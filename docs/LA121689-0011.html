			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANS CAN'T TAKE MUCH MAS OF THIS  </P> <P> Why does Jim Murray even bother writing boxing articles? They are so Sugar Ray  Leonard biased, it's nauseating.  </P> <P> He recently had the audacity to claim that Leonard has ruled boxing much in the  same way that Sugar Ray Robinson did decades ago.  </P> <P> Robinson never avoided fighters in their prime (as Leonard did with Marvin  Hagler). If a fighter ever gave Robinson anything even resembling a good fight,  he gave them an instant rematch. He didn't wait for the pug to turn into a  battle-scarred cadaver (as Leonard did with Hearns, and then almost lost  anyway).  </P> <P> Leonard is a feather-fisted slapper. He couldn't mark up the cut-prone Hagler,  he couldn't floor the battle-worn Hearns with his best punches, and couldn't  knock out Roberto Duran, an old, puffed-up lightweight.  </P> <P> DOUG CAVANAUGH, Canoga Park  </P></p>

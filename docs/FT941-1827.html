			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A squeeze in stock index futures at the close of trading enlivened what had been an erratic session in derivatives. The late rally in futures fuelled strong buying of the underling FT-SE 100 Index ahead of the close of the stock market, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,211, which was about 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 10 points, with the strong finish attributed to a late advance in UK gilts. Volume at the official close was 10,275 lots. Bonds had also been firmer earlier in the day when June opened at 3,208, and good buying drove the contract to the day's peak of 3,229. However, a bout of nervous trading ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting saw June surrender early gains and it fell to a low of 3,183 in the early afternoon. In Liffe FT-SE Mid-250, June traded 97 contracts and it closed at 3,850. The screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX. In Liffe traded options, turnover improved to 43,697 contracts ahead of today's expiry of the March stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,973 lots and 2,594 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid speculation made Argyll Group the busiest stock option with a total of 4,530 lots.</p>

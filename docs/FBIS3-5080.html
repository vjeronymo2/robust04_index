			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Takao Nakura, Industry News Department reporter: </F> "Communications Gear -- Japan, U.S. Confrontation Over Mobile  Phones Is Emerging as a Major Item Subject to U.S. Sanctions on  Japan"; fourth in a series entitled "The Review of Four Areas of  Japan-U.S. Friction"]    [Text] In response to a news report on 16 February that  the U.S. trade representative has begun taking moves to impose  sanctions on Japan because of friction over the issue of raising  U.S. access to the Japanese mobile phone market, a senior  official in a major telecommunications equipment maker angrily  said, "I have no choice but to say that it is utterly  unreasonable."  <H5>  Distrust in Motorola </H5>   The mobile phone issue was not on the agenda of the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which ended in breakdown.  The U.S. trade representative has asserted that the "mobile  phone issue had nothing to do with the breakdown of the latest  Japan-U.S. summit talks," but the mobile phone issue has emerged  as a "major item" subject to U.S. sanctions on Japan. The Japan  Mobile Communications Company [JMCC] is being criticized as  responsible for Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue.  JMCC President Kenyu Tsukada, however, says, "The demand by the  U.S. trade representative and Motorola is impossible for us to  meet." In this way, the JMCC maintains its confrontational  posture. The JMCC has already made a compromise proposal to  Motorola that it would spend 30 billion yen over the next two or  three years to expand the Motorola mobile phone service in  Japan. The JMCC says, "We can no longer make concessions for  Motorola," and nongovernmental negotiations remain deadlocked.  On 16 February, the Telecommunications Equipment Industry  Association (headed by Yoshi Sekizawa) issued an unusual  statement saying, "If the United States imposes sanctions  against Japan, Japan needs to argue with the United States in  multilateral trade organizations like the GATT." The  telecommunications equipment industry is increasingly expressing  its distrust in Motorola, saying, "Motorola's demand for setting  numerical targets for Japan's purchase of U.S.-made mobile  phones is clearly a steamroller, and the U.S. company has made  the demand with the idea of sanctions on Japan from the  beginning."    In mid-February, when the United States strongly hinted at  taking moves to enforce sanctions on Japan, JMCC President  Sekizawa told Toyota Motor Corporation, a major shareholder of  the JMCC, that "sparks of fire may fall upon us." Electric  tools surfaced as items targeted by U.S. sanctions on Japan in  connection with friction over the semiconductor issue. Japan is  in the grip of U.S. suspicion.    Regarding sanctions on Japan under consideration by the  United States, Ryoichi Sugioka, managing director of Fujitsu  Ltd, ostensibly projects a calm attitude, saying, "I cannot  comment on them before the specific contents of the sanctions  come to light." Since the latest Japan-U.S. friction has arisen  over the mobile phone issue, there is growing apprehension that  "automobiles and mobile phones are most likely to be targeted by  U.S. sanctions on Japan."  <H5>  Overwhelming Export Surplus </H5>   Japanese makers of mobile phones produce about 4.2 million  sets every year, and of these, about 1.9 million sets are sold  in the U.S. market. An official familiar with the  telecommunications equipment industry says, "Japanese mobile  phone makers produce 70 percent of the mobile phones sold on the  U.S. market in the United States, and any increase in U.S.  duties on them will have little impact."    In 1992, Japan exported $2.407 billion in telecommunications  equipment to the United States and imported $556 million, an  overwhelming net export surplus in favor of Japan. Speculation  is rampant that if the United States imposes sanctions on Japan,  the sanctions would target "telecommunications equipment  generally," not only mobile phones, and overseas procurement by  the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) would be  embroiled in the sanctions."    A top executive of Oki Electric Industry Ltd has said, "The  exports of facsimile machines would be hit the hardest by U.S.  sanctions." Japan's exports of facsimile machines to the United  States account for about 60 percent of its total exports of  communications-terminal products to that country. If U.S.  sanctions target facsimile machines, it would become a matter of  life or death for Japanese producers of the machines.  <H5>  Japan, U.S. Feud Over NTT Procurement </H5>   The NTT, too, is worried about being targeted by U.S.  sanctions. The United States has demanded that the NTT's  procurement be incorporated into the framework of the government  procurement. In response, Japan has rebutted the U.S. demand,  saying, "The NTT has already been privatized so it is impossible  to meet the U.S. demand." As a result, negotiations between the  two countries have yielded no agreement.    The International Procurement Office of the NTT says: "We  have procured many goods through joint-development arrangement.  Our procurement formula is different from conventional  procurement. If our procurement is incorporated into the  framework of government procurement, this would not be an  advantage for the United States." In this way, the NTT appears  to have no room to accept the U.S. demand.    The trade structure between the two countries of network  products such as switchboards is totally opposite the trade  structure of such communications terminals as facsimile machines  and telephones. Japan exports $199 million worth of network  products to the United States while importing $257 million worth  of network products from that country. The United States has a  net surplus in the trade of these items.    Most of Japan's imports of network products are due to the  NTT's procurement activities abroad. The International  Procurement Office of the NTT says: "The NTT has increased its  amount of overseas procurement to $784 million (including the  amount for the procurement of computers), an increase of 23  percent over the amount of such procurement in 1992. We have  procured 95 percent of our goods from U.S. producers. There is  no reason for the United States to criticize the NTT for being  responsible for the current trade imbalance between the two  countries."    Behind the Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue  is  Motorola, a company which has scored great achievements by  taking a tough stand on Japan whenever trade friction has  occurred between the two countries. It is unpredictable how the  Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue will develop in  the future. The Japanese telecommunication industry is likely to  be pushed around by the friction for the time being.</p>

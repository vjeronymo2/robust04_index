			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, the IDRC will consider the benefits of appointing a departmental ombudsman and the benefits of appointing an ombudsman for selected departmental bureaus. An ombudsman could serve the following functions: (1) To address specific categories of workplace disputes through the investigation of the circumstances giving rise to the disputes and based on their findings to recommend corrective actions, if appropriate; or (2) to investigate and propose the resolution, if appropriate, of citizen complaints against the Department, including recommendations for changes in agency structure or organization to better address or avoid persistent problems. The IDRC will submit a written report at the end of the Interim period on the use of an ombudsman. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Training in ADR <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department recognizes, consistent with the philosophy of the National Performance Review, that bureaus can best evaluate and develop specific ADR programs and initiatives to meet bureau needs. Therefore, each Bureau Head shall appoint a Bureau Dispute Resolution Specialist (BDRS). The BDRS shall receive training recommended by the DRS in ADR consensus-building techniques, conflict resolution, and program design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DRS shall recommend appropriate BDRS training, such training to be completed no later than 60 days following issuance of the interim policy. Additionally, the DRS shall provide ADR training opportunities for selected groups of senior managers of the Department, whose job responsibilities include determining or influencing how disputes will be managed. The DRS will also identify opportunities for advanced training in facilitation and mediation for judges and attorneys within OHA, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Development of Bureau Alternative Dispute Resolution Plans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BDRS shall develop and submit the Bureau's Alternate Dispute Resolution Plan (ADRP) through the Bureau Head to the appropriate Assistant Secretary no later than 60 days following the completion of training. The ADRP shall include at least one category of disputes amenable to ADR methods, and a discussion of how the bureau will implement ADR to address such disputes. Additionally, to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the bureau's initiative(s), the ADRP should address, among other topics, the (1) Goals; (2) objectives; (3) timetable; (4) implementation strategy; (5) monitoring criteria; and (6) evaluation methodology. It is permissible if two or more bureaus adopt the same plan or parts of a plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In selecting appropriate ADR pilot initiatives, a bureau can focus, for example, on a particular category of dispute (e.g., contract cases), on a variety of disputes involving a particular organizational segment or region of the agency, or on a particular ADR process that would be applied in a variety of disputes across the bureau. In selecting a focus for an ADR pilot initiative, the Department encourages bureaus to consider using some of the disputes that are central to the Department's mission. While a bureau should not avoid identifying personnel and small contract disputes, for example, as candidates for a pilot initiative, a bureau should not focus exclusively on these areas so that the effectiveness of ADR for a bureau can be judged in a programmatic context. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some offices of the Department, such as the Office of the Solicitor, assist bureaus in carrying out their programs rather than conducting programs of their own. For the purposes of this policy, such offices should assist their client bureaus in implementing ADR in a programmatic context. Nonetheless, such offices should develop an ADRP for internal, human resource management purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the many activities and functions of the Department and the Federal Acquisition Regulations' (FAR) recognition of the usefulness of ADR in government contracts, each BDRS, or appointed designees, should review categories of all proposed new and renewal contracts, agreements, permits, memoranda of understanding, and other documents, to determine whether to include ADR provisions. Moreover, the Department encourages the use of ADR in contract disputes prior to these disputes reaching the Interior Board of Contract Appeals. To avoid duplication of effort by bureau personnel, the Office of the Solicitor, working with the Department's Senior Procurement official, will develop standardized ADR-related clauses that bureaus can use in contracts and other documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department expects, as well, that those bureaus with comparatively more dispute resolution experience will, on a voluntary basis, assist bureaus less familiar with dispute resolution in the development of the ADRP. The Department expects, as well, that inter-bureau initiatives such as ``one stop permitting,'' for example, be coordinated with the BDRSs. Each BDRS and others involved with the implementation of the interim policy are encouraged to consult with other federal agencies, and others in the dispute resolution field in the development of their ADR initiatives. The DRS is available to provide the names of contact persons within various federal agencies who have effectively utilized ADR methods in resolving disputes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Judges within all boards and divisions of OHA will be encouraged to utilize, where appropriate, ADR methods, including, among others, the use of settlement judges, minitrials, and the referral of litigants to mediation or arbitration in advance of a judge's consideration of a case on the merits. OHA will develop an internal policy for the appointment of settlement judges and will refer litigants to a list of approved mediators and arbitrators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

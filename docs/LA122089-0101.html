			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR ANGRILY DISPUTES REPORT OF OFFERING SPECIAL TREATMENT  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, angrily disputing a Times report that he offered  preferential treatment to a personal friend and her business clients, declared  Tuesday that the access given to Mary Anne Singer was no more sweeping than  that accorded to hundreds of lobbyists and public relations executives.  </P> <P> "I can tell you that there are hundreds of PR firms and representatives who  have access and who are campaign contributors who are able to reach me," the  mayor said at a City Hall press conference.  </P> <P> "There are political lobbyists who are able to reach me. They do so because  there has been a pattern that has been the principle of my office. I serve the  public."  </P> <P> The article in Tuesday's Times detailed how Singer, a 47-year-old contact lens  technician, has used her connections to Bradley to build a small public  relations business. At the same time, she was raising tens of thousands of  dollars for Bradley's election drives.  </P> <P> Bradley, at 71 recently elected to a record fifth term, has been engulfed in  controversy since spring because of his financial dealings. A federal grand  jury recently convened to investigate possible violations of securities and  public corruption laws by the mayor.  </P> <P> According to Times sources in Tuesday's article, Singer had virtually  unrestrained access to the mayor. "Nobody had access like Mary Anne," one  former Bradley aide said. "Whatever she wanted, she got and she let people know  it. If you said 'No' -- for whatever the request was -- Bradley would call. So  you would just learn."  </P> <P> Bradley, who had refused several requests for an interview before the article  was published, similarly declined to discuss Tuesday any specifics about his  relationship with Singer. Singer, too, has declined to discuss the matter.  </P> <P> But in questions posed after a news conference on homeless programs, Bradley  angrily answered, "No, no, no, no," when asked if Singer had special access.  </P> <P> He also criticized The Times for publishing the article, calling it a  "non-story."  </P> <P> The mayor repeatedly sought to frame his connection to Singer as part of a vast  network of associates he maintains, and not as a special and isolated case.  </P> <P> "Whether it is somebody that I've known for 20 years or someone that I know  only by virtue of a phone call, I try to respond to their needs," Bradley said,  "and I believe that is the function of an elected official."  </P> <P> "I try to provide the kind of case-by-case evaluation so that whatever my  response is in connection with that inquiry, that is not something that is  improper or illegal."  </P> <P> "I immediately go to work to try to get somebody to take some sort of action,"  the mayor said. "I think the process in far too many cases is much too  cumbersome."  </P></p>

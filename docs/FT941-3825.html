			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Spanish economy brighter There are signs that Spain is emerging from recession but its welfare system must adapt to survive, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, said. A slowdown in the growth of registered unemployment last month showed that the economy was picking up, he told the Efe news agency. The improvement would be seen mainly in exports, tourism and construction, he said. Mr Alfredo Pastor, the economy minister, reaffirmed expectations of export-led growth of 1.3 per cent this year against negative growth of 1 per cent in 1993. He hinted there might be room for further interest rate cuts following a half-point cut in the official benchmark rate to 8 per cent earlier this month. Spain's broad M4 money supply fell 6.3 per cent in February.</p>

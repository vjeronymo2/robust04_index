			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rajendra Dwivedi: "The Process of Polarization </F> in the State Is Accelerating"]    [Text] The political turmoil in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] for  the last month indicates that political polarization is  accelerating there. Usually, political polarization in a  democratic country is considered a good sign. However, a large  number of political parties does not prove to be good for  democracy.    At present, there are two basic doctrines active in the  state. One of these belongs to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]  and the second is espoused by the parties that accuse the BJP of  creating religious factionalism in the nation. The  representative or the leader of the second doctrine is the  present Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. The people  subscribing to this school of thought do not want the BJP to  emerge [from defeat] at any cost. That is why some of the  parties that are not happy with Mulayam Singh are forced to  support Mulayam Singh's government.    The week of 11 April appeared to be the week of competition  for joining the Samajwadi Party (SP). Everyday, there were two  announcements telling people who was joining the SP. Kunwar  Rewati Raman Singh, former state leader and V.P. Singh's right  hand, resigned from the Janata Dal and decided to join the SP.  For the announcement, he called an "equality conference" on 11  April.    Chief Minister Mulayam Singh welcomed them to his party and  even called this "returning home." He said that the leaders who  had decided to join the SP and fight for the principles it  stands for will always be known as holy men. The BJP was accused  of spreading religious factionalism and was greatly criticized  in this conference. Chief Minister Yadav called the BJP militant  for the first time. He said that there was no difference between  the Kashmiri militant groups and the BJP that helped tear down  the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.    Kunwar Rewati Raman's "equality conference" was to begin on  Monday, 11th April. Without any prior notice, the chief minister  called a press conference at 1000. In this press conference,  Ramawadhesh Singh, national president of the Lok Dal, announced  his decision to join the SP. Mr. Ramawadesh Singh announced that  he will formally merge the Lok Dal into the SP on 6 May in Patna.    Yadunath Singh, former state president of the Janata Dal  (Ajit), also announced his decision to join the SP. Mr. Yadunath  is very influential in the Mirzapur area. The next day, another  meeting was arranged in Ravinderalya. The meeting was organized  by Mittersen Yadav and Ram Chander Baksh Singh who were leaving  the Communist Party of India to join the SP. One special aspect  of this meeting was that they both had the blessings of veteran  leader Dr. Z.A. Ahmed. The CPI [Communist Party of India]  leaders who were joining the SP claimed that this meeting was  the state level meeting of their party. They also claimed that  the people who were present in that meeting represented 80  percent of the CPI membership.    There are three CPI members in the Vidhan Sabha. If  one-third  of the total members desert, it is not called desertion, but  division of the party. Mittersen Yadav took full advantage of  this rule as he was one-third of the total! Mr. Uddal, the  leader of the party in the Vidhan Sabha, strongly condemned this  desertion, however, at the same time, he also said that he and  his party will continue to support Mulayam Singh.    The same situation is of the Janata Dal. Ten legislators of  the total 27 have left it to join the SP. According to political  sources, six more legislators are ready to leave. The leaders of  this party are very upset at this party hopping. However, they  are helpless because of the political atmosphere of the state,  will have to support Mulayam Singh's government.    The Congress (I) is even in worse condition than this. Its  leaders strongly support the idea of backing Mulayam Singh. At  the same time, they want to maintain their party's image as an  opposition party in the Vidhan Sabha and in the Vidhan Parishad.  Perhaps, that is why they showed so much anger as if he [Mulayam  Singh] was going to uproot the government in the context of  discussions on Mahatma Gandhi and Govind Ballabh Pant. They  showed the same level of anger over the firing incident in  Meerut and even threatened to resign from all the legislative  committees. However, what happened today is what was going to  happen. The government still has the Congress (I) support. The  truth is that the Congress (I) not only supports the government  in the Vidhan Sabha, but also acts as the "shock absorber" for  it. No one attacks the BJP as fiercely as does Congress Party  leader Pramod Tiwari.    Thus, the BJP is alone both within and outside of the  legislative assembly, and the other parties are on the other  side. This is the first step in the polarization process. We are  waiting for the next step.    Now the question is: Why this sudden acceleration in this  political polarization? If this had happened before the vidhan  sabha elections, the political scene in the state would have  been different. The political leaders who now consider  themselves invincible and very powerful, would not have achieved  this status. There is a lot of talk in political circles that  Chief Minister Mulayam Singh wants to make himself strong by any  means so that he does not have to depend on any other party, and  he will Mulayam [mellow] in name only! He will become a powerful  Singh [lion] when it comes to obeying his orders and following  his principles.</p>

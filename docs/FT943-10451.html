			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bulgaria plans to sell off tour operator The Bulgarian government is to sell off Balkantourist, the largest state-owned tour operator, with a stake of at least 51 per cent being offered to a single investor. The remainder will be split between employees and domestic investors, with employees offered 20 per cent. 'We will secure equal terms for foreign and local investors to participate in the privatisation of the company,' said Mr Bonka Hinkova, first vice-president of the Committee of Tourism in Sofia. Tui of Germany, Inghams of the UK - a member of the Hotelplan multinational concern - and the Louis Organisation, a Cyprus-based holding comprising hotels, tour operators, cruise lines and airport shops, are interested in acquiring a majority stake in the company. Local investors are also lining up to buy a stake. Private airlines and several of Bulgaria's most powerful private financial groups, including Multigroup, Tourist-Sport Holding, Tron and Bulvar Holidays, are reported to be discussing the opportunity. Balkantourist, the former tourism monopoly, was founded 47 years ago. Until 1990 the company administered all tourist facilities in the country.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Leading Article: A pale green blockbuster The environment, more even than other areas such as economics or defence, requires a touch of the visionary to go with a robust framework for those who have to make regulatory, policy or business decisions. Yesterday's policy blockbuster from Mr John Major and his environment secretary, Mr John Gummer, Taking Rio forward tries to fill this bill, and in some respects succeeds. It identifies the goals to which Britain committed itself at the 1992 Earth Summit and maps out routes towards them: a better use of resources, more care for environmental assets such as clean air and water, and respect for biological diversity. It also stresses the need for a balanced approach which weighs the benefits as well as the costs, something that many people prefer to ignore until their clamour for a cleaner environment translates into higher taxes or a wind farm in their back garden. In other words, environment is not merely a question of government providing the right policy, but people adapting their lifestyles and the way they think. But having said all that, it is hard to see Taking Rio forward having more than a marginal effect on either the way British people conduct their lives, or the way government behaves. The document is notably devoid of new or inspiring initiatives, and it lacks the force needed to convince the reader that it will resolve the increasingly difficult contradictions between the government's environmental aims and its policies in other areas. Pragmatic approach To some extent this is due to a desire to retain a pragmatic approach and avoid the damage that an overzealous environmental policy can do to other aspects of the national interest, such as industrial competitiveness. There is no point, for example, in forcing all the country's coal-fired power stations to install expensive clean-up equipment - as Germany has done - when many of them will shut down or be replaced by natural gas within the present policy time frame. Britain can live with this contradiction because it is temporary - though the foreseen solution owes much to the accident of Britain's natural energy endowments. But the document is weak in key areas, notably transport, which it acknowledges is likely to produce some of the most severe environmental pressures in the years ahead. To hear Mr Major speak yesterday, the only solution the government has to offer is a commitment to increase petrol tax and to study road pricing. Such proposals look suspiciously like making a virtue of budgetary necessity rather than taking a thorough view of the problem. Clear policy Here is an area where market forces alone will not provide solutions, yet where a clear policy framework could produce ideas to deal with both the public's increasing exasperation with traffic congestion, and its professed concern for the environment. Fiscal measures, regulation and investment, especially in public transport, need to be blended in the right proportions to achieve the desired result. It is also premature of the government to claim sustainable policies for areas like energy and forestry when crucial issues such as the future of nuclear power and the privatisation of the Forestry Commission remain unresolved. However, the prime minister's comment yesterday that the forthcoming review of nuclear power should take a broad view of the issue was welcome. Until now, ministers have spoken of the need for a narrow, commercially focused review which would have ignored the environmental benefits that nuclear has to offer as a non-gas-emitting power source. As for the way forward, the government has appointed an advisory committee to help its deliberations. Though eminent and highly qualified, its members all belong to what might be called the green great and good: some are already advising on other environmental bodies, and it must be wondered how much freshness they will bring to the subject. Mr Major is right to continue to give high personal priority to the environmental agenda, on which Britain has a less than first-rate reputation. The search for clarity and consistency, however, is not yet at an end.</p>

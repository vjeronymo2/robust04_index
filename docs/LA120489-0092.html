			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY TREAT: HELPING OTHERS;  </P> <P> FRAUDULENT CHARITIES PREY ON CONSUMERS  </P> <P> If a telephone caller wants a charitable contribution on behalf of the Marine  Corps or the Salvation Army, the consumer should beware. Neither solicits by  telephone, and Christmastime seems to bring about an increase in fraudulent  charity schemes.  </P> <P> Officials at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station say they have received  several calls recently from people who were asked to donate to the blind  through the Marine Reserves. The Marine Reserves collect toys but not cash  donations.  </P> <P> "People take advantage of the naivete of the public and . . . our good name,"  said Maj. James McClain.  </P> <P> The Salvation Army also has trouble at Christmas. People steal their bells or  collection kettles and collect for themselves.  </P> <P> Maureen Williams, spokeswoman for Childrens Hospital of Orange County, suggests  that anyone asked to make a charitable donation check out the charity before  sending money.  </P></p>

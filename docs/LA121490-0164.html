			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BILLIONAIRE EUROPEAN PRINCE DIES  </P> <P> Prince Johannes von Thurn and Taxis, considered one of Europe's richest men  with a global empire worth more than $1 billion, died today after his second  heart transplant in seven weeks.  </P> <P> The prince, 64, whose ancestors created the postal service in central Europe  500 years ago, ruled over a global empire of companies, properties and real  estate worth an estimated $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife Gloria, 30, and three children.  </P> <P> He had suffered from heart disease for several years and received a first heart  transplant Oct. 26. Several days ago, his body rejected the donated heart and  another transplant was needed. Surgeons operated again Wednesday, but his body  was too weak to recover from the second transplant, physicians said.  </P></p>

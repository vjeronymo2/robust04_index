			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM GENUINE EMOTION TO SHOW BIZ;  </P> <P> CONCERT: ONCE AGAIN BILLY JOEL, THE CONSUMMATE ENTERTAINER, GIVES HIS FANS A  GOOD SHOW, BUT HE FAILS TO CHALLENGE THEM.  </P> <P> Billy Joel did a shtick early in his show Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports  Arena -- the first of five sold-out dates there -- in which he pushed his piano  stool back with his foot as he played a little rock-a-boogie introduction to  "Angry Young Man."  </P> <P> Eventually the stool was just . . . far . . . enough . . . away that he  couldn't quite reach it to pull it back. With a little stagy flair he stretched  with his left hand to try to grab the stool, all the while not missing a note  with his right hand.  </P> <P> Of course, there was no real point to this exercise, but it was a nice little  bit of show.  </P> <P> It's also a pretty good analogy to the nature of Billy Joel the artist. Often  he has tried to give the impression that he's stretching, reaching, finding new  vistas. Some examples -- highlights of a nearly 20-year recording career --  were presented throughout the two-hour-plus concert Saturday, notably the  social observation of "Only the Good Die Young," "Allentown," "Out of Saigon"  and the new, glasnost-inspired "Leningrad."  </P> <P> In the end, though, it's just show. It doesn't add up to much, any more than  the post-World War II names and places listed in the recent smasheroo "We  Didn't Start the Fire" add up to anything besides a list.  </P> <P> Ask yourself: Has ever there been a figure in popular music as successful for  as long as Joel who has left so little impact on the music world? Can you name  one significant artist whom Joel has influenced? Can you identify any special  nature to Joel's artistic vision?  </P> <P> But to some extent it's a moot point. "We Didn't Start the Fire" was a smash  hit, and it brought the crowd (predominant age group: mid-to-late 30s; average  status, from appearances: comfortable) to its feet. And there's the rub.  </P> <P> It may have been just a show, but it was a really good show. Joel is a  consummate entertainer, a naturally feisty presence and a born ham. And, most  important, he knows his fans and plays to them with the best. He just never  tests them or challenges them. Or stretches them.  </P> <P> He just delivers, on an uncluttered, unobstructed stage, with nifty lighting  and an accomplished (though musically anonymous, save for ace drummer Liberty  DeVitto) seven-piece band. He plays most of his many hits, he mugs and clowns,  he makes engaging hey-I'm-just-a-working-Joe patter. It's very easy to sit back  and just enjoy.  </P> <P> Too easy, and that's the problem, just like the facetious, let-'em-eat-cake  joke that he closed the evening with:  </P> <P> "If you abso-tively, posi-tootly have to go home," he told the crowd after  cautioning against drinking and driving, "do what I do. . . . Go in a big  limousine."  </P> <P> Way too easy.  </P></p>

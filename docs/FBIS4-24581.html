			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Entrepreneurs from China  and Russia as well as some officials from relevant Chinese  Government departments -- about 80 people in all -- gathered  here this afternoon to talk about Sino-Russian cooperation.    Visiting Russian Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin spoke at  the gathering.    He said that Russia and China are experiencing profound  social changes and the two countries have taken different ways  and measures in their own reforms due to their respective  national and historic characteristics. He added that the two  countries should learn from each other.    The tasks facing both Russia and China were similar in many  aspects, he said, which holds possibilities for bilateral  cooperation of mutual benefit. The Russian premier said that  the complementary nature of the two countries, their resources  and economies provides both with certain potential for effective  bilateral cooperation.    He noted that bilateral relations have entered a new stage,  which brings about a broad prospect for a constructive  partnership in the next century.    Such relations, he said, well meet the basic national  interest of the two countries and constitute an important  element in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region as well as rest of the world.    Touching upon bilateral economic cooperation, he said that  this was a complicated thing: on the one hand, the cooperation  is vigorous; while on the other hand, there is great potential  for its expansion.    He said that bilateral cooperative relations have to be  shifted to a higher level in line with international standards,  involving cooperation in production, investment and joint  ventures.    He said that the good-neighborly cooperation between the two  peoples will continue to be accelerated, for the sake of the two  great nations, and peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.    Xu Dayou, vice-president of the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade, also spoke briefly at the  gathering.</p>

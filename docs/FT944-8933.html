			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: AssiDoman lifts profits forecast AssiDoman, the Swedish pulp and paper group, has raised its forecast for full-year profits for the second time this year, citing larger-than-expected price rises for many of its products. The company, which ranks as one of Europe's top 10 forestry groups, says it expects 1994 profits to be between SKr1.8bn and SKr1.9bn (Dollars 248m-Dollars 262m), more than double last year's SKr876m level. The latest upgrade came after profits at the nine-month stage reached SKr1.28bn, up 126 per cent from SKr568m a year ago. Average selling prices for sawn timber, sawn timber products, kraftliner and pulp were all higher than during the same 1993 period. The increases reflect the recovery in the pulp and paper sector where demand is recovering sharply after a deep recession between 1991 and 1993. The increase in demand for timber and pulpwood has had a beneficial impact on AssiDoman, which is the biggest private forestry owner in the northern hemisphere. Its forestry and timber division lifted operating profits 67 per cent to SKr939m as sales climbed 26 per cent to SKr3.7bn. There was a strong performance from the Kraft products division, which swung to a SKr131m operating profit from a SKr70m loss. The packaging and carton divisions fared worse than last year. Overall operating profits were 81 per cent higher at SKr1.44bn on a 13 per cent rise in sales to SKr12.3bn. The bottom line figure was influenced by lower financial charges to SKr159m from SKr232m.</p>

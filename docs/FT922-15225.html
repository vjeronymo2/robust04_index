			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: DKB in debt-for-nature swap DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank (DKB), the leading Japanese commercial bank, is to donate Dollars 1m of its loan portfolio to the Republic of Ecuador in a 'debt-for-nature' swap to assist a conservation project in the Galapagos Islands, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The debt donation will be channelled through the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Japan, and is the first to be organised within Japan. Japanese banks have been reluctant to become active in such projects, due to the negative image of lending to developing countries. A Japanese bank official said they were afraid that shareholders would find such write-offs hard to accept. DKB will donate the right of claim for the loan to WWF Japan, and will write off Dollars 1m next fiscal year to March 1993. The WWF will then release the obligation of repayment to Ecuador.</p>

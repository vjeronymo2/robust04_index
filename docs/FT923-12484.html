			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: Philips's shares fall sharply PHILIPS yesterday saw its share price fall sharply for the second time in two months, as concern spread among investors that two of the Dutch electronics group's business products might be facing difficulties. The shares lost 11 per cent to Fl 25.60 on news of the departure of Mr Gaston Bastiaens, director of the consumer electronics division to join Apple Computer of the US and the move of Mr Peter Groenenboom, who had been an influential figure in Philips's high definition TV programme, to an advisory position within the group. Mr Bastiaens has led the business in compact disk interactive (CD-I), a new medium which combines video, text, data and sound and which Philips hopes will be its next consumer electronics hit product. Mr Groenenboom's move to a job not directly related to the TV business follows a decision by Philips to split its TV division into conventional TV products and advanced TV products, such as HDTV and digital television. The market interpreted the changes as a sign that all was not well with Philips's business in CD-I and HDTV. Investors reacted nervously to the departure this month of Mr Jacques Caumartin from Thomson CSF, the French industrial group, and his comment that the European HDTV programme, based on satellite transmission, was flawed since most European TV viewers receive terrestrial broadcasts. Mr Caumartin was formerly general manager of business development at Thomson SA and senior vice-president of the professional broadcasting systems division. As such he was involved in the HDTV programme, but Thomson Consumer Electronics said: 'Mr Caumartin does not speak for Thomson Consumer Electronics, especially after he has left the group. As far as Europe is concerned we have developed the entire chain for HDTV.' The combination of events triggered nervousness because success or failure in these products could mean for Philips the difference between recovering its stature as a leader in the industry and falling further into the doldrums. Philips said its strategies would not be affected by these announcements.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIANIST HEARS THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN SILENT FILMS;  </P> <P> PERFORMER: ROBERT ISRAEL, 27, IS AN ANOMALY. HE PROVIDES ACCOMPANIMENT FOR '20S  FILMS AND WILL ALSO BE HEARD IN A "21 JUMP STREET" EPISODE.  </P> <P> After Robert Israel played the organ for five silent movie comedies at a UCLA  film class this spring, a sophomore confided her initial surprise to him. "I  was expecting an old man to be sitting there," she said. "I was shocked to see  how young you are."  </P> <P> In a business that peaked in the 1920s and fell apart when sound pictures  became dominant during the Depression, the 27-year-old Israel is an anomaly. He  is one of a handful of people in his generation, one bred almost exclusively on  recorded sound, to play live scores for silent movies.  </P> <P> And, ironically, recorded sound will soon bring Israel's silent-movie talents  to a national audience. Israel will accompany a seven-minute silent film in  Monday's hourlong episode of "21 Jump Street." In the show, an undercover unit  thwarts an assassination attempt on a senator, and Officer Tom Hanson uses a  silent movie to describe the slapstick rescue.  </P> <P> Israel developed the "Jump Street" score as he would any other, by watching the  clip once or twice and creating the accompaniment in his head. This music will  be heard by an audience thousands of times larger than his usual audience. More  than 8.5 million people are expected to be watching Monday's show, according to  a Fox spokesman.  </P> <P> Israel's interest in silent pictures began 20 years ago when his father took  him to The Silent Movie Theatre on Fairfax Avenue and other film venues. "I was  fascinated by silent movies," he said. "The quality of life, the way they  dressed, the landscaping. There was a simplicity in living back then that was  reflected in ideals and behaviors of the films. It's an era gone by."  </P> <P> He started collecting films at 13 and began to notice that music was important  to the picture. He first played the piano at 16, and by 17 he accompanied his  first silent picture, today's stage rage, "The Phantom of the Opera," at a  Caltech film festival.  </P> <P> In 1988, the Los Angeles native completed his music studies at Cal State  Northridge. Although the school doesn't offer film accompaniment courses,  Israel said what he learned there has helped his playing.  </P> <P> "It's a very intensive study in music, which helps you interpret the language  of music and understand music," he said. "So the film accompaniment was better  than I was previously able to do. The best film accompanists studied music. The  ones in the '20s were classical pianists, not hack pianists."  </P> <P> William Toutant, associate dean of the CSUN School of the Arts, is a fan of  Israel's accompaniments. "He points out certain dramatic and comedic points in  the film with his harmonic imagination. What he does with the music really  enhances the film, without drawing attention to the music."  </P> <P> That, Israel said, is the accompanist's goal. "The music shouldn't set the  mood," he said. "The film provides the mood, and the music realizes the mood  the film is intending."  </P> <P> Israel alluded to Bernard Herrmann's recorded score for Alfred Hitchcock's 1958  movie "Vertigo" to support his point. "It's one of the most perfect film  scores. The compositions seem to supplement the film without getting in the  way. But if you take away the music, you've taken away a lot of the film."  </P> <P> The pianist said live scores have a special touch that recorded scores lack.  "The audience knows that there is something being created on the spot. It's a  psychological effect. Musicians provide a link between the audience and what's  on the screen."  </P> <P> Israel's accompaniment schedule is unpredictable. He'll play for six films some  weeks and other times accompany only two films a month at the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art, UCLA's Melnitz Theatre and the Cultural Hall in North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> He creates about four of every five scores himself, rather than playing the  music that was developed for the film. Sometimes he must develop a score  without previewing the movie. "Instinct, experience and repertoire help a lot,"  he said. "If it's a Russian picture, you think of Russian composers."  </P> <P> But in an anachronistic business that last thrived when Calvin Coolidge was  president, accompanying a movie cold is the least of Israel's problems.  </P> <P> Octogenarian Gaylord Carter, who has played for silent movies since their  heyday, said that it's tough to be a young silent-movie accompanist today.  "When I started, every theater hired an organist. They had to have them.  There's not a future out there for the average performer today. You have to be  a star performer to make it a viable profession."  </P> <P> Despite his keyboard excellence, Israel faces another barrier: reverse ageism.  "They imply that they think I'm just not experienced enough," he said about  some who consider hiring him. "I'll ask, 'Why?' and they'll say that I'm too  young."  </P> <P> Israel said the limited competition that exists in the accompaniment world  seems fierce. "It's a combination of elements. Some people have egos to  satisfy, some are trying to just grab the limelight and not to compose a  serious score, and others are scrambling to get work."  </P> <P> On top of all that, the audience may not like his interpretation of a film. He  has received hate mail for his film scores, such as "Nosferatu," the 1922  German film, for which Israel played Brahms, Beethoven, Wagner and others.  </P> <P> "I got a letter that said I 'should not play church chords' and that the music  sounded like 'waltzes and polkas all night long,' " Israel said. "If you can  find in any music book what 'church chords' are, please let me know. I don't  know where his ears were placed during the evening."  </P> <P> So why does the young pianist persist? "My love of silent movies and my love of  music," he said.  </P> <P> Israel alternates between using the piano and the organ for his accompaniments.  "They're entirely different," he said of the two instruments.  </P> <P> "In terms of sheer power and volume, the organ has it over the piano. But the  piano can be very effective." The choice of instrument has a bearing on the way  he arranges a score, he added.  </P> <P> When he's not accompanying silent films, Israel sells pianos and organs for  Church Organs Inc. in Pasadena and plays classical piano. "Classical music is  the biggest passion I have, and it's not one that opens up a lot of jobs," he  said.  </P> <P> One drawback of the "Jump Street" score, Israel noted, is that it may typecast  him. But silent-film organist Stan Kann, who played the organ occasionally on  "The Merv Griffin Show" and "The Mike Douglas Show," doesn't think Israel will  have a problem getting classical piano recitals.  </P> <P> "He's a marvelous pianist with a fabulous memory. He can play a two-hour  program completely without music," Kann said. "If I could play piano as well as  he does, I wouldn't play the organ."  </P></p>

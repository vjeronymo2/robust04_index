He said the arrest of the spy must not hamper the  partnership  between Moscow and London. "Contrary to Americans, who are  fretting due to the Ames case we do not make a tragedy of what  has happened. The British special service is collecting material  on Russia, it is natural. It is not natural to take the stand  of "offended innocence" as the U.S. did in the Ames case," the  diplomat stressed.    He emphasized that intelligence and counterintelligence were  inalienable parts of any state. They have existed and will  exist as long as the state itself exists. At the same time,  there must be civilized ways to react to the arrest of a spy  working for the other state. This reaction, in fact, tests the  true character of the bilateral relations, the diplomat said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This weekend, generator unit no. 3 of the Carlos  Manuel de Cespedes Electric Plant will go on a 35-day  maintenance program in order to reestablish its full capability  of 158 megawatts per hour. Electric maintenance and Construction  Ministry workers have the necessary resources to conduct the  maintenance with the required quality and complete it ahead of  schedule. The plant workers are also working to reactivate the  30 megawatts per hour generator unit no. 1, which has been  inoperative for three years. Their goal is to make it  operational as soon as possible.    On 27 June, workers will also begin an 80-day repair program  on the five megawatts per hour unit at the Dionisio San Roman  plant, Cienfuegos, which has also been out of service.</p>

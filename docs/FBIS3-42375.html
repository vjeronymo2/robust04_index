The government in Khartoum, under fire for giving shelter to  radical Palestinian and Lebanese groups such as Hizballah,  Hamas, and the Islamic Jihad movement, is anxious to take steps  to end its economic and political isolation.    Now THE EUROPEAN has learned that senior Sudanese officials  have recently visited France, establishing links with the French  secret service. They have also offered to intercede in Algeria  as its new strongman, President Lamine Zeroual, tries to open a  dialogue with Islamic fundamentalist leaders.    The developments came in a week when Germany and the  Algerian  government seemed to be forging closer relations. As German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met Algerian Prime Minister Redha  Malek in Brussels, the German government tried to ban the  fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in exile from  involvement in "political activities" because its president,  Rabeh Kebir, had expressed views "endangering German interests."    Speaking to THE EUROPEAN on condition that his whereabouts  in  Germany are kept secret, Kebir said that neither he nor his  lawyer had received official notification from the German  government: "All we know is what was reported in the media, and  if it is true it is disappointing, as it would constitute an act  that is biased in favour of the Algerian military dictatorship.  We are aware, of course, that we are on the sovereign territory  of a foreign country, and that we must abide by its laws."    French intelligence had talks with the FIS in Sudan in late  1991, after elections were cancelled when it seemed that the  fundamentalists were certain to take power. Zeroual said on 7  February that he wanted to open discussions with FIS leaders,  though the battle against the armed militant groups would  continue. An alliance between the army and the dominant Islamic  political group -- the same situation as in Sudan -- is far from  unlikely, according to observers.    The FIS said it believed a peaceful solution to Algeria's  crisis could be negotiated with Zeroual. But Rabeh Kebir said  that a precondition had to be that the government release all  political prisoners and "engage in serious negotiations."    He said: "Zeroual should not offer to negotiate while his  war planes bomb suspected fundamentalist strongholds in the  mountains. Either they release all our people and negotiate in  good faith, or they don't. They cannot have it both ways."    The first indications of Franco-Sudanese cooperation came  last month from the Paris-based confidential Indian Ocean  Newsletter, which disclosed that Sudanese officials and  ministers had come to France to negotiate commercial contracts.    The most extraordinary visit was that of Sudanese secret  service chief General Hashim Abu-Sa'id. He met Colonel  Jean-Claude Mantion, an Africa specialist in the DGSE, France's  foreign intelligence service, who was eager to exchange  information on countries such as the Central African Republic  and Chad, where a new Libyan offensive is feared.    THE EUROPEAN has since learned that Abu-Sa'id twice came to  France in January in connection with a partnership deal.  Between two visits he went to his hometown of Doha and reported  back to Khartoum headquarters.    He is the chief of the foreign department of the Sudanese  intelligence service, led by fundamentalist Dr Nafi' al-Nafi', a  former Khartoum University lecturer before the 1989 coup d'etat.  His visits were clearly approved at the highest level of the  Islamic National Front. Opponents of the Khartoum regime say  they fear that in exchange for information on neighbouring  African countries, the DGSE will provide the regime with precise  data on and satellite pictures of the southern rebels of the  Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). The head of the DGSE  station in Khartoum favours the rebels, but was overruled  because his Paris chiefs now favour a rapprochement with Sudan.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER was again depressed on the LME by dull fundamentals and rising inventories. Comex stocks are at five-year highs while the LME stockpile is at its highest since April. Talk of Chinese selling and liquidation also weighed on prices. Three-month copper breached support at Dollars 2,340 a tonne and eventually ended at Dollars 2,325, down Dollars 25. The next downside target is Dollars 2,320, dealers said. ZINC was supported by renewed technical tightness for November metal, with widening premiums helping to arrest an early decline. The premium for cash over three-month metal ended at around Dollars 25, compared with Dollars 12 on Wednesday and last week's small discount. ALUMINIUM continued this week's decline, but closed above the day's lows, with support for three-month metal developing at Dollars 1,260 a tonne. GOLD recovered earlier losses to close steady on the London bullion market. But activity was generally subdued ahead of today's key US jobs data, which might trigger a cut in US rates. PALLADIUM extended its rally, fixing at Dollars 97.25 a troy ounce. It has advanced Dollars 6 in the past week to its highest in over a year on tight supply of Russian spot metal.

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Setback for shop discounts The sales division of Shiseido, Japan's largest cosmetics producer, yesterday won court clearance to refuse to supply its goods to Fujikiya, a discount retailer. The Tokyo high court decision, on an appeal by Shiseido, is an unexpected legal setback to the growth of discounting in Japan's high-priced retailing industry and conflicts with a three-year-old fair trade commission ruling, in favour of cut-price cosmetics. The FTC, which is independent from the courts, is expected this year to pass judgment on a similar row between Kawachiya, another cosmetics discounter, and Shiseido. Shiseido was told by a district court a year ago that it had contravened anti-monopoly laws by stopping sales to Fujikiya, which was offering 20 per cent discounts on Shiseido goods. The cosmetics group had ended its contract with the discounter on the grounds that it objected to Fujikiya's practice of piling Shiseido goods onto shelves, rather than using Shiseido-trained sales staff to present the products to customers. Known as the 'face to face' system, the use of sales staff trained by manufacturers is standard practice in department stores, and a factor in their high prices. The FTC had earlier investigated the dispute and ruled in 1991 that Fujikiya's sales practices were legal. Mr Kinichi Takahashi, the high court judge, yesterday argued that Shiseido had a legal right to demand 'face to face' sales contracts, even if this led to higher prices.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Stone walls do a prison make: Two colourful Italians learn that clinics are no substitute for a jail ITALIANS, it seems, can no longer 'do time' in a clinic as a substitute for landing in a prison. This appears to be the message behind the fate of two of Rome's more colourful business figures, Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, owner of Roma football team, and Mr Mauro Leone, son of former President of the Republic Giovanni Leone. Both have landed in a Rome prison on fraud charges concerning some L300m (Pounds 136,860) of funds in alleged false billings and rental contracts connected with finance subsidiaries of Efim, the state industrial holding put in liquidation last July. In the past, lawyers have usually been able to persuade Italian courts that important figures with health problems should be allowed to remain in hospital. Now, Mr Leone, 45, has been forced to leave a Rome clinic where he had been for a week. Mr Ciarrapico avoided this indignity by being in a London clinic, whence his lawyers sought to negotiate his return to a Rome hospital to face the fraud charges. He happens to be the owner of several Rome clinics, and part of the charges relate to alleged false leases on hospitals. The magistrates insisted he had to return and go to a jail, at best the prison sanatorium. This he did on Sunday in style, in a jet of his own air-taxi company. Yesterday, Mr Ciarrapico underwent his first interrogation in jail, with his lawyers confident he would be able to demonstrate his innocence. Though now known for his association with Roma football team, Mr Ciarrapico is also dubbed the king of mineral water, because of his extensive interests in that commodity. More important, Mr Ciarrapico is seen as a peculiarly Roman phenomenon, a businessman very publicly identified with politics. Mr Ciarrapico has been closely associated with Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times Christian Democrat prime minister. Equally, Mr Leone is regarded as an example of someone who has risen to business prominence as a result of the political connections of his father, operating in the labyrinthine world of Italian state-controlled companies. He is being charged with fraud in his role as deputy chairman of Efim and in connection with his being in charge of the latter's leasing and factoring subsidiaries, Safim Leasing and Safim Factor. Earlier this month, Mr Ciarrapico was sentenced to two years' jail for irregularities in the purchase of one of Rome's best known cafe-restaurants. He is also contesting a sentence concerning involvement in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tough first half for Brambles BRAMBLES Industries, the diversified Australian transport group, yesterday blamed economic conditions in Europe and the US for a 0.7 per cent fall in net profit to ADollars 88m (USDollars 59.8m) for the first half to end-December. Sales fell 10 per cent to ADollars 1.3bn. Mr Gary Pemberton, chief executive, said the result 'fell short of expectations', mainly because of reduced demand for waste processing in the US and a lower UK contribution. Mr Pemberton said prospects for the second half were difficult to predict, but 'any reasonable reading of overseas economic conditions would demand caution'. He said Brambles' full-year result would be 'particularly sensitive' to the state of the US economy, where the newly established Chep USA pallet business recently won a big contract with Campbell Soup, the US food group. Brambles said the contribution from Australian operations slipped slightly from last year, but added that the economy had showed some signs of recovery before pre-election jitters set in after the New Year. Some Australian businesses contributed improved trading profits, but the economy continued to provide a difficult trading environment for most of the company's industrial service activities. In Europe, the group's new contracting, records management and forklifts businesses contributed to a slight improvement in trading profits, although crane and construction-related operations were 'disappointing.' Mr Pemberton said UK trading conditions were tough. The effects of high interest rates and rising unemployment were most severe on the Cleanaway and GKN-Chep joint ventures. The group said the interim dividend would be maintained at 30 cents, fully franked.</p>

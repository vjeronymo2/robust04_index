			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "Diplomacy": "Austria </F> Is Coming Closer"]    [Text] A government delegation of the Republic of Armenia  headed by Minister of the Economy of the Republic of Armenia  Yegiazaryan was in Austria for several days.    In Vienna they signed an agreement on trade-economic  cooperation between the two countries. They also okayed another  agreement concerning promotion and protection of foreign  investments.    The delegation from Armenia had a meeting with the minister  of transportation and nationalized industry of Austria, during  the course of which a draft agreement between the two countries  in the area of air communications was discussed. The agreement  will make it possible to complete flights in the air space of  the two countries, use airports, service aircraft, etc. Thus the  airline companies will have a legal basis for concretizing their  relations with the corresponding agreements.    Delegates from Armenia visited a number of enterprises of  the  Austrian capital and learned about their activity. Then in the  Ministry of Transportation and Nationalization of Industry of  Austria, which has jurisdiction over the state enterprises,  there was a businesslike discussion of certain mutually  advantageous programs.    From the Chamber of Commerce, which essentially unites a  number of industrial ministries and enterprises and also  performs banking functions, an agreement was reached to the  effect that the Austrian side would render to Armenia a certain  amount of assistance in the matter of training personnel and  encouraging investments.    The trade-economic and other agreements will undoubtedly  help  in the development and deepening of Armenian-Austrian  cooperation.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lords urge more cuts in EC fishing fleets THE PHASING out of industrial fishing within the European Community and further reductions in community fleets are among the proposals in a critical House of Lords report, published yesterday, on the EC's common fisheries policy. The Lords inquiry was prompted by the mid-term review of the CFP being undertaken by the European Commission with a view to drawing up proposals for reforms for the consideration of the council of ministers later this year. While criticising the policy's failure to ensure that fish stocks are sufficient to support the fishing industry, the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities concludes that the community fleet is still too large and should be reduced further by decommissioning. Structural funds should be made available to coastal communities to help provide training and alternative employment for those who lose their jobs as a result of fleet reductions, it says. To ensure value for money for taxpayers' expenditure on decommissioning grants the report suggests that a tendering system could be employed. The committee's concern about industrial fishing (catching non-human consumption species for animal feed production) is based on the threat it poses of undermining the food chain for larger fish and the unacceptably high by-catch of human consumption species. This type of fishing should be phased out in EC waters over the next ten years, the report says. The Lords committee also deplored the large-scale discarding of unwanted species from human consumption catches. This practice, which wastes huge quantities of fish, should be banned, the report says, with the fish that otherwise would have been discarded being used for industrial purposes. Whatever reforms are agreed by the EC fisheries ministers they should seek to simplify the present complex regulations, the committee argues, pointing out that the CFP can never work unless it is simple and enforceable. It calls for harsher penalties for infringements ,including revocation of licences. Review of the Common Fisheries Policy (HL Paper 9), HMSO, Pounds 38.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 31 INJURED AS BUS FLIPS NEAR VEGAS  </P> <P> A Greyhound bus carrying passengers from Los Angeles flipped on its side and  skidded 50 feet on a rain-slick highway near Las Vegas on Sunday, injuring 31  people, none seriously.  </P> <P> The bus driver, who was not immediately identified by authorities, was changing  lanes on Interstate 15, slightly north of the Spring Mountain Road exit, when  he lost control, Nevada Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Marquardt said.  </P> <P> The accident did not appear to be caused by excessive speed, he said.  </P> <P> The bus slammed into a center divider and flipped onto its side, coming to rest  on top of the guardrail in the middle of the six-lane highway, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The passengers "got banged around pretty good," Marquardt said. The injuries  appeared to be minor to moderate -- bruises but no broken bones, he said.  </P> <P> Most of the passengers left the bus by walking or climbing over the front  dashboard where the windshield had popped out, authorities said.  </P> <P> Thirty passengers and the driver were taken to four area hospitals, Marquardt  said. All but one had been released by late Sunday.  </P></p>

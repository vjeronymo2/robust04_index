			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Biotrace International valued at Pounds 40m after placing at 130p SHARES IN Biotrace International, the South Wales-based biotechnology group which is being floated on the Stock Exchange, were yesterday placed firm at 130p, valuing the company at Pounds 40m. Allied Provincial Securities placed 7.15m shares, representing 23.2 per cent of the enlarged share capital, including some 4.6m shares placed on behalf of the com-pany. Biotrace was founded five years ago by Mr Ian Johnson, a former Welsh Water microbiologist, and Mr Colin Griffiths, an accountant. The group manufactures a range of rapid testing instruments and chemical reagents to monitor hygiene levels and detect microbiological contaminants in the food and drink and other sectors. Uni-Lite, the group's briefcase-housed portable product, provides a quick electronic test to check food industry hygiene on the production line - necessary to meet increasingly tough legislation and protect brand names and reputations. Like the group's other products it uses luciferase - a natural phenomenon based on the enzyme which makes fire flies glow - which emits light when it comes into contact with a substance called Adenosine Triphosphate which is present in all living cells including bacteria. An electronic instrument called a luminometer is then used to measure the light. The group's rapid hygiene and microbial testing systems are mainly supplied to the international food and drinks industry although it has a growing number of customers in other sectors including cosmetics and pharmaceutical manufacturers. After spending Pounds 299,000 on research and development, Biotrace incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 113,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.71m in the 12 months to July 31. Mr Griffiths, the finance director, expects the group to report a pre-tax profit in the current year. Biotrace is raising Pounds 5.6m net of expenses through the placing which will mainly be used to increase marketing resources in overseas markets and in particular, to accelerate international market penetration of Uni-Lite. Dealings in the shares are expected to begin on November 25.</p>

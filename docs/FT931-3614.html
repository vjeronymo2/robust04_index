Called Barbarians at the Gate, it is based on the best-selling tale of Henry Kravis, Ross Johnson and the battle for RJR Nabisco. Indeed, the preliminary reception was graced by one of the book's co-authors, Bryan Burrough, who left The Wall Street Journal recently for a highly paid perch at Vanity Fair. But he ducked out of the show as soon as the lights went down. Of the subsequent cackles, the most hysterical outburst was a true sign of changing times on Wall Street. It came when the story moved to the home of Jim and Linda Robinson, the former power couple from American Express.

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEWER BOSSES ARE PRESENTING THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH YEAR-END BONUSES;  </P> <P> PAY: THE TREND IS TO SUBSTITUTE INCENTIVE-BASED PLANS FOR THE TRADITIONAL  AUTOMATIC CHECK.  </P> <P> Performance-based considerations are increasingly taking the place of year-end  bonuses as employers across the United States decide who's been naughty or nice  at holiday time.  </P> <P> Although a boss who substitutes an incentive program for the traditional  holiday bonus risks being called a Scrooge, the trend actually reflects the  Santa Claus principle of rewarding good -- i.e., productive, behavior -- says  consultant Paul Muller.  </P> <P> "Bonuses, like salary, are no longer being treated as an entitlement," said  Muller, director of Midwest compensation consulting for Ernst &amp; Young, a  New York-based consulting firm.  </P> <P> And Orange County employers are no exception. An informal survey this week of  many of the county's largest employers -- and also of some of the smaller ones  -- finds that holiday bonuses here are most likely to be in the shape of  turkeys or in the form of a week off with pay. The Christmas check still  exists, but it is rare.  </P> <P> By and large, the county is in line with the rest of the nation in not giving  employees something simply because it's the holiday season.  </P> <P> "In effect, management now is saying, 'To the extent that you help us be  successful, we'll help you be successful,' " Muller said Wednesday in a  telephone interview from his Chicago office.  </P> <P> The move away from holiday bonuses is part of a trend toward fewer benefits in  general for employees and retirees, especially in health insurance, often in  light of lower corporate profits.  </P> <P> Muller said the elimination of year-end bonuses is motivated more by  management's desire to increase productivity than to cut costs.  </P> <P> But some Orange County firms are bucking the trend.  </P> <P> Beckman Instruments of Fullerton, for example, is one of the few large  companies in the United States in which each of its domestic employees receives  a cash bonus not tied to a profit-sharing or incentive plans. Company founder  Arnold O. Beckman "has always considered the company and its employees a  family," said Elke Eastman, a spokeswoman for the company, which has 6,000  employees in the United States.  </P> <P> The dGWB advertising agency in Irvine will be handing out "substantial" cash  bonuses, said partner Jim deYong, who describes it as "a Christmas tradition."  The 30 employees there "all work hard, so we try to share our appreciation with  them in the way it will be most appreciated," deYong said.  </P> <P> But many -- if not most -- Orange County firms are are skipping yuletide  gift-giving altogether. Knott's Berry Farm, for one, has no holiday bonuses,  although it puts on a Christmas party for employees and their families. "We  have a profit-sharing program that's unrelated to Christmas," said spokesman  Stuart A. Zanville, "but we close on Christmas Day so employees can spend the  day with their families."  </P> <P> While U.S. employers are becoming less generous with bonuses, their Japanese  counterparts are becoming more so. Japanese companies ordinarily pay bonuses  twice a year, in summer and before the new year.  </P> <P> Winter bonuses at 291 Japanese companies averaged $4,870 this year, up 7.3%  over last year, the biggest increase in nine years, the Japanese Federation of  Employers Assn. said Wednesday.  </P> <P> An association official in Tokyo attributed the increase to the prosperity of  business in that country.  </P> <P> Compensation experts in the United States said the traditional year-end bonus  in this country typically represents 5% to 6% of annual pay for hourly workers  and 10% to 15% for middle managers and executives.  </P> <P> Muller had no statistics to support his contention that year-end bonuses are  disappearing, but other experts say a trend toward incentive-based compensation  is apparent.  </P> <P> "There is a great deal of increase in the use of variable pay . . . tied to  some performance measures," said Frank Belmonte, a compensation consultant with  Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire, Ill.  </P> <P> Bob Kurisu of Strategic Compensation Associates in Los Angeles said Christmas  bonuses are "kind of an anachronism" and are rarely found in large  corporations.  </P> <P> However, at companies where year-end bonuses have been traditional, Belmonte  said, workers often expect them and management may feel obliged to hand them  out even if the company has not had a particularly good year.  </P> <P> "When you consider eliminating it, it's not an easy thing to do," he said.  "It's a very emotional issue."  </P> <P> Therefore, he said, employers planning to replace the year-end bonus with an  incentive-based program should give employees plenty of notice and clearly  spell out which goals must be met to qualify for incentive pay.  </P> <P> "Don't eliminate it and say nothing," Belmonte said. "Eliminate it and do a lot  of communication and explanation."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Luz Villarreal and Mary Ann Galante contributed to this  story.  </P> <P> HOLIDAY BONUSES AT LARGEST COUNTY COMPANIES  </P> <P> Here is a list of some of the biggest employers in Orange County and their  bonus/gift plans for the holiday season):  </P> <P> Rank Company, City (County Employees): Monetary or Other Bonus  </P> <P> 1.

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pirelli to sell shoes, clothing unit ONE of the last pieces in the disposal of the diversified products division of Italy's Pirelli tyres and cables group fell into place yesterday with the sale of its STL Superga shoes and clothing subsidiary, The buyer, a subsidiary of the Milan-based Sopaf investment banking group, is paying L103bn (Dollars 70m) for the businesses, which involve Pirelli's Superga shoes and K-Way sports clothing lines. The transaction will give Pirelli an extraordinary gain of L70bn, to be used partly to cover extraordinary losses in the 1992 accounts stemming from restructuring and other costs. The sale brings to L850bn the amount raised in disposals from Pirelli's diversified products division and other activities, notably property. The company has set a L1,000bn target for sell-offs by mid-1993. Pirelli has sold seven of the nine business units in its diversified products division. The operation was put on the block to raise cash after the failure of Pirelli's takeover bid for Continental, its German rival, in November 1991. The two units still to be sold involve transmission belts, hoses and some minor activities. The latest disposal will reduce Pirelli's group debt by about L160bn, as the purchasers are also taking around L57bn in STL Superga debt. In December 1990, Pirelli bought the French K-Way, also run by STL Superga, to broaden its consumer products activities. Pirelli will retain an indirect interest in Superga through Pirelli &amp; C, its ultimate holding company. Pirelli &amp; C will take around 12 per cent of Superga.</p>

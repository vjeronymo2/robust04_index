			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Korean accord is only a first step: Optimism and worry in the US pact with the North The framework agreement concluded between the US and North Korea on Friday night amounts to a diplomatic roadmap for an eventual solution to the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. The essence of the accord is that the US promises to improve diplomatic and economic relations with North Korea in return for Pyongyang's acceptance of full nuclear inspections and restrictions on its ability to produce plutonium, the core ingredient for nuclear weapons. But analysts warn the deal could still come unstuck over technical details, which will be the subject of negotiations beginning in late September. The new accord contains many of the same elements in an US-North Korean agreement reached in July 1993, but which subsequently unravelled over disputes about how it would be implemented. It is also similar to the plan outlined by former US President Jimmy Carter during his mediation mission to North Korea in June. The key difference between the new agreement and the July 1993 one is that the US this time has made explicit promises to North Korea for its compliance with international nuclear safeguards instead of offering vague incentives as it did earlier. The accord also helps resolve procedural issues on the implementation of any agreement, which has been a main stumbling block to a solution. The US has accepted North Korea's proposal for a package deal and abandoned its step-by-step approach that would have forced Pyongyang to make concessions first. This indicates there 'is an improvement in their mutual trust,' said Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister. The preliminary agreement consists of four main steps: North Korea will replace its plutonium-generating gas-cooled graphite reactors with light-water reactors, which are safer, easier to inspect and depend on imported enriched uranium for fuel. It will halt the construction of two 50MW and 200MW reactors, which would complement its current 5MW reactor. It also promises to forego the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel into plutonium, and seal its 'radiochemical laboratory', which is suspected to be a reprocessing plant. The US, in turn, will arrange for the supply of light-water reactors, which will be constructed in eight to 10 years and be capable of producing 2,000MW, which will significantly ease North Korea's energy shortage. Financing for the estimated Dollars 2bn-Dollars 4bn project is expected to be provided by Japan, while South Korea wants to supply the nuclear reactors. In the meantime, the US will arrange for interim energy supplies, such as oil shipments, while the light-water reactors are being built. The US and North Korea will establish some form of diplomatic representation in each other's capitals, possibly beginning with liaison offices, and reduce barriers to trade and investment, including the possible lifting of the US trade embargo against North Korea. The US will offer assurances to North Korea banning the threat or use of nuclear weapons if Pyongyang agrees to implement its 1991 non-nuclear pact with South Korea, which includes mutual nuclear inspections. North Korea will remain a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This would oblige North Korea to accept special inspections of two nuclear waste dumps to determine how much plutonium it has already produced for suspected nuclear weapons. The demand for special inspections by the IAEA triggered the nuclear dispute in March 1993, with North Korea threatening to withdraw from the NPT. Negotiations on the technical details of the accord will begin in Geneva on September 23. In the meantime, North Korea has agreed not to reprocess spent nuclear fuel rods recently withdrawn from its reactor. But the future fate of the fuel rods, with the two sides disagreeing on their disposal, indicates the complexity of the negotiations that lie ahead. North Korea wants to bury them in concrete to prevent radiation leakage, while the US wants to transfer them to a third country, possibly China, for reprocessing to prevent Pyongyang from using them as a possible bargaining chip. The comprehensive breadth of the agreement, with its provisions interlinked, could slow down future negotiations and any serious disputes could threaten the implementation of the accord. The issues to be tackled are difficult and their resolution must also be co-ordinated with progress in inter-Korean relations, which recently have hit a rough patch. But the conclusion of the agreement may put pressure on South Korea to ease its recent propaganda attacks on the North. Seoul cautiously welcomed the agreement, explaining it 'made clear the principles to be followed by both sides in their further efforts to find an ultimate solution to the nuclear issue'. Another cause of optimism is that the US-North Korean accord was concluded after only a week of talks, indicating that North Korea's new leadership may be ready to resolve the nuclear dispute in a first step to open the country to foreign investment.</p>

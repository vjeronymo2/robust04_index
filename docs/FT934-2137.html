			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Southern Water rises to Pounds 64.5m Southern Water yesterday reported a 7.5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 64.5m and at the same time attacked the water industry regulator over its approach to pricing. The company warned that it would appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if it was unhappy with the outcome of next year's review. 'We believe the underlying mechanics on which the methodology is based are flawed,' said Mr Martyn Webster, managing director. 'There are equally valid and alternative methods which should be considered.' These included the approach taken to pricing at British Gas, where the MMC recommended a rate of return on assets of between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent. Ofwat has suggested it will seek to reduce this for water companies from a 7 per cent level to the lower end of the 5 to 6 per cent range. Southern was particularly unhappy with Ofwat's approach to initial capital valuations and replacement expenditure. Mr Webster said Southern would not hesitate to approach the MMC if it was unhappy with the final settlement. 'We should lose our jobs if we did not go to the MMC,' he said. The improvement in profits for the six months to September 30 was achieved on the back of a 7 per cent sales rise to Pounds 171.9m. The interim dividend is increased 8.5 per cent to 7.7p - the largest rise so far declared in this season's water sector results. Earnings were 7 per cent higher at 36.9p per share. Southern enjoyed a 12 per cent increase to Pounds 61.9m in trading profits in its core utility water business. The company's non-regulated businesses stood out in a sector which has reported a series of disappointing results from diversification. Profits rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 4.9m. After interest, the non-regulated businesses contributed Pounds 5.9m. Mr Webster also announced the acquisition of an environmental research lab in Manchester for less than Pounds 1m. COMMENT Southern begins to get more attractive just when water companies are falling out of favour. The group has in its favour a successful non-regulated business, a better than expected cash position, and a sterling record on customer service. It is also not afraid to put its head above the parapet on the forthcoming price review, unlike some of its sector colleagues. Nevertheless, it cannot avoid the uncertainty in the light of that very review. Ofwat's recent statements leave much up in the air. Full-year forecasts were held at Pounds 127m, but 1995 moves ahead on the back of the diversified businesses. If you are one of the few looking to plunge into the sector, this may be one of the more attractive.</p>

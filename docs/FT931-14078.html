			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Canadian airlines face warning THE CANADIAN government has threatened to step in if the country's troubled airlines fail to take firmer action to reduce their chronic excess capacity. The warning from Mr Jean Corbeil, the transport minister, follows a decision by Canadian Airlines International to reinstate some flights which it earlier planned to cut. Canadian's change of heart, which will reduce its cuts from 15 per cent to 6.7 per cent of capacity, was in response to a cutback of only 3 per cent by its arch-rival Air Canada. The struggle between Air Canada and Canadian has been exacerbated by the entry of Nationair, a small Montreal-based charter airline, into some of the two leading carriers' busiest routes. All three have introduced cut-throat fares between Toronto and Montreal in recent weeks. A ministry spokesman declined to provide details on the action being contemplated to reverse deregulation, introduced in 1987. 'We would like the industry to self-discipline itself,' he said. 'But if we find they're not capable of doing so, we may jump in.' Any move is unlikely, however, before the government receives recommendations, probably within the next few weeks, from a panel which conducts an annual review of the National Transportation Act. Air Canada and Canadian have been losing an estimated CDollars 2m (Dollars 1.5m) a day in their battle for market share.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> 48TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;  </P> <P> DESPITE RESIDENCY FLAP, FARRELL PROVES TOUGH FOR ARCHIE-HUDSON  </P> <P> Marguerite Archie-Hudson came into the battle for the Democratic nomination for  Maxine Waters' 48th Assembly District seat with heavy-duty political armaments.  </P> <P> She had a larger war chest than any of her opponents, the official endorsement  of the California Democratic Party, plus the blessings of Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Waters, a Democrat who is vacating her seat  after a 14-year tenure to run for Congress. Perhaps most important, she had  access to Waters' highly effective political machine.  </P> <P> But in the final days of the primary campaign, it remains unclear whether  Archie-Hudson, a one-time Brown aide and former Los Angeles Community College  District trustee, can parlay those advantages into a victory Tuesday over Los  Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell, the most formidable of her opponents.  </P> <P> Three other Democratic candidates are considered long shots in the race.  </P> <P> Even some of Farrell's staunchest political foes are cautiously giving him the  edge in the race, despite questions raised last week about whether he is  legally eligible to be a candidate.  </P> <P> Farrell's voter registration card lists an address in the 48th District as his  residence, but the owners of the home dispute that, saying Farrell began the  process of buying the property from them in February but allowed the deal to  lapse.  </P> <P> California law requires that candidates for Assembly seats live in their  respective districts at the time nomination filing papers are issued. Aside  from the legal question surrounding Farrell's residency, the flap has raised  the political question of his commitment to the 48th District.  </P> <P> Kerman Maddox, who helped spearhead an unsuccessful drive to recall Farrell  from his council seat two years ago, said the residency issue may have cropped  up too late to harm Farrell.  </P> <P> "Had this come out a week before and dragged out, Marguerite could have  snatched it and run," Maddox said. "It's a great hit. It's a real issue. But  it's real late."  </P> <P> Political observers agree that the one most important advantage Farrell has in  the race is name recognition.  </P> <P> He has been on the City Council 16 years, and in that time has built a  following of loyal supporters. His council district overlaps much of the  portion of the 48th Assembly District that is within the city of Los Angeles.  The district also includes the cities of Lynwood and South Gate, as well as  unincorporated county areas.  </P> <P> Ferdia Harris, 73, a longtime community activist who heads a coalition of 30  block clubs in South-Central and Southeast Los Angeles, said she doesn't care  whether Farrell actually lives in the 48th.  </P> <P> "None of them live where they say they live. It's just a joke anyway," she  said, referring to officeholders and candidates in South-Central in general.  </P> <P> Willis Pursley, another coalition leader, also continues to support Farrell.  </P> <P> "He just should have gotten a better lie, and he should have gotten his lie  together," said Pursley.  </P> <P> Despite such support, Farrell's record has been the subject of harsh criticism  during the campaign. His opponents have contended that his future effectiveness  as a politician can be best measured by the deterioration that has occurred  within his council district during his tenure. They cite increases in gang  violence, drug-trafficking and other crimes, the flight of businesses from the  district and chronic joblessness among many of its residents.  </P> <P> Archie-Hudson, at a candidates forum last week, promised that as an Assembly  member she would push for state programs that stress job training, economic  development and improvements to public schools.  </P> <P> Similar promises were made by the other Democratic candidates, Lynwood City  Councilwoman Evelyn Wells, political consultant Roderick Wright and write-in  candidate Brenda Moffett, a Watts activist.  </P> <P> The Democrat who is victorious Tuesday will face Republican Gloria Salazar and  Libertarian Jose Castaneda in the November general election.  </P></p>

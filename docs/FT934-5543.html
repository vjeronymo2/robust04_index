			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Mahathir row with Keating intensifies Blunt-talking Australian politicians have often ruffled the sensitivities of neighbouring governments in southeast Asia. But, now, just as Australia is making a big push to become more interlinked with the dynamic economies of the region, the country's straight-talking prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, has provoked a row with Malaysia. Mr Keating has been critical of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's non-appearance at the recent Apec summit, and Malaysia struck back at the weekend. Dr Mahathir had said that he did not attend the summit because certain countries, mainly the US and Australia, were trying to railroad Apec into becoming a organisation structured along the lines of the European Union. 'Please don't ask me any more questions about Dr Mahathir,' Mr Keating said to the Australian press corps. 'I couldn't care less, frankly, whether he comes or not. I am sick of. . . questions about Dr Mahathir. . . Apec is bigger than all of us. . . Australia, the US, Malaysia, Dr Mahathir and any other recalcitrants.' At the weekend, Mr Mohamad Rachmat, Malaysia's information minister, announced that Malaysia would be banning Australian-made TV programmes and advertising material and that Malaysia's state-controlled broadcasting service would be reporting only negative news about Australia. 'This,' he said, 'is to tell the Australian government and media that what was said by Keating was not only an insult to our prime minister but also to the Malaysian people and to the country.' He insisted that Mr Keating publicly apologise. Dr Mahathir, himself not averse to the occasional undiplomatic verbal thrust, said that he was disappointed with Mr Keating but chose to lay most of the blame on the Australian media: 'Some newspapers made me out to be a difficult person and very unpopular and that Malaysia was about to burst into racial violence.' Australia's claim to be part of Asia was meaningless. 'How', he asked, 'can Australia claim to be part of Asia when Australian journalists lack manners? It is difficult for us to love Australia.' While the Malaysian media and political opposition also joined in the war of words, the row will probably be resolved by diplomacy. Mr Keating, due for an official visit to Malaysia next year, has made closer relations with southeast Asia the central point of his government's economic and foreign policy. 'For the first time,' says Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, 'Australia is paying more attention to its geography than its history.' Australian exports to the region have been growing rapidly. Two-way trade with Malaysia rose more than 30 per cent in 1992-93 to ADollars 2.3bn (Dollars 1.6bn), with Australia showing a healthy surplus. Australian investors are involved in several big projects in Malaysia, particularly in the mining and petrochemical sectors. But Australia's relations with its Asian neighbours are never easy. Relations with Indonesia have only recently improved. A few years Malaysia took offence over an Australian TV series which depicted life in an Australian embassy. Kuala Lumpur said the series was modelled on Malaysia and was very insulting. 'It's a clash of styles' says a Malaysian academic who studied in Australia. 'Australia's politicians and its press can say anything they want. We have to be a lot more careful about what we talk about. Australians are going to find life very difficult as Asians.'</p>

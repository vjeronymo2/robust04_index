			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Stage mothers are bad enough, but rink mothers sound worse. Short Stories reports on 'the Jemettes', junior European precision skating champions, who are practising for a competition in Sweden and for their appearance in 'The Sleeping Beauty'. The mothers of these budding Torvills and Deans sew the sequins and bull the skating boots (8.00 C4). Further Abroad is a genuinely eccentric series, which makes a change after all those mannered programmes where arm waving egotists with odd accents strain desperately for eccentricity. Jonathan Meades doesn't need to strain: he is really weird. Tonight his subject is architecture in the context of brewing (9.30 BBC2). Two middle-of-the-road drama series return. In The Chief Martin Shaw is now the chief constable of 'Eastland', a role originally played by Tim Piggott-Smith. Today's plot involves illegal immigrants (9.00 ITV). In Love Hurts Adam Faith plays a rich plumber and Zoe Wanamaker a pushy middle class administrator, working for a big charity (9.30 BBC1).</p>

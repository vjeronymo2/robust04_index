			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Port industry signs a fragile peace treaty: Longer-term solutions are needed to avoid further discord AFTER more than two years of bitter infighting, a deal has been struck that may bring temporary peace to Portugal's best known industry and Europe's oldest delimited wine region. An agreement signed last month by port wine producers, shippers and regulators, resolves an immediate problem - what to do with excess production - and sets the stage for avoiding future surpluses. Current stocks of surplus wine will be withheld from the market to maintain price stability, but longer-term solutions are needed to avoid further discord. The row has pitted farmers against the traditional port shipping houses, and the shippers against the regulatory authorities. It also caused the resignation last July of the president of the Port Wine Institute, which sets the production ceiling for each harvest. It has brought the Casa do Douro, the main regulating body, close to bankruptcy, and helped to create a surplus wine lake which may be good news for drinkers, but is a disaster for producers. The recent row started in 1990, when the Casa do Douro announced it was buying a 40 per cent stake in Real Companhia Velha, one of the largest shippers, thereby becoming a leading producer in its own right. This caused an outcry from other shippers who argued that the Casa do Douro could not be regulating body, producer and shipper at the same time. 'It's the sort of thing that happens in a banana republic,' said one shipper. These conflicting responsibilities are central to the dispute. The Casa do Douro, established in 1932 as a para-state institution to regulate production and to assist and protect farmers, operates under the tutelage of the agriculture ministry. It directly controls production by issuing the individual beneficios or licences to the farmers, stating how much wine and, equally importantly what sort of wine each can produce. It also supports producers by buying up surplus stocks, as well as acting as a farmers' union - all producers are legally obliged to be members. This multiplicity of roles has given it considerable influence and power over some 30,000 farmers, whose livelihood depends on selling their grapes and making wine. With the price of a pipe of wine for port (one pipe contains 534 litres) fetching Esc130,000 (Dollars 1,000) compared with Esc20,000 for ordinary table wine, farmers naturally want to produce as much as possible of the former. 'The Casa do Douro is like a big daddy. It tells you how much you can produce and if you can't sell it, it buys it,' says Mr Paul Symington, from one of the largest port shippers. The system of beneficios has been fraught with difficulties for years, says another shipper. 'It's arbitrary; it's open to fraud, and everybody knows it. The farmers are starting to realise they've been led down the garden path.' Critics say only a new independent institution, with farmers and shippers equally represented and the Wine Institute acting as neutral referee, could bring back sense to the industry. The Casa do Douro's purchase of a stake in Real Companhia Velha, was the final straw, turning it into a battleground for competing interests. The row was fuelled by Mr Manuel da Silva Reis, Real's managing director and majority shareholder. He hatched the deal after he fell out with Cofipsa, his main partner, which is partly owned by Italian financier Mr Carlo De Benedetti. That partnership collapsed within months after acrimonious debate and irreconcilable differences over strategy. All of this came at a difficult time for the port industry, which was beginning to feel the effects of a worldwide decline in demand for alcoholic drinks. Port sales have fallen steadily since 1988, when they peaked at 9.23m cases (of 12 bottles of 75cl). Exports last year were worth Dollars 272m, down almost 5 per cent on the previous year, while the volume of sales including domestic sales fell by about 3.5 per cent from 8.98m cases to 8.66m cases in the same period. Overproduction depressed prices, and rising costs contributed to lower margins and profits. The Port Wine Shippers Association (AEVP), which represents all port shippers except Mr Silva Reis's Real Companhia Velha, expects profits to fall by 40-50 per cent this year. The Casa do Douro, already financially strapped by its Esc9.6bn (Dollars 73m) purchase of the stake in Real and increasing costs of buying up rising surplus production, is negotiating a World Bank loan in efforts to remain above water. Shippers are not brimming with sympathy: 'It's the result of its own incompetence.' They say the industry was put at risk by the Casa do Douro's irresponsible behaviour in allowing farmers to produce more than was authorised. In 1989, 29,000 pipes of must - the wine base for port - were produced illegally, bringing total production to 174,000 pipes; in 1990, 42,000 pipes out of a total of 157,000 pipes were produced illegally. Last year, the authorised production ceiling of 110,000 pipes was respected, but shippers say it was set far too high and 38,000 pipes remained unsold at the end of the season. Faced with the prospect of large excess stocks flooding the market, the shippers have agreed to buy the surplus for Dollars 34m and will release it gradually on to the market in 1992-93. The 1992 harvest will be calculated on the basis of world sales to June less the amounts that will be released from surplus stocks. 'Buyers abroad will know that production in this harvest (1992) will be based on demand and nothing more,' says one shipper. Enthusiasts who may have hoped for more and cheaper port are likely to be disappointed, but they need not be despondent: despite the downturn, world sales of port have doubled in the past 20 years, and there should be no shortage of premium wines in years to come.

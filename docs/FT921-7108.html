			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Bank must pay compound interest THE GOLDEN MED Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: February 18 1992 INTEREST DUE to the owners of money retained by a bank in breach of its fiduciary duty as constructive trustee after the condition on which it was deposited has failed, is compounded with yearly rests, in that in the commercial circumstances the bank is presumed to have made the most beneficial use of the money in its investment business, to earn compound, not simple, interest. Mr Justice Hirst so held when giving judgment for the plaintiffs, Guardian Ocean Cargoes Ltd and others, on a claim for compound interest in an action for the return of monies deposited conditionally with the defendant bank, Banco do Brasil, in negotiations to refinance the building of Golden Med. HIS LORDSHIP said that in the action he gave judgment for Dollars 600,000 in the plaintiffs' favour on February 14 1991, and adjourned questions relating to interest. The Dollars 600,000 comprised three payments of Dollars 200,000 made by the plaintiffs to the bank as an earnest of their sincerity in a proposed refinancing deal for a shipbuilder's contract. Originally the contract was between a Brazilian shipbuilding yard and a Danish ship-owning group for construction of Golden Med. The transaction had been financed by the bank. The Danish company ran into financial difficulties. The plaintiffs, members of a Greek shipping group, were anxious to take over the contract. The court found that the Dollars 600,000 was deposited by the plaintiffs with the bank conditionally, as a token of genuine intent for future use in the intended acquisition of the vessel, and was to be applied for that purpose only if the refinancing negotiations were successful. In other words, the remittances were conditional on conclusion of a re-financing deal. The negotiations, having nearly come to a successful conclusion in 1981, dragged on for five years until November 1986, when they broke down. The plaintiffs then demanded return of the Dollars 600,000, but the bank refused to pay. The money was held intact by the bank in an account with a New York bank from 1981 to 1986, and beyond. Due to recent radical re-organisation following a change of government in Brazil, the bank had been unable to ascertain, despite strenuous efforts, what rate of interest had accrued to it from that deposit. In January 1987, the plaintiffs issued the present proceedings, claiming return of the Dollars 600,000 on the footing that consideration for the payment had wholly failed; or alternatively on the basis of a constructive trust in their favour. The bank's case was that the payments were voluntary and unconditional, and were therefore irrecoverable. The court had ruled on both issues in the plaintiffs' favour. It was common ground that the plaintiffs were entitled to statutory interest under section 35A of the Supreme Court Act 1981, which empowered the court to include simple interest in the judgment sum at such rate as it thought fit, on all or part of the debt or damages in respect of which judgment was given, for all or part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and date of judgment. The plaintiffs also sought an award of compound interest under the court's equitable jurisdiction, having regard to the bank's breach of fiduciary duty, from November 1986 to date of judgment. It was common ground that the court had jurisdiction in an appropriate case to award compound interest in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction. Miss Gloster for the bank submitted that the power should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances, such as where the defendant had mis-applied trust money to his own profit. She said the normal basis was simple interest. Mr Pickering for the plaintiffs submitted that there was no such limitation, and that the proper basis of the award depended on the commercial circumstances which, in the case of a bank defendant, normally warranted compound interest. In Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2) (1975) QB 373,388, in which Mr Wallersteiner was guilty of serious misfeasance in breach of fiduciary duty, Lord Denning MR said that in equity interest was 'never awarded by way of punishment'. He said it was awarded where money was misused by anyone in a fiduciary position who had misapplied the money and made use of it for his own benefit. As to whether it should be simple or compound interest, he said on general principles it should be presumed that the company (had it not been deprived of the money) would have made the most beneficial use open to it. Alternatively, he said, 'it should be presumed that the wrongdoer made the most beneficial use of it. But whichever it is, in order to give adequate compensation, the money should be replaced at interest with yearly rests, that is, compound interest'. In O'Sullivan v Management Agency (1985) QB 428,461, a manager was in breach of fiduciary duty towards an entertainer under his management. Lord Justice Dunn distinguished Wallersteiner as concerning a financier who used the money he obtained in his operations. He said 'in those circumstances it was presumed that the money was worth to him the equivalent of compound interest at commercial rates with yearly rests. In the present case, accepting that the money was used by the defendants for their business purposes, part of it must have been used for the benefit of O'Sullivan himself'. He awarded simple interest. Miss Gloster's submission that compound interest was only to be awarded in exceptional cases where the defendant was guilty of serious misconduct, was not accepted. The authorities made it clear that the award of compound interest was in no way punitive, but was related to the commercial circumstances. Thus compound interest would be inappropriate in the case of a solicitor trustee who was not engaged in an investment business (see Burdick v Garrick (1869-1970) Ch App 233. Conversely, where a trustee was engaged in investment, as in Wallersteiner, it was to be presumed that he would invest the money in his trade or business using it in effect as part of his working capital. Miss Gloster strongly relied on O'Sullivan, and submitted that the court should adopt the same approach and award only simple interest. However, an important factor in the decision in that case was that there was a joint enterprise between the manager and the entertainer; and in any event the manager was not engaged in investment business. The present case was comparable with Wallersteiner, apart from the irrelevant distinction that here there was nothing seriously culpable in the bank's conduct. The bank, like Mr Wallersteiner, was essentially engaged in investment business, and must be presumed to have used its money for normal banking purposes as part of its working capital, and thus to have been in a position to earn compound interest. It followed that compound interest was the appropriate basis. The evidence was that in New York, where the bank held the Dollars 600,000, it would have been able to earn the New York prime rate plus 1 per cent. That was accepted. It would not be appropriate to award the lower New York Certificate of Deposit rate. The evidence also was that in New York the rests for compounding interest would be three-monthly. The court preferred, in the exercise of its discretion, to adhere strictly to the Wallersteiner formula, and award yearly rests, which in the circumstances it considered fair. Compound interest was ordered at 1 per cent over the New York prime rate applicable from time to time with yearly rests for the period November 1986 to date of judgment. If those conclusions were wrong, on the statutory basis the appropriate award would be simple interest at three months New York Certificate of Deposit rates applicable from time to time. The area of dispute was the date at which the cause of action arose. Mr Pickering submitted it arose on payment in 1981. Miss Gloster submitted it arose when the refinancing negotiations broke down and the plaintiffs requested repayment. To award statutory interest running from any earlier date than November 1986 would not have been just, seeing that throughout that period the bank was holding the money entirely in accordance with the condition on which it had been deposited. For the bank: Elizabeth Gloster QC and George Leggatt (Clifford Chance). For the plaintiffs: Murray Pickering QC and Elizabeth Birch (Swinnerton Ashley-Claydon &amp; Co).</p>

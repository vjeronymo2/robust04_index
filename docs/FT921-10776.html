			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Famous face of fashion wears well in tough times - The house of Yves St Laurent IT IS hard to avoid Mr Yves St Laurent in Paris these days. The face of France's most famous fashion designer is splashed across magazines and television screens following yesterday's party to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his fashion house, a 'fete de famille' for 2,800 guests at the glossy new Opera Bastille. The 30th birthday comes at a critical time for St Laurent. It, like the rest of the global luxury goods industry, has spent the past year struggling against the parallel problems of economic recession and the backlash against the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s. 'Life has been difficult, but not disastrous,' said Mr Pierre Berge, president of YSL. 'The first half of this year will be tough, but there are already signs of recovery. The second half should not be too bad at all.' Mr Berge has worked with Mr St Laurent since the very beginning. They met in the late 1950s, when Mr St Laurent was a precociously gifted young designer at Christian Dior, one of the most prestigious houses in Paris. In 1960, Mr St Laurent was drafted into the French army to fight in the Algerian war. He broke down, unable to cope with army life. Mr Berge rescued him from a military hospital outside Paris. In the meantime, Dior had found a new designer. Mr St Laurent sued and used his Pounds 48,000 (Dollars 86,880) damages to found his own house. Mr Yves St Laurent is now an institution in French fashion. He is cast in the role of the tortured genius, so shy and so sensitive that he sometimes does not even attend his own shows. Rarely a season goes by without rumours running around that he is too ill or too depressed to work. Mr Berge once described him as being 'born with a nervous breakdown'. Mr Berge, or 'Pierre the Panther', as the French press call him, is seen as the business brains, the efficient eminence grise behind the scenes. Recently, he has become more prominent through his role as head of the three Paris opera houses and his friendship with President Francois Mitterrand. The mere mention of his name is an anathema to right wing industrialists, to whom 'Pierre the Panther' is a prime mover in 'La Gauche Caviar', France's sybaritic socialists. Even his critics concede that Mr Berge has turned St Laurent into a financial success. He was one of the first in the fashion industry to forge links with the mainstream business community. In 1986, he did a deal with Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, which enabled St Laurent to buy back its perfumes. Three years later, St Laurent became the first publicly-quoted fashion house when it floated on the Paris stock market. Today, at a time when so many fashion designers have been subsumed into luxury goods conglomerates such as Mr Bernard Arnault's LVMH and Mr Henri Racamier's Orcofi, St Laurent is not only independent, but one of the very few houses to own its own perfumes. The company now generates annual sales of more than FFr3bn. Four-fifths of its turnover comes from perfume and cosmetics. Haute couture, the business with which it began 30 years ago, musters little more than 1 per cent of overall sales. Last year, St Laurent suffered a slight fall in profits when the disruption of the Gulf war aggravated the depressive effects of the recession. Cholet-Dupont, the Paris stockbroker, forecasts a fall in net profits from FFr252m (Dollars 46.6m) in 1990 to FFr236m in 1991, with a modest recovery this year to FFr258m as the luxury goods market moves out of the doldrums. Once the recession is over, St Laurent will face a new set of challenges in the increasingly competitive luxury goods industry. Just as groups like LVMH have invested in high fashion, so the giant consumer goods companies, such as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, have expanded in its other areas of activity, perfume and cosmetics. These companies have deployed their huge research resources and hefty marketing budgets to raise the cost of competing in St Laurent's main markets. This means that its future expansion projects will not only be more difficult, but also more expensive. St Laurent's recent foray into skin care involved a significant investment in research facilities. The proposed launch of a new perfume next year will be accompanied by heavy advertising, although Mr Berge insists St Laurent will 'not spend crazy sums - Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m - like our competitors'. In the long term, the increasingly competitive state of the luxury good industry may make it difficult for St Laurent to retain its independence. This, coupled with the inevitable questions as to who will succeed Mr St Laurent and Mr Berge could prompt the company to forge links with other groups so it can share their resources. 'Eventually we may have to find an ally,' said Mr Berge. 'But we would have to be careful, very careful in choosing the right one.'</p>

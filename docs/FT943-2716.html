			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Sweden At one level it scarcely matters to Swedish financial markets who wins tomorrow's election. With government debt already yielding 8 percentage points more than the inflation rate the market has already priced in a good measure of scepticism over the country's ability to contain its government deficit. National debt threatens to exceed gross domestic product next year. High interest charges on that debt mean Sweden will find it harder than other countries to grow out of its deficit problem. The stage is coming when a government of whatever hue must take action to curb welfare spending. Doubtless, victory for Mr Carl Bildt's centre-right coalition would come as a pleasant surprise for markets. The Social Democrats look more likely to win, albeit not outright. Their plans for reducing the deficit are strikingly modest by comparison with those of the government, but a coalition partner might force them into tougher action. High-profile warnings about the state of government finances from private sector businessmen have at least drawn public attention to the issue. The question for financial markets will be how long it takes for the Social Democrats to revise their plans. Anything more than a short delay could provoke a further bout of weakness for both bonds and the krona, and a fresh rise in short-term interest rates. Bold investors might see that as a buying opportunity on the grounds that financial market alarm would concentrate minds on the fiscal problem. But the ride could become very rough indeed if the markets conclude that the government does not have the stomach for the task. That would prompt more general worries about the ability of industrial democracies to fund their public spending.</p>

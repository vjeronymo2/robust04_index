			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: EniChem sees deficit widening to L2,200bn ENICHEM, the chronically loss-making petrochemicals subsidiary of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals group, expects this year's losses to reach about L2,200bn (Dollars 1.3bn). The company, which has seen a severe deterioration in its financial performance in spite of cost-cutting efforts, lost L1,052bn in the first half of this year against L721bn in the same period last year. About L1,000bn of this year's losses will stem from financial charges on its large net indebtedness, expected to be about L8,500bn by the year end. The deterioration at EniChem means it will have to be recapitalised by Eni under Italian law. However, Mr Marcello Colitti, EniChem's chairman, said fresh capital would have to await further results of the group's restructuring. Mr Colitti noted that any injection of funds would have to convince the European Commission in Brussels that it did not represent illegal state aid. EniChem intends to dispose of non-core activities and slim down its business to concentrate on ethylenes, polymers and elastomers.</p>

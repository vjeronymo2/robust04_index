			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Arsene Bonga Koudou] </F>   [Text] With the approach of the 1995 elections, the  Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI] wants foreigners to  vote officially. For this reason, Interior Minister Bombet is  getting ready to present a custom-made electoral law to  Parliament. Article 3 of this law stipulates:    Those eligible to vote are:    Ivorian nationals of both sexes aged 21 before the closure  of  the voters' register, who enjoy full civil and political rights,  and who are not disqualified to vote by law.    Foreigners from the Economic Community of West African  States  [ECOWAS] member countries, in accordance with the community's  protocol on citizenship, whose names are in the voters' register.    That is the PDCI's detonator. Obviously, the old party is  demonstrating its desire to pitch the Ivorian people against  foreigners because it knows that Ivorians have not yet forgotten  the 1990 elections. The late Houphouet-Boigny stole their  victory from the people by allowing these foreigners from  neighboring countries to vote. How frustrating! However, if  the people accepted their pain stoically, it was because it was  caused by Houphouet-Boigny. This time, however, they do not know  who their provoker is.    Who says Ivorians are nonviolent. Beware! If the PDCI does  not want foreigners in Cote d'Ivoire, it should drive them away  itself. It must not use the hands of the freedom- and  justice-loving people to do that. Frustrations at the elections  have transformed peaceful Algerians into indomitable terrorists.  As they see their hopes evaporate because the West has imposed  freedom-stifling regimes on them, all they can do is to choose  the path of violence. At least, that is what they believe so in  Algeria no day passes by without the murder of at least two or  three Westerners. Is that not driving foreigners away?    The Ivorian people know that it is foreigners who imposed  the  PDCI on them in 1990 otherwise, this party, which has refused to  organize fair elections, just has a few Ivorians within its  ranks.    Today, Eburneans [Ivorians] have decided to finish with  their  governors who have nothing to propose to them. They need  change: new men and a new program. They should not be invited  to the field of violence. The PDCI must be careful. The  deputies who will be called upon to pass this fatal law must  show a sense of moderation because no Army in the world, no  matter its training, can thwart the legitimate aspirations of  the people, especially when the people are provoked  indefinitely. Let us look around us.</p>

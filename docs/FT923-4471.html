			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Move to boost women's pay urged THE GAP between the earnings of men and women is set to increase unless the government forces employers to upgrade women's pay, according to an Equal Opportunities Commission report published today. The decline of centralised collective bargaining in many sectors, the casualisation of the labour market and the introduction of performance pay in recent years are all working against the closing of the pay gap, the organisation says. The absence of a statutory minimum wage also continues to disadvantage women, it adds. The commission wants to see the existing, highly complex equal-pay legislation replaced by more simple and more effective laws to require employers to demonstrate they are not discriminating against women. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, who also has cabinet responsibility for women's issues, is more sympathetic to the idea of legislative reform than her recent predecessors. Women in full-time work earn about 77 per cent of the full-time average hourly pay of men. The commission argues that an increase of 10 per cent in women's hourly earnings would result in an increase in the UK's total wage bill of only 3.1 per cent. This is because women work shorter hours and receive lower basic pay. Mrs June Bridgeman, deputy chair of the organisation, said the study showed it would be good value for money to correct the harmful bias in the way women's work is valued. The report concludes that progress in closing the pay gap is unlikely to come as a result of existing legislation on equal pay and the pursuit of individual equal-value cases.

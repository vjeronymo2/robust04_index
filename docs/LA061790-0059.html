			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: TALES FROM THE PLANET EARTH BY ARTHUR C. CLARKE (BANTAM:  $9.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Although it doesn't include all of Arthur C. Clarke's stories about Earth ("No  Morning After" and "The Nine Billion Names of God" are among the notable  omissions), "Tales" offers some of the writer's finest work from the '50s and  '60s. "The Road to the Sea" and "The Lion of Comarre" represent early  explorations of the link between cultural stagnation and technological advance,  a theme Clarke would develop more fully in "The City and the Stars." The  bizarre surprise ending of "The Other Tiger" and the disastrously successful  media hype in "Publicity Campaign" stand out as examples of the deliciously  black humor that enables Clarke to end the world, not with a bang but a  snigger.  </P></p>

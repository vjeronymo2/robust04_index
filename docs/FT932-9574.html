			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Hillsdown's US accent Bridget Macaskill, president and chief operating officer of US mutual fund manager Oppenheimer Management Corporation, is joining the board of Hillsdown, the poultry to upholstery group, as its third non-executive director. Sir John Nott, who has recently taken over as executive chairman, says that '90 per cent of our ultimate customers are women, but that is not why she was selected.'

Not much later she was running the new fruit juice division. In 1982 she then moved with her husband, who works for Bankers Trust, to New York, and picked up a job as vice president of marketing for Oppenheimer, then part of Mercantile House. Moving onto the general management side, she had risen to chief operating officer by the time Oppenheimer bought itself out from the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth empire. Oppenheimer Management Corporation currently manages Dollars 22bn of assets with annual sales running at Dollars 4bn. Macaskill believes that her awareness, as a consumer, of American trends in the food business - salads, prepared foods - will justify her presence on the Hillsdown board. Now sporting a distinctly American accent, she adds that her experience of running a US business may also prove useful. Sir John, who acknowledges that Hillsdown has been 'light' on non-executives since he took on the role of executive chairman and Tony Brice, a former Hillsdown executive, retired at the agm, says that the group will probably be looking for another non-exec. 'It has not finally been decided whether Sir Harry Solomon (the co-founder of Hillsdown who has recently stepped down from the chairmanship) will be seen as a true non-executive director.'</p>

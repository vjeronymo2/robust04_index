			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER BOWL XXIV: DENVER BRONCOS VS. SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS;  </P> <P> 20 YEARS AGO, HE BEAT ODDS;  </P> <P> SUPER BOWL IV: LEN DAWSON NOT ONLY PLAYED FOR UNDERDOG CHIEFS, HE FACED  GAMBLING INVESTIGATION.  </P> <P> So John Elway thinks his world is closing in on him, with the Denver media  piling on his socializing habits, his Halloween candy-giving habits and his  Super Bowl-losing habits as he readies for another Roman numeral in New  Orleans.  </P> <P> Elway says he's suffocating.  </P> <P> Elway ought to talk to Len Dawson.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, Dawson was the quarterback for the 1969-70 Kansas City  Chiefs, the Denver Broncos of their era. At that point, the Chiefs had been to  one Super Bowl, lost it big, and were advised not to try it again. They were  the first wild-card team to reach a Super Bowl, upset winners over the Oakland  Raiders in the American Football League's final championship game, and they  went off as 12 1/2-point underdogs to the Purple People Eating Minnesota  Vikings in Super Bowl IV.  </P> <P> But for Dawson, that was the least of it. Five days before Armageddon, Dawson  was rousted from his sleep by pounding on his hotel door. Nightmares of Carl  Eller and Alan Page gave way to a far more frightening reality once Dawson,  blurry-eyed, swung the door open.  </P> <P> The press.  </P> <P> "Do you have a statement to make?" one reporter asked Dawson.  </P> <P> "On what?" Dawson wanted to know.  </P> <P> On what had just been broadcast on the Huntley-Brinkley Report: That a  sports-gambling investigation had turned up a Detroit suspect holding $400,000  and a slip of paper with Dawson's name on it.  </P> <P> Some wake-up call.  </P> <P> Dawson, currently a sports broadcaster in Kansas City, Mo., well remembers his  first reaction. Ever the quarterback, he called an audible, phoning Coach Hank  Stram and assembling a quick strategy session that included Chief owner Lamar  Hunt. What to do? What to tell the reporters?  </P> <P> "I told them, 'Fellas, I've just been sleeping. Why not tell the truth?' "  Dawson said. "I know the guy. He called me twice. Once when I hurt my knee and  again when my father passed away."  </P> <P> Dawson described the man as a casual acquaintance and nothing more, a claim  that would later be substantiated. But for Dawson, the next four days were the  worst of his life.  </P> <P> On the fifth, he led the Chiefs to a shocking 23-7 victory over Minnesota,  completing 12 of 17 passes and winning the game's most valuable player award.  </P> <P> But to reach such a height, Dawson first had to pass through the depths.  </P> <P> "It was hell," he says.  </P> <P> The Chiefs spent the rest of Super Bowl week plotting two game plans -- one for  the Vikings and one for the national media, who hounded Dawson to the point of  exhaustion.  </P> <P> "My name was just one of a lot of names that were supposed to be subpoenaed,"  Dawson said. "And anybody can be subpoenaed; it has nothing to do with being  innocent or guilty.  </P> <P> "But I happened to be the quarterback in the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the  writers went crazy."  </P> <P> Misdirection plays were devised.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of intrigue," Dawson says. "I changed rooms with (safety)  Johnny Robinson -- and he got no sleep. We were going out the back door,  talking with NFL security. It looked like a B movie, I guess."  </P> <P> Nothing much worked. By week's end, Robinson said his road roommate had "aged  five years. . . . You looked into his face and you knew it wasn't the face of  Len Dawson."  </P> <P> All of this was dumped into the ample lap of Stram, the coach who had been  embarrassed by Green Bay in the inaugural Super Bowl and had been pining for  vindication ever since. Stram was proudly plugging his multi-back,  multi-formation schemes as "the offense of the '70s," but on Super Sunday,  would his quarterback be too weary to run it?  </P> <P> A turning point, Stram says, occurred at the Chiefs' first workout after the  Huntley-Brinkley newscast.  </P> <P> "After the press conference, I met with the squad and explained all the details  and what was going on," Stram says. "Then I asked if there were any questions.  </P> <P> "E. J. Holub, who was one of our holler guys, stood up and said, 'Yeah, I've  got three.  </P> <P> " 'When do we eat?  </P> <P> " 'Where do we get tickets?  </P> <P> " 'And what time do we have to get up for practice?' "  </P> <P> The Chiefs broke up in laughter.  </P> <P> "I could tell then that we weren't going let this interfere with our  preparation," Stram says.  </P> <P> Dawson remembers another conversation during that week of practice, a  conversation that made him a believer.  </P> <P> Says Dawson: "Johnny Robinson came up to me and said, 'All right, I've heard  the coaches, I've read the papers, I've listened to all the BS. You tell me --  what's really going on? Can you move the ball? Can you put points on the  board?'  </P> <P> "I said, 'John, the game plan fits. I think we'll be able to score some  points.' And he says, 'Good. I've been watching films all week long. We might  shut them out.' "  </P> <P> Kansas City came close. The Chiefs led at halftime, 16-0, gave up a 69-yard  scoring drive to open the third quarter and then bottled up Viking quarterback  Joe Kapp the rest of the way.  </P> <P> A nation was stunned. A National Football League was stunned.  </P> <P> In retrospect, Stram says, they should have seen it coming.  </P> <P> "We played Minnesota in the preseason and we knew we matched up very good with  them," Stram says. "Their center, Mick Tingelhoff, was a good one, but he  weighed only 235 pounds. With our triple-stack defense and Curley Culp, who  weighed 275, lining up on the nose of the center, we knew we had a mismatch  there."  </P> <P> Minnesota made it simpler with a limited offense led by the slow-footed,  overachieving Kapp and two straight-ahead, inside runners, Dave Osborn and Bill  Brown.  </P> <P> "A vanilla offense," Stram calls it. "They were basically a two-formation team  that executed very well. That changed when they got (Fran) Tarkenton, but that  was their personality then. . . .  </P> <P> "Joe was a competitor and he made some plays on the run, but we didn't think he  could beat us outside the pocket."  </P> <P> First impressions mattered greatly in Super Bowl IV. Dawson's first pass of the  game went to halfback Mike Garrett for a first down.  </P> <P> "What am I thinking then?" Dawson says. "I'm thinking, 'All right!' " And that  first drive resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Jan Stenerud, a nice little ice  breaker.  </P> <P> "When I sent Stenerud in, Minnesota was laughing on the bench," Stram says. "It  was a misty day, the ball was heavy, but Stenerud kicked it like it had eyes.  It got the flaps down and it went through.  </P> <P> "They were stunned."  </P> <P> Stenerud kicked two more and then the Vikings fumbled a kickoff and the Chiefs  recovered on the Minnesota 19. Moments later, Kansas City had the ball on the  five, third down, and Stram was having a ball.  </P> <P> His sideline narration of Garrett's ensuing touchdown burst, captured for  posterity by NFL Films, remains an audio sports classic, right there with Tom  Lasorda's opinion of Dave Kingman's performance.  </P> <P> Some excerpts:  </P> <P> "OK, boys, 65 toss power trap, look for 65 toss power trap . . .  </P> <P> "It might pop wide open, boys. It might . . . "  </P> <P>  (Garrett scores. Much screaming by Stram follows.)  </P> <P> "Was it there, boy?  </P> <P>  "Yessir boys. Your coach drove it in there, boys."  </P> <P>  Boy, was Stram happy.  </P> <P> "It was a one-time thing," Stram says, collected again after 20 years. "We  didn't use that play in that many short-yardage situations, but because Alan  Page was so fast and reacted so quickly, we thought that if we pulled a tackle,  he'd chase the tackle to the outside.  </P> <P> "And that's exactly what happened. We didn't even have to block him. That's why  we got a little excited on the sidelines."  </P> <P> The Chiefs added a fourth-quarter touchdown when flanker Otis Taylor caught a  quick out from Dawson, slipped a tackle and high-stepped down the sideline for  46 yards.  </P> <P> It was a big victory for Stram, who moved to 1-1 in Super Bowls, and a huge  victory for the AFL, ready to merge with the NFL on even terms, but no one  cherished it more than Dawson.  </P> <P> "Afterward, I had to shudder," Dawson says. "What if I looked lousy and we got  blown out? What would've been said then?  </P> <P> "At least this turned out to have somewhat of a happy ending. Nothing ever came  out of Detroit and I have a Super Bowl ring on my finger."  </P> <P> So, can Broncos follow where Chiefs once roamed?  </P> <P> Even old champions of the underdog have to wonder.  </P> <P> "What we had, and what Denver maybe doesn't have, was a dominant defense,"  Dawson says. "Our defense was so good, it enabled us to be patient on offense.  </P> <P> "Are the Broncos strong enough to put heat on (Joe) Montana? Defensively, what  they're hearing is, 'Geez, they've got Taylor and Rice and then there's the  tight end roaming around. They've got Roger Craig.' . . . Hell, (Tom) Rathman  caught more balls than anyone. Montana throws to them all. Denver's got to put  pressure on the guy doing all this."  </P> <P> Adds Stram: "Any time you've got a quarterback like Elway, you've always got a  chance. I think Denver's much better than their last two (Super Bowl) teams.  They have much better balance, they're a bigger team, defensively they're  greatly improved and they have a definite edge in the kicking game over San  Francisco.  </P> <P> "They're closer to having it all than the last two times, but I don't think you  can win it all unless you have it all.  </P> <P> "San Francisco has it all."  </P> <P> But it can be done. That much Kansas City proved 20 years ago.  </P> <P> So let's not deflate Denver's balloon any more than it already is. It sounds as  if Elway needs all the air he can get.  </P> <P> * 49ERS: The only question remaining to be answered Sunday is if Joe Montana  and Co. are the best National Football League team ever.

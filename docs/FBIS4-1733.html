			<p>BFN     [Text] The Australian foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has  told China's leaders his country strongly objects to the  detention, in the south of the country, of an Australian  citizen, James Peng, who has been jailed for more than five  months. The Chinese born Australian, James Peng, is involved in  a business dispute with the local authorities in the southern  Chinese city of Shenzen but he's still not been charged with any  offense and has been denied any contact with his family. In  talks with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li  Peng in Beijing, Senator Evans said there were serious grounds  for concern over James Peng's detention.    [Begin Evans recording, in progress] ... I made it every  clear that whatever the legitimacy might be that China taking,  probably formulated criminal action against him [words  indistinct] some matter proceeding to late charges and trial  [words indistinct] Australia could have no objection to that  process being followed; we certainly had a strong objection to  Australian citizens, or anyone else for that matter, being  detained without due process in this way.

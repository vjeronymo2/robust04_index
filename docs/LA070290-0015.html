			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> NEAL STULBERG CONDUCTS BAROQUE ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> The program for the Friday-night event at the now-concluded third E. Nakamichi  Baroque Music Festival promised "Music for the Coronations," but, even before  the agenda was changed, that title was stretching it.  </P> <P> "Baroque Mozart," the theme of this year's festival -- the gatherings of 1986  and 1988 focused on appropriately contrasting motifs -- was to have been  highlighted in performances of the "Coronation" Concerto and the "Missa  Solemnis" in C, K. 337.  </P> <P> At the Royce Hall concert, K. 337 was given, though, of course it is not the  "Coronation" Mass, as some may have been led to believe. That designation  belongs to the composer's work numbered K. 317.  </P> <P> And, in the event, the "Coronation" Concerto was replaced by the Piano Concerto  in G, K. 453 "at the request of Malcolm Bilson," the fortepiano soloist,  according to an insert in the program.  </P> <P> With or without the crowning pieces, this performance by Philharmonia Baroque  Orchestra, led by Neal Stulberg, turned out festive, stylish and felicitously  pristine.  </P> <P> All the performers -- conductor Stulberg, the accomplished Bay Area  instrumental ensemble, the Southern California-based vocal group I Cantori and  all soloists -- seemed to eschew overstatement in favor of modest savoring of  the imposing musical values in this agenda.  </P> <P> Bilson made a virtue of articulate but unpushy tempos, myriad stylistic details  and a directness of statement that never contradicted the seraphic nature of  the familiar work at hand.  </P> <P> Stulberg and the orchestra brought irresistible grace and subtle resonances to  the opening German Dances, K. 509. Assisted by I Cantori, they found Mozartean  sobriety in the ear-opening deeps of the scarey Kyrie in D minor.  </P> <P> Then, in the brief but pithy "Missa Solemnis," all forces -- with vocal  soloists Judith Nelson, Lisa Turetsky, Frank Kelley and Douglas Lawrence --  produced as serious and faceted a reading of this largely unfamiliar  masterpiece as it deserves.

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Argentaria net profits up 12% to Pta75bn Argentaria, the partially-privatised Spanish state banking corporation, raised its 1993 consolidated net profits by 12 per cent to Pta75.4bn (Dollars 538m) due to strongly increased fee income during last year's currency turmoil and strict cost control. The gain was ahead of that of other successful domestic banks and reflected Argentaria's lowered exposure to falling interest rates, which have squeezed margins among its rivals. With only 38 per cent of its liabilities in deposits, against a domestic sector average of 65 per cent, Argentaria obtains most of its funds from the market and its balance sheet is less affected by lending conditions. The banking group's net interest revenue increased by a more modest 5.8 per cent to Pta256bn, in line with that of the more profitable Spanish banks. It raised its commission income by 17 per cent to Pta54bn, reduced its operating expenses by 0.5 per cent to Pta166bn and lifted its operating profit by 18.9 per cent to Pta144bn. Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD), Portugal's state-owned savings bank and largest financial institution, registered a 6 per cent increase in net profits in 1993 to Es41.3bn (Dollars 236m). Net assets grew 18 per cent to Es4,373bn, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.</p>

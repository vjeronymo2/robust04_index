			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Fewer nukes BY THE standards of the Cold war, Tuesday's Russo-American agreement to cut nuclear arsenals to fewer than 3,500 warheads apiece would be a truly amazing item of good news. Even today it is good news, but those standards no longer apply. Indeed, one of its salutary effects may be to remind world public opinion that both superpowers still possess very large stocks of nuclear weapons, which would take them well over a decade to destroy. Few people in the west any longer see Russian nuclear weapons as the instrument of a hostile power's quest for world domination. Therefore, western preoccupations are less concerned with the quantitative destructive potential of Russia's nuclear strike force than with the degree to which it is under effective political control and physically secure. The west has eagerly, almost indecently, hastened to recognise Russia as the sole legal successor of the defunct Soviet Union, mainly out of anxiety to avoid the multiplication of nuclear powers by a process of vegetative reproduction. The fiction that the former Soviet strategic forces devolved not to Russia as such but to the Commonwealth of Independent States has now been abandoned. But the precise relationship between the Russian state and those elements of the ex-Soviet armed forces - both conventional and nuclear - which remain in being outside Russian territory remains unclear. The difficulties involved in 'repatriating' both troops and weapons to Russian soil, in demobilising the former and in decommissioning the latter, are at once economic, technical and political. The implementation of arms control agreements - notably CFE and Start - signed by the Soviet Union but not yet ratified by its successor states, is problematic, and dependent even in the best of cases on western help. Mr Vadim Osinin, an arms control expert attached to the Russian parliamentary defence committee, spoke yesterday of 'difficulties with implementing the Start treaty obligations, which will go on until 1999'; and said that implementation of the new agreement could not begin until that of Start was complete. In those circumstances it is probably best to regard this agreement as at once an earnest of Mr Boris Yeltsin's goodwill (conditioned, in part at least, by his desperate need for western economic aid), and as a test of his control over the ex-Soviet armed forces. It will not be fully implemented until the year 2003, or at best 2000. But it is a very important measure of nuclear disarmament by the two largest nuclear powers, in accordance with the letter and the spirit of Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. As such it should facilitate the extension of that treaty in 1995. At the same time it brings the US and Russian arsenals down to a level where they can reasonably require that the next round of disarmament talks should involve the other nuclear powers as well.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BE MOST WARY OF NATURE'S OWN PESTICIDES  </P> <P> The bad news is that our plant foods contain carcinogens. Carrots, comfrey tea,  celery, parsley, parsnips, mushrooms, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, mustard,  basil, fennel, orange and grapefruit juices, pepper, cauliflower, broccoli,  raspberry and pineapple contain natural pesticides that cause cancer in rats or  mice and that are present at levels ranging from 70 ppb (parts per billion) to  4,000,000 ppb -- levels that are enormously higher than the amounts of man-made  pesticide residues in plant foods.  </P> <P> All plants produce their own natural pesticides to protect themselves against  fungi, insects and predators such as man. Tens of thousands of these natural  pesticides have been discovered, and every species of plant contains its own  set of toxins, usually a few dozen. When plants are stressed or damaged, such  as during a pest attack, they increase their natural pesticide levels many  fold, occasionally to levels that are acutely toxic to humans.  </P> <P> Only a tiny percentage of these natural pesticides has been tested in animal  cancer tests, but of those that have been tested, the percentage that turns out  to be carcinogenic is about as high as for man-made pesticides (about 30%). The  same appears to be true for natural teratogens (agents that cause birth  defects). It is highly probable that almost every plant product in the  supermarket contains natural carcinogens and teratogens.  </P> <P> The pesticides that we are eating are 99.99% all natural (we eat 10,000 times  more natural than man-made pesticides). Most natural pesticides, like man-made  pesticides, are relatively new to the modern diet, because most of our plant  foods were brought to Europe within the last 500 years from the Americas,  Africa and Asia (and vice versa).  </P> <P> In response to the environmentalist campaign about tiny traces of man-made  pesticides, plant breeders are active in developing varieties that are  naturally pest resistant. However, the primary way plant breeders are able to  increase natural resistance to pests is to breed plants with increased levels  of natural pesticides. It should be no surprise, then, that a newly introduced  variety of insect-resistant potato had to be withdrawn from the market, due to  acute toxicity to humans caused by much higher levels of the teratogens  solanine and chaconine than are normally present in potatoes. Similarly, a new  variety of insect-resistant celery recently introduced in the United States had  to be withdrawn after it caused widespread outbreaks of dermatitis due to a  concentration of carcinogens at 9,000 ppb rather than the usual 900 ppb.  </P> <P> Many more such cases are likely to crop up -- they are undetected as yet due to  lack of immediate observable effects -- because there is a fundamental  trade-off between nature's pesticides and man-made pesticides.  </P> <P> The good news is that it now appears from much recent work on the mechanisms of  carcinogenesis that the risk of cancer is negligible from carcinogens at levels  far below the maximum tolerated dose given to rats and mice in cancer trials. I  am not even very concerned about the cancer risk from allyl isothiocyanate, a  natural carcinogen present in cabbage at 40,000 ppb and in brown mustard at  900,000 ppb, because I, along with most other leading scientists, am very  skeptical about all of these worst-case, low-dose extrapolations from high-dose  animal tests.  </P> <P> What must be emphasized is that "the dose makes the poison." For example,  consuming five alcoholic drinks per day is clearly a risk factor in humans for  cancer, and in pregnant women for giving birth to mentally retarded babies.  However, there is no convincing evidence as yet that consuming one alcoholic  drink per day is dangerous. As another example, sunlight can cause cancer, but  the evidence suggests that the carcinogenic danger is from repeated sunburns.  In fact, ultraviolet light at low doses induces a tan, which protects against  the burning of skin by ultraviolet light.  </P> <P> My own estimate for the number of cases of cancer or birth defects caused by  man-made pesticide residues in food or water pollution -- usually at levels  hundreds of thousands or millions of times below that given to rats or mice --  is close to zero.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are  doing an adequate job of protecting our food supply from carcinogenic  contaminants and are much more credible than the activists lawyers with the  Natural Resources Defense Council who spend their time wooing the media with  scientifically unfounded claims about the dangers of pesticides, but who have  never assembled a knowledgeable board of scientific advisers. The cost to the  American public from such misplaced efforts is enormous, both in terms of a  very large hidden tax on our economy and in terms of lives lost by diverting  our resources from real public-health problems.  </P> <P> In order to minimize cancer and the other degenerative diseases of aging (which  are associated with our constantly increasing life expectancy), we need the  knowledge that will come from further basic scientific research. Yet we are  spending $70 billion per year on pollution because of wildly exaggerated fears  and only $9 billion per year on all of our basic scientific research.  </P></p>

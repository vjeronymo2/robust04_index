			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER LOVE'S IMAGE  </P> <P> In her Sept. 3 letter on "Hot Radio" (Aug. 20), Claudia Anderson criticizes KFI  talk-show personality Mother Love and urges that Calendar instead "focus on  someone who provides (women) with a positive image."  </P> <P> In recent weeks Mother Love has called for increased tolerance and respect for  the gay population; appealed to rap singers to tone down profanity and use  their music to positively influence youths; urged full-figured people to have  more self-esteem and others to respect them more.  </P> <P> Could it be that Anderson has trouble transcending Mother Love's race or her  full figure?  </P> <P> ALVA MOORE-STEVENSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

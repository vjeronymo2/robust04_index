			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By So Kyo] </F>   [Text] Following the North Korean delegate's absurd threat  on the weekend of 19 March that "Seoul will become a sea of fire  if a war breaks out," the North Korean Army began inciteful  broadcasts through loudspeakers in the DMZ saying that "South  Korean armed forces, point your guns backward [kokkuro]."  Meetings are being one after another at the Chongwadae  [presidential office] and the White House daily. Foreign and  domestic news reports sound like a war would break out any time.    Surprisingly, however, citizens' responses are rather  apathetic. With the 9.85-point drop in the composite index when  the stock market opened at 9:40 AM [0040 GMT, 21 March], people  said: "So people are shaken as expected." However, the  predictions of employees at security companies were off the mark  as stock prices rose shortly thereafter. Consequently, the  stock market yesterday ended with the usual range of  fluctuation. The so-called "North- related items," that should  have obviously plunged if "Seoul is to become a sea of fire,"  showed no particular changes.    The same applied to travel agencies who are used to being  swamped by heightened airline ticket sales and visa inquiries  whenever North-South relations have gone awry in the past.  Saying that "nothing has changed," Na Yong-sok, 39-year-old  sales manager for Global Tours, said "I would rather have our  business suffer than receive such telephone inquiries in the  future." There has not been much shopping in bulk either.  Chong Yong-kil, 37-year-old president of the Kwangmyong Ha-an  branch of Nongsimga [a supermarket chain], said, "It seems like  citizens don't see much likelihood of war as they haven't been  buying in bulk."    The college scene is also quiet. Why are the citizens so  unperturbed? Yi Hyok-chu, chief of the marketing department of  Lucky Securities Co., assesses that, "It seems that people have  developed their own sense of the international situation from  the prolonged negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue and  that they are well aware of North Korea's situation." A member  of Seoul National University's General Student Council  commented, "The `Seoul sea of fire theory' is merely North  Korea's gesture to secure an advantageous position in nuclear  negotiations."    Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense views this  phenomenon from two contradictory positions -- that "it reflects  a maturity in people's views," and that "it reflects that people  have become desensitized to the security issue."</p>

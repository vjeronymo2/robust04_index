This amendment also requires the eventual replacement of certain MLG wheels with other wheels, as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted by in-service experience that indicates the possibility of fatigue cracking occurring in the subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the brake side half hub due to fatigue cracking, which could lead to separation of the MLG wheel and tire from the axle. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Dunlop Limited, Aviation Division, Silverton House, Vincent Square, London SW1P 2PL, United Kingdom.

That action proposed to require repetitive eddy current inspections to detect cracking in the bearing housing of the brake side half hub of Dunlop MLG wheels, part number AHA1752 Pre Mod 6. Additionally, that action proposed to require that, if any cracked half hub assemblies are detected, the complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheel must be replaced. If certain improved replacement wheels are installed, the repetitive eddy current inspections may be discontinued. That action also proposed to require the eventual replacement of all MLG wheels having part number AHA1752 Pre Mod 6 with other (improved) wheels, as terminating action for the repetitive inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter supports the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 16 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,760, or $110 per airplane, per inspection. Should a cracked half hub assembly be found, replacement wheel assemblies will be provided by Dunlop at no charge to the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required wheel replacement action will require approximately 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Replacement parts will be provided by Dunlop at no charge to the operators, as part of Dunlop's repair/replacement program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the replacement actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,760, or $110 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

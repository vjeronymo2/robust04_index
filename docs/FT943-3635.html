			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech shares up 5% despite deeper losses British Biotech shares defied a falling pharmaceuticals sector yesterday and jumped 5 per cent to 490p in spite of the company's announcement of deeper losses in the first quarter. The market ignored the 34 per cent rise in net losses to Pounds 5.6m and chose to focus instead on British Biotech's upbeat comments on the progress of its cancer and pancreatitis drug trials. Dr Brian Richards, chairman, said the year had started well for the group. 'The successful completion of the Pounds 46m rights issue. . . together with the encouraging results of our trials means we are now planning the final stages of development for our leading drugs,' he said. The comments were interpreted by the market as 'further confirmation that things are on track,' said one analyst. The losses were also an improvement on the performance in the final quarter of last year, when British Biotech reported a deficit of Pounds 8m. Turnover fell by 64 per cent to Pounds 767,000 due to the sale last year of British Biotechnology Products. Sales of continuing operations rose by 64 per cent. The company has set up a new subsidiary, Neures, to investigate neuro-degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The loss per share deepened from 10.7p to 11.9p. There was no dividend.</p>

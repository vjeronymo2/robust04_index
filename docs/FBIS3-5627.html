Hosokawa, replying to questions from Hiroshi Tachiki of the  Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in the House of Councillors  plenary session, said the government "will wait and see how the  investigation develops."    Nakamura, 44, who bolted from the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday, is suspected of taking a 10  million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992, investigative  sources said.    On Tuesday, prosecutors asked Tokyo district court to issue  an arrest warrant for him. The court submitted a document to  the cabinet asking for Diet permission to lift parliamentary  immunity on Nakamura from arrest. The cabinet in turn passed it  to the House of Representatives, to which Nakamura belongs.    The Diet is currently in the middle of a 150-day regular  session due to end in June.</p>

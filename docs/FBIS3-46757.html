			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Stepping Back"] </F>   [Text] The initial concern that the gate of openness would  be shut temporarily following President Suharto's stern warning  the other day that certain elements in society have used  communist techniques in forwarding their demands now seems to be  groundless. The Armed Forces (ABRI) spokesman, Brigadier General  Syarwan Hamid assured in a written announcement yesterday that  ABRI will stick to its commitment to continue to uphold the  policy of openness.    "There is no reason to step back. If openness recedes, it  means that ABRI's dual function is failing," Syarwan Hamid said.  He explained that the wave of criticism and demands surging as  of late was a logical consequence of the policy of openness. In  general, he said, the aspirations expressed are tolerable since  they have come from a sincere wish to improve the situation.    However, he pointed out that there is a small group of  people  using methods inappropriate to our political culture, which  focus on highly sensitive issues. In such cases, Syarwan said,  ABRI will not tolerate their actions. "We know them well enough  since it is always a group comprising the same people," he said.    Syarwan appealed to the public not to force ABRI to use  repressive means. "There is a limit to everything, and at a  certain point ABRI cannot turn back."    Therefore, he suggested that all parties apply wisdom and  conscience in restraining themselves. "But on the whole, ABRI  is committed to not stepping back from the openness policy. We  are also prepared for any consequences of the policy. We are  also committed to our role of tut wuri handayani (following  while providing guidance)," he said.    In summing up, Syarwan Hamid's statement feels like a fresh  breeze -- the kind of relief one might wish for at a desperate  moment. From the statement, one not only derives the desired  assurance, but feels that the words contain wisdom and sincerity  as well.    Many of us may remember how a few weeks ago, a statement  from  Major General Sembiring Meliala caused an uproar when he hinted  that ABRI was not happy at taking a back seat role -- tut wuri  handayani -- which results from new directives outlined by  President Suharto several months ago. Sembiring later explained  that his statement was misunderstood. However that may be, many  people continued to believe that somehow it reflected the  majority feeling in ABRI.    Now, with his statement, Syarwan Hamid has indirectly  assured  the public that this view is untrue.    Frankly speaking, there is nothing wrong with ABRI's new  role. From any possible point of view, ABRI will remain the  backbone of our national stability. In the context of its dual  function, apparently the time has come for ABRI to switch its  role from that of a stabilizing agent to that of a dynamizing  one. And to dynamize the country and the nation, ABRI is to  stay at the back and from that position help to push forward the  nation's democratization process. And openness is an inherent  part of that process.    Thus, we heartily welcome Syarwan Hamid's statement. But we  must also underline his point that all of us should exercise  wisdom and restraint at all times. We have come this far and we  surely do not want to go back into the black hole we were in  before. Ahead of us we can see a shining bright future. And  only if we join hands can we be sure to reach it.    As for the "small group" of people Syarwan referred to, such  groups can be found in any society. We should deal with them  wisely since, after all, they are a part of us and in a way  those "angry young men" may serve as vanguards of our  conscience. And in this mad, mad world, maintaining and  protecting our integrity and our conscience is perhaps the most  difficult task of all.</p>

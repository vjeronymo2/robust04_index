			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group The run up in Mirror Group's shares over the past year is good news for the administrators, but raises the question of how much value is left for those who are lining up for the book-building exercise. There will be no dividend until 1994, and even then any payout is likely to be modest. At the same time, the current share price of 178p offers buyers only a small discount to the market's rating. Given the risks, a lower rating may be required to shift such a large stake. Most worrying is the thought that the genial bonhomie of the chancellor masks a preparedness to slap VAT on newspapers. He has, after all, taken on lobbies such as doctors, teachers and the police in the past. That would give another twist to the screw currently being applied by News International's cover price cut. So far, the Mirror's circulation has not been damaged, though given its heavy dependence on circulation revenue it can neither afford to match the effort nor allow a long term gap to open. Perhaps potential investors should ponder the fact that no buyer has been prepared to pay for control of this singular media product at anything like the current share price.</p>

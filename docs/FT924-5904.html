			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Varity posts modest profit in third period A STRONG improvement in automotive parts sales helped Varity, the industrial and farm equipment maker, post a modest third-quarter profit. Kelsey-Hayes, Varity's automotive components subsidiary, reported a 23 per cent improvement in operating earnings and a 7 per cent rise in sales. The improvement was due to relatively strong demand for light trucks in North America, where K-H has a high share of the market for wheels and anti-lock braking systems. Varity, which is based in Buffalo, New York, posted net earnings of USDollars 10.5m, or 23 cents a share, in the three months to Oct 31, compared with a Dollars 17.8m loss, or 91 cents, a year earlier. The latest figures include a foreign exchange loss of Dollars 6.4m, following a Dollars 2.3m gain a year earlier. Sales climbed to Dollars 844m from Dollars 759m. The bulk of the increase came from a one-third rise in sales at Perkins, the diesel-engine maker, where business was hit by a four-week strike in the third quarter of 1991. Perkins turned a 1991 operating loss of Dollars 6m into a profit of Dollars 7m for the latest quarter. In spite of the decline of the world farm machinery market, Massey Ferguson recovered to a Dollars 7m profit from a Dollars 7m loss on a 6.4 per cent rise in sales. Varity's long-term debt dipped to Dollars 795.6m on October 31 from Dollars 864.2m.</p>

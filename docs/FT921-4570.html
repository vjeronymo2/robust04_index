			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Philips offers to buy remainder of Super Club PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has offered to buy out minority shareholders in Super Club, the troubled Belgian-based chain of video rental shops, in return for their support of a 'drastic' financial restructuring of the loss-making company. If the deal goes ahead, Philips said it would pay cash or issue new shares of its own to take over the 49 per cent stake in Super Club which it does not yet control. Philips, which has repeatedly come to Super Club's rescue since 1990, will soon call a special meeting of Super Club's bankers and bondholders to discuss the restructuring of a BFr2.5bn (Dollars 73.5m) bond issue and other loans. 'It is essential that the banks as well as the bondholders agree that they should make financial sacrifices,' Super Club said. In return for these unspecified sacrifices, Philips would guarantee all the Belgian company's bonds and loans. Philips will also agree to buy out minority shareholders, based on a valuation to be performed by an independent bank. Philips has already pumped some Fl 400m (Dollars 215m) into Super Club, representing one of the only investments it has made since running into difficulties of its own in 1990. Minority shareholders intend to press Philips to value Super Club at around BFr2,000 a share, the price prevailing in March 1991 when Philips assumed majority control. Although Philips is expected to resist these demands, it is likely to pay well over Fl 200m to remaining shareholders. The proposals, which mark a further deepening of Philips' involvement in the ailing Belgian venture, follow news that Super Club posted a loss of BFr4.3bn in the first nine months of its 1991 financial year, due mainly to high financing costs. In the previous financial year, which covered 14 months, Super Club made a loss of BFr14.7bn. Super Club said its results would continue to come under pressure from the high cost of its indebtedness.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL IN BRIEF: NORCO;  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS GAIN CONTROL OF BLAZE  </P> <P> A fire that raged through 900 acres of brush, grass and trees and torched two  hay shelters was wrestled under control by firefighters who surrounded it  Sunday afternoon, authorities said. The blaze, which broke out Saturday  afternoon, was believed caused by children, possibly playing with matches, said  California Department of Forestry-Riverside County Fire Department dispatcher  Jeff Lloyd. He said an investigation into the fire's cause was continuing.  About 225 firefighters from Orange and Riverside counties, the cities of Corona  and Norco, and the state departments of Forestry and Corrections battled the  blaze at its height, Lloyd said. No one was injured. The fire, declared  contained at 2 p.m. Sunday, burned mostly along the Santa Ana River bottom,  where it crackled through bamboo, brush, trees and thick grass. Although the  damp river bottom provided some aid in slowing the fire's advance, the steep,  slippery terrain also made it difficult for firefighters to get close to the  blaze, Lloyd said.  </P></p>

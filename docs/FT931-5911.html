			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Doubt cast on Bonn's plan for company tax reform PLANS by the German government to overhaul company taxation, to make Germany more competitive, could have the opposite effect, leading economists and tax experts warned yesterday. Far from encouraging investors to come to the country, it was likely to act as a disincentive, because of sharp cuts proposed in depreciation allowances, they told a parliamentary inquiry in Bonn. In addition, the new law could contradict the German constitution, by discriminating between income tax payers. Indeed, rather than have an inadequate tax reform, which is supposed to have no net effect on the government's tax income, the experts suggest that it would be better to have no reform at all. The embarrassing evidence for the German government, and for Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, in particular, was presented at a public hearing of the finance committee of the German Bundestag. The key element in the plan for a new law on corporate taxation, intended specifically to improve the competitiveness of Germany as an investment location - the so-called Standortsicherungsgesetz - is a substantial reduction in the marginal rate of corporate taxation from more than 50 per cent to 44 per cent. Private companies which pay income tax would see the rate come down from 53 to 44 per cent, and public companies paying corporation tax would also be liable for a marginal rate of 44 per cent, instead of the present 50 per cent. However, the plan is intended to have no net effect on the government's tax revenues - given the current acute budget squeeze to finance spending in east Germany - and the reduction in overall tax rates is to be financed by abolition of depreciation and other allowances. In a report on the tax reforms published to coincide with the hearing, the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) said that 'on balance, it will be precisely those companies intending to invest who will be penalised by the tax changes. 'For them the advantages offered by the planned reduction in basic tax rates will frequently be outweighed by the disadvantages resulting from the worsening of depreciation allowances.' A series of leading experts in the field of company taxation backed the argument of the DIW. Professor Joachim Lang, of the Institute for Taxation Law at the University of Cologne, said that 'to attempt to improve competitiveness in a way which does not reduce tax revenues is as impossible as trying to square a circle'. He suggested that, in particular, foreign investors would be discouraged by the reforms which would if anything make German tax law more, not less, complicated. DIW calculates that particularly in capital intensive industries, like engineering and the chemical industry, the effect would be negative, while labour-intensive industries like textiles would benefit. That was scarcely the intention of the tax reform.</p>

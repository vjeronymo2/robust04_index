			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Books: In from the cold - Fiction THE NIGHT MANAGER by John le Carre Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 443 pages THE masterpiece of John le Carre, as we can now see, was what his publishers today call The Quest For Karla trilogy - the sequence of three long novels, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People - in which the British intelligence chief Smiley confronts and eventually outmanoeuvres his opposite number, his 'shadow', his semblable, his frere, the Soviet spymaster Karla. At the end, at the moment of Smiley's victory, they meet, unspeaking, at the Berlin Wall in a moment of profound truth: 'This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine,' as Prospero puts it in The Tempest. Le Carre was our finest novelist of the Cold War. His new novel triumphantly breaks free of that genre and discovers a new world, a new subject - and he has not lost his gift for the topical. The Night Manager is about British arms exports to the Third World, Whitehall's complicity in that trade, a giant scam by an English tycoon to swap arms for Latin American drugs with the co-operation of 'a caucus of bent bankers, brokers and middlemen and corrupt intelligence officers on both sides of the Atlantic.' As so often in Le Carre's world, the protagonist - the hero - is an innocent: a brave and lonely individual in danger of a tragic end, who is inspired by his own decency and the love of a not-particularly-good woman to fight against colleagues and employers, fellow spies and his own political and civil service masters. Jonathan Pine, the night manager, has retreated from army service in Ireland to the safety of the posh hotel trade. He is rescued by a love affair in Egypt with a woman he loved, betrayed, killed, and through whom he discovers Roper, the businessman who is 'the worst man in the world'. Roper is a great charmer who takes a robust and historical view of arms dealing: he is happy to compare himself with Britain's 19th-century China traders - 'Opium for tea. Barter. Came home to England, captains of industry. Knighthood, honours, whole shebang. Hell's the difference? Go for it] - that's all that matters. Americans know that. Why don't we? Tight-arsed vicars braying from the pulpit every Sunday, old nellies' tea-parties, seedcake, poor Mrs So-and-So died of the whatnots? Screw it. Worse than bloody prison . . .' (It will be seen that Le Carre's extraordinary gift for mimicry has never been so fully indulged and developed. His dialogue is a never-ending delight.) The night manager is recruited by a minor branch of British intelligence to penetrate Roper's organisation. His deep cover is meticulously and successfully developed to the point where he is trusted by Roper as front man for his big arms deal with the Columbian drugs cartel. He falls in love with Roper's woman. He is betrayed by his own side, caught up in the Whitehall-Washington power struggle between 'Pure Intelligence' and 'Enforcement'. Le Carre's moral has not changed: 'The enemy's not out there. He's here among us . . . We are honourable people, he thought . . . Honourable people with self-irony and a sense of decency, people with a street spirit, and a good heart. What the hell's gone wrong with us?' This is wonderful stuff, subtle, exciting, complicated (almost too much so, it is very complicated), vivid in its successive pictures of Switzerland, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America - and of course, SW1. Who else could introduce a sub-section like this?: 'Eight men and Goodhew sat at the long refectory table: a Foreign Office mandarin, a baron from Treasury, the Cabinet Office solicitor, two squat-suited earthlings from the Tory middle benches and three espiocrats of whom Darker was the grandest and poor Harry Palfrey the most derelict . . . ' Note that Palfrey was the narrator of The Russia House. He here comes to a suicide's end. But there have to be various caveats. The first is that we are given 'Jeds', the usual Le Carre cosmopolitan half-whore, whose qualities (cf. the girl in The Honourable Schoolboy) do not convincingly sustain their burden in the plot. 'She had a jewelled brilliance and a kind of dressed nakedness.' Oh dear. I'm sure she's wonderful as well. Much more seriously, Le Carre's Whitehall this time is near-impossibly opaque and confusing, which can only be because he does not allow himself to develop and characterise his warring factions. We are given Burr, Goodhew, Rooke and the wicked Darker - but they never begin to achieve the memorable lineaments of Smiley, Guillam, Hayden, Alleline, etc. in the earlier books. Even on a second reading these espiocrats blur into each other, which is a dangerous failing in view of the fact that the heart of the plot turns out to be double-dealing in Whitehall. We thereby lose, at the end, some of the story's psychological depth and conviction: and that, ever since The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, is why we have been reading Le Carre all these years, and shall continue to look forward to his next.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Management: Uniting against the rest of the world - The restructuring of German industry A distinct chill has crept into many of Germany's boardrooms recently. The domestic boom, caused by unification, which shielded German industry from recession abroad, is coming to an end. More seriously, foreign competition is increasing, not just from Japan but also from the rest of western Europe where production costs are lower. Companies throughout Germany have begun taking drastic action to shave costs and strengthen their product ranges. According to a poll by Munich's Ifo research institute, most German companies are less satisfied with conditions at home than they were three years ago, blaming high costs and taxes, short working weeks, and tough environmental rules. More than half have taken action, such as cutting their German labour force or shifting output abroad. Ominously, Ifo said the EC internal market and the opening up of eastern Europe would intensify competition, not just between companies but also between locations. Adding to industrialists' concern is the current wage round, with claims approaching 10 per cent. 'In the past, we've been too generous with wage increases,' says Achim Diekmann, managing director of the motor industry association (VDA). German productivity is high, but European competitors are catching up. Moreover, foreign labour costs are much lower; in the UK they are 60 per cent of Germany's, in France 59 per cent, and in Japan 76 per cent. Two companies whose actions show how German industry is facing up to the stiff challenges are Kugelfischer, the bearings maker, and Degussa, the precious metals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals group. Both have experienced steep falls in demand and are heavily dependent on non-German markets. They also have strong ties to the motor industry, but their problems go beyond just one sector. KUGELFISCHER Based in the German bearings capital of Schweinfurt in northern Bavaria, the company has moved decisively to combat a slump in demand and disappearing profits. Net income dropped by 42 per cent in 1990 to DM52m (Pounds 18m). Last year, the company, which derives 60 per cent of its turnover from abroad, made a loss of some DM80m. It has cut its workforce and is striving to lower its fixed costs so that it can avoid losses when operating, as now, at around 80 per cent of capacity. Around a quarter of its west German workforce of 18,000 is on short-time working. Order books contain enough work for less than six months, compared with nearly eight months a year ago. Further high wage settlements will make matters worse. 'We can't afford settlements anywhere near last year's 7 per cent,' says Wolfgang Masuch, commercial director. 'This will simply increase pressures on companies to rationalise their domestic operations.' Rationalisation is a polite word for cuts and closures. Kugelfischer has not shut any west German plants, but it has hacked back its labour force. Last year, it shed 5,600 employees. This included 3,400 at its new east German bearings subsidiary where the job losses needed to improve efficiency were increased after demand collapsed in eastern Europe. In west Germany, most cuts were effected through early retirement and by not replacing those leaving; there were fewer than 100 redundancies. Subsequent losses will be more painful, and will involve up to 800 redundancies. Kugelfischer is not only wielding the axe, however. It is also trying to make its activities less dominated by bearings, which account for some 75 per cent of its DM4bn turnover. This would balance its dependence on industries like vehicles and engineering, though the textile sector - to which it sells industrial sewing machines - is hardly buoyant either at present. At the same time, it is upgrading production to make more sophisticated products. 'We want to supply whole systems, not just components,' Masuch explains. Thus, Kugelfischer's car hub units include flanges to help lubrication and assembly; it also makes a wheel bearing unit with sensors to monitor speed for anti-skid brakes. On the non-bearing side, its sewing technology has been expanded with a hydro-cutter using a razor-thin water jet at twice the speed of sound to slice through materials such as plastics and printed circuit boards, as well as textiles. DEGUSSA With its grandly named Degussa 2000 strategy, the Frankfurt-based company began trying to reshape itself in 1989. Gert Becker, the chief executive, says this process has been speeded up as a result of its declining performance, with net income down last year by 33 per cent to DM99m. 'It's an advantage that we can now say to the workforce: 'We've got to do this now'.' Thus the company has also trimmed its labour force - by 2,200 people last year to 33,000. A further 1,000 will go by autumn, 1993, possibly a third or more through redundancies. For the first time, it is investing more abroad than at home as it builds up specialty chemicals production mainly in the US, but also in Brazil, India, Taiwan, and Belgium. Degussa's wide product range includes materials for tyres and catalytic converters, for animal feeds, and for environmental applications like phosphate-free detergents. Around 70 per cent of its DM13bn turnover comes from abroad. It plans to float a minority stake of its expanding pharmaceutical subsidiary, Asta Medica, on the stock exchange to raise funds, the first time it has taken such a step. Degussa is struggling to stem losses at Leybold, its vacuum technology unit for which it is seeking a partner to develop products for the electronics industry. With the aid of McKinsey, the management consultants, Degussa has worked out a programme to reduce central administrative and research staff and push these functions out to the operating units; this will account for most of the coming job losses. Central overheads will thus be cut by about 25 per cent and research costs will be more related to divisional needs. 'We've got to reduce the core of Degussa and spread the group out more horizontally,' Becker says. Examples like these abound in German industry. Kolbenschmidt, the vehicle parts maker, plans to shift more piston output to France and Brazil. Mercedes-Benz wants to cut car production jobs and buy more parts from cheaper foreign sources like the UK. MAN Roland, the printing machinery maker, is cutting its workforce by 750 people after a shrinkage in orders, although it declined to discuss this while it was talking to the unions. These companies know that when the world economy does finally pick up, their competitors will still be breathing hard down their necks. Thus the rest of the 1990s is likely to prove strenuous for managers and workers alike as German businesses endeavour to avoid being overtaken by their foreign rivals.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           GERMAN COMPANIES' REACTIONS TO TRENDS AT HOME  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (% of those polled)                          Capital     Consumer                                 All manuf.    goods        goods Measures                         industry     sector       sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Job cuts in        Implemented       27         34           22 Germany            Planned            8         13            5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Production         Implemented       20         35           16 shifts abroad      Planned            8         10            9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- No home expansion, Implemented        9         19            5 but growth abroad  Planned            6          9            7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- More processing    Implemented       12         21           10 done abroad        Planned            5          9            5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- No measures taken                    45         40           43 or planned  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ifo institute, Munich. 500 companies polled.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

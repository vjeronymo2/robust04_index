The Swiss Foreign Ministry in Berne said no agenda had yet  been set for the talks between Mr. 'Arafat and the Swiss  president, Otto Stich, as well as the foreign minister, Flavio  Cotti.    However, one ministry spokesman said Switzerland's  invitation  to the PLO to open an office in Bern would be discussed.  Correspondents say his visit is likely to coincide with the  annual world economic forum which begins in Davos on 27 January.</p>

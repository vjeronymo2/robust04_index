			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / People: Williams wooed back to Mosaic David Williams, who quit Mosaic Investments in 1991 after a policy disagreement, has been wooed back by the management of the one-time high-flying mini-conglomerate to take up the post of executive chairman. 'The group is made up of entrepreneurs looking to build their businesses within a quoted vehicle. One of the problems has been a succession of chairmen, none of whom really knew how to handle them all,' says Williams. Not very long after the previous chairman Andrew Davison had been appointed  -in September of last year - Williams says he received a 'grand deputation' from the management asking him to come back. 'I hate seeing things I have been associated with go wrong.' Davison is to stay on as a non-executive director. Aside from the group's best known activity - character licensing for the likes of Tom and Jerry and Thunderbird and once the Ninja Turtles - Mosaic's other products range from spirit measures to coat-hangers to the creases in restaurant menus. After Williams, the acquisitions expert, left the company Mosaic ran into serious financial trouble and substantially restructured. The share price stood at 280p when he left; since then it has been suspended and relisted, and yesterday it closed up 6p at 27p. Only one, non-executive, member is left from the board with which Williams fell out. Williams, 41, in turn had been running printing ink specialist Usher-Walker, which he turned round and sold to Sun Chemical of America in the autumn of 1992. Since then, he says, he has kept his hand in in the City, 'doing flotations and MBOs and the like'. He hopes that some of the still private companies in which he has got involved might be candidates for the Mosaic stable at some stage. He also now reckons he has a good base from which to build. 'The company is viewed as a rag-bag and a mess but it is debt-free. The strategy is to find out the state of everything and then if necessary rejig all the pieces to get some focus.' Tomkins boss Greg Hutchings, who with Williams was one of the founders, left the board in October 1992, but still retains a stake of just over 4 per cent.</p>

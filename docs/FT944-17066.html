			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Lucas shares climb despite Pounds 214m restructuring costs Extensive restructuring by Lucas Industries is to cost the UK automotive and aerospace components group a total of Pounds 214m in exceptional charges, double previous forecasts. Shares in Lucas, however, rose yesterday by 17p to 194p as the City reacted positively to the new strategic direction outlined by Mr George Simpson, who took over as chief executive of the Birmingham-based company in June. Mr Simpson, former chairman of Rover Group, is focusing on three areas - automotive, aerospace and electronics. One aim is to shorten response times and improve service levels to increasingly demanding manufacturers. He also announced the planned disposal of two aerospace businesses in the US  -Lucas Communications and Electronics and Lucas Aviation, which between them employ 550 people. Mr Simpson said: 'It is quite clear that three of our core business areas must be restructured if they are to achieve a competitive edge and maximise their contribution to future earnings.' Job losses at the group - which during the financial year cut its workforce by 3,200 to 45,700 - would be 'hundreds rather than thousands', he said. The provisions led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 129.7m for the year to July 31, compared with profits of Pounds 49.5m last time. Operating profit rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 84.2m. Sales were flat at Pounds 2.6bn but, excluding divestments, grew by 7 per cent. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, was confident the progress already demonstrated in underlying performance would be maintained, so the final dividend had been held at 4.9p to give an unchanged total of 7p. The biggest chunk of provisions was the Pounds 94.3m writedown of goodwill on businesses earmarked for sale, which has no effect on shareholders' funds. Another Pounds 87.6m covers the future costs of restructuring and anticipated costs of settling legal claims in the US, where the group has been accused of failing to fulfil government defence contracts. Mr Simpson said: 'It is important to note that less than 40 per cent of such provisions have a direct cash implication and this will be, in the main, offset by planned divestment proceeds.'

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lack of answers dogs Citizen's Charter Sir, In his Personal View article (March 17), William Waldegrave suggests that the Citizen's Charter is a 'glass half full', and filling rapidly. He went on to claim that the Financial Times had made the mistake of not recognising that his reforms in the public sector are far wider than merely charters, and involve privatisation and contracting out as well. The problem is that it is almost impossible to get any hard information from the minister for open government on exactly how much is being spent on these various reforms. For example, in answer to the three parliamentary questions within one week on the value of consultancy contracts government ministers claimed that the information is either 'commercial in confidence' (parliamentary questions to the trade and industry secretary January 31, and to the minister, Department of Health February 7) or that the work involved in preparing an answer would be disproportionate (parliamentary question to the minister, Welsh Office January 31). The minister claims that Pounds 100m was saved last year through market testing and contracting out but he will not give a detailed breakdown of the figures involved. Equally, information on the value of consultancy contracts varies enormously. The Treasury will provide information on the value of such contracts, for example on job evaluation and auditing, but excludes all information connected with privatisation. Meanwhile, the ministry of defence is prepared to give a total value to all consultancies awarded including privatisation, and then excludes all consultancy contracts of less than Pounds 10,000. Given these variations in practice, and the impossibility of eliciting true costs for these various reforms, the minister can hardly wonder that fundamental questions are raised at just how much value for money there really is in public sector reforms. We now see a move towards contracts being awarded without competitive tendering; and answers to parliamentary questions since last March reveal many departments and agencies are not going out to tender before placing market testing consultancy contracts. Until the minister, and perhaps as importantly Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's efficiency adviser, can answer straightforward questions with straightforward answers there will continue to be suggestions that this single-minded policy is based more on dogma than common sense value for money.

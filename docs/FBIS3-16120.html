			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Both Imatran Voima [IVO, power company] and Neste  [oil and gas company] have today signed significant energy  agreements while the visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin continues in Helsinki. A subsidiary of Imatran  Voima, IVO International, signed a general agreement worth  almost 1 billion Finnish Markkas, which includes the  modernization of several power plants in Russia, especially in  the area of St. Petersburg. The main emphasis of the agreement  is on modernizing the power plants, protecting the environment,  and saving energy. Some of the projects will be financed by  selling the saved energy to Finland.    The Russian natural gas company Gazprom will, for its part,  become a partner with a 25 percent share in a natural gas  company, which will remain a subsidiary of the Neste concern.  In addition, a new 20 year-old agreement on supplying natural  gas was signed. This agreement will increase the imports of  natural gas from the current 2.9 billion cubic meters to more  than 4 billion cubic meters by the end of the decade. The  increase in the imports of natural gas will make the extension  of the natural gas network in Finland possible. Neste reports  that industry especially and the producers of heating in heavily  populated areas are interested in increasing the use of natural  gas.    At the end of his official visit to Finland, Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin will have a 24-hour holiday in Lapland.  Chernomyrdin and his small retinue will fly to Kittilae [north  western Lapland] by special flight. The hosts of Prime Minister  and Madame Chernomyrdin's day in Lapland are Prime Minister Esko  Aho and Madame Kirsti Aho. Chernomyrdin will fly directly from  Kittilae to Moscow tomorrow afternoon.</p>

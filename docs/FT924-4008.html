			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (9): Refineries open their doors - Petrochemicals is expanding at rapid speed VENEZUELA'S petrochemical sector, in the midst of the largest expansion in its history, now depends less on capital investment from the government and is trying to promote increased equity investment from abroad. The industry is made up of a mixture of state-owned and private companies. Pequiven (Petroquimica de Venezuela), a wholly owned subsidiary of the national oil company, PDVSA, coordinates development of the petrochemical industry. It owns three large petrochemical complexes and has several plants of its own. It is an equity partner in more than a score of joint-venture projects with Venezuelan and international investors, covering plastics, oxygenates (used to replace lead as an octane booster in motor petrol), industrial chemicals and other products. Petrochemical projects currently rank among the most important targets for foreign investment in Venezuela. Recent projects with international partners include a 500,000 tonnes per year mtbe plant, now in operation (partners: Ecofuel, Pequiven and SF Mercantil): a facility for producing ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol (Olin, IFC, Corimon, Pequiven); a linear-low density polyethylene plant (Combustion Engineering; Pequiven, Grupo Zuliano and Latino Soc. Financiera); and a specialty wax plant (Repsol, Pequiven and SF Provincial). In 1989-90, Pequiven initiated a programme designed to increase Venezuela's petrochemical production capacity to around 16m tonnes a year. At the time the programme was started, total capacity stood at a little over 3m tonnes; currently, capacity exceeds 5m tonnes a year. Pequiven, which has worked in partnership with private companies for many years, has based its expansion plan on the existence of large reserves of natural gas (more than 3.1 trillion cubic metres at the end of 1991) that can be used as a feedstock for petrochemicals. While some of the new facilities are being used to supply the domestic market, most are developed with export markets in mind. Until mid-1992, Pequiven was operating under a policy whereby it could hold equity positions of up to 49 per cent in new joint ventures. Pequiven's owner, PDVSA, realised, however, that it was being forced into a prolonged cash-flow deficit, owing to low international oil prices, high domestic taxes and the demands of a multi-billion dollar investment programme. As a result, it decided to minimise all direct investments by Pequiven and to encourage the development of new facilities that are 100 per cent owed by private investors. PDVSA is also seeking increased foreign investment for projects in oil and natural gas. It recently named a veteran oil industry executive, Arnold Volkenborn, as head of Pequiven. His task is to initiate the next stage of petrochemical development, whereby Pequiven will be more of a promoter than an investor. PDVSA also plans for Pequiven to offer some of its own shares to the public, and to sell part of its stock portfolio in the joint ventures. Pequiven and the joint-venture petrochemical companies continue to make good progress. In 1991, Pequiven's fully-owned facilities produced 2.43m tonnes of products, up slightly from 1990, while the joint-venture partnerships produced 1.34m tonnes, a 30 per cent increase over the previous year. Petrochemical plants outside Venezuela where Pequiven holds full or partial ownership produced 3.5m tonnes in 1991. Pequiven had 1991 sales of Dollars 448m, and invested Dollars 439m during the year.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PETS OWNERS NEED TO BE ON GUARD;  </P> <P> RISKS OF ANIMALS TRANSMITTING DISEASES A SERIOUS MATTER  </P> <P> Best friends. That's the way a Baltimore woman described her pint-size terrier,  who greeted her each morning with tail wagging. He slept curled on the pillow  next to her own -- until the day last month when she found ticks on her arm,  her linens and her dog.  </P> <P> "I was in a panic," she says. "All those warnings you hear about diseases. I  never worried about it before, but I was upset." So upset she gave the dog a  repellent dip and banished him from the bedroom for the rest of the summer tick  season.  </P> <P> The likelihood of an animal sharing a bug that can transmit disease -- or  directly giving bacteria or parasites to a human -- is relatively low. But  cases occur across the country. The risks of getting roundworm, toxoplasmosis,  rabies and other animal-related illnesses must be taken seriously, say  infectious disease specialists.  </P> <P> In a society in which animals are treated as family members, it's only logical.  Husbands and wives share colds. Children give chicken pox and measles to  siblings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Similar Symptoms  </P> <P> Pets can also carry home diseases. To be sure, the majority of  animal-transmitted sicknesses cause little more than discomfort. Misdiagnoses  often occur because the symptoms are similar to so many other ailments: fever,  nausea, diarrhea, aches, rashes, sweats or chills and flu-like reactions.  Untreated, however, some bacterial and parasitic ailments escalate to  debilitation and even death. Advising the family physician or emergency room  that you've been bitten or scratched, therefore, can make the difference.  </P> <P> Doctors stress that for the majority of pet owners who have strong immune  systems, owning an animal can be beneficial as well as safe. The problem is one  of awareness, says Dr. Peter Schantz, an epidemiologist and veterinarian at the  Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Most pet owners don't realize that they  can take simple precautions against catching their pets' diseases.  </P> <P> Failing to keep the pet's living area clean; feeding with raw, undercooked or  spoiled meats; forgetting to wash hands after contact with the pet; allowing  the animal to run free in areas where wildlife or strays roam -- these are  health-risk behaviors of humans. Ignoring routine veterinary care such as  worming and vaccinations is like opening the front door and inviting disease  in.  </P> <P> "I have dogs and cats, and I have kids, and I feel that it's very easy to have  pets and reduce the risks," Schantz says. "The infectious disease risks  associated with pets are not that severe that they counterbalance the  recognized values of owning pets."  </P> <P> Americans, by and large, agree. Our love affair with pets grows annually. About  52.4 million dogs live in about 34.7 million households -- about 1.5 pooches to  each household. The cat population is even larger: 54.6 million, or about two  cats to each household. Celebrities like pop singer Michael Jackson, a giraffe  and chimpanzee owner, make exotic creatures "status" pets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inconveniences Outweighed  </P> <P> With all these pets, responsibilities and risks tug at the owner's end of the  leash. Lloyd H. Ross, chief of Baltimore's animal control bureau, an arm of the  city Health Department, says the public health benefits of leash and  pooper-scooper laws outweigh their perceived inconveniences.  </P> <P> When pets foul parks, yards, playgrounds and sandboxes, parasites can be left  in the soil or sand, he says. Uncontrolled animals also pose the risks of bites  and scratches, which can be traumas in themselves.  </P> <P> The health risks can be reduced with responsible pet ownership.  </P> <P> "It's the neglected pet that could conceivably be a health concern," says Dr.  Jack Grigor, chief of Maryland's Center for Veterinary Public Health. "I think  a healthy pet is a safe pet."  </P> <P> His office works to safeguard human health -- not just animal health.  Throughout history, veterinarians have had crucial roles in detecting zoonoses  (zoh-oh-no-ses), diseases transmitted from animals to humans. In some Western  states, vets are working to halt bubonic plague transmitted by fleas, the  medieval world's black death, which still exists. They helped rope in  tuberculosis, once widely spread by infected livestock and now nearly  eradicated in the United States.  </P> <P> For pet owners, history can be a lesson: The vet as well as the physician, the  control of the pet's habitat and sanitation and hygiene protect not only the  pet, but the entire family.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karen Brutents: "Why Did Yegor Gaydar Suddenly </F> Start Talking About Corruption?: What Kept Him From Fighting It  When He Was in the Government?"]    [Text] I am prompted to write about corruption again, not  only by the subject itself, the topicality of which,  unfortunately, simply continues to grow, but also by the fact  that for the first time, at least publicly, Yegor Gaydar has  addressed it extensively: "The boundlessness of corruption is  profoundly insulting. The main reason for the collapse of  democratic power, I am convinced, is related... to the profound  disillusionment with the `democracy of thieves.'"    One can only rejoice that such a well-known and influential  person has turned his attention to this problem, which is, as we  liked to put it not long ago, so portentous for the country. One  cannot help but agree that "corruption is becoming, not a  by-product, but a determinant (at least, one of the  determinants) of the political process." Incidentally, this was  also mentioned on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, although not  in such complicated form. Taken as a whole, however, the  arguments of the former first vice-premier impel us to make  certain comments.    First of all, it is curious that Ye. Gaydar addresses this  subject when he is already outside the government and feeling  about for a popular platform for his fight to return to power.  When he was at Staraya Ploshchad, he did not do this. I see in  this, unnecessary confirmation of the fact that the fight  against corruption is not -- leaving aside the question of "why"  -- among the primary concerns of power. I recall that Nikolay  Fedorov, the former minister of Justice (now president of  Chuvashia), even spoke of a "lack of the will, among the higher  Russian leaders, to fight in earnest against corruption." Not  counting, of course, the myriad loud-mouthed decrees and edicts,  the dissolved committees and commissions, etc. These spasmodic  propagandistic imitations provide, rather, a negative effect,  strengthening the corrupters' insolent belief in impunity.    The scandalous exposures of corruption in the higher  government echelons, which surfaced in the course of the scuffle  between the legislative and executive powers, have faded into  oblivion. Having fulfilled its function, that of dethroning  Rutskoy, the Interdepartmental Commission to Fight Crime and  Corruption, created by a decision at the highest level, and  appearing to us on the television screen even under the  chairmanship of the president, has quietly passed to its rest.  Likewise remaining unclear is the Russian-Swedish-Canadian  odyssey of Yakubovskiy, reminiscent of a hurriedly cooked-up  mediocre detective story, a sprinter's rise -- in the manner of  the favorites of the medieval monarchs -- a young reserve  officer coming close to a general's epaulets. None of the state  and political figures from the official tribunal followed the  example of Sergey Shakhray -- he did not publish the data on the  property situation and incomes. The press and television also  grew tired of -- or seemed uncomfortable with -- the theme of  corruption. They prefer to lapse into general discussions,  sometimes sluggishly stinging personalities of rayon or  settlement scale.    Meanwhile, corruption has obtained a qualitatively new  dimension. It has not only resolutely widened its boundaries,  having covered practically the whole country with its hairy paw  and ensnared all the degrees of the administrative ladder. A  union of influential groups of bureaucrats, with the criminal  and semi-criminal nouveau riche, has actually been organized on  the its basis. This not only bleeds the country economically and  prevents the growth of production enterprise, but has also  become a weighty political factor (let us remember Ye. Gaydar's  "determinant"). In many cases, this iniquitous union interferes  in the electoral process, turns the practical realization of  certain government decisions to its advantage and has a direct  influence on other decisions. The Russia of reforms is turning  into the Russia of corruption. This is already scaring off its  Western partners. The Paris QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS wrote the other  day that corruption in Russia was of a scope that created  serious ethical problems for those in the West who were doing  business with it.    Yegor Gaydar, obviously, underestimates the effect of the  sluggish stand of authority on the corruption processes. I am  not going to find fault with the natural striving to minimize  the "exploits" in this field, to use his expression, of "new  people," and to give first place to the "former" schedule of  appointments: it is dictated by the transparent political biases  and gains. In real life, things are going, of course, otherwise  -- the division here is not in any way taking place on this  basis. In the embezzlement of public funds, both these schedules  of appointments merge very nicely, although not without  conflicts.    When Yegor Timurovich writes that "the main thing is to  destroy the objective bases of corruption and the state's  monopolistic power over ownership," he is, of course, right. No  less important, however -- particularly under the present  Russian conditions -- is the way the state parts with its  property. A unique process -- even the Chinese phenomenon bears  only a distant resemblance -- is taking place in Russia right  now, a process of alienation from the state and feverish  dividing up of huge property worth hundreds of billions of  dollars. It is being done actually behind the scenes, outside  democratic control, farmed out to an army of officials, many  units of which were corrupted from the start. The formal  participation in this process of part of the population and work  collectives is, of course, no hindrance to it. They have  absolutely no understanding of either the essence or the  technology of what is taking place, and are subject to pressure  from the management of the enterprises, which makes wide use of  the threat of unemployment as a warning to "parliament." This  system of privatization is undoubtedly a fantastically powerful  supplementary feeding factor for the corruption bacchanalia.    Finally, corruption in Russia, as everywhere, incidentally,  does not boil down to merely embezzlement of public funds and  bribery. Perhaps, though, it is in our country, against a  background of the boundless "flood" of them and the loss of  ideals that political, moral corruption has taken on  immeasurable scope. It has dragged many state officials,  parliamentarians and professionals of various colors into its  rapids. I am not concerned with the privileges with which the  state pays for the stress, fervor and loyalty of its officials,  although, of course, I do not agree with Ye. Gaydar when he  states that it is "not a struggle against privileges, and  especially not unappetizing populist outcries on this subject"  that we need to counter corruption. The temptation is great to  recall that these "outcries" were the main hobby-horse of the  democrats in their campaign for power. The point, however, lies  in something different: privileges stimulate corruption, if they  are not open and known to society, but are secret.    I have something else in mind: not only is conformism  widespread among by no means ordinary statesmen, but also a  readiness to "swap" their political, civic duty for material and  other blessings, for the favors of the top echelons, and also  for the strides of authority encouraging this trend. Commonplace  on our public scene are the figures of the guardians of the law  who manipulate original documents with impunity; generals,  changing the oath; deputies hastily privatizing their official  quarters; public prosecutors submitting their formal charges to  the press; democrats worshiping Pinochet; finally, writers  kissing up to the authorities.    What is unbearably bad, though, is the penetration of this  trend into the relations between various branches of power. Was  it not in this spirit that the proposal that the Russian  deputies leave the White House in exchange for material reward  was sustained in the pre-October days? Can we not now see the  obvious striving to make the conditions of work and everyday  life of the deputies of the State Duma dependent on their  "correct" behavior? Look how Vitaliy Kolbasyuk, in NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA, describes the mutual relations of the Moscow municipal  council and city duma: "The State machine was attached to each  of its members, and now they are quietly finding apartments for  the people's chosen ones. Perhaps that is why there are no  scandals in the city duma, and the Moscow duma members, fully  dependent on the municipal council, but with no grounds for  complaining that they are paid no attention, are working  fruitfully."    Such phenomena, of course, also occur in other countries,  but  usually do not emerge at the level of political manners. World  experience has already reliably proved that the leadership of  the executive power is above the representative, and  anti-democratic structures and procedures are breeding  corruption.    Corruption and corrupters have advanced far, very far in our  country. It is bitter to realize it, but the immune  anti-corruption potential of society has been seriously  undermined. The boundlessness and falsehood of the hired pens  surrounding it has dulled the people's reaction, and many have  succeeded in suggesting that this is, if not a normal, then in  any case, a common and inevitable phenomenon.    There is no doubt about it, corruption has already turned  into an obstacle that is hard for any course of reform -- shock  or otherwise -- to surmount. This, by the way, is one of the  reasons why in Russia "enlightened authoritarianism" is  impossible and doesn't work. Its reform is conceivable only  along a democratic path and at the hands of democrats who are  not mercenary-minded. The fight against corruption, naturally,  should be the programmed task of all true democrats and patriots  -- both those in the corridors of power and those opposing it.</p>

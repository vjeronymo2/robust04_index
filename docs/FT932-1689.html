			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Rhone-Poulenc seeks FFr4.5bn through sale of Roussel stake RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals group, hopes to raise FFr4.5bn (Pounds 530m) by next month through the sale of its 35 per cent stake in Roussel Uclaf, the bioscience company. The deal will give Hoechst greater control of Roussel, in which it holds a 54.5 per cent stake. The German company felt restricted by the stake of Rhone-Poulenc, in which the French government has a 43.4 per cent interest. The disposal will be made through an open offer on the Paris stock market and an international private placing. It will enable Rhone-Poulenc to reduce borrowings of between FFr33bn and FFr35bn. This will enhance its chances of being chosen as one of the first targets of the new centre-right French government's privatisation programme. Roussel's share structure will be simplified. After the sale, preferred non-voting shares will be swapped for ordinary voting shares on a three-for-two basis. Roussel plans to increase its capital by FFr1.1bn, thereby raising the controlling holding of Hoechst, the German chemicals group, from 54.4 per cent to 57 per cent. The new shares, worth about FFr1.2bn, will pay Hoechst for the transfer of Laboratoires Hoechst, its French pharmaceuticals business, to Roussel and for giving the latter a 50 per cent interest in Albert Roussel Pharma, a German marketing company in which it already held 25.1 per cent. The share sale is in two parts, an international book-building exercise, and a public share offering on the Paris stock exchange. Early bids for the international offering are being asked at between FFr550 and FFr575. The price for the international offer will be struck on July 5, while the book-building is scheduled to close on July 12 when trading in the shares will resume. The shares were suspended at FFr575 yesterday. Barclays de Zoete Wedd is the global co-ordinator. The Paris offering is managed by Banque National de Paris. An international road-show starts in Switzerland tomorrow. Lex, Page 24; Background, Page 29</p>

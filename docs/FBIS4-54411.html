			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 27 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the  Czech Government discussed and approved the principles for a  constitutional bill on higher self-administrative units to be  submitted to Parliament by April 30, Premier Vaclav Klaus told  journalists.    He said the government had thoroughly reworked and regrouped  the materials. The first part concerns general powers of higher  administrative units while the second one defines which powers  would be transferred to higher administrative units from central  bodies, Klaus said. The third part specifies areas where the  higher units would have the right to set up institutions. These  would include social care, education, health care, transport,  culture, and the environment, he said.    Klaus said that the approved principles would "facilitate  the  next stage of the work on the future administrative arrangement  of the state."</p>

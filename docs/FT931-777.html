			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: Royal Shakespeare Company's touring production of Richard III Richard of Gloucester: 'Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes.' Simon Russell Beale, back from injury, plays Richard in the Royal Shakespeare Company's touring production of Richard III, newly returned to Stratford at the Swan Theatre. His superb Richard has verve and wit enough to make villainy enthralling; he is by turns vicious, icy, and funny. Other highlights are Stephen Boxer's limber Buckingham, Kate Duchene's Queen Elizabeth and Christopher Hunter's vexed Hastings. The simple plain set and monochrome lighting leave space for the play to bustle in. The plot unfolds at great pace from the moment Richard opens the action under a bare light bulb. Intelligent detail fills out the evening, with a fine end in the Malmsey butt for 'false perjur'd Clarence' and the terrifying dreams at Bosworth as Richard is cursed by his victims' ghosts. Sam Mendes directs. In Repertory until May 1 (Box Office 0789-295623).</p>

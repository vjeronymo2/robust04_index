			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family: Mortgage rates are cut The cuts in mortgage rates this week came without the stimulus of a cut in bank base rates. With base rates at 10.5 per cent and the new mortgage rate from three leading lenders at 10.95 per cent, the margin between the two is very narrow in historic terms. Divergence between base rates and the Halifax mortgage rate was at its greatest when base rates were relatively low in 1987 and 1988. In May 1988, the difference was just over 2 1/2 percentage points, when base rates were 7.5 per cent and the Halifax mortgage rate 9.8 per cent. Mortgage boost for first time buyers, Page III</p>

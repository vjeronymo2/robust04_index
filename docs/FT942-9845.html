			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / US Senate votes to defy arms to Bosnia embargo The US Senate voted yesterday for the US to break the United Nations embargo on arms shipments to the Bosnian Moslem government, adding to pressure on President Bill Clinton to become more aggressively involved in the Bosnian conflict. By a single vote margin, the Senate passed a resolution proposed by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, to prohibit the administration from blocking shipments of conventional weapons to the Bosnian government. The Senate also voted for a less radical measure, backed by the administration, calling for efforts to persuade America's allies to agree to lift the arms embargo. The vote is unlikely to have any immediate impact on US policy, since it would first have to come to a vote in the House of Representatives and could then face a presidential veto. But it raises the domestic stakes for Mr Clinton, who himself favours lifting the embargo. However, he has refused to do so without the agreement of the UN and his European allies who have troops at risk in Bosnia. European diplomats had been rallying opposition to any unilateral move, fearing it could jeopardise UN humanitarian operations in Bosnia and create an ominous precedent by disregarding a UN resolution. US senators supporting the resolution argued that Bosnia had suffered most from the 1991 UN resolution prohibiting arms shipments to any of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. The Senate vote comes on the eve of talks between foreign ministers from the US, Russia and the European Union meeting in Geneva today to try to relaunch the peace process. The vote also reflects a growing frustration among western nations about the failure to secure a settlement that all sides will accept. A Foreign Office spokesman said the UK planned to discuss the Senate vote with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, at today's meeting. UK observers feared it could push the warring parties away from the bargaining table. France will propose today that the countries meeting in Geneva should demand an immediate ceasefire, reaffirm the existence of Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent state and recognise that it can exist only as a confederation of different communities. But Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has caused concern in the US by referring to the possibility of an imposed settlement, a position opposed by Washington. The US has been unwilling to press the Bosnian government to accept a territorial division that it believes to be unjust.</p>

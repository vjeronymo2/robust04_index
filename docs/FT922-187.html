			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Technology: What you see is what you get / Examining an electronic publishing system that maintains its 'look and feel' Personal computers are great for producing feature-rich documents enhanced with special typefaces, colour graphics, photographs and charts which make them more lively and easier to read. When someone else wants to read the document in its original form, the problems begin. Unless the recipient is using the same sort of computer equipment and the same software packages, a document can usually only be electronically transmitted in a dull basic (Ascii) text form, losing most of its special features when it is viewed on another screen. Usually, therefore, the document is printed out before being distributed, adding to the piles of paper which already clutter offices. Not only has this meant that the paperless office remains a dream, it has also imposed severe limitations on the format of electronic publishing, including electronic mail. However Adobe Systems, the Californian company which has pioneered the sophisticated PostScript page description language for printers, believes it has the answer with technology which was code-named Carousel during its early developmental stages. Carousel software can distribute electronically a document from one desktop computer to any other computer while preserving its exact 'look and feel'. For example, a document could be sent via an office network from an IBM PC on one desk to an Apple computer running a different operating system and software on another desk, and then viewed on screen, manipulated, or printed. Adobe claims its new technology, based on PostScript, may have a profound effect on the electronic distribution of information and on business electronic publishing. The technology will make it much easier to publish electronic documents on computer disks or on CD-Rom and will reduce the need to distribute documents. Today, a CD-Rom publisher must prepare data in different forms for every type of computer, but by including the Carousel software on the disk any PC could read it. A newspaper, magazine, or newsletter publisher will be able to transmit to a subscriber's screen an electronic version that looks exactly like the original. If required, the subscriber could then print out the page, or read it on his computer screen. Electronic newspapers could even be distributed via cable TV. Carousel raises some thorny legal questions. How will publishers protect copyrighted materials if computer users can rapidly and cheaply reproduce and distribute them? It may also prove impossible for the recipient of an electronic newsletter to verify that the text he is reading on what looks like a genuine copy has not been altered. For publishers, the advent of this new generation of electronic publishing technology represents both an opportunity and a challenge.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "WB Loans To Keep Coming"] </F>   [Text] The World Bank will continue to remain an important  source of long-term capital for China's economic development, a  senior official with the world body said.    Pieter P. Bottelier, head of the bank's China branch, said  China has done a "very good" job implementing World Bank loans.    Making his remarks in a recent interview with China Daily,  Bottelier said the bank's total lending to China is projected to  reach $19 billion by the middle of this year.    The international organization has lent $17 billion to China  since it first made a loan in 1981.    Last year, China received the largest amount of World Bank  funds of any country in the world.    New annual commitments are to total over $3 billion with  projects concentrated in infrastructure construction, social  development and environmental protection.    The bank's lending programme for the coming years, Bottelier  said, is to be around $3 to 3.5 billion, with about 15 to 17  projects annually. They are to focus on agriculture and  removing transportation and energy "bottlenecks."    Lending to bolster industry enterprises reform, urban  development and alleviating poverty are also to receive greater  emphasis.    Bottlier said the World Bank, in addition to being a source  of capital for China, also provides technical and policy advice  through economic studies and technical assistance projects.    He said assistance programmes this year and in coming years  will focus on developing the legal system, financial sector and  fiscal administration.    The bank official also noted that Chinese companies are  winning more international contracts under World Bank loans to  other countries.    This shows that Chinese contractors are becoming more  competitive in the international economy, he said.    Chinese suppliers secured about 3.3 percent of international  World Bank contracts in 1992, compared with none five years ago.  About 8 percent of contracts in 199's were awarded to Japanese  firms.    Bottelier also said the World Bank is very pleased with the  quality of its relationship with China, which is regarded as a  long- term co-operation project. "The World Bank is expected to  help deepen and accelerate China's economic reform programme  announced at the Third Plenary of the 14th Central Committee of  the Communist Party of China in November last year," he said.    However, he said the relative contribution of the bank's  capital will inevitably diminish as other sources of capital,  especially the private foreign capital, becomes more important  for China.</p>

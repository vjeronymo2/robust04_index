			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 19 April]    [Text] A network of observers and monitors will be deployed  before and on the election days to report on the electoral  process and to ensure that the elections are free and fair by  applying the guidelines of the Electoral Code of Conduct, as set  out in the Electoral Act, 1993.    More than 14,000 election monitors will be employed by the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] on the election days to  report any misconduct or breaches of the code. They have the  power to intervene in disputes and to mediate between disputing  parties. Monitors fall under the monitoring directorate, which  has wide powers to investigate alleged electoral offences.    On the election days at least one monitor will be stationed  at each voting station throughout the country. They will try to  resolve complaints directly or to intervene in disputes to  defuse conflict.    While monitors are paid employees of the IEC and have legal  powers of intervention, observers are volunteers who can only  report findings.    The role of the observers, particularly domestic observers,  is fundamental to the election in order to allow civil society  to observe and report upon the electoral process. There is a  commitment from the side of the IEC to working closely with all  observer organisations -- domestic and foreign -- in order to  ensure that they are able to fulfil this crucial role in the  election.    There will be three kinds of observers:    --domestic observers provided by local NGOs [nongovernmental  organizations]. To date 26 domestic observer organisations,  which include the primary umbrella body of domestic observers,    --and the National Electoral Observer Network (NEON) have  been registered by the IEC. A full list will be provided to the  IEC by domestic observer bodies on 22 April 1994.    --foreign observers from international non-governmental  organisations. 77 foreign observer organisations have been  accredited by the Monitoring Directorate of the IEC.    Observers provided by inter-governmental organisations such  as the United Nations, the Organisation for African Unity, the  European Union and the Commonwealth. These observers are not  registered by the IEC, but by the United Nations Observer  Mission (UNOMSA). The observer organisations will be  responsible for accommodation, welfare and transport, but will  be supplied with observer identification and insignia by the IEC.

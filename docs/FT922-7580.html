			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE WHITBREAD will open a round of brewers' results today by reporting its first fall in earnings for 16 years. The impact of the recession, culminating in a Pounds 37m provision for bad and doubtful debts, is expected to reduce full-year pre-tax profits by more than 20 per cent to between Pounds 225m and Pounds 230m. Market forecasts for Allied-Lyons tomorrow suggest pre-tax profits in the new management's inaugural year of about Pounds 635m - marginally ahead, excluding last year's Pounds 147m on foreign currency dealings. The results are likely to have less influence on sentiment than statements about the group's plans for the future and the benefits expected from restructuring. Interim results from Bass on Wednesday should show a 20 per cent rise to Pounds 263m on last year's weak first half. The country's leading brewer is continuing to benefit from cost savings from brewery closures, but pub sales to comply with the government beer orders will hit retailing profits. At least Pounds 290m pre-tax for the year to March is expected from British Airways, which reports its finals tomorrow, against a Gulf crisis-affected Pounds 130m. Strong second and third quarters lie behind the recovery. It is hoped the upturn will be accompanied by some positive noises about future trading. BOC, the chemicals group, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 166m tomorrow. This compares with Pounds 144.7m last year, when the figure was depressed by some above-the-line charges. Analysts will be looking for signs of improvement in the US and the scale of any downturn in Japan. Courtaulds, also in the chemicals sector, reports full-year results on Wednesday. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 200m are expected, compared with Pounds 186.3m. Attention will focus on the downturn in performance materials and the quality of business in fibres and films. Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK's composite insurers, could show a slight fall in pre-tax losses to between Pounds 15m and Pounds 25m when it reports its first-quarter results on Wednesday. Like its rivals, Royal and General Accident, which both reported improved figures this week, CU will benefit from premium rate increases in the UK. BT, the telecommunications group, is expected on Thursday to report pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March, marginally up on the previous year's Pounds 3.07bn. Profit growth has been held back by the recession, competition from Mercury Communications and a tighter price cap which came into force last September. Storehouse, the retailing conglomerate which owns BhS, Habitat, Mothercare, Richard Shops and Blazer, will announce a mixed bag of trading fortunes when it reveals its annual results on Thursday. Although group profits are likely to be down from Pounds 21m to Pounds 13.5m, there should be progress on several fronts. Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway chain of supermarkets, will demonstrate the continued resilience of food retailing as it looks likely on Wednesday to lift yearly pre-tax profits by about a quarter to Pounds 360m. This performance will continue a remarkable five-year period of growth since Argyll bought Safeway.

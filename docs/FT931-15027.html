			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Central bankers believe ERM dangers receding THE central banks of countries still in the European exchange rate mechanism are confident that the four-month crisis in the European Monetary System is past its peak. An upbeat appraisal of the ERM's prospects at a meeting of EC central bank governors in Basle this week was reflected in comments at Wednesday's meeting in Frankfurt of the privately organised G7 Council. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice president, said there was no longer any reason for a realignment of parities in the European exchange rate mechanism following the adjustments of recent months. Mr Wim Duisenberg, governor of the Netherlands central bank, went further: 'What crisis?', he asked. The problem with the ERM was that 'we had forgotten how to realign'. The upheavals that had shaken the system since September simply added up to 'one realignment that lasted four months'. The bullish tone was tempered by doubts among officials from non-EC nations and countries that had been forced to quit the system and scepticism among some of the bankers and financiers attending the Frankfurt G7 Council meeting. Currency markets also remain concerned about the ability of the Irish punt and Danish krone to maintain their current parities. Mr Lamberto Dini, the director general of the Bank of Italy, urged a co-ordinated reduction in European interest rates as soon as possible to promote economic convergence among EC countries. One UK official expressed concern that tensions could reappear nearer to the French national assembly elections in March. Such doubts would be greatly reduced if Germany's high short term interest rates were to ease soon. On Tuesday night, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, predicted 'a significant and durable drop of interest rates in Europe' this year. This bold forecast gained some support from the Bundesbank. Although Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Tietmeyer insisted that the German central bank would not relax its drive for low inflation, they made clear that the bank was prepared to allow some flexibility in operating its policy. However, lower interest rates ultimately depend on the German government finalising negotiations on a 'solidarity pact' that will control Germany's public sector deficits and rising labour costs growth.</p>

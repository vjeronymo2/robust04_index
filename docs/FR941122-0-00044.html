			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the November 18, 1993 proposal, it was also noted that, in the draft permits, EPA had proposed to defer action on those compliance options with regard to 1996&hyph;1999 pending completion of the instant rulemaking. 58 FR 60962&hyph;60963. In notices of draft permits, the Agency had stated that it intended to take this approach for all substitution and reduced utilization plans submitted before July 16, 1993 but that, with regard to such plans submitted on or after July 16, 1993, it intended to defer action for all of Phase I on those compliance options until completion of the rulemaking. 58 FR 38371 (July 16, 1993); 58 FR 39542&hyph;39543 (July 23, 1993); 58 FR 40812 (July 30, 1993); 58 FR 42065 (Aug. 6, 1993); 58 FR 43107 (Aug. 13, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency had explained in draft permits, notices of draft permits, and the November 18, 1993 proposal that it was taking the position that it had the authority under the January 11, 1993 regulations to defer action on compliance options. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 60963. Nevertheless, the Agency proposed, in the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, to add language to &sect;&sect;72.62 and 72.82 of the January 11, 1993 regulations ``making this authority more explicit.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Agency concludes that it is no longer necessary to defer action for any period on any substitution or reduced utilization plans that have been submitted. The Agency has already issued direct final permits addressing these plans for all years during 1995&hyph;1999 for which the plans were proposed. See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 37755 (July 25, 1994); 59 FR 38454 (July 28, 1994); 59 FR 39339 (Aug. 2, 1994); and 59 FR 39767 (Aug. 4, 1994). Most of the permits automatically became final. Significant, adverse comment was received on several permits, which were reproposed and have now been issued in final form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 49395&hyph;49396 (Sept. 28, 1994). As provided in the May 4, 1994 settlement, the substitution and compensating units designated in the plans are allocated allowances in Phase I under settlement provisions consistent with today's final revised rule and receive for one or two years any additional allowances (referred to, in the settlement, as ``excess'' allowances) that would be provided under the January 11, 1993 regulations. Consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement, allowances equal to the number of additional allowances allocated for one or two years will be deducted from a future year subaccount in the unit's Allowance Tracking System account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the Agency is withdrawing its position, set forth in draft permits, notices of draft permits, and the November 18, 1993 proposal, that it has the authority under the January 11, 1993 regulations to defer action on compliance options. The Agency is taking no position at this time on whether it has such authority. Further, under these circumstances, the Agency is not adopting the revisions to &sect;&sect;72.62 and 72.82 as proposed on November 18, 1993. The comments that were submitted on these proposed revisions and on the Agency's authority to defer action on compliance options are therefore no longer relevant and require no response at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Agency is not addressing, in this rulemaking, questions concerning whether and how to apply today's final revised rule to permit applications submitted to the Agency prior to the effective date of the final revised rule. These matters_including the question of whether allowances allocated to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 rules should be returned to EPA in the future_were addressed when, as noted above, the final permits were issued with regard to these permit applications. The Agency considered, in the individual permit application proceedings, both the comments on this matter submitted in this rulemaking and those comments submitted on the draft permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The docket is the organized and complete file of all the information considered by EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The Agency notes that, consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement, several parties withdrew comments or portions of comments that they had submitted concerning matters addressed in the November 18, 1993 proposal. Along with the preamble of the proposal and final rule, the contents of the docket_except for interagency review materials and all comments or portions of comments that were withdrawn prior to the date of the Administrator's signature on this final rule_will constitute the record in case of judicial review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), the Administrator must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

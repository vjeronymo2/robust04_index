			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CITY MAY RESCIND HITLER HONOR  </P> <P> Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering will lose their honorary citizenship of  Potsdam if a City Hall proposal is approved next month, the East German news  agency ADN reported today.  </P> <P> The Nazi dictator and his air force chief were awarded the honor in 1933, but  it was never revoked because of a 57-year administrative mess and the ousted  Communist leadership's fear of causing a public scandal, ADN said.  </P> <P> Records showed that officials assumed shortly after World War II that the issue  had been settled under decrees issued by the Soviet military administrators of  what is now East Germany.  </P> <P> However, those Red Army decrees on "de-Nazification" made no specific mention  of the honorary citizenships, the agency said.  </P> <P> "When the problem finally came to light in the City Council in 1988, the matter  was quietly relegated to the archives," ADN said.  </P></p>

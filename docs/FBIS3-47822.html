			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the fourth working-level contact held between  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea in  Vienna this afternoon, the IAEA presented its official reply  document to the letter from Pyongyang dated 17 January, and  again urged North Korea to accept overall [chonmyon]  inspections. Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna.    [Begin Cha recording] This afternoon Korean time, the IAEA  held the fourth round of working-level contact with the North  Korean side and presented a document to North Korea in the form  of a reply letter. This document presented the IAEA's position  on points of dispute that were revealed on three occasions  during working-level discussions.    The official document presented to the North Korean side by  the IAEA is a reply to the reply letter of the Pyongyang  authorities dated 17 January. It was learned that through this  official document the IAEA stressed that it cannot accept  limited [chehanjok] inspection, which the North Korean side  insists on, and again strongly called on North Korea to accept  overall inspections in compliance with the nuclear accord in  order to recover promptly the continuity of inspections.    In particular, the IAEA clearly expressed its intention to  conduct overall inspections -- not only replacement of  surveillance devices, but also extraction of nuclear materials  -- of the two sensitive nuclear facilities, including an atomic  reactor and radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, over which the  two sides show acute differences in views. Such a position by  the IAEA was conveyed verbally many times to the North Korean  side in the course of working-level contacts. At the request of  the working-level delegate representing the Pyongyang  authorities, the IAEA presented its position in the form of a  document.    Meanwhile, an IAEA source said that the North Korean  response  to this document is a matter of interest, however, Pyongyang is  expected to finally accept overall inspections because North  Korea, in contact with the United States, agreed [yanghae] to  accept inspections demanded by IAEA.

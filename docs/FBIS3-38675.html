			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- General Klaus Naumann, the  Bundeswehr chief of general staff, warns that the latest cuts in  the defense budget could have far-reaching consequences on the  Bundeswehr's operational readiness and the scope for action of  German security policy. In an interview in WELT AM SONNTAG,  Germany's most senior military officer says "cuts are now being  made that will lead to parts of the Bundeswehr being unable to  achieve the degree of operational readiness that its mandate  demands."    It is true that the Defense Ministry is still in the middle  of the assessment process, but, the general says, its initial  assessment has been "that we will no longer be able to achieve  today's level of operational readiness in 1994/95 in many  sections of the Army." Units will experience staffing  shortfalls.</p>

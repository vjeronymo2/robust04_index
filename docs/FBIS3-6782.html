			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Butterworth, March 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia is  willing to send additional soldiers to serve in the United  Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina if  requested to do so by the UN, Chief of Defence Forces General  Borhan Ahmad said Tuesday.    He said, however, there had been no proposal yet to despatch  extra peacekeepers to the war-ravaged country.    So far Malaysia's contribution in UNPROFOR was sufficient  alongside the participation of soldiers from several other  countries, he told reporters after launching the 13th air Thamal  joint exercise between the Malaysian and Thai Air Forces at the  Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) base here.    Malaysia has sent about 1,500 soldiers to join the UN  peacekeeping force in response to the atrocities committed by  Serbs on Muslims in Bosnia.    Ten RMAF aircraft, including five F-5E jets and three OV-10  reconnaissance planes, are taking part in the exercise, an  annual series held on rotation between the two countries to  strengthen cooperation in operational procedures.</p>

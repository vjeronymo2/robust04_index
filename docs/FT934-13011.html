			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Fiat extends Rhone-Poulenc alliance FIAT, Italy's largest private industrial group, is to form part of a core of stable long-term shareholders in the forthcoming privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals company. The move, which was revealed yesterday by Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive officer, will mark an important consolidation of a cross-border alliance with Rhone-Poulenc. Rhone-Poulenc and Snia BPD, Fiat's chemicals and fibres subsidiary, have one joint venture and a second is due to begin in January. Fiat's participation in Rhone-Poulenc's privatisation, which is due within the next few weeks, reflects the interest of international industry in France's ambitious plan to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. The privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris earlier this month attracted participation from several overseas companies, including BAT Industries of the UK and General Electric of the US. In announcing Fiat's involvement in France's privatisation programme, which has to be approved by the French privatisation committee, Mr Romiti said the group would not be bidding for any of the assets about to be divested by the Italian state. 'We have drawn too much fire for being too big in Italy and we do not want to be accused of further increasing our size in respect of others,' he told a parliamentary commission. This comment appeared an attempt to head off suggestions that Fiat had passed a vote of confidence in French privatisation and not that of Italy which is proceeding at a much slower pace than that of the Balladur government. Core investors are expected to represent about 25 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc's shares when the state sells its 43 per cent stake within the next few weeks. They must purchase a minimum of 2.5m shares, about 1 per cent of the total. Rhone-Poulenc shares are trading at about FFr156. The move by Fiat comes shortly after the consolidation of relations with another large French industrial group. On September 28, Fiat announced a L6,250bn (Dollars 3.9bn) capital increase and the creation of a hard core of friendly shareholders that included France's Alcatel Alsthom, due to raise its stake from 1 per cent to about 2.2 per cent. Fiat intends to rationalise its Fiatimpresit construction and civil engineering interests by forming a joint venture with Lodigiani and Girola, two private Italian operators.</p>

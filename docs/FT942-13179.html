			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter income drops 28% at Texaco Texaco, the US oil group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent decline in consolidated first-quarter net income to Dollars 202m, or 69 cents a share, as sharply lower crude oil prices offset efficiency improvements, costs reductions and increased oil production levels. The group's quarterly earnings were restated to account for the sale of Texaco Chemical to Huntsman Corporation, concluded last week. If income from the chemical operation was included in the results, Texaco would have earned Dollars 278m in the quarter, still slightly below last year's profit of Dollars 281m. Upstream exploration and production earnings were almost halved to Dollars 120m in the wake of declines in crude oil prices of more than Dollars 4 per barrel in the US market, and more than Dollars 3 per barrel internationally. However, upstream earnings were buoyed by an increase in natural gas prices. Earnings from downstream manufacturing and marketing operations, which traditionally benefit from cheaper oil, rose to Dollars 203m, up from Dollars 171m a year earlier. The group said margins rose in the US market, where the introduction of its new CleanSystem gasoline product boosted domestic sales. Downstream earnings overseas were lifted by increased sales in Latin America and higher margins in Brazil. Capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter rose 17 per cent to Dollars 624m as overall spending on both upstream and downstream operations increased, particularly on drilling on developmental gas projects in the US. Overseas upstream expenditures fell, primarily because successful project completions in the North Sea oilfields continue to feed through into higher production volumes. Although corporate overheads were lower in the quarter, higher after-tax interest expenses pushed up corporate and non-operating expenses from Dollars 99m to Dollars 120m. The results had little impact on Texaco's share price, which rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based energy group, yesterday reported a 43 per cent decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 149m or 92 cents a share from Dollars 260m or Dollars 1.60 a year earlier. Revenues tumbled to Dollars 3.9bn from Dollars 4.67bn. The company blamed the sharp drop in earnings on lower crude oil prices. Arco's downstream refining and marketing operations, however, put in a solid performance, thanks partly to higher natural gas prices.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners visit Rumblings of dissent were being heard in the leisure sector as analysts returned from a visit to downgrade Owners Abroad, the tour operator which recently fought off a hostile bid from rival Airtours. Part of Owners' defence was its bullish outlook on trading and the cost savings after its tie-up with Thomas Cook. While the company was said to be positive on current trading, some analysts expressed surprise at the size of the exceptional cost items, including the defence costs from the bid and reorganisational costs from the Thomas Cook deal. Most downgraded their forecasts by between Pounds 3m to Pounds 6m, to a range of Pounds 27m to Pounds 33m for 1993. Profits last year were Pounds 25m. 'If we had known the size of these extra cost figures during the bid, Airtours would have walked it,' said one disgruntled analyst. Owners shares shrugged off the negative talk and stayed steady at 111p. Airtours was also unmoved, at 286p. Stagecoach Holdings, the Scottish-based coach company, continued the long list of highly successful stock market flotations this year. The shares, placed at 112p, opened at 123p and were heavily traded all day, ending at 124p. Turnover reached 13m. There were no big surprises for the market in Tarmac's results, which showed a heavy Pounds 350m loss but a maintained dividend and no rights issue. Dealers said the big provisions had been well flagged for many weeks and the market was encouraged by the bullish statement accompanying the figures. Tarmac rose 8 to 141p on high turnover of 6.5m. Travis Perkins forged ahead 13 to 218p after maintaining the dividend in spite of the sharp fall in profits. Results from Sears were in line with market expectations. BZW upgraded the stores group by Pounds 8m to Pounds 123m for 1993 and to Pounds 144m for 1994. Boots recovered from Monday's mauling over its Manoplax drug, the shares improving 5 to 469p. Analysts said the US Food and Drug Administration had put the drug back on its emergency agenda. It is to be discussed on June 3. Asda saw hefty turnover of 33m shares and the stock eased a halfpenny to 72 1/2 p. Dealers said good two-way business focused on the depth of the supermarket group's recovery. The Pounds 85m convertible bond from Forte is likely to lead to investors switching out of the ordinary shares and into the higher yielding investment. The shares slipped 2 to 194 1/2 p. Results from Euro Disney, the French theme park operator, were badly received and the stock fell 38 to 895p. Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said an equity-raising excercise was vital to the heavily indebted group, as was the need to proceed with the second phase of the park's development. He suggested a convertible bond issue and help from the US Walt Disney group. Encouraging comments by Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster, at the bank's annual meeting in London triggered a flurry of support for the shares and helped the rest of the sector make good progress. The comment from Lord Alexander that 'we are over the worst as far as UK bad debts are concerned' saw NatWest pick up to close a net 5 higher at 473p on relatively heavy turnover of 6.3m. Barclays also performed well, adding 7 at 438p on 6.5m traded, while Lloyds rose 11 to 534p. HSBC, however, eased 3 to 612p. TSB gave up 2 to 187p, but there remained persistent talk in the market that a European predator may still be stalking the UK bank. Jeweller Ratners jumped 4 1/4 to 24 1/4 p on turnover of 5.8m as the market reacted to rumoured good trading news from Zales in the US. Leading textile group Coats Viyella held steady at 238p ahead of a buy note from one securities house which is due out today and said to value the shares at around 260p. Shanks &amp; McEwan was heavily traded after a securities house bought 8.5m shares from one institution at 183p a share and placed them with a variety of institutional clients at 186p, a 10p discount to the market price. Smith New Court, which specialises in large pre-arranged trades, made around Pounds 250,000 from the deal. Shanks shed 6 to 194p. Troubled specialty chemicals company MTM, which saw its share price collapse last year, slipped a further halfpenny to 11 1/2 p on suggestions of a statement today. British Aerospace gained 6 at 322p after upbeat comments from the group's chairman at its annual general meeting. McKechnie, the plastics and components group, eased 3 to 423p after making a recommended offer for USM-quoted Savage, manufacturer and distributor of home improvement accessories, valuing it at approximately Pounds 47.2m. Savage rose 6 to 77p.</p>

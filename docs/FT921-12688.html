			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Scott Paper to cut 10% jobs SCOTT PAPER, the world's largest manufacturer of toilet tissue, announced plans to cut its workforce by around 10 per cent, or 3,800. It will also take a Dollars 183m after-tax special charge in the fourth quarter, about half of it due to the job cuts, which will push it into losses for the period. Scott, which faces ferocious competition in the US, attributed the cuts to 'the difficult economic environment and highly competitive market conditions.' It estimated that fourth-quarter earnings, due to be announced on January 30, would total around 35 cents a share excluding the special charge, which would work through at about Dollars 2.49.</p>

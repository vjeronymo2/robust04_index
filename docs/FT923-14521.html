			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: LSO at the Barbican Sir Colin Davis was making one of his too infrequent London appearances to conduct three of his favourite composers - Beethoven, Berlioz, Stravinsky. In Stravinsky's 1923 Octet for wind, the LSO players could easily have managed without any conductor but Davis kept a benevolent eye and ear on the proceedings. It was probably he who ensured some particularly smooth transitions. Smooth, not bland, yet the Octet sounded less perkily mischievous than usual. Where we expect some fairly rude braying and chugging, the Stravinsky was svelteness and light. At first I thought it was simply losing some of its aural bite in this large hall; but then Beethoven's Eighth Symphony arrived with the same buoyantly innocent air, at least in the earlier movements. With the Finale, however, the old Davis spark (ie the younger Davis spark) asserted itself. The playing fizzed, and the sudden key-swerves in the music had their full disorienting force. Perhaps all that the mellowing of Sir Colin amounts to is that more than ever, in music he loves, his instinct is to make everything seem as lyrically natural as can be. If that is indeed his guiding principle now, the Berlioz Harold in Italy showed that it does not cramp his insights. Its soloist, Yuri Bashmet, a violist sans pareil; freighted Berlioz's curiously shy, edgy solo role with dense but classically controlled feeling. Davis's contribution was no less inspired. There is no more penetrating Berlioz conductor now. He went far beyond realising the familiar sonorous effects, beyond even his own distinguished performances in years past. The orchestral 'marginalia' set the score alight with fresh expressive sense. Some 20 years ago Sir Colin rehabilitated Berlioz for modern French musicians; his latest work sets a new, deceptively 'natural' standard for interpreters from anywhere.</p>

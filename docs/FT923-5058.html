			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / US and Israel under fire at Jakarta talks MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, yesterday criticised Israel for lack of progress at the Middle East peace negotiations. The PLO had expected Israel to 'take tangible, practical steps to push forward the peace process. Alas, however, repression is still continuing,' said Mr Arafat, addressing the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Jakarta. The PLO leader said proposals presented last week by Israel included 'a project for local administration aiming at whitewashing the occupation' of Palestinian territory. The role of the US in the Middle East was attacked by President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani of Iran, while Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, criticised the US-led 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq. Mr Rafsanjani said supporters of Israel 'have gained unprecedented and shameless presence in the region on the pretext of protecting Kuwait' and condemned 'the continuous interferences' by the US in the region. Dr Mahathir said he was perplexed by the the 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq, set up to protect the Shia community from attack by Baghdad. 'Maybe there are a lot of Shias in America,' he quipped. Commenting on Yugoslavia, Dr Mahathir said the failure of western countries to intervene is 'in stark contrast to the response to the alleged killings of Kurds in Iraq . . . even when the evidence (of the killings) is not clear'. Some delegates fear Dr Mahathir's approach to north-south relations will undermine the appeal by Indonesia, chairman of NAM, for a less confrontational dialogue with industrialised nations.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities' shareholders funds deficit CONTROL SECURITIES, the property and leisure group, said yesterday that a further write-down of property values and other exceptional costs totalling Pounds 68.4m, had left the company with a deficit on shareholders' funds of Pounds 31.8m. It called an extraordinary meeting for March 17 to ask shareholders to support the board's continued discussions with banks, bondholders and creditors. The shares have been suspended since October 1991. Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, said that the group's 'complex and delicate' restructuring was taking 'considerably longer than had been anticipated'. He said there were still some significant issues to be resolved. However, he said that holders of the group's SFr200m (Pounds 92m) of bonds would be offered equity in place of a quarter of the principal amount and a new repayment date on the rest of 2000. The two issues, each of SFr100m, have maturities in 1994 and 1997. Banks which lent to Control Securities have security over the group's assets and are not expected to swap any debt for equity. Control Securities is also negotiating with Bass, the leisure group, from which it bought some Spanish hotels in 1989. Bass was due to receive a final instalment of Pounds 11m last September, but has not yet been paid. The group announced interim results, for the period to September 30, showing trading profits slightly lower at Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 17.7m) on sales 11 per cent higher at Pounds 56.2m. However, interest charges of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 12.8m) and the exceptional costs left losses of Pounds 68.5m before tax (profit Pounds 4.4m). The net loss was Pounds 62.1m or 16.73p a share (profit Pounds 2.1m and earnings per share of 0.56p). The exceptional costs included a Pounds 52.8m write down of property values. This largely related to a valuation done at December 31 on a 'Red Book' basis - complying with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors guidance on property valuation - necessary before the company's shares could be relisted. The valuation basis assumes sales of properties within a short time period, while Control Securities' business plan envisages a controlled sale of assets over a longer period. Mr Robin said 'this valuation basis has been the prime cause of the requirement for additional write-downs against UK property values.' He said the directors believed they could realise better values. The exceptional items also included a debit of Pounds 14.4m covering the effect on the principal value of the Swiss franc bonds caused by sterling's devaluation. The group had covered its exposure to the Swiss franc until mid-August, but could not continue to do so after that. At the trading level, the property division contributed Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 7.5m), mainly because of a fall in rental income as some properties were vacated when tenants failed. The leisure division made an unchanged Pounds 10.6m. See Observer</p>

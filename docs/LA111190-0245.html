			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CO-OPS TO CONDOS  </P> <P> This is in response to the Sept. 23 letter from Herbert H. Fisher regarding our  article titled "Southland Hot Spot: Converting Co-Ops to Condos" (July 22).  </P> <P> Fisher's letter contained the following incorrect statements regarding co-ops  and their conversion to condominiums:  </P> <P> 1 -- "Property taxes could be affected by a conversion."  </P> <P> In California property taxes are unaffected by a conversion from a co-op to a  condominium. Reassessment will apply only to units sold. The conversion itself  does not trigger a reassessment.  </P> <P> 2 -- "Community control over property is significantly altered."  </P> <P> In California the laws, statutes and procedures governing the homeowners  association control over comunity projects are the same for co-ops and  condominiums.  </P> <P> 3 -- "The individual owner now assumes personal mortgage liability as a condo  owner, which the shareholder did not have as a cooperative."  </P> <P> In most co-ops in California the shareholders already have individual loans on  their co-op units along with the associated personal mortgage liability. This  liability is the same as that of an owner of a condo with a mortgage.  </P> <P> In co-ops with one blanket loan for the entire project, each shareholder is  personally responsible for payment of the entire loan amount throgh the  association. If one co-op shareholder does not make his loan payment, then all  the other owners must make up that amount, otherwise the lender can foreclose  on the entire project.  </P> <P> In a condominium, the owner is responsible only for his own loan.  </P> <P> 4 -- "They (co-op owners) have no desire to be part of a more expensive . . .  form of mutual home ownership."  </P> <P> It is not clear when Mr. Fisher uses the term "more expensive" if he is  referring to the operating expense of the association or the value of the unit  as a condo versus a co-op. The value of a co-op typically increases when it  becomes a condo. The conversion almost never changes the operating expenses.  </P> <P> Fisher also states that financing is available for co-ops. This financing is  very limited in California.  </P> <P> STEVEN J. SOLOMON, Redondo Beach. Solomon is president of Condominium  Conversions Inc.  </P> <P> </P></p>

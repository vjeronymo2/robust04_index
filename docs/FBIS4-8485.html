			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ion Marin: "What the Grain Mafia is Pursuing"] </F>   [Text] Immediately after the revolution, a strange  phenomenon occurred in Romanian agriculture. Wishing to lend  credence to the idea that the figures of the Ceausescu era were  inflated not one or two times but 10 times, the  postrevolutionary government, with its spearhead, the Ministry  of Agriculture, began to systematically reduce the areas sown to  crops and to resort to massive imports through specialized firms  -- that is, by means of a network of a few magnates with an  influence on some parties in power. The result is well-known.  The individuals concerned became rich in defiance of the people,  who were subjected to a slow but certain process of starvation.    In 1992, the grain yield was only 10.5 million tons. The  technique perfected by the importers is simple: the reduction of  the sown area from more than three million hectares to less than  two million hectares, under conditions in which sowing was  executed only after the best period. At the same time, the  merry-go-round of imports was accelerated by an average of $1  billion a year! Wheat was imported -- from one West European  country, in particular -- at $155-160 a ton. When there was no  need for wheat -- in 1990, for example -- the magnates contented  themselves with importing fodder, for which $800 million were  paid. This is how they arrived at the incredible amount of $3  billion, which was paid by the Romanian state for wheat and  fodder in 1990, 1991, and 1992 alone, a sum which represents 80  percent of the total accumulated foreign debt. This debt paid by  the Romanians was for commissions of about 5-10 percent, which  went into the bottomless pockets of the big importers and their  accomplices who governed the country in the respective years.  Instead of being held responsible for this pillage and for the  deliberate destruction of agriculture, these people still occupy  important positions or comfortable seats in Parliament where  they continue to boycott agriculture.    A bank director who was recently removed from his position  has begun to make statements in various newspapers about the  pressure exerted on him to initiate letters of credit for the  import of millions of tons of grain, which were not needed, as  he maintains now and as was well-known then. However, it seems  that no one from the General Parquet or from the government or  the Parliament paid any attention to such statements. Instead,  there has been a lot of talk about some more or less obvious  abuses occurring in some hamlet or some former agricultural  production cooperative for which the current leadership of the  Ministry of Agriculture is blamed! The fault of the minister is  indeed great in the eyes of those who make such claims since the  current minister of agriculture, with the support of the prime  minister, has categorically refused to take into account the  blackmail, exercised by all economic and political means, for  continuing the import of grain and further indebting the  country's treasury. In addition, he has undertaken to increase  the areas sown by more than a million hectares, resulting in  grain yields of more than 15.5 million tons in 1993, over 5  million tons more than in the year, which was most profitable  for the mafia of importers. In this situation, which was so  disastrous for it, the importers' union, which has as its  eminence grise the father-in-law of an influential politician  who is highly regarded by the voters, was fully mobilized by  some trade union organizations and by the lobby in Cotroceni  Palace [presidential office] and Victory Palace [headquarters of  the government], with a great chance of success. Last year, this  trade union of the grain mafia, presenting data collected by  American satellites, called upon the Government of Romania to  import 1.5 million tons of wheat, but when it realized that it  could not force the hand of the government it brought tractors  into Victory Square and unleashed a wave of protests by means of  a "peasant" trade union composed of city-dwellers. The current  mobilization of the grain mafia has been prompted by the  obstinacy of the government officials who have decided to double  the area sown to sugarbeets, making it impossible to import  sugar, which has brought so many millions of dollars of profit  to these greedy racketeers. These gentlemen also received  support, intentionally or not, for the destruction of the  country's agriculture, from the banks, which loaned money, in  dribs and drabs, at an exorbitantly high rate of interest. As a  result, interest fees represent 60 percent of the cost of a ton  of agricultural product and the animal husbandry sector has been  destroyed.    What is under discussion now is not the exchange of one team  for another but the return to the rudder of agriculture of those  who have shown that they have no other interest besides driving  agriculture to the ground. In future issues of the newspaper we  will provide documents and name the people involved.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazuichi Sekiguchi, industrial news department </F> reporter, fifth and last in the series "Field Report on Market  Opening": "Recognition Gap: There Are Differences in Basic  Data"]    [Text] "The U.S. Government does not understand the actual  situation concerning the Japanese market." On 1 April, Ken  Suzuki, managing director of the Japan Electric Industry  Development Association, a computer industry organization,  expressed his grievance after reviewing details of the "1994  National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers"  announced by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Japanese Government's procurement of foreign computers is  steadily increasing following the Japan-U.S. agreement reached  in January 1992. However, the USTR report pointed out that "the  share of foreign products on the Japanese market is decreasing."  <H5>  "The United States Is Eager To Increase Items of Japan's </H5> Trade Barriers"    The latest report claimed that barriers to trade in the  Japanese market existed for 43 items, the most ever. There are  44 pages pertaining to Japan, more than double the amount of  pages the Bush administration devoted to Japan. Masakazu  Toyoda, chief of the America-Oceania Division of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], pointed out: "The  Clinton administration is eager to increase the number of items  listed as Japan's trade barriers. Most of them have been  settled under the Japan-U.S. agreements." He added: "Moreover,  a problem is that the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is  closed is based on groundless, unclear data."    As for government procurement of computers, a MITI survey  shows that the share of foreign products at ministries and  agencies increased from 4.1 percent in fiscal 1991 to 10.2  percent in fiscal 1992. However, the USTR report points out  that the share decreased from 4.0 percent in fiscal 1991 to 3.7  percent in fiscal 1992. Mr. Toyoda stated that although there  are differences in the means of arriving at the stated figures,  it is exceedingly unusual that the results of the surveys were  so different, especially in terms of the direction of change of  procurement shares.    The Japanese Government procured 11 supercomputers using  supplementary budget funds allocated for fiscal 1993. Of these,  six units are U.S.-made products. However, the USTR report  still listed the sector as encumbered by trade barriers, saying:  "U.S. companies were only able to receive orders in biddings in  which Japanese companies did not participate."    Originally, the Japanese industry had urged the government  to  place orders for the 11 supercomputers as a measure to stimulate  the economy. Mr. Suzuki said: "We did not expect that U.S.  firms would win the half of the orders. Conversely, this proves  that the Japanese market is open enough."  <H5>  The U.S. Government Depends on Results of Industries' Surveys </H5>   Such differences in figures as well as in evaluations are  noted everywhere in the USTR report. In many cases, the USTR  office, which is comprised of a select few people of superior  ability, depends on statistics presented by industries when it  compiles data on market surveys. The U.S. industries are liable  to present figures favorable to them. Seikei University  Professor Mitsuo Matsushita said: "The U.S. Government's  practice of coming to one- sided judgment causes mutual distrust  between Japan and the United States."    Moreover, there are not a few cases where the U.S.  Government  easily reacts to requests made by industrial lobbyists." Many  business managers maintain that Japanese and U.S. "private  sectors are getting along with each other" in the semiconductor  and automotive industries (as stated by Toshiba Corporation  President Fumio Sato). There is a case noted in the  construction sector that although private companies in the  United States have no complaints against Japan, the U.S.  Government itself is attacking Japan to eliminate the closed  nature of the Japanese market.    The Japanese Government compiles a Japanese version of an  "unfair trade report" every spring, with Professor Matsushita  playing a leading role. The Japanese report analyzes issues  concerning the U.S. legal system, including the antidumping law  and the buy-American law, in the light of such agreements as  GATT. On the other hand, a "problem with the U.S. report lies  in the fact that the United States evaluates Japan's business  practices such as keiretsu based on its own value system" (as  stated by Professor Matsushita).    Such a gap in recognition between Japan and the United  States  is shown in their approach toward Japan-U.S. agreements. USTR  Kantor and other U.S. officials stress: "Although 33 agreements  now exist between Japan and the United States, Japan has failed  to fulfill them faithfully." However, the Japanese Government  refutes this, saying: "Somewhat more than 20 Japan-U.S.  agreements exist. The U.S. way of counting them is obviously  arbitrary" (according to the Foreign Ministry).  <H5>  "The Government Arbitrarily...." </H5>   Nihon University Professor Tadakuni Nogimura points out that  "the fact is that Japan also has a problem concerning a lack of  understanding." For example, the duties of MITI division chiefs  change about every two years. While documents on past  agreements are kept at offices, there are many cases in which  concrete details of negotiations are not completely handed over  from departing officials to their successors. Because officials  in charge of negotiations try to reach agreements of any sort  during their term of office, they sometimes conclude temporary  agreements.    The 1992 Japan-U.S. agreement set a target for Japan's  purchase of auto parts for fiscal 1994 of $19 billion. In this  regard, many people in the automotive industry say: "The  government, at its own discretion, compiled targets for efforts  shown by the industry, and presented them to the United States."  The aim of the Clinton administration is to have Japan fulfill  all of the agreements reached in the past.    A problem also lies in a lack of understanding between the  Japanese Government and industries. Recently, it has been  revealed that, in a document on the Japan-U.S. mobile phone  accord worked out by the Ministry of Post and  Telecommunications, there is an expression that could be  interpreted as the government guaranteeing accords between the  Japanese and U.S. private sectors. There is a famous case of a  note attached to the 1986 Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement  which stipulated that the share of foreign semiconductor  products of the Japanese market should reach 20 percent.  Professor Nogimura said: "The government seldom informs the  private sector of unfavorable information."    Even if the private sector is making efforts to open markets  at the government's request, it cannot be said from the latest  USTR report that its efforts are highly evaluated by the United  States. At a time when the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  are suspended, the computer industry is not the only industry  that is indignant over the Japanese Government's negotiations  with the United States.</p>

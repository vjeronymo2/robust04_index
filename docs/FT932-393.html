			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Observer: Money doesn't talk John Campbell's monumental biography of Sir Edward Heath will be published on Thursday and has already been criticised, notably by Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, for being far too long. On one subject, however, it is remarkably brief: money. Campbell writes that when Heath became party leader in 1965 'it seems that his personal finances were discreetly managed for him and his money well invested. 'The Tory party has ways of ensuring that its leader is not financially embarrassed.' Apart from adding that the main reason Heath could afford to sail was that he was unmarried, that's about it. Clearly the party's backers of the 1960s were more discreet than those of 20 years later.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Leading Article: After Taurus - City lessons WHAT lessons are there for the City in the collapse of the Taurus project? Mr Peter Rawlins, who lost his job as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange over the failure of the exchange's ambitious project of computerising equity settlement, thinks the lessons are wide-ranging. 'To characterise it simply as a Stock Exchange failure, or as a failure just of the technology, is to miss the point,' he said last week. Mr Rawlins argues that the Taurus project became unmanageable because the City failed to agree on a specification which could actually be built. 'There is a real City management problem here,' he said. 'It could happen again.' The point Mr Rawlins is making reflects a shift in the way the City works. Once, it was dominated by the heads of powerful institutions - the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's, the Accepting Houses Committee - who possessed enough clout to get what they wanted. Those days are gone. The old institutions have lost their influence. The newly important bodies in the City - the Securities and Investments Board, the Eurobond trade-association-cum-regulator, and so on - see their roles in much more narrow terms. Increasingly, there is only one 'communal' body left, its prestige tarnished but its role if anything enhanced: the Bank of England. It is not surprising that the Bank ended up picking up the pieces of Taurus; whenever the City sneezes, these days, the Bank is asked to supply the handkerchief. The Bank's approach - collegiate, calm, rational-men-together - has its virtues. But it risks producing consensus at the price of something for everyone. It was a Bank-sponsored committee, after all, which saddled the City with the unbuildable Taurus blueprint. Market competition So far, so depressing. It would be easy for this debate to drift, like many discussions in Britain, into a lament for past glories, and an elegy for a time of giants. Another way of looking at the issues involved, however, is to see them as the inevitable result of the introduction of competition into London's financial markets. Economic theory teaches us that in a truly competitive market, with easy access for new entrants, it is hard to reach agreement on sharing the costs of projects which benefit everyone. It is much easier, and much more rewarding, to be a 'free rider', coasting along on the back of others' efforts, than to contribute oneself. To entice free riders to contribute, they must be promised something for their efforts, risking the creation of unmanageable projects like Taurus. The City's difficulty in reaching agreement on shared projects is therefore the mirror image of its progress in becoming a more competitive marketplace. Settlement system That may be a plausible explanation. It still leaves the London equity market without a modern settlement system, however - and, perhaps, without other desirable shared undertakings in future. When a shared project is truly a common good, the state, with its powers of taxation and coercion, is the only institution capable of overcoming the free rider problem. Precisely because those powers are so great, however, they must be used sparingly. A working legal system is certainly a public good worthy of the state's attention; an equity settlement system may not be. Where does that leave desirable-but-not-essential projects? Answer: in limbo, their outcome subject to chance, and the diplomacy of the project's proponents. If that seems unsatisfactory, consider the alternatives, neatly illustrated by London's two principal rivals as European financial centres. In Frankfurt, the club ethos still rules, but is fraying at the edges as participants start to grapple with the harsh lessons of competitive financial markets. In Paris, the state eagerly ensures the provision of public goods - at the risk of providing more than the market needs and stifling competition in the process. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. London has chosen a model in which, increasingly, competition rules. If that occasionally results in a spectacular mess like the Taurus affair, so be it: capitalism is a very messy process.</p>

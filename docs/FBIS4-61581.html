			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Foreigners Leave Yemen, Which </F> Is in the Grip of Civil War"]    [Excerpt] Boris Yeltsin has issued a directive to commence  the evacuation of Russian citizens working in Yemen.    French warships have taken on board 150 people -- mainly  women and children -- and taken them from Aden to the port of  Djibouti, together with staffers of other foreign embassies.    From there they will be brought to Moscow in the near future  by a special flight organized by the Ministry for Emergency  Situations.    In all, some 950 Russians are in Yemen on official business.  They are diplomats, civilian and military specialists, and  representatives of Aeroflot and of commercial organizations.  The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry has informed us that at  the first stage the objective is to evacuate all Russian  personnel from the southern part of Yemen, where events have  become most alarming. The situation is somewhat calmer around  Sanaa, the northern capital of this Arab state of 9 million  inhabitants. In the event of a further exacerbation of the  conflict, urgent measures will be taken to ensure the safety of  all Russian citizens. [passage omitted]</p>

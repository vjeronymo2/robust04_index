			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (8): New services abound for businesses in the UK - Call charges fall for fixed and mobile communications / It could be argued that the success of competition in the UK has strengthened the case for telecoms liberalisation across Europe Competition and new technologies have transformed the shape of telecommunications in Britain in the ten years since British Telecommunications was privatised. New network operators and service providers have entered the market and prices for both fixed and mobile services are tumbling. Oftel, the UK telecoms regulator, has forced BT to bring its call charges down sharply to reflect the falling cost of delivering calls as new technology cuts overheads. The latest price reductions announced by BT early last month mean that, in real terms, UK long-distance calls are barely a third of the cost a decade ago. Meanwhile, a new band of telecom companies have appeared providing specialist value added network services (Vans) such as electronic digital interchange (EDI) and electronic mail. Others, many of them with foreign parents, are building advanced digital networks, including some dedicated to mobile data. As basic voice telephony services become more of a commodity item, 're-sellers' leasing spare capacity and repackaging it at knock-down prices, have begun to appear. In cellular mobile telecommunications, consumers in some parts of Britain can now choose from an array of competing tariff structures offered by four competing network operators on four digital and two older analogue networks. Other competitors offer mobile services over public access mobile radio and satellite-based networks. All this has been achieved against the backdrop of government policy which has turned the UK into the most liberalised telecoms regime in Europe and in some areas - for example, cable telephony - made Britain a test-bed for the world. The privatisation of BT and the licensing of Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of Cable Wireless in 1984 to build a competing national network, heralded a period of unprecedented change in the UK telecoms industry. Ten years later, BT still boasts a 90 per share of the total market for telecoms services in the UK, and according to most projections, will only loosen its grip by a few percentage points a year. Nevertheless, business customers in particular can now select an ever-wider range of telecommunications services from a growing number of vendors. Mercury has captured about a quarter of the large business market and about two-thirds of the City of London's outgoing traffic. Mercury - which initially competed primarily on price - is, however, now facing tougher competition from a leaner, more aggressive BT, and from new entrants pursuing the lucrative business market. These new competitors have sprung up in the past three years since the government decided to end the BT/Mercury long distance duopoly and announced its willingness to license new public operators, either building their own networks or reselling services provided over existing networks. At the same time, the government went one step further and became the first country in the world to allow cable companies with franchises in urban areas, to build combined TV and telephony networks - thus providing direct competition in the 'local loop.' In order to give the cable network builders a head start, BT was banned from offering entertainment services over its telecoms network for a decade. As a result, cable companies - many US-owned - have piled into the UK market attracted by the prospect of a double income stream. Where new cable network operators have offered telephony services, the take-up in some areas has been running at more than 50 per cent. Cable franchises have so far installed over 500,000 telephone lines in more than 30 areas and the Cable Television Association has forecast that exchange line connections will rise to more than 700,000 by the end of this year. Although this still only represents a small dent in BT's dominance of the residential market, BT has nevertheless felt the need to counter-attack by sending 'win-back' teams into areas targeted by the cable companies. Nevertheless, Dataquest, the market research organisation, forecasts that business and residential customers for cable telephony will be renting 1.5m telephone lines out of a total of 29.3m on the public switched telephone network in 1997, representing five per cent of the market. By the turn of the century, Barclays de Zoete Wedd analysts suggest cable could be costing BT up to Pounds 1bn a year in lost revenues. BT is expected to recoup some of that lost revenue in charges for linking cable systems into its trunk network, but it will be competing for business with Mercury and other new long-distance telephone companies. Since 1991, more than 40 new operators have been licensed to provide telecoms services in the UK. Most of the licenses are for specialised or regional services but some, including a license awarded to Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid, are for national networks. Energis, which began operations in June, has built a 3,500km nationwide optical-fibre network using National Grid's pylons. Last month, Energis announced that it was teaming up with Colt, which provides local network services in London, to provide seamless national telecom services. Colt has 55km of fibre network installed around the City of London, serving nearly 170 buildings and has also extended its network into Westminster and Docklands. Colt is one of three new operators now building their own infrastructure in the City specifically to serve the corporate sector. Another, MFS which was launched in March this year, offers free line-rental to customers with bills of Pounds 600 or more per line per year. Its fibre network covers most of the City and Docklands and is being extended to Southwark and Westminster. The City has also attracted a growing array of re-sellers - operators leasing capacity from others and re-selling it at a discount to standard tariffs, often providing their own switching facilities and direct links to customer premises. Three US groups, Worldcom, Sprint, and ACC and Esprit, a private UK-based operator, are the among the most prominent re-sellers. The re-sellers concentrate on international traffic, but most also offer a re-sale service within the UK. Worldcom, which set up in London in 1991 and aims to undercut Mercury business prices by between 10 and 15 per cent, now has more than 250 business customers and claims to have cornered nearly three per cent of the UK's outgoing international telecoms traffic. Competition is not, however, limited to fixed-line services. Britain's cellular telephone industry is amongst the most developed and competitive in Europe. In the UK, the government seized upon the advent of cellular telephony in the early 1980s to further foster competition. From the outset, two cellular operators were licensed and BT was only allowed to take a 60 per cent stake in one of them. The government's aggressive policy towards competition has not always worked, however - Telepoint services such as Hutchison Telecom's ill-fated Rabbit network, based on digital cordless telephony, proved to be a business flop in the early 1990s despite the financial backing of international consortia. Similarly, only two Personal Communications Networks (PCN) systems have been built, although four licenses were originally awarded. Nevertheless, most analysts agree that the UK's cellular mobile telephone network strategy has been effective in stimulating subscriber growth and effective price competition. The UK now has four cellular network operators with 2.6m subscribers between them: Vodafone, launched as a subsidiary of Racal Electronics but de-merged in 1991; Cellnet, a joint venture between BT and Securicor; Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury and US West, one of the US regional Bell companies; and Orange, whose largest shareholder is Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate. Vodafone and Cellnet, the original competitors, both have analogue and digital GSM networks, while One-2-One, launched last year, and Orange, which was launched earlier this year, were the first PCN networks in the world. Fueled by falling handset prices, aggressive marketing and tumbling tariffs, these cellular services have proved increasingly popular with net new connections to mobile networks overtaking fixed network connections to BT and the cable TV companies for the first time last December. One-2-One has been particularly bold, offering residential customers free off-peak calls in an effort to broaden the base of mobile subscribers, while Orange's strategy has been directed more towards business customers. As with fixed telecoms, there is little doubt that competition between cellular operators has helped bring prices down for the first time, broadened the range of services on offer and helped encourage subscriber growth. Perhaps, more contentiously, the success of competition in the UK, has strengthened the case for telecoms liberalisation across Europe.</p>

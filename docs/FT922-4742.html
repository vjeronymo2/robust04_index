			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour wavers on Maastricht referendum THE prospect of inflicting a damaging Commons defeat on the government is raising the pressure on Labour's leadership to reconsider its opposition to a British referendum on the terms of the Maastricht treaty. After Mr John Major, the prime minister, had again ruled out a poll, Labour business managers conceded that there was now 'a head of steam' growing among MPs for a shift in strategy. With the Liberal Democrats, Conservative rebels and some other minority parties firmly backing a plebiscite, Labour would have a real possibility of a morale-boosting victory should it seize the opportunity in the wake of France's decision to hold a poll. The problem for Mr Neil Kinnock, who discussed the matter with shadow cabinet colleagues last night, is that such a move would conflict with the view he clearly expressed before the the election that complex European Community questions should be left to the Commons. Nonetheless, there were clear signs within the parliamentary Labour party yesterday that the Danish referendum and President Francois Mitterrand's pledge have altered opinions. A motion tabled by Mr Tony Benn, urging support for an amendment to the Maastricht bill demanding a referendum, appeared to be winning tacit support well beyond Labour's rump group of Euro-sceptic MPs, including that of some frontbenchers who support closer European union. After the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party, addressed by both Mr Bryan Gould and Mr John Smith, the two candidates for the leadership both expressed scepticism on the value of a plebiscite. However, with Mr Benn's motion likely to be put to the PLP next week, neither would definitively rule out the option. Later Mr Gould - whose campaign manager, Mr David Blunkett, publicly backs a referendum - appeared to be warming to the idea when he conceded that it did offer 'a means of testing public opinion'. Much will depend on how Brussels reacts to the Danish vote over the next few days. Senior party officials indicated last night that a final decision would probably come next week. Earlier Mr Kinnock insisted at the PLP meeting that the treaty was now 'defunct or in hibernation'. However, Mr Benn pointed out that Labour had at first been sceptical about his proposal in 1970 to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European Community, but changed its stance later when France decided to hold a national plebiscite on its application. It was absurd that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had hinted that Denmark might hold a second referendum when the UK was not being allowed one, he said. Mr John Smith, in his address to the parliamentary party, pledged yesterday that as leader he would to give a stronger voice to Labour's new intake of MPs by offering some places on a revived 'review committee' to examine the working methods of the parliamentary party.</p>

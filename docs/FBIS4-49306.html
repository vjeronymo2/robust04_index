			<p>BFN     [Text] To encourage the province's construction enterprises  and establishments as well as their staff and workers to  energetically develop the export-oriented economy, the  construction department, the foreign economic relations and  trade department, the financial department, the personnel  department, the foreign affairs office, the labor department,  the tax affairs bureau, and the foreign exchange bureau of the  province jointly issued, a few days ago, "several policies and  regulations on encouraging construction departments in Liaoning  Province to search for larger international markets and to open  wider to the world."    These policies are mainly devoted to encouraging  construction  enterprises to seek contracts for foreign construction projects,  to conduct labor service cooperation, and to engage in real  estate business beyond the limitations of the countries and  trade. Under these policies, enterprises that have appropriate  conditions are encouraged to set up branch agencies and sales  service centers abroad. For the staff and workers of these  enterprises who have independently sought out foreign traders in  an effort to work abroad, in accordance with employment  contracts, their enterprises should keep them on the roster with  no pay and should conduct exit formalities on their behalf by  collecting a certain amount of expenses from them. For the  staff and workers who engage in foreign labor or management  service abroad with the approval of their original units and who  have paid the old-age cash deposit to their units or to domestic  labor insurance companies, their service abroad can be included  in their length of service, and their wages on file can also be  raised in accordance with the state unified wage readjustment.  When these staff members and workers retire, they can enjoy the  same treatment enjoyed by other staff members and workers. For  personnel residing abroad, their spouses may also be sent abroad  for employment or to accompany them. If responsible enterprise  personnel located outside the territory have worked abroad for  over a year, their spouses are allowed to accompany them and  corresponding jobs for spouses should be arranged in line with  the demands or spouse allowances should be given. The personnel  residing abroad may enjoy one-month home leave every year.    The policies also stipulate: Enterprises should be  vigorously encouraged to absorb foreign funds and to initiate  Chinese-foreign joint ventures or cooperative enterprises.  Enterprises should also be encouraged to use their existing  sites, plant houses, equipment, property rights, and the  self-owned funds to run joint ventures and cooperative  enterprises and to carry out technological transformation of  enterprises and to build urban infrastructure. Great efforts  should be made to attract foreign investors to engage in real  estate development. If it is demanded, enterprises are allowed  to invite foreign specialists and scholars with high salaries.  Those who have been able to bring in funds, projects,  technologies, and professionals for their units and those who  have offered good advice and suggestions for opening their units  to the outside world should all be given cash awards, and those  whose contributions are outstanding should be given handsome  rewards. Those who are able to assist their units by obtaining  project or scientific research results and well-trained,  specialized personnel, including those studying abroad, can be  transferred to construction units. Preferential treatment  should be given to them in line with the regulations by cadre  management authority.</p>

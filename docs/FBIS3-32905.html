The importance  of Trinidad's tourism hub increases each year, not only by the  growth in its capacity but by the wealth and beauty of its  facilities.    Osmani Cienfuegos was accompanied by Jorge Valdez Rodriguez,  first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in the region,  and other PCC and government officials. The Politburo member was  briefed on prospects for tourism development in Trinidad and  asked about the thoroughness of studies conducted to guarantee  the success of the new investments.    Osmani Cienfuegos also participated in the inauguration of  the Santa Ana Foundation multipurpose center, built from a  150-year-old former prison by a specialized brigade of the  People's Government. The facility, which will be used for  international tourism in a effort to develop the economy, has a  restaurant, cafeteria, two bars, Comintur stores, and facilities  for pottery and handicraft sales. Folk shows and other  activities will be held at the main square, which can hold 150  persons.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Oleksandr Moroz </F> in Kiev -- live]    [Excerpts] Dear compatriots, esteemed comrades, and my  honorable competitors: Lately we have heard so many horror  stories about a change of the president leading to a civil war  in Ukraine. I can only say I am an optimist and am convinced  nothing grave will happen.    We shall build a strong, prosperous Ukrainian state, but  only  by working, being together, and not hoping for some  extraordinary help. [passage omitted]    I believe the president's role must above all be to  consolidate all power structures and enable the organization of  power both centrally and locally. [passage omitted]    We today formed a working commission at the Supreme Council,  which is to check the program of privatization and sort out who  has taken what for how much and on what conditions. If someone  has taken something unlawfully, they should put it back.    We have a different view on the problem of land reform. I  have established this by collating positions by many of  Ukraine's citizens and know that Ukrainian land must not become  a commodity and must not be sold out. Otherwise, there shall be  no justification for us in the future. [passage omitted]    I believe we must introduce serious changes to our state's  domestic and foreign policy. I can explain the details of these  changes when answering questions. I would, nevertheless, like  to briefly describe the contents of two other very important key  elements. One of them is the issue of international economic  cooperation. It is not only with Russia that we must have good  economic relations, but also with the other countries that  formerly constituted the USSR and that are now our neighbors.    One more thing is to do with the independence of our  Ukraine.  I shall say the following, which is quite unorthodox: I  believe we must have an independent Ukraine. But independence  is only the state where people populating it feel independent.  It is in that respect that we shall still have to do a great  deal. But there will only be success if we act together, from  top to bottom. So I am asking you, esteemed electors, on the  evening of 26 June, to help me form the power structures that  will work as a team.</p>

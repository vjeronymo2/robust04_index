			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities It is a measure of the resilience of UK equities that the market was not prepared to retreat on the threat of civil strife in Russia, but advanced as the crisis was resolved. True, the rise in the FT-SE 100 index was led in the futures market and the lower echelons of the cash market were left trailing. But that need not undermine the significance of yesterday's rally. If overseas investors are taking positions for the fourth quarter and the new account, the futures market may simply be the first port of call. That said, there was nothing in yesterday's consumer lending figures which might rekindle hopes of an interest rate cut to please the faithful at the Conservative party conference. The picture is not as rosy as the headline net borrowing figure suggests. Finance houses gained business from the strong new car market. The rush to take advantage of favourable credit terms from motor manufacturers could easily dwindle as special offers are withdrawn. Credit card companies - probably a better indicator of overall consumer confidence - saw net repayments in August. With retail sales on an upward trend and narrow money growing faster than the government's target range, though, the chancellor still has good reasons for delaying any rate cut.</p>

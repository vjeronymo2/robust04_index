			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Mulroney rejigs Canadian cabinet ahead of poll SEVERAL veteran Canadian ministers are stepping down as part of a cabinet shuffle designed to freshen the face of the Progressive Conservative government ahead of the next general election. Those stepping down include Mr Marcel Masse, the controversial defence minister; Mr Jake Epp, energy minister; and Mr Robert de Cotret, secretary of state. Announcing the shuffle yesterday, Mr Brian Mulroney, who has been prime minister since September 1984, gave no clue to his own intentions. Speculation is rife that he will also step aside in the next few months. His personal popularity remains at rock-bottom with only about one in five voters approving of his performance. It is widely thought that a new leader would greatly improve the Conservatives' chances in the election, likely to be held in the summer or early autumn. The latest shuffle will trim the cabinet from 39 to 35 ministers, in keeping with efforts by the government to project an image of restraint and improved efficiency. Mr Masse will be succeeded as defence minister by Ms Kim Campbell, who previously held the justice portfolio. Ms Campbell, a forceful and bilingual British Columbian, is the favourite to take over as party leader if Mr Mulroney quits. Mr William McKnight, previously agriculture minister, takes over the energy portfolio. Mr Mulroney said another reshuffle was likely before the election. Several other senior ministers are said to be contemplating their futures and may announce their retirement from politics before the election. These include Mr Michael Wilson, the trade and industry minister.</p>

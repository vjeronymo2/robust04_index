			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH : THE BARD ON BOARDS AT SANTA MONICA PIER; PROGRESS REPORT ON  EQUITY-ATLAS TALKS  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Pier will become a theater in August. The Pacific Theatre  Ensemble will venture out over the Pacific, presenting a Shakespearean comedy  in a 200-seat space at the western end of the pier.  </P> <P> Admission will be free. The city is putting up $15,000 for the production, and  the ensemble hopes to match that amount in a fund-raising campaign, said  artistic director Stephanie Shroyer. This will be the first Actors'  Equity-contract show for the ensemble, which has won acclaim for its  smaller-theater productions of such shows as "Slaughterhouse on Tanner's Close"  and "South Central Rain."  </P> <P> The Pacific Theatre Ensemble won't be the only theatrical group on the pier.  The Aresis Ensemble, formerly based at the Off-Main Street Theatre, plans to  present a production of "Wozzeck" in a 49-seat space next to the carrousel in  September, said the group's Charles Duncombe. Aresis has arranged to rent the  space from the Pier Restoration Corp. for six months at $10 a month.  </P> <P> CONTRACT APPROVED: The organization of smaller-theater producers, Associated  Theatres of Los Angeles (ATLAS), has approved a new Actors' Equity contract  that would allow smaller-theater productions to extend runs beyond the 80  performances allowed under Equity's 99-seat plan.  </P> <P> While the contract has yet to be endorsed by the Equity board, Equity already  has used many of its provisions in an individual contract for "On Tina Tuna  Walk," at the Zephyr. "Tina Tuna" will pass the 80-performance mark Friday. Its  producers are not ATLAS members.  </P> <P> The contract calls for a sliding scale of payments per actor per performance,  from $20 for one performance each week to $15 for shows that give four or more  performances each week. It also provides for payments to Equity's pension and  health funds.  </P> <P> Prospects are much darker for an Equity-ATLAS contract governing  smaller-theater shows that move to larger theaters. "We have called a hiatus in  the talks," said ATLAS chairman Laura Zucker, "because I didn't think we were  getting anywhere." She wants the issues "to percolate in the community" before  talks resume.  </P> <P> The major issues, according to Zucker: Should the contract include provisions  for part-time performance schedules (ATLAS says yes)? Should it cover theaters  with as many as 399 seats (ATLAS' idea) or only 299 (Equity's)? And, she  continued, "we're very far apart on money." She claimed that Equity "wants us  to pay as much as 40%-50% of the gross to actors" under contracts "comparable  to other cities. But we do not yet have the subsidies here to pay for it."  </P> <P> Equity Western Regional director Edward Weston declined to respond to Zucker's  specific comments, but he remarked that ATLAS officials "had (earlier) argued  that the new 99-seat plan would be the end of small theater. They should  reconsider their objections and be a little more realistic."  </P> <P> Referring to Zucker's desire to let the issues "percolate," he said: "I'd  rather negotiate than percolate. Let's keep the lid on the coffeepot."  </P> <P> DIRECTORS STRIKE?: The Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers will  strike the League of Resident Theatres if agreement on a new contract isn't  reached by Aug. 8.  </P> <P> The vote to reject the league's latest offer was taken at five union membership  meetings -- in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago -- but  only 18% of the members voted. Of 1,038 members, 114 voted to reject, 74 to  accept.  </P> <P> The 67 league theaters include the Mark Taper Forum, South Coast Repertory, La  Jolla Playhouse and the Old Globe. Thomas Hall, managing director of the Old  Globe and president of the League of Resident Theatres, said Tuesday: "I don't  have anything to offer at this moment that would hold out any hope" for further  negotiations.  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: NTT hopes London listing will lift profile Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's public telecommunications operator and the world's biggest company by market capitalisation - it is valued at Y13,603bn (Dollars 135.2bn) - will today be listed on the London Stock Exchange. NTT hopes the listing will lift its foreign profile, improve its ability to raise equity internationally and stimulate foreign business alliances. This follows the listing of NTT American Depositary Receipts in New York on September 29. 'With the advent of multi-media, we are pursuing affiliations and tie-ups with various companies and countries and believe a listing will heighten our name recognition,' said Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president. NTT's foreign listings come as it is preparing to face a fresh battle against plans by the ministry of posts and telecommunications to split up its long-distance and local businesses. The ministry hopes, in a review of the structure of Japan's telecommunications market next year, to emulate the success of AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications operator, after it was split up in 1983. NTT argues that the investment demands of multimedia make a split inappropriate. Over the past year, the group has entered joint ventures with three US software groups to develop multimedia. It is negotiating with British Telecommunications for a joint venture, between NTT and IBM of the US, to provide high-speed international data communications. Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, meanwhile, is interested in a possible stake in NTT's personal 'handyphone' service to open in Japan next year. NTT's foreign links are small, partly a reflection of the fact that it is the only leading national telecommunications group not allowed to operate international services. The Japanese finance ministry owns 65.6 per cent of NTT, which was partially privatised in 1985, but has been hindered from selling more by the weakness of Japan's stock market. The group reported a 42.4 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y175bn in the year to last March, on turnover up by 2.8 per cent to Y6,687bn. See Feature</p>

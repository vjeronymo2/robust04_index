			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ WON'T LET AMERICANS OUT; BAGHDAD MASSES MORE TROOPS;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: STATE DEPT. SAYS 580 U.S. CITIZENS 'ARE STUCK' IN IRAQ AND ANOTHER  3,000 IN OCCUPIED KUWAIT. U.N. DECLARES ANNEXATION 'NULL AND VOID.'  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said Thursday that Iraq has sent word that most  Americans in Iraq and Kuwait cannot leave and may be held indefinitely, raising  the specter of a painful new complication for the U.S. effort in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> Additionally, the Pentagon confirmed that 50,000 more Iraqi troops are  gathering in southern Iraq, apparently preparing to bolster forces in Kuwait,  as newly arrived U.S. troops took up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia. The  American forces are as close as seven miles to the Kuwaiti border.  </P> <P> As Iraq showed signs of digging in, the U.N. Security Council unanimously  declared the annexation of Kuwait "null and void." It called on all countries  and organizations to refuse to recognize Baghdad's claim on its tiny neighbor  and demanded that Iraq "rescind its actions purporting to annex Kuwait."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, State Department officials said they are growing increasingly  concerned about 580 Americans in Iraq and 3,000 more in occupied Kuwait.  </P> <P> "They are stuck," Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said of the  marooned Americans. ". . . It's bad news that the airports are not open and  borders are closed."  </P> <P> Only a relative handful of U.S. diplomats and American citizens on short-term  visitors' visas will be permitted to depart, according to officials, who said  that one vehicle of departing embassy personnel was turned back at Iraq's  border with Jordan.  </P> <P> Thirty-eight Americans remain in Baghdad's Rashid Hotel, where they have been  detained since Monday. A 10-year-old California girl, Penelope Nabokov, who was  released from the hotel into the custody of the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday,  remains at the embassy while U.S. officials try to arrange for her safe passage  out of the country, officials said.  </P> <P> The ominous notice that most foreigners will be held indefinitely and the  appearance of fresh Iraqi troops along Kuwait's northern border came as U.S.  intelligence officials watched Iraqi forces digging defensive positions on  Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials said their actions  suggest that an invasion of Saudi Arabia may not be imminent.  </P> <P> "They seem to be in a defensive posture," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams  said. "But nonetheless, Iraqi forces are still capable of an offensive action."  </P> <P> As the Mideast crisis entered its second week, diplomats worked feverishly to  find a way out of the standoff. Among other actions internationally:  </P> <P> Arab leaders postponed until today a critical summit meeting in Cairo aimed at  finding a peaceful resolution -- possibly an all-Arab force to act as a border  buffer between the Saudis and Americans on one side, and the Iraqis on the  other. Representatives of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein are among those slated  to attend.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials confirmed a "gathering" of Iraqi troops along Iraq's border  with Turkey. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Ankara, told Turkish  leaders they could depend on their North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in  any showdown with its neighbor.  </P> <P> Iraq's trade and oil routes were virtually sealed off as British and French  warships joined American ships gathered in the gulf to enforce sanctions  against Iraq. In London, the government said it is sending a squadron of  Tornado fighters to Saudi Arabia and a squadron of Jaguar fighters to the gulf  region to help fend off any Iraqi attack.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union denounced Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, but said it would not  take part in any multinational force against Baghdad outside the U.N. umbrella.  </P> <P> The U.N. vote denouncing the annexation, the third such action taken this week,  was 15 to 0. In its third meeting since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, it  demanded immediate and unconditional Iraqi troop withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "We cannot allow sovereign state members of the United Nations to be swallowed  up," U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the council.  </P> <P> Pickering emphasized that the U.S. presence in the area is strictly defensive,  under provisions of the U.N. Charter, and intended to help protect Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> In other action, Finland was chosen Thursday as chairman of a Security Council  committee set up to monitor U.N. economic sanctions and an arms embargo imposed  on Iraq to force its withdrawal from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. servicemen dug into positions inside Saudi Arabia  and awaited the arrival of thousands more in the coming weeks. In the United  States, the Army's 24th Infantry Mechanized Division based in Ft. Stewart, Ga.  announced it was formally on alert and readied its tanks and troops to be sent  to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Pentagon operations even extended to Tennessee and Wisconsin, where local  Air National Guardsmen were hurriedly called from their civilian jobs and  prepared to help fly U.S. troops and gear the 5,000 miles to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Two days into the operation the Pentagon has dubbed "Desert Shield," White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the costly overseas deployment would  force the Pentagon to exempt military personnel accounts from potential budget  cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction formula.  </P> <P> While most lawmakers continued to support the deployment of U.S. forces,  Congress' inability to forge a budget compromise with the White House has  raised concerns that the federal government could face automatic spending cuts  of as much as $100 billion by Oct. 1. At the same time, officials said that the  potential costs of operating a large military force in the Persian Gulf  indefinitely made it increasingly unlikely that such automatic cuts would be  enforced.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials said that the cost of Operation Desert Shield, even if not  substantially escalated, could easily reach that of the United States' invasion  of Panama and subsequent operations -- about $400 million.  </P> <P> But while President Bush indicated concerns about the financial cost of the  Saudi operation, he has indicated he has committed to drawing a line in the  sand, protecting vital economic and strategic interests and Americans in the  Middle East.  </P> <P> The fear for American lives in Kuwait and Iraqi clearly increased with  unsettling news and events Thursday. Eight diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in  Baghdad were expected to travel to Jordan by road on Thursday. But when they  arrived at the border, Iraqi officials prevented their crossing, although they  called it just a "delay," Jordanian officials said. American officials say that  the government of Saddam Hussein had earlier given permission for the partial  evacuation of the embassy.  </P> <P> "The point is, the Iraqis say they are being allowed to leave, but they aren't  being allowed to leave. Our only interest is in getting them out. The best way  to do that is to keep our cool," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> A senior Administration official said he was not prepared to call any of the  Americans held in Iraq "hostages" because "there's no indication they have been  taken with any particular purpose in mind. You are a hostage for something."  </P> <P> In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand said the foreigners were being  held as "prisoners," and said his government was very concerned about its  estimated 450 citizens in Kuwait and Iraq. "They are being detained. They  cannot leave either Kuwait or Iraq. So you can say they are prisoners,"  Mitterrand told a news conference.  </P> <P> "It's up to us to help them," he added, saying he is ready to send a senior  official to Baghdad to negotiate his countrymen's freedom.  </P> <P> While the dangers for those citizens appeared to mount, Iraqi officials made  ominous threats against U.S. military forces. Officials in Baghdad said the  U.S. force, which is expected to mount beyond 50,000 men, could be used to  invade Iraq.  </P> <P> Saying that any such move "will be answered decisively," Iraq's ambassador to  Greece suggested the Iraqis would unleash poison gas on any attacking American  troops.  </P> <P> As the intentions of Iraqi troops remained ambiguous, however, the Pentagon  raced to build on U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, where British aircraft and  support crews will soon join them. The next 2 to 3 days will be critical, said  officials. With new troops departures slated for the coming days, the initially  skimpy U.S. force will begin to grow to a size that would give Saddam Hussein  second thoughts about attacking, they said.  </P> <P> "There's much more to come" over the next several days and possibly weeks, said  Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. "This is an operation that is going to  continue for several days -- one might say many days," he added.  </P> <P> But the Pentagon, citing Saudi sensitivities, remained mum on how many forces  are in Saudi Arabia and which U.S. troops are expected to arrive. Even so, that  confusion may help to deter an Iraqi advance, said one Pentagon official.  </P></p>

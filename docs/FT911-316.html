			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Northwest slides deeper into red NORTHWEST Airlines, the US carrier taken private via a leveraged buy-out, has reported a Dollars 62m loss after tax in the first quarter of 1991, writes Nikki Tait in New York. This compared with a Dollars 39m deficit in the same period a year earlier. The loss was scored on revenues almost static at Dollars 1.64bn. Like most of its rivals, Northwest blamed the losses on the effects of the Gulf war and depressed domestic demand. Operating costs rose to Dollars 1.76bn, from Dollars 1.72bn.</p>

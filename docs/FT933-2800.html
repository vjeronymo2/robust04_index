			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Devro at Pounds 3.78m and sees progress - Taking account of flotation pro forma figures show a rise of 32% at mid-way Correction (published 17th September 1993) appended to this article. DEVRO International, the maker of sausage casings made from the edible protein collagen which came to the market in June, reported lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.78m for the first half of 1993, against Pounds 5.89m. However pro forma figures, calculated assuming the post flotation capital structure had been in place during both periods showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.1m, a 32 per cent improvement on the Pounds 9.1m of the comparable period. Reported interest payments were Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 4.53m) but fell to Pounds 470,000 (Pounds 1.28m) in the pro forma figures. The results for the Glasgow-based company showed sales growth of 18 per cent to Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 39.2m). The sales growth was roughly in line with the unaudited trading performance of 19.8 per cent for the first five months stated in the flotation prospectus. The pre-tax profit figures and trading margins impressed the market and the shares closed up 6p at 232p. Devro, which manufactures in the US and Australia as well as at its base, was bought out of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US multinational by its management for Pounds 108m in 1991. The flotation at 170p valued the company at Pounds 224m. Mr Leon Allen, chairman, said trading had been strong despite the continuing effects of recession in many markets. 'The group is in a strong financial position, enabling us to continue to pursue our strategy of expanding Devro's share of the collagen market.' Mr Graeme Alexander, who has succeeded Mr Frank de Angeli as chief executive, said that sales volumes in the period were up 7 per cent, with sausage casings increasing by about 6 per cent. The UK showed a sales rise of 6 per cent. The company's new range of collagen film products, used in continental Europe for wrapping smoked hams, rose by 90 per cent, though turnover is only about Pounds 2m. The rest of the profits increase was due to an 8 per cent foreign exchange gain, mainly in North America and Japan, and a 3 per cent increase in the price mix. Profit margins rose from 26 to 27 per cent thanks, Mr Alexander said, to controlling costs and gains in productivity. Research and development spending was between Pounds 3m and Pounds 3.5m on in the six month period. Devro expected its underlying tax rate for the period to be about 20 per cent. This could rise progressively to 33 per cent in future years. For the second half sales had started well and the company expected to report further progress for the full year. Reported earnings per share were 2.6p (3.4p). The pro forma figures were 6.4p (4.8p), a rise of 33 per cent. CORRECTION Devro International had pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.44m in the six months to June. The figure was reported incorrectly in yesterday's edition.</p>

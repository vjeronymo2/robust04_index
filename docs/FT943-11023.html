			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A new name for BS 5750 BS 5750, the quality management standard that is as much reviled by some smaller companies as it is revered by others, is changing its name. With immediate effect, BS 5750, which is equivalent to the international standard ISO 9000 and the European standard ES 29000, is to be called BS EN ISO 9000. The British Standards Institution says it is making the change to avoid confusion about the different numbering and that BS EN ISO 9000 has few additional requirements. But there are some. The changes, the BSI assures us, mainly clarify the clauses of the standard and facilitate its use in all organisations, regardless of size, industry or activity. BSI says all companies registered under BS 5750 should revise their quality management systems to comply with the new standard. Copies of a guide are being sent to all BSI-registered members and are available to others from BSI Customer Services for Pounds 25 (Pounds 12.50 for subscribing members).</p>

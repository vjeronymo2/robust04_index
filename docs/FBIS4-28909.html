			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Stop Acting Recklessly"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- At "a meeting of the  National Security Council" on June 8, the traitor Kim Yong-sam,  talking about "damage" of the "North's nuclear transparency",  said "sanctions of the international community is inevitable"  and pressed home the need to "promote sanctions against the  North".    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    Kim Yong-sam, who had incited North-South confrontation with  the bellicose remarks that "a military reaction will not be  ruled out" over the North's "nuclear issue", is now displaying  feverish activities for "sanctions against the North" in a bid  to harm the fellow countrymen by joining hands with outside  forces. This shows that Kim Yong-sam's is a group of traitors  who have no regard for the country and the nation, for peace and  peaceful reunification of the country.    It is the height of folly for Kim Yong-sam to think he can  go  scotfree after getting "sanctions" taken against the fellow  countrymen through conspiracy with outside forces.    The Kim Yong-sam group's attempt to do harm to the fellow  countrymen, dancing to the tune of outside forces without  independence, is an act of self-destruction that reminds us of a  rabid dog barking into the sky, without any knowledge of its  imminent death.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must stop acting rashly,  clearly mindful that neither Uncle Sam nor Patriot missiles can  protect them.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that the traitor Kim Yong-sam  should not babble about "sanctions" like a mad dog barking at  the moon, not knowing its doom, but ponder over the consequences  that would arise therefrom and stop acting rashly.</p>

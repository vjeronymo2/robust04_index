In an interview with the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the  present status and prospects of the two countries' economic  cooperation, Minister Le Xuan Trinh said that during the visit  the two sides reviewed the implementation of the programme of  the Vietnam-Russia Intergovernmental Committee on Economic,  Commercial and Scientific-Technological Cooperation approved at  its second session held in Hanoi in early 1993. The two sides  also discussed an agenda for the third session of the committee  scheduled to be held in Hanoi in mid-April this year. The two  sides signed protocols on trade for 1994 between the two  countries, and on their cooperation in the time to come.  Vietnam also signed a protocol on payment of mature debt to  Russia.    Asked about the payment of debts to Russia, Minister Le Xuan  Trinh said that Vietnam agreed to pay a mature debt of some USD  [U.S. dollars] 60 million in garments, woolen carpets,  lacquerwares, rice, meat and other goods. The two sides agreed  that an amount of USD 50 million contributed by Vietnamese guest  workers in Russia would be included in the payment to Russia.  The Russian side agreed to take part of this payment to  reinvest in and expand its cooperation with Vietnam.    Speaking about the cooperative orientation between the two  countries in the years to come Mr Trinh said that the Russian  side had declared to continue to provide loans to Vietnam to  implement in 1994 the project for the city public lighting  system. Also this year, he said, Russia will resume investment  in agro-industrial projects to plant tea, rubber, and coffee.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ning Shiqun (1337 0013 5028)] </F>   [Excerpts] Lhasa, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- The development of a  market economy has served as a string to tie up lateral economic  cooperation between Tibet and the inland. Lateral exchanges at  different levels and in all domains have helped Tibet usher in a  market economy.    According to incomplete statistics, from 1985 to 1993, Tibet  and inland provinces and regions reached agreement on over 600  economic and technical cooperation projects, which involved 700  million yuan in cooperation funds, the transfer of nearly 2,000  skilled personnel to Tibet, and the import of materials worth  over 500 million yuan. With annual profits of 70 million yuan,  these projects have produced rather good economic returns.  [passage omitted]    Tibet has imported equipment, technology, and management  know-how to upgrade existing enterprises. From 1985 to 1993,  the autonomous regional economic cooperation office approved  over 100 technical cooperation projects, of which over 50 have  been implemented. This has helped upgrade the level of Tibet's  manufactured goods.    Thanks to the barter of materials in connection with  economic  cooperation, steel products, automobiles, color televisions,  cigarettes, brown sugar, tea, and butter have been brought into  Tibet. This has improved market supply and made life easier for  the people.    Credit funds have been utilized to expand cooperation. With  the approval of the People's Bank's head office, in 1988 Tibet  set up special credits totaling 200 million yuan for lateral  cooperation. Close to 100 funding-cooperation projects involving  over 500 million yuan in cooperation funds were implemented from  1988 to 1991, yielding an annual profit of 80 million yuan, of  which 10 million yuan went to the enterprises.    Since the first forum of the CPC Central Committee on work  in  Tibet in 1980, state ministries and commissions and over 20  provinces and regions have offered assistance to Tibet in terms  of know-how, finance, and materials. While jointly developing  resources, they have passed on technology, provided technical  training, and helped Tibetan enterprises raise management  levels. Following the second forum on work in Tibet, nine  provinces and municipalities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and  Shandong helped Tibet build another 43 projects.</p>

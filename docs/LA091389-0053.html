			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEA CHASE, GUNSHOTS LEAD TO 'TEXTBOOK CASE' COCAINE BUST  </P> <P> Federal agents who hauled in 2,700 pounds of cocaine, 17 defendants and five  boats described the bust Tuesday as a "textbook case" of how U.S. agencies can  choke off the cocaine pipeline from Colombia.  </P> <P> The seizure of the freighter Nerma, allegedly used as a smuggling "mother  ship," as well as three speedboats and a trawler used to haul the cocaine to  land was described by agents as the largest since President Bush announced his  battle plan against drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Videotape provided by the Coast Guard showed a chase in which the speedboats  tried to evade a persistent, but slower Coast Guard craft, which fired 43  warning shots near the speedboats. A fourth speedboat escaped.  </P> <P> The drug organization supervising the cocaine smuggling was based in Miami and  had been under investigation for several months, Drug Enforcement  Administration agent Tom Cash said. More arrests were expected.  </P> <P> Federal agents moved in Sunday while cocaine reportedly was being unloaded from  the Nerma in Bahamian waters. The cocaine was believed to have originated in  Medellin, Colombia, home of the Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers, and was  loaded onto the freighter on the island of Aruba.  </P> <P> Cash said the bust "is indicative of the magnitude of the pipeline. This is a  textbook case of what taxpayers get for their money" in drug enforcement.  </P></p>

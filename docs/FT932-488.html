			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle plant locks out workers A E STALEY, the US subsidiary of Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, has locked out workers at its Decatur, Illinois, corn-milling plant, where a contract dispute with about 800 members of the Allied Industrial Workers' Union has been continuing since September, write Maggie Urry in London and Nikki Tait in New York. Tate said that management 'has been forced to begin a lockout of hourly employees' after 'environmental problems arising from the union's in-plant strategy'. The company alleged that workers had been putting waste from the process into the drainage system, causing problems for the local sewerage authority. 'That's just an accusation,' retorted the AIW. It claims that, with regular employees working to rule, management failed to maintain environmental standards. See International Companies and Lex</p>

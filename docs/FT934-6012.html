			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Healthcare side behind rise to Pounds 19.1m at AAH AAH, the diversified distribution company, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 19.1m for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 17.5m, in spite of lower trading profits in two small divisions. Turnover improved to Pounds 773.1m (Pounds 679.7m). The board declared an interim dividend of 6p (5.8p) and blamed difficulties in the divisions for a drop in earnings per share from 15.4p to 14.7p. 'The reduction in the performances of our environmental and distribution services divisions, and the absorption of reorganisation costs, have inevitably dampened earnings performance in the first half,' said Mr John Padovan, chairman. He added: 'I see a continued solid performance and growth through expansion and otherwise in our health division. The two divisions which have not performed so well this year are likely to return to substantial profitability in the future.' The company's healthcare business, its largest division, lifted trading profits to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 13.9m) on sales up at Pounds 642.7m (Pounds 564.2). Retail sales were Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 22m). Over the period AAH acquired 24 new retail pharmacies at a cost of Pounds 5.6m, bringing the total to 235. A further 11 had been acquired since the year end. Environmental services contributed Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 3m) to trading profits on sales of Pounds 38.4m (Pounds 34.7m) as wet weather and a reorganisation compounded the deleterious effect of a weak market. Distribution services, into which the consumer products division is now being integrated, contributed Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 1.3m) to trading profits on sales of Pounds 46.2m (Pounds 37.6m). The replacement for a contract had been delayed and another incurred a significant loss. Average net debt was Pounds 59.8m (Pounds 42m) and gearing rose to 37 per cent. Interest payments were Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.2m). Net cash flow from operating activities was negative at Pounds 4.7m compared with an inflow of Pounds 16m last time. The company said the difference was partly related to timing but that the working capital in the pharmaceuticals division had increased.</p>

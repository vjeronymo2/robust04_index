			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A problem with banks - Bethan Hutton finds out why foreigners dislike British banks WHEN foreigners working in Britain swap stories of their experiences, one of the commonest gripes is not the weather, or the food, or even the beer, but British high street banks. It seems that every expatriate has a horror story about the length of time and number of pieces of paper needed to open a bank account in the UK, or was deeply insulted by being put on a few months' 'probation' before being granted a Pounds 50 cheque guarantee card, when any 18-year-old embarking on a degree is showered with offers of plastic cards and overdraft facilities. One Belgian banker, now working in the UK, complains that opening an account in London was more time-consuming and bureaucratic than in Belgium, Germany, the US, Argentina, Switzerland and the Netherlands. 'In New York, when you open a bank account you may have to queue up for half an hour, but you walk out with a temporary cheque book and everything,' he says. 'Here, it takes forever and a day to get a cheque book. 'You have to give them copies of your passport, employment details, they want to have a letter from your lawyer, from your accountant, they want to see bank statements from where you have banked before . . . in no other country has anyone ever asked me for all that.' Most banks say they treat all applicants the same, whatever their nationality, but the fact is that the application process is designed for long-term UK residents. The biggest stumbling block is the banks' requirement for a permanent address before an account can be opened. Few overseas nationals arrive with permanent accommodation arranged - most have to spend a period staying in a hotel or with friends - but before moving into a longer-term home, letting agencies demand deposits, advance rent and sometimes even a direct-debit mandate for the rent, all of which require banking facilities. One European banker who moved to London earlier this year found that Barclays would not open an account for her until she had a permanent address, but she needed a bank account to avoid paying a hefty deposit on a flat in cash. The problem was solved after the intervention of her employer. One American bank has resorted to arranging private banking facilities for non-UK employees at its London office. Employees of smaller or less international companies have a tougher time. Carolyn Chao, a New Yorker working in music publishing, tried to open a building society current account, but was turned down after several weeks of effort, in spite of calling in her boss for help. She finally managed to open an account with Abbey National, the bank, but still does not have full current-account facilities. Abbey National says its policy is to give current accounts only to UK residents, usually with UK passports. The British fondness for overdrafts means that an application to open a bank account is effectively treated as an application for credit, even if all the customer wants is a simple account with cash and cheque facilities. Jeannie Zakharov, a subeditor with FT Information Services, arrived from Australia in 1990, and wanted an account in which to deposit her pay cheques and withdraw cash. She did not ask for a cheque card, overdraft facility or any other kind of credit. It took NatWest two months to open the account, and another three months to grant a cash card. For the first two months, even though she accumulated cheques worth over Pounds 2,000, she had to rely on money transferred from Australia. Banks are increasingly using credit scoring to judge applicants. Anyone newly arrived, with a new job, is at a distinct disadvantage, particularly since they will also lack a track record of paid-back loans and well-managed credit cards in the UK. As mitigation for the length of time spent checking new customers' credentials, banks also point to new anti-money laundering rules, which oblige them to be wary of large cash deposits or transfers. This makes life more difficult for those wanting to open an account, move money from their home bank accounts and gain immediate access to it. Overseas nationals are possibly less attractive customers by banks' normal standards. Foreigners working in the UK may leave the country after a few years, closing their accounts. They may also be less likely to buy insurance and investment products, a greater source of profit for many banks than their core personal banking services.</p>

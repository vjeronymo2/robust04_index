			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (31): A cancer in busines - Corruption / Michael Holman on a growing global phenomenon Pssst . . . Want to know what it costs to get the government minister on your side? Or how to broach the delicate subject of whether the president should be cut in on the deal? Then buy The Good Business Guide to Bribery*, an insider's guide to what has been called a cancer which poses a bigger threat to development than Aids. The cancer is corruption: once seen as a problem associated with tin-pot dictatorships in far-off countries, it is now increasingly acknowledged to be a growing global phenomenon, which requires a co-ordinated international response. Leading the way is Transparency International (TI), the Berlin-based 'coalition against corruption in international business' and publisher of the Guide, which argues that at the end of the day, bribery is bad for business. Corruption, the TI publication warns, is not a problem confined to the third world. It is also undermining the fledging democracies of eastern Europe, threatens clean government in Europe itself, and is ultimately bad for business. Its symptoms range from a majestic cathedral in Cote d'Ivoire, built by a former president who treated state resources as his own, to classrooms without books in Nigeria, where the education budget has suffered and businessmen and politicians have benefited from inflated contracts and diverted oil earnings. When TI was launched in May last year, it prompted a sceptical response, summed up by a cartoonist who portrayed the organisation as a contemporary Don Quixote, tilting at windmills. But behind Transparency International was a group of hard-headed veterans of aid, commerce and development, eminent in their own fields, and with experience spanning the developing world, and with no illusions about the enormity of their task. As Peter Eigen, the chairman of TI and a former senior official with the World Bank, put it: 'We recognise the realities of international commerce and competition; our approach must be evolutionary.' But at the same time, he knew that a growing number of businessmen were increasingly concerned about the spread of corruption and its impact on business. Said one executive of a leading international company, with experience in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean: 'Nobody in the business world pretends any more that corruption is not one of the most important and damaging factors in third world development.' Without a combination of tougher laws, tighter monitoring, and technical assistance where necessary, the malaise will spread, Mr Eigen and his colleagues argued at the launch. These sentiments struck a responsive chord, as Transparency International began to promote ethical business conduct. It lobbied governments and leading international companies for support, and above all co-ordinated the response from leading politicians and concerned citizens around the world to the call for better business practices and cleaner administrations, and a crack down on bribery. 'Initially there will be only a few countries where business and government can jointly subscribe to the concept, a few 'islands of integrity',' says Mr Eigen. The campaign initially focused on five or six governments in developing countries and central and eastern Europe which were prepared to participate in the programme. Drawing up a code of practice, and providing the expertise with which to monitor it, and strengthening the institutions that have to enforce it, takes time. But the day is not far off when these governments will restrict tendering for state contracts to corporations which have themselves signed an anti-bribery pledge as part of the integrity in business programme. The trailblazer has been Ecuador, where tenders for a Dollars 600m government-funded pipeline contract will be limited to companies who have signed a code of business conduct. 'We expect these leading countries will then create a momentum by their example,' says Mr Eigen. TI's role includes providing a range of services, such as suggesting ways in which rules and systems for international procurement bidding can be improved, assisting governments to establish anti-corruption investigative agencies, establishing a clearing house for information on corruption, and examining serious cases of briery. Anti-corruption drives are not new, TI officials acknowledge. But past efforts have failed in part, they say, because it was not possible to co-ordinate a global coalition involving all the main players, as TI now does. This has been made possible, says TI, by the new world order that has emerged over the past few years. The end of the cold war has meant that governments which used to shelter under the umbrella of Moscow or Washington, now face exposure, knowing that their erstwhile patrons will no longer turn a blind eye to economic and political abuses because of the need for access to a strategic airport, dockyard or mineral supply. The wave of democratisation that followed the super power rapprochement, from central and eastern Europe to Africa and Latin America, has seen the emergence of representative governments anxious to make a fresh start. At the same time, the industrialised countries have been shaken out of their complacency about corruption, as scandals in Italy, Japan and Britain reveal that they, too, are vulnerable. Today, much of the drive for an internationally binding code of conduct comes from the regions that have suffered most, instigated by a new breed of politicians, lawyers, and businessmen in south America, eastern Europe and Africa, who know from their own bitter experience just what corruption can do. Eighteen months after its launch, TI draws on the support of chapters that have sprung up around the world - including Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Australia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Germany, Hungary, Mali, Kenya, New Zealand, the Phillipines, the UK, and the US. Word spread through TI's quarterly newsletter, which monitors corruption around the world, and tells subscribers what is being done to combat it. In Russia, for example, where TI is in the process of establishing a chapter, it has been asked by parliament and President Yeltsin's office to make submissions on the proposed new anti-corruption laws. Leaders brought together by the Organisation of American States have put anti-corruption measures high on their agenda for their December summit in Miami, noting that 'corrupt practices are capable of frustrating the process of overall development'. Perhaps the most important breakthrough came barely a year after TI's launch. In Paris last May the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), made the opening move in what could become an internationally co-ordinated programme to combat corruption. The influential 25-country association recommended 'that members take effective measures to deter, prevent and combat the bribery of foreign public officials in connection with international business transactions'. 'The OECD move is something we have worked for assiduously', said Mr Eigen. 'Ideally we wanted stronger action than non-binding recommendation.' * The Good Business Guide to Bribery, by George Moody-Stuart, DM40, obtainable from Transparency International, Berlin, Tel 49-30-261 6015 Fax 49-30-262 8583</p>

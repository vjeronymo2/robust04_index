			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuba has reiterated its willingness to restore  telephone communications with the United States through  agreements with U.S. telecommunications companies that are able  to follow the proper procedures justly, equally, and reasonably.  An official note from the Cuban Government states it is  awaiting a decision from the U.S. Federal Communications  Commission, which could authorize three of that country's  companies to initiate telecommunication services to Cuba.    The information, reported by the official newspaper GRANMA,  says these are norms established by the State Department for  U.S. long-distance telephone companies. The note specifies  Havana-based EntelCuba [National Telecommunication Enterprise of  Cuba] signed recently separate agreements with three U.S.  companies from Washington, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. GRANMA  has reported the parties have agreed to establish a distribution  rate of $1.20 per minute, divided by 50 percent between the  Cuban and U.S. companies.    The note explains before 1991, when Hurricane Andrew  interrupted telecommunications between the two countries, Cuba  paid, for humanitarian reasons, all costs of the service, which  originated in Cuban territory, without receiving a single cent  of what was legally and justly its share. It explains that  since 1966, as a result of the blockade, there have been  accounts in U.S. banks totaling $100 million, resulting from  operations various governments have carried out to prevent the  telephone company from paying Cuba.    Negotiations between EntelCuba and the U.S. companies began  during the second half of 1993, after the current U.S.  Government authorized the resumption of traffic and the payment  of Cuban telephone services.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (7): Acquisitions give companies a lift - France / The leaders in Europe's third largest stock market FRANCE'S top quoted companies have continued their steady march up the FT500 league, partly reflecting their position as some of the busiest acquirers in Europe, in some cases leading the concentration of their industrial sector. In part, they were also helped by the relatively strong performance of the French stock market in 1991, which led to an overall performance between the two FT500 cut-off points that outstripped rival markets, notably Germany and Italy. By the end of October, the French main market included 556 domestically incorporated companies, down from 578 a year previously and 229 foreign listings, up slightly from 226 at the end of October 1990, according to the Societe des Bourses Francaises. It is Europe's third largest stock market with a capitalisation of FFr1,879bn (Dollars 340bn). However, it is still small in relation to the size of the French economy and the market in many of the top companies' shares can be very limited due to the often large stakes - so called noyaux durs - held by loyal shareholders. On the takeover front, British companies were the biggest European buyers abroad in 1990, according to a recent study by KPMG, the accounting group, but the French slipped into the lead in the first nine months of 1991. They spent Dollars 5.9bn abroad in the nine months to September, Dollars 1bn more than their British counterparts, says KPMG. Among the most notable cross-border deals are the FFr12.5bn unsolicited takeover of Square D, the US electrical distribution group, by Schneider, the French electrical equipment company, and the FFr3.8bn takeover of the transmission equipment division of Rockwell International by Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications and engineering giant. Also falling into the period covered by the FT500 is the partial merger of Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals subsidiary of oil group Elf Aquitaine, with Sterling Drug of the US. In two of these three case, these deals have been reflected in a further rise in the buyers' rankings. Elf rose seven places to take 13th position, where it consolidates its position as the largest French quoted company in the FT 500, with its market capitalisation of Dollars 17.4bn, also reflecting a strong profits performance. It is followed by Alcatel, which changed its name during the period from the unwieldy Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, and moved up four places to 23rd. Schneider, by contrast, tumbled from 196th to 269th, a reflection of the continuing impact of economic downturn on its construction and engineering subsidiaries. France was relatively late in joining the buoyant acquisition markets of the late 1980s, but has made up for it with a hectic burst of activity which has started to show through in a growing internationalisation of the French economy. Just over 40 per cent of the staff of France's 10 top companies now works abroad, and five of the top 10 make more than half of their sales outside France, according to a recent survey by the Direction de Relations Economiques Exterieures. These include Michelin, the world's largest tyre maker, which climbed from 267th to the 210th slot, reflecting the surge in its share price as it began to digest its 1989 takeover of Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre group, and as the market began to accept that Michelin was prepared to take an axe to its own and Uniroyal's costs. There is also Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled defence electronics group which has climbed from 209 to 164, and has made a whole range of partnerships with other European defence suppliers. Saint-Gobain, the glass and pipes concern which last year bought Norton, the US abrasives group, has had less luck, down from 65th position to 79th, reflecting the drop in earnings and share price cause by the fall in demand in the building, automotive and industrial supplies businesses. The big change in this year's French listings in the FT500 is the inclusion for the first time of companies which have at least 25 per cent of their shares in the hands of the public. Ther previous cut-off point - 30 per cent  -had excluded most of the state sector, with the three exceptions of Elf, Total, the other state-controlled oil group, and Thomson-CSF. The change reveals the real importance of French state industry. It also coincides with the government's decision to allow sales of minority stakes to private investors, so putting an end to President Francois Mitterrand's freeze on privatisations and nationalisations. So there could well be new entrants from the French state sector next year. Now the original trio is joined by the three state insurance companies: Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), which comes in at 52, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 7.7bn; Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN) (63rd); and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) which makes its debut at 95. The other important new face from the state sector is Pechiney International, the 75 per cent subsidiary of Pechiney, the state-controlled aluminium and packaging group, which comes in at 220. In the private sector, some of France's best known names have continued to climb the ladder, in sectors which have shown comparative resilience to the economic slowdown. They include LVMH the luxury goods group, up from 34th to 25th, where it is the third largest French company, followed by BSN, the leading foods company, up from 47th to 39th. Other reshuffles in the domestic rankings reflect takeovers and mergers, like the link-up between Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water distribution group and construction company Dumez, which jointly weigh in this year at number 110, or - on a smaller scale - the Pinault timber and paper group's takeover of Conforama, France's largest furniture retailing chain. Since the FT500 lists closed, Pinault (416th), has bid for Au Printemps, the department store at 410. The two-thirds bid was controversial, but received clearance from French stock exchange authorities, in spite of minority shareholders' allegations that they were not being treated fairly. So Pinault can be expected to climb a few more rungs this year.</p>

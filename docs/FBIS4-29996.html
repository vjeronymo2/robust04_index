			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrade Lieutenant General Saman Vi-gnaket,  Political Bureau member of the party Central Committee, chairman  of the National Assembly, and former chief of the Army's General  Political Department, held a meeting with representatives of all  Army units from throughout the country on 18 June 1994 in the  meeting room of the National Defense Ministry.    First, Comrade Lt. Gen. Saman Vi-gnaket hailed every service  of the armed forces for being steadfastly loyal and faithful to  the nation and the party, consistently enhancing the fine  traditions of the Lao nation and the Army, resolutely persisting  in overcoming all difficulties and fulfilling national defense  and public security maintenance tasks, and striving to  consolidate themselves to become progressive in all fields. The  comrade also noted developments in the current international and  regional situations; the enemy's sinister designs against our  country; and the party's current policies spelled out in the  various resolutions adopted by the party, which must be  profoundly appreciated and strictly implemented by the armed  forces with a high sense of responsibility. In conclusion,  Comrade Lt. Gen. Saman Vi-gnaket called on our Army to enhance  its fine traditions actively; to fulfill the three-duty and  four-relations tasks [not further specified] exceptionally; and  to act as a progressive model in all four areas -- firmly  grasping the party's policy, consistently maintaining the  revolutionary line, pursuing correct behavioral patterns, and  maintaining a clean and honest lifestyle.</p>

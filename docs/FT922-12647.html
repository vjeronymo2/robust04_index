			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: AMR returns to the black with Dollars 20m after-tax profit AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday met its forecast of a small profit in the first quarter of 1992, turning in a surplus of Dollars 20m after tax. American is one of the three largest US carriers, and only last week led an important revamp of domestic air fare pricing. This was matched by many competitors but it was then undercut by Trans World Airlines and, to a lesser extent, USAir. The modest first-quarter profit compares with the large Dollars 195m loss American made during the first quarter of 1991, when the Gulf war-related slump in traffic decimated the industry's profitability. Mr Bob Crandall, AMR's forthright chairman, said that, although pleased to be in profit, he still viewed the results as 'less than satisfactory'. He said he hoped the new pricing structure - which centres on four basic types of fares, all lower than previously offered in these classes, but discards the numerous discount products - would produce 'the kind of financial performance we seek'. According to Mr Crandall, bookings with the airline have risen by 46 per cent since the new pricing plan was announced. Industry observers, however, have wondered how long American's simplified system will 'stick'. In the first quarter, American's revenues reached Dollars 3.51bn, compared with the depressed Dollars 2.77bn a year earlier. Fuel costs were 13.7 per cent lower, at Dollars 411m, and total operating expenses rose 11.9 per cent to Dollars 3.37bn. Revenue yield per passenger mile was up by 4.3 per cent to 13.98 cents, while the load factor increased by 1.8 percentage points to 58.3 per cent. American is also in talks with Canadian Airlines, over the acquisition of a minority stake in the carrier. Canadian told an airline industry conference in Toronto the two sides have agreed in principle on the size and terms of the investment, and that a services and marketing agreement could be finalised within weeks. Mr Kevin Jenkins, president of Canadian, reportedly said he was 'comfortable' with suggestions that AMR will acquire 25 per cent of Canadian for about CDollars 200m (USDollars 181.8m). Government agreements would then be required.</p>

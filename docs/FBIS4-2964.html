			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- China has published  its white paper on population, the environment and development  in the 21st century today, charting the course of the country's  long-term economic and social development.    The white paper, "China's Agenda 21" was released at a press  conference jointly held by the State Planning Commission and the  State Science and Technology Commission.    Chen Yaobang, vice-minister of the State Planning  Commission,  said that the Chinese Government has formulated the agenda in  line with the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on  the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June  1992.    He said that, in accordance with China's actual  comprehensive  conditions, the agenda puts forward overall strategies,  policies, measures and plans to promote the coordinated and  sustained development of the economy, society, natural  resources, environment, population and education.    The agenda will become a guiding document for the  formulation  of China's long and medium-term plans for the national economy  and social development, and will be embodied as important  contents and objectives in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan  (1996-2000) and the development program until 2010.    Meanwhile, it is also a manifestation of the seriousness in  action and firmness in principle of the Chinese Government in  implementing the U.N.'s agenda, he added.    The agenda is written in over 200,000 Chinese characters in  20 chapters. It has 78 projected areas under four headings:  Sustained Development Strategies, Social Sustained Development,  Economic Sustained Development, and Rational Utilization of  Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. It was drafted  by 300 experts and scholars from 52 government departments and  social organisations.    At the same time, the Chinese Government has also organized  related departments to draft "the priority projects plan for  China's Agenda 21", with the first 63 priority projects selected  in favor of international co-operation, on the basis of more  than 500 project proposals.    Chen said that the implementation of the program will not  only solve crucial problems such as population expansion,  environmental deterioration and resources shortage, but also  promote public participation so that sustained development in  China can get experience which can help foster the economic  development and environmental protection in the Asia-Pacific  region, and throughout the world.    He said that the total input for the first priority projects  is estimated at 3.76 billion U.S. dollars, of which 60 percent  will be guaranteed domestically, while the other 40 percent will  come from international co-operation.    The domestic part of the input will mainly come from  government investment and loans, or be raised by the localities;  while international co-operation will be carried out in forms of  multilateral and bilateral co-operation, grants, loans, joint  investment and BOT (building, operation and transfer). Chen  said he was optimistic about the prospects for the financial  support of these projects.    Chen said the United Nations Development Program has paid  great attention to the drafting and implementation of "China's  Agenda 21" and has decided to include the agenda in its  co-operative projects with the Chinese Government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Jiujiang City in  east China's Jiangxi Province has improved its transportation  and telecommunications conditions in the past two years.    Situated on the Chang Jiang River, Jiujiang was designated  an  open city by the central government in May 1992.    Since then, Jiujiang has been working hard to improve its  environment in a bid to draw foreign investment.    The transportation situation has been greatly improved as  the  Chang Jiang River Bridge at Jiujiang and the Nanchang-Jiujiang  Highway were opened to traffic a year ago.    The construction of a highway linking Jiujiang and  Jingdezhen, the "capital of porcelain", is about to start.    The Port of Jiujiang is also open to all foreign vessels.  Routes for container ships from Jiujiang to other parts of the  world have also been opened.    The city is to open air routes to Shanghai, Xiamen,  Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou before long, in addition to the  established destinations of Beijing, Nanjing and Huiyang.    Three railways including the Beijing-Kowloon line under  construction now converge at Jiujiang.    Communications construction has also been accelerated. By  the end of last year, all telephones in the city were automated,  linking Jiujiang with 1,600 cities and towns in China and more  than 180 countries and regions.    The improved environment has attracted a growing number of  foreign investors. Jiujiang absorbed 30.64 million U.S. dollars  investment in some 30 industries last year.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Bonds: Euro-French franc sector springs to life after polls THE EURO-FRENCH franc market sprang back into life yesterday following the National Assembly elections as investors positioned themselves for an expected fall in French interest rates. The success of yesterday's issues - from Caisse Autonome de Refinancement (CAR) and Credit National - was explained in part by the fact that they do not need to be paid for until the fourth week in April. With fears over the French currency continuing, such new issues give international investors a period of exposure to the French bond market without exposure to the currency, reducing hedging costs. The CAR's FFr1.8bn, eight-year zero-coupon issue follows a spate of similar deals in early March from Credit Local, Kingdom of Sweden, KfW and Electricite de France. Given the hefty discount at which they are priced, zero-coupon issues help to reduce the carrying cost of a French franc bond holding at a time of high short-term interest rates. French overnight interest rates eased yesterday to 10 3/4 per cent, but are still well above the 7.2 per cent yield on 10-year yield OATs. Credit National's three-year issue was raised from FFr1bn to FFr1.5bn, despite a spread of 38 basis points above French government bonds which was seen as tight given the AA3 rating of the borrower. The Eurodollar market remained subdued yesterday, marked by the slow take-up of a Dollars 250m offer from Halifax, the biggest UK building society. Halifax was tempted into the market by a rise in the three-year USDollars swap spread, as quoted on screens, from 30 to around 32 basis points. That enabled it to meet its unspecified borrowing target while issuing bonds at a spread of 45 basis points over US Treasuries - the same spread as a recent issue from Abbey National, the former building society which is widely seen as a similar credit. Abbey's issue had been brought at a spread of 38 basis points. Halifax's bonds fell slightly later in the day, and were bid at a spread of 48 basis points over Treasuries. A successful UK gilt auction yesterday prompted renewed talk in the bond markets of further Eurosterling bonds in the coming days. However, while demand among investors remains strongest for long-dated bonds, the swap market is most attractive in the five-year area, where the spread over gilts has risen to 50 from 48 basis points in recent days. That disparity dampened talk of foreign issuers coming to the market, though UK corporates were thought to be likely borrowers.</p>

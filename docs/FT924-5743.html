			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Record at EMI helps Thorn advance 11% RECORD profits from EMI Music, combined with the benefits of cost-cutting operations, supported an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Thorn EMI, the music and electrical rentals group, from Pounds 94.9m to Pounds 105.2 in the first half. Thorn also announced a higher than expected dividend increase of 4.7 per cent to 9.0p (from 8.6p). The firm performance, which comes at a time when the worldwide music industry is suffering from the effects of economic slowdown, and which included a four-month contribution of Pounds 5m from Virgin Music, was higher than expected in the City. Thorn's share price rose yesterday, closing up 21p at 796p and offsetting recent losses brought on by speculation that the company was having trouble integrating Virgin Music. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said that while the rest of the financial year would continue to be difficult, he expected the full year to show improvement over the last two with the greater contribution from Virgin. 'The UK markets continue to be worse than expected and Rumbelows will continue to suffer,' he said. However, the rationalisation measures undertaken early on in the recession have had a very beneficial effect and should yield annual savings of about Pounds 20m. 'We have the business under good control,' Sir Colin noted. Turnover increased to Pounds 1,945.3m (from Pounds 1,760.5m), helped by a strong performance from EMI Music, where turnover rose 24.6 per cent to Pounds 614.0m. Including the contribution from Virgin, profits at the music division rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 60.6m, although EMI Music achieved record first-half results even before taking Virgin Music profits into account. Contrary to comments made by some industry observers, compact disc sales had not stalled and the sluggishness in the music industry was 'entirely recession driven', Sir Colin said. While unit volumes and revenues from European music markets were sluggish, both the US and Japanese markets saw unit volume and revenue growth. Sir Colin also emphasised that the integration of Virgin Music was going according to plan. The departure earlier this month of Mr Simon Draper, co-founder of Virgin, following that of several other executives, had raised concern that Thorn was facing difficulties integrating the Virgin business, which it purchased in March for Pounds 560m. HMV, the record retailer, however, made a loss of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.9m last time) on increased turnover of Pounds 120.8m (up from Pounds 104.3m). Fully diluted earnings per share were down by 6.9 per cent to 16.6p (from 17.8p) due to the acquisition of Virgin Music. Lex, Page 20</p>

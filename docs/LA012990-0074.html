			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS' THIRD-STRING QB BONO HAS NO ILLUSIONS  </P> <P> Steve Young sits behind Joe Montana and wonders. Steve Bono sits behind both  Montana and Young and comprehends.  </P> <P> Bono is the third-string quarterback on the San Francisco 49ers, a team that  rarely gets past the first-string quarterback named Montana.  </P> <P> And you thought the U.S. ambassador to Iceland was anonymous.  </P> <P> Bono did play briefly this year, in the win over the Jets, subbing for Young  who already was subbing for Montana, and Bono completed all four of his pass  attempts, one for a touchdown.  </P> <P> But as the 49ers prepare for Sunday's Super Bowl against Denver, and the media  swarm about his teammates, Bono goes virtually unnoticed.  </P> <P> "I don't even think I'll be dressed out for the game," said Bono.  </P> <P> There's no bitterness in the comment. Early last year Steve was a man without a  franchise, having been released by Pittsburgh. And now he's on a team in the  tournament championship.  </P> <P> "Just getting here is extremely rewarding," said Bono. "I think of Archie  Manning, who played 13-14 years, whatever, and never was on a winning team. I  got my start because he was released by Minnesota. He never got to the Super  Bowl in his career. That puts it all in perspective."  </P> <P> For Steve Bono, 27, perspective is the operative word. Nothing has gone quite  the way he planned the past 10 years, but he shrugs.  </P> <P> "Expectations weren't met," he says. "But I can't say it's bad luck. You just  do what you can do, and I felt I always worked hard."  </P> <P> Bono was the best high school quarterback in Pennsylvania the fall of 1979, and  also a fine basketball and baseball player. The question was not only which  sport he would choose but which school he would choose.  </P> <P> In his community of Norristown, the Philadelphia suburb that also gave us  Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, the betting was the 6-foot-4, 215-pound, darkly  handsome Bono would select Penn State. Instead he went Hollywood.  </P> <P> Bono enrolled at UCLA, but instead of becoming a star he became a cipher. There  were injuries. There was Jay Schroeder. There was Tom Ramsey. there was --  egad! -- Rick Neuheisel.  </P> <P> Given a chance to start as a junior in 1983 against Brigham Young -- for which  Young was the QB -- Steve set a Bruin record by passing for 399 yards. But the  next week at Stanford he was sacked, suffered a separated shoulder and was gone  for the year. Neuheisel was back to upset Illinois in the 1984 Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> The 1984 season Bono only missed three games -- he had a sprained ankle -- and  then in the 1985 Fiesta Bowl he outdueled a University of Miami quarterback  named Bernie Kosar.  </P> <P> The Vikes took him in the sixth round of the 1985 draft, but after two seasons  of watching Wade Wilson and Tommy Kramer alternate at QB he was released and  signed by the Steelers. His two years at Pittsburgh produced five passes and  three completions.  </P> <P> He beat out Kevin Sweeney as No. 3 quarterback at San Francisco. There may be  disappointment, but there are no illusions.  </P> <P> "I can understand why Steve Young would be frustrated, because he came out of  college runner-up in the Heisman voting and having thrown for a trillion yards.  I was drafted in the sixth round and was a backup from the start.  </P> <P> "My role has been defined for me. People have been honest with me. I credit  (coach) George Seifert and John McVay, the GM, and everyone else."  </P> <P> The past two weeks Bono has portrayed Denver's John Elway in practice against  the 49er defense.  </P> <P> "When I did get to play this year I made a contribution," said Bono, "and I  would hope that in running formations against our defense I'm making a  contribution."  </P> <P> Some of Bono's family lives on the street in Norristown where Lasorda grew up.  When Steve was at UCLA he would work as a bat boy and shag flies at Dodgers  games.  </P> <P> But football is his game and his business.  </P> <P> "Joe Montana amazes me," said Bono. "I knew before I came here he was a winner,  even as far back as high school. But I didn't realize what a great person he  is. That's what amazes me more than anything."  </P> <P> In his attitude, Steve Bono is also quite amazing. He doesn't think about what  might have been only what is.  </P></p>

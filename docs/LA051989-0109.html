			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Thousands of protesters demonstrated in 11 South Korean cities on the  anniversary of the 1980 uprising in the southwestern city of Kwangju, burning  effigies of President Roh Tae Woo and calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops  from the country. In Kwangju, an estimated 100,000 people rallied, while in  Seoul and other cities, thousands joined marches, protests and religious  services. The 10-day Kwangju uprising, which killed nearly 200 people by  official count, hundreds more by unofficial reports, occurred after Roh's  predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, declared martial law and jailed opposition leaders.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Evangelist Jim Bakker suffered stress and not mental illness when he collapsed  Thursday, his wife said. "After 2 1/2 years of sheer mental torture, he was  just stressed out," Tammy Faye Bakker said in a taped statement telecast on the  Jim and Tammy Show. Meanwhile, Bakker's lawyers filed a motion seeking a  mistrial on grounds that the collapse of a witness during defense  cross-examination last week in U.S. District Court in Charlotte, N.C.,  prejudiced the jury. The U.S. Marshal's Office said a hearing would be held  today to determine if Bakker is competent to stand trial on fraud and  conspiracy charges.  </P></p>

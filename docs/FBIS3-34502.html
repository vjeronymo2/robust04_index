			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 8 Feb (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  says that the problem with British Prime Minister Major is that  he, just like the other politicians whose calculations have  proven to be wrong, thought that playing the Kurdish card would  result in destabilizing the Iraqi regime. The end result is  that he has placed his country and the U.S. Administration at an  impasse.    In its editorial today, the paper ridicules Major's  statements that "the Kurdistan region is safe," wondering when  it was actually more safe -- now or before the anti-Iraq  aggression.    The paper answers this question, saying that all fair-minded  people, even Major himself, cannot deny that the Iraqi Kurdistan  region enjoyed stability, security, a high standard of living,  as well as the potential for rapid growth before the onset of  the aggression.    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds that, before the aggression, there was a  kind of tranquility along the Iraqi-Turkish borders--a  tranquility that was marred by only few minor clashes between  the Kurdish Workers Party and the Turkish authorities.    The paper points out the current situation in the Kurdistan  region, including the military interventions there, as well as  the Turkish and Iranian attacks on some positions in the region.  It also mentions the incidents witnessed in southeastern  Turkey, which have been stepped up since the anti-Iraq  aggression.    The paper also speaks of the impasse in which Major placed  the U.S. Administration, as manifested by the presence of the  so-called Hammer Force in the region. The opposition is  wagering on the continued deployment of this force. However,  this force is stuck there. It can neither stay there forever,  nor withdraw, because it has failed to turn the region into a  "safe haven." Likewise, this force cannot establish a Kurdish  state there, because Turkey, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and other states  strongly oppose this.    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: There are indications of another impasse  in Iraqi Kurdistan. For the armed agents in northern Iraq are  confused. Worse still, they feel that they have reached a dead  end, and that they have been exposed as terrorist gangs that are  willing to slay one another for trivial reasons, to betray  Kurdish nationalism, and to collude with the enemies of Kurds  just to maintain their oppression of our Kurdish people.    The paper goes on to say: The people of Kurdistan have begun  to speak publicly, expressing their desire to return to Iraq's  lap. They are singing the praises of His Excellency President  Saddam Husayn and writing graffiti expressing their sentiments  toward his excellency the president.    Concluding its editorial, the paper says that our Kurdish  people's return to Iraq's lap would grant them the warmth,  security, and stability they have been denied in the false "safe  haven" created and protected by the British and Americans. The  "safe haven" the British and Americans created is even robbing  its creators of security, the paper maintains.</p>

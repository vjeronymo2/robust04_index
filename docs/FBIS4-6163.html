			<p>CSO     [Text] NTT Develops Signal Compensator IC for Optical  Communications Receivers    Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) has developed an  integrated circuit (IC) with signal compensator capabilities for  use in optical communications receivers. Wave shapes of signals  transmitted via optical fiber cables tend to disintegrate and  the timing of signals becomes delicately upset, but these new  IC's have the capability to correct such problems. They also  have been improved so that the corrective function is more  precise than with circuits developed in the past and will serve  to enhance the reliability of and to miniaturize optical  transmission systems.    The newly developed IC is a circuit used for required  processing following conversion of the optical signals, received  via optical fiber cables, to electrical signals. It compensates  data signals weakened or contaminated by static while passing  through optical fiber cables. Additionally, when computer  processing is involved, the new IC augments signals with clock  signals and automatically synchronizes them with timing  reflected in data signals. The new IC, as a single unit, will  handle processing previously involving several ICs and delicate  manual adjustments.    First, clock signals are allowed to emanate automatically at  an appropriate frequency and as the compensated data signals  change from a "0 to 1" or "1 to 0" range, the starting point of  the clock signals and compensated data signals are synchronized.  Next, the point in time for the change in the data signal is  captured, deviations in the two signals are checked and the  frequency of the clock signal is subjected to minute adjustment.  Repetition of this process leads to the final synchronization of  the two signals.    Under previous methods, with data signals unchanged, as long  as a "0" or "1" signal was repeated more than seven times, the  data was sent to the central processing unit (CPU) without  detection of deviations. Thus, reliability could be assured only  by controlling deviations via a dedicated circuit.    The newly developed IC has the capability to memorize data  up  to the point where a change in data signal occurs and to make 23  consecutive timing corrections. In reality, the probability of  the same data repeating itself more than 23 times is very small  and such a capacity provides for sufficient commercialization of  the IC. The new IC will provide for miniaturization of  high-capacity receiving systems capable of handling multiple  signals and a reduction in electrical consumption.</p>

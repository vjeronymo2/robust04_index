			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, 28 Nov (TINS)--The chief of air staff,  Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul, has emphasised that China posed a  primary strategic challenge to India in the long term,  notwithstanding the recently-signed LAC [expansion not given]  agreement.    Stressing the need to develop a sound strategy to meet this  "formidable challenge," the air chief observed that China had  emerged as the most powerful military nation which with its high  rate of economic growth and sustained military programme had  drastically altered the military balance in Asia.    "India is thus placed with two contrasting security  dilemmas.  On the one hand, the probability of an armed conflict with China  has been reduced in the short term, but in the long term, by  2005, the threat (from China) will be of a different magnitude  altogether," he said.    Delivering his valedictory address at the end of the two-day  seminar on "Challenges to India's national interest in 1995-2010  and Indian response" organised by the United Services Institute,  Air Chief Marshal Kaul reflected on the double standards of the  U.S. foreign policy, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  unabated low-cost proxy war by Pakistan, the grim internal  security situation and the poor quality of the Indian polity. He  pointed out how all these factors had a dangerous bearing on  India's future national security interests.    The air chief strongly advocated India's need for enhancing  its conventional military capabilities, while simultaneously  initiating confidence-building measures with countries in the  neighbourhood to ensure regional stability.    Reflecting on recent American efforts to revoke the Pressler  amendment on Pakistan, the air chief warned that the fall-out in  this eventuality would add to the security complications.  "Therefore, as an overall threat perspective, I visualise  Pakistan as a potent threat in the short term and China as a  potential strategic challenge in the long term", he said.    Criticising Pakistan for continuing to exercise the low-cost  option of instigating militancy and separatism in Kashmir and  Punjab, he observed that since partition Pakistan had been  following a single track foreign policy of forcing Kashmir's  secession from India.    "The prospect of stability and tension-free relations with  Pakistan is not in sight. Since Independence, Pakistan has  tasted democracy for only a few years and hence, its political  framework still remain fragile. Besides, pressures from the  military junta and Islamic fundamentalists mixed with a strong  perception of its own insecurity has crystalised into adoption  of a nuclear weapons programme and a foreign policy inimical to  our interests," he said.    Accusing the U.S. of hijacking the United Nations, Air Chief  Marshal Kaul said that after the Gulf war, the U.N. was being  used by the U.S. more as an extension to serve its foreign  policy interests. India has been subjected to pressures such as  NPT, MTCR, GATT, NAFTA and Super 301, and pointed to the recent  trend of "coercive diplomacy in the garb of human rights issues"  with a frequent temptation by the west to wield the human rights  stick to settle foreign policy issues.    Pointing to contradictions in this policy, the air chief  said: "The U.S., the so-called champions of human rights, has  admonished China for human rights abuses but still continues to  finalise business deals and extend military co-operation to  China," he said. He regretted that in recent times India's  capabilities in international fora has been somewhat eroded due  to lack of diplomatic support from Russia which is evident from  its policy on cryogenic engines, NPT and even Kashmir.    Stressing the need to set the Indian polity in order, the  air  chief said India needed to be politically cohesive and  internally strong. Founders of the constitution had evidently  presupposed that our polity would be educated and have basic  civic sensibilities. "However, our political system has not been  able to meet the aspirations of our people. Today, we see more  sectarian, partisan and motivated behaviour with dangers of  communalism and fundamentalism causing tremendous strains on the  chosen secular fabric of our country," he said.</p>

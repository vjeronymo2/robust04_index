			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAGE AGREES TO BUY DAILY PILOT AND 4 WEEKLY PAPERS  </P> <P> Robert E. Page, former publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times and Boston Herald,  has agreed as expected to purchase the Orange Coast Daily Pilot and four local  weekly newspapers from Adams Communications Corp. Terms of the transaction were  not disclosed, but sources pegged the price at around $7 million.  </P> <P> Page said the Pilot offices in Costa Mesa would serve as headquarters for a  "Southern California publishing company," and that "other transactions are  pending."  </P> <P> He declined to discuss what other papers he may be purchasing, but is  reportedly pursuing the North Coast Publishers Inc., a group of weeklies in  Northern San Diego County, and the daily Glendale News-Press.  </P> <P> The Pilot, purchased by Adams Communications from Ingersoll Publications last  year, has a circulation of about 23,000 in the Costa Mesa-Newport Beach area.  The weekly newspapers -- all called the Independent -- serve Newport Beach,  Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Pilot publisher Rosemary Churchman has resigned, but Page said other staff  changes were not anticipated at this time. Page emphasized his commitment to  expand the paper's influence and become involved in the community, and added  that he is now living in rented quarters in Newport Beach and expects to settle  in the area.  </P> <P> Financing for the Pilot acquisition, which is expected to close today, came in  part from a New York media investor, Elliot Stein Jr., who will serve as  chairman of Page Group Publishing Inc. Stein is managing partner of a new New  York investment house called Commonwealth Capital Partners, which counts Page's  company as its first investment.  </P> <P> Page described Commonwealth as his "partner" and said it would be involved in  any additional transactions.  </P> <P> Stein's other media interests -- which are not part of Commonwealth -- include  El Vocero, which Stein described as the largest Spanish language newspaper in  Puerto Rico, as well as the Los Angeles-based weekly Mundo Artistico, a trade  magazine company, and four television stations.  </P> <P> Stein said Commonwealth had "a lot of capital" and would "do what it takes" to  help Page build his newspaper group. He noted that Page was "a very imaginative  publisher who's going into a small market compared to what he's done before,  and he's going to apply all his ideas and marketing talents to make (the Pilot)  useful for its readers."  </P> <P> Page said he has no plans for major changes at the Pilot but said he believed  the paper had "significant opportunities" to grow, in terms of circulation,  advertising and influence. He added that the paper would focus on local issues,  emphasizing life style, the arts, local government and high school sports.  </P> <P> The Pilot's circulation has dropped by nearly half since the late 1970s,  falling to about 20,000 when Adams purchased the newspaper in June, 1988. Kirk  Cheyfitz, president of the publishing division of Adams Communications, said in  October that the paper had picked up about 3,000 subscribers.  </P> <P> Page rejected suggestions that the Pilot, which has been caught in the  cross-fire of the fierce competition between The Times and The Orange County  Register, would have to reorient its position in the market.  </P> <P> "I've spent my whole life as an underdog -- at UPI fighting the mighty AP, at  the Boston Herald when (media mogul Rupert) Murdoch first bought it, and at the  Sun-Times, and we've made an awful lot of money," Page said.  </P> <P> Page joined Murdoch in 1981 after a long career at United Press International  and soon became publisher of the Boston Herald. In 1984, he moved to the  Chicago paper, which was also owned at the time by Murdoch, as publisher. Page  led a management buyout of the Sun-Times in 1986 but resigned as publisher last  year and sold his interest after reportedly clashing with investors and other  executives.  </P></p>

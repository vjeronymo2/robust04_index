			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA, the Department's proposed rule states that the structural impracticability exception will apply only in rare and unusual circumstances where unique characteristics of terrain make accessibility unusually difficult. This exception is the same as the exception in the Department's title III regulation, 28 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36.401(c), and is narrower than the exception in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (56 FR 9472 (1991)), which generally would allow exceptions from accessibility requirements, or allow compliance with less stringent requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limited structural impracticability exception adopted by the proposed rule would allow deviations from accessibility requirements only where unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features or where providing accessibility would destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in which a building must be built on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an example of one of the few situations in which the exception for structural impracticability would apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if full compliance with the accessibility standards would be structurally impracticable, compliance is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. Any portion of the facility that can be made accessible must be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In addition, if providing accessibility to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility must nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.152&blank;Alterations: General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New &sect;35.152 of the proposed rule establishes the requirements for alterations. It includes a definition of ``alteration'' based on the Department's title III regulation. The term ``resurfacing'' is added to this definition to be consistent with the Access Board's proposed change to the definition of alteration in ADAAG &sect;3.5. It also adds a definition of the phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as used in &sect;35.152(a), which requires that alterations be done, to the maximum extent feasible, in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is accessible. That proposed definition is taken from the Department's title III regulation, 28 CFR 36.402(c), and provides that the phrase applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In the occasional cases in which full compliance is impossible, alterations shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Like the structural impracticability exception for new construction, it requires that the facility be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities even if providing accessibility for individuals who use wheelchairs would not be feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.153&blank;Alterations: Path of Travel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;35.153, Alterations: Path of Travel, is also based on the title III regulation. UFAS and ADAAG both contain requirements for provision of an accessible ``path of travel'' to the altered area when an existing facility is altered, although the circumstances that trigger the requirements are somewhat different under each statute. Under &sect;4.1.6(3) of UFAS, an accessible route to the altered area, an accessible entrance, and (where applicable) accessible toilet facilities must be provided when a substantial alteration is made to an existing building. An alteration is considered ``substantial'' if the total cost of all alterations within any twelve-month period amounts to 50% or more of the full and fair cash value of the building. The proposed rule eliminates the UFAS ``substantial alteration'' basis for path of travel requirements because it eliminates UFAS as an option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The path of travel requirements of proposed &sect;35.153 are based on section 303(a)(2) of the ADA, which provides that, when an entity undertakes an alteration to a place of public accommodation or commercial facility that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area that contains a primary function, the entity shall ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;35.153 provides that areas such as mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges and locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Nor are restrooms areas containing a primary function unless the provision of restrooms is the major reason that the facility is maintained by a public entity, such as at a highway rest stop. In that situation, a restroom would be considered to be an ``area containing a primary function'' of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement for an accessible path of travel does not apply, however, to the extent that the cost and scope of alterations to the path of travel is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General. Sections 227 and 242 of the ADA adopt the same requirement for public transportation facilities under title II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4.1.6(2) of the ADA Standards, which is not modified by the Access Board's proposed amendments, adopts the statutory path of travel requirement, and &sect;36.403 of the Department's title III regulation establishes the criteria for determining when the cost of alterations to the path of travel are ``disproportionate'' to the cost of the overall alteration. The proposed rule would add a new &sect;35.153(d) to adopt the same disproportionality criteria for facilities altered by public entities as are applied to private entities under title III. Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area would be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.154&blank;Alterations: Historic Preservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;35.154 would incorporate the procedures set out in section 4.1.7 of the ADA Standards for determining whether a physical alteration would threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic property and would replace &sect;35.151(d) of the Department's current title II regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.155&blank;Standards for New Construction and Alterations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;35.155 provides that, as of the effective date of this amendment, new construction and alterations subject to the regulation shall comply with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design published as Appendix A to 28 CFR part 37 in this publication. Appendix A to 28 CFR part 37, which the proposed rule would adopt as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, would incorporate the text of the revised ADAAG, which is published as an interim rule elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS UP  </P> <P> The Assn. for California Tort Reform said punitive damage awards by juries have  risen 266% since 1987. Association President Frank Schubert issued a statement  with a report saying, "When one out of 10 jury verdicts is likely to result in  a punitive damage award averaging more than $4 million, it is not difficult to  understand why business leaders are leery of California's legal climate. It is  a major reason why California is slowly losing its competitive edge to lesser  competitors." A review of 1,868 verdicts by Jury Verdicts Weekly showed that  the average punitive damage award is nearly $4.4 million. While the percentage  of cases resulting in punitive damages has declined from 16.1% in 1987 to 9.9%  in 1989, the average dollar amount being awarded has increased from $1.64  million in 1987 to $4.38 million in 1989.  </P></p>

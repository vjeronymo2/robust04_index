			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (26): Viewers fear too much power in too few hands - The media are in the news As they voted to elect a new Bundestag, or lower house, Germans were relieved that they had at last reached the end of a mammoth round of local, state and federal elections. For over seven weeks, television and radio devoted worthy discussions about the campaign. Some politicians said they feared the electorate was sick of the non-stop coverage. But behind the scenes, another debate was taking place: how to re-write Germany's broadcasting law. The discussion coincides with a period of rapid change in the media where Germany's moguls and non-Germans are joining ranks or competing to increase their market share. According to Mr Dieter Wolf, president of the country's federal Cartel Office, Germany's television - and media owner ship structure - is an oligopoly. There are two public television channels: ARD and ZDF. These faced competition a decade ago when the German government allowed independent channels to operate. The three largest privately-owned channels are SAT1, RTL and Pro 7. The bulk of the television advertising, worth an annual DM4.8bn, goes to two media groups - Leo Kirch, whose high-tech studios are based in Munich, and Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media group, which has joined forces with CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcasting company. Kirch has a 43 per cent stake in SAT1, a 25 per cent stake in Premier TV, a pay TV movie channel, a 48 per cent stake in Pro 7, a 25 per cent stake in Deutsches SportFernsehen (DSF), a sports channel, and substantial stakes in a Swiss, Italian and Spanish channel. He also holds a 35 per cent stake plus one vote in the Springer publishing house, which in turn holds a 20 per cent stake in SAT1. Alongside the Kirch group is Bertelsmann. It holds a 37.5 per cent stake in Premiere TV, 38.9 per cent in RTL and has a 74.9 per cent in the Gruner+Jahr giant publishing house, as well as stakes in Stern and Spiegel, the political weeklies. Until recently, Germany's broadcasting authorities turned a blind eye, or at least kept the debate about reforming the ownership structure of Germany's independent television channels on the back-burner. But two recent developments brought the issue out into the open. The first was the decision by Mr Rupert Murdoch, the Australian mogul and owner of Times Newspapers in the UK, and Bertelsmann to save VOX, the television channel by taking a 49.9 per cent stake. The other development was a major venture by Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly, to create a joint venture called Media Service which will offer to manage and distribute new TV channels, as well as specialist tele communications services on Deutsche Telekom's cable tele vision network. This venture was referred to the European Commission which earlier this month ruled that the Media Service would hinder competition. The three parties are expected to return to the drawing board and revise their plans. The three partners meanwhile have insisted that 'the new joint venture will not act as a broadcaster or provider of programming,' and will be scrupulously neutral in its treatment of future clients, restricting itself to technical, administrative and distribution services. All sides are also adamant that they are not seeking to create a monopoly over distribution of future digital television services in Germany. But the Cartel Office, and Germany's Medienanstalten, which consists of 15 regulators representing each of the 15 states, are sceptical. 'Having oligopolies is one thing. But we have to see if there is no competition between them,' said Mr Wolf. The Medienanstalten are just as sceptical and even more critical about the ownership structures in German broadcasting. The Medienanstalten are quangos which also represent the regions and local communities. They are supposed to act as a watchdog with the aim of ensuring a variety of high quality programmes for the German consumer. They carry out this task by issuing broadcasting licences. A regulator, for example, can award satellite and cable licences, which would give a TV station access to about half of Germany's households. In addition, any station must apply to the individual regulators in each state for terrestrial frequencies. 'We want more competition. But where does the border lie?,' said Mr Hans Hege, chief regulator for the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Mr Hege's concern is that the Media Service backed by Bertelsmann and Kirch will effectively monopolise the market. 'The big issue is one of concentration by the oligopolies. What is required now is a new media law which would monitor and control both market and audience share.' Under current legislation, owners of independent, private television cannot own more than 49 per cent in any channel. But what some regulators want is a law which allows any individual broadcaster no more than a 35 per cent stake of the audience. That might be hard to monitor given that audiences fluctuate. Moreover, that law would not weaken the oligopolies run by Bertelsmann and Kirch which in theory could together dominate well over half the audience share through their diverse television channels and their overlapping ownership interests. 'We have to consider all these things,' said Mr Wolf. 'But we have to make sure that competition between the oligopolies continues to exist,' he added. Recent developments suggest otherwise.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS STIFFER PENALTY ON WEAPONS  </P> <P> I am a sixth grader who is entering junior high next year. I will not feel safe  knowing that a person with a gun or a knife will be transferred to my school or  return after a few days suspension. I think an expulsion is not too extreme for  a student who can threaten the life of any person on campus! Does the school  board care at all about endangering the lives of people on campus?  </P> <P> SUN-YUP PARK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

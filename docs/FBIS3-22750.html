He said today the government had set aside funds to  modernise  the armed forces to deter any prospective aggressor.    "With the armed forces' improved capabilities, an aggressor  will think twice about testing our defence," he added.    Najib said this when interviewed on the TV3's inaugural  Malaysia Hari Ini [Malaysia Today] morning talk show.    He also said the government was reviewing the national  defense policy to keep it in line with the changes and  challenges facing the armed forces.    He said the higher defense spending should not be seen as an  attempt by Malaysia to join the arms race.    However, this was to keep up with developments in defense  technology to ensure the armed forces had modern equipment and  for continuous economic development.    During the special programme, Najib also answered public  enquiries and suggestions through the toll-free telephone lines.    To a caller's question, Najib said the armed forces did not  plan to include nuclear arms as part of its modernization  programme.    There was no need for such weapons in the region since the  end of the Cold War had removed superpower rivalry in the  region, he explained.    To another question, Najib said Malaysian troops were safe  in  Bosnia despite the Serb forces' recent threat to retaliate  against the air strike threat by NATO.    NATO had threatened to carry out air strikes if the Serb  forces did not pull back their heavy guns from the hills around  Sarajevo.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MEXICO STATE'S HILL GOES TO BANK TO BEAT UNLV  </P> <P> Keith Hill's 16-foot bank shot with five seconds left Monday night gave New  Mexico State an 83-82 Big West Conference victory over No. 7-ranked Nevada Las  Vegas.  </P> <P> The Aggies, off to their best start since a Final Four appearance in 1969-70,  are 12-1 and 3-0 in the Big West.  </P> <P> UNLV dropped to 9-3 and 4-1.  </P> <P> Hill finished with 19 points, and guard Randy Brown, who carried the Aggies  offensively in the first half, scored a season-high 27.  </P> <P> UNLV had 24 points from David Butler and 12 each from Larry Johnson and Greg  Anthony. Johnson had a final attempt to avoid the upset, but his 12-foot  turnaround jump shot hit the front of the rim as the Pan American Center crowd  of 12,719 celebrated the Aggies' first victory win ever over the Runnin'  Rebels.  </P></p>

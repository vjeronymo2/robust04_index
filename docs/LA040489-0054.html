			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA TO LEARN FROM WEST -- BUT WON'T END SOCIALISM  </P> <P> China intends to learn from Hong Kong and Western countries in building a  stronger economy, but this does not mean that the country is abandoning  socialism, Premier Li Peng said Monday.  </P> <P> "In the course of reform and opening to the outside world, we will draw on some  of the worthwhile experiences and methods of Western countries," Li said during  a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. "But whatever is done must  be appropriate for the actual conditions of China."  </P> <P> Speaking specifically of the role played by Hong Kong as a model for Chinese  development, Li stressed that China does not plan to copy Hong Kong's entire  economic and social system.  </P> <P> "Hong Kong will keep its current capitalist system and the Chinese mainland  will cling to its socialist system," Li said.  </P> <P> But Li said there is much China can learn from the British colony, which is due  to revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hong Kong Experiences  </P> <P> "If some regions and cities . . . want to experiment with or draw on some of  the experiences of Hong Kong in order to reach the same level of prosperity as  in Hong Kong, I think this is understandable," he said.  </P> <P> Li, speaking in a similar fashion about political reform, said that China will  gradually institute greater democracy, but that democratization must not  proceed too quickly or too far.  </P> <P> "If the democratic process is not well attended to -- say if work in this  regard is carried out in haste or to an excessive extent -- then it will  certainly affect the situation of unity and stability," the premier said. "If  the stable situation is undermined then it won't make our work of construction  of reform smooth."  </P> <P> China also will not copy the political reforms now under way in the Soviet  Union, Li added. "China's conditions are different from those in the Soviet  Union, and we cannot copy the Soviet Union's methods," he said.  </P> <P> In a speech two weeks ago at the opening of the current 16-day annual session  of the National People's Congress, Li spoke at length about errors made last  year in economic policies. He was especially critical of a failure to take  action quickly enough to fight inflation, which according to official  statistics ran at 26% in 1988. Inflation, which has run at an even higher rate  for food and other daily necessities, has aroused widespread dissatisfaction.  </P> <P> At Monday's press conference, Li stressed that the mistakes made last year came  "in the course of progress and development."  </P> <P> Li also pointed out that major policy decisions in China are made by the  Communist Party Politburo and its Standing Committee. The State Council,  China's Cabinet -- which he heads as premier -- is responsible for implementing  these decisions. He said that he shares responsibility for errors last year but  that the responsibility is not his alone.  </P> <P> China's three vice premiers -- Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian -- also  appeared at the press conference and spoke in response to a few questions that  Li turned over to them.  </P> <P> Yao, answering a question about a controversial proposal to build a huge dam  that would flood the scenic Three Gorges section of the Yangtze River, said  that both supporters and opponents of the project have "strong arguments." More  study is needed, he said, but in any case, China's economic situation will not  allow the project to be started anytime during the next five years.  </P> <P> "I think now we can stop arguing about this project for a while," he concluded.  </P></p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Nadir's donation may be returned, says Major MR JOHN MAJOR signalled last night that the Tory party was seriously considering returning the Pounds 440,000 donated by Mr Asil Nadir. His comments came amid growing pressure on Mr Michael Mates, the junior minister linked to Mr Nadir, to resign, threatening a fresh crisis for the government. Speaking to journalists on his arrival in Copenhagen for the European Community summit, the prime minister appeared to suggest that the failure by the fugitive businessman to declare the donations in company accounts could be sufficient reason for their return. In an attempt to defuse the mounting furore, Mr Major reinforced Tory officials' pledges that the money would be returned to the administrators of Polly Peck if it was proved to have been dishonestly obtained or remitted by Mr Nadir. 'Any money that was dishonestly obtained and dishonestly donated to the Conservative party is not wanted by the Conservative party,' he said. 'If it is proved to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us, then of course we will return it.' But while stressing his determination that his party should act properly, Mr Major refused to comment on the future of Mr Mates, the security minister at the Northern Ireland office. Support for Mr Mates among Tory MPs fell rapidly at the weekend, and senior MPs voiced concern that he may have to resign amid the failure of the party hierarchy to stop continuing controversy over the support given to Mr Nadir by Conservatives before he fled to northern Cyprus. Senior Whitehall officials acknowledged that it had been 'unwise' of Mr Mates to accept the loan of a car from Mr Nadir's public relations advisers. His future is expected to be raised when the powerful 1922 executive of Tory backbench MPs meets on Thursday. One member, among the most pessimistic about Mr Mates's chances of survival, said yesterday: 'I doubt whether he will last that long.' A resignation would be a further embarrassment for Mr Major who has only just recovered from the fallout after Mr Norman Lamont's sacking as chancellor. Even Tory MPs who are suggesting that Mr Mates may have to go accept that it would be another example of Mr Major losing a minister after media pressure. Mr Mates was unavailable for comment yesterday. However, colleagues were concerned at the impact of the row which began with revelations that Mr Mates had raised with the Attorney General Mr Nadir's treatment by the Serious Fraud Office. The row over the Nadir donations has triggered calls from within the Tory party for a wider review of how it sets out its accounts  - demands likely to be reiterated when the Commons debates the funding of political parties tomorrow. Conservative Central Office said yesterday that Sir John Cope, former deputy chairman and now Treasury minister, had written two years ago to liquidators of Mr Nadir's business empire setting out the payments the party had received from him. However, it was still waiting to be told formally if the donations had been from 'stolen money'. Mr David Mellor, former cabinet minister, said one way of dealing with the issue would be to recognise that the money would never appear a legitimate donation  - however honourable it seemed at the time  - and send it back. Administrators at accountants Touche Ross have traced a series of payments totalling Pounds 365,000 during 1987-90 which were paid through a bank account in Jersey of Unipac, the northern Cyprus-based packaging manufacturer within the Polly Peck group. Touche has also identified several payments totalling at least Pounds 75,000 in the period 1985-87 paid directly with funds from Polly Peck International, the parent company. None of these political donations was disclosed in the group accounts, although these details are required by the law. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, seized on the latest twists in the financing row to underline his demands that the Conservative party repay immediately the money contributed by Mr Nadir. Mr Major should explain publicly the 'very murky' circumstances in which funds were paid to the Tories, he said. Tories unsettled, Page 7 Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM MIGHTY MICHELIN, LE CROCODILE GAINS THAT THIRD STAR  </P> <P> The 80th edition of the venerable Michelin food and travel guide was published  in France on Thursday with the news that Le Crocodile in Strasbourg, has been  added to the guide's three-star ranking. The newest member of the Michelin  firmament brings the guide's number of three-star restaurants in France to just  19 restaurants.  </P> <P> Le Crocodile, founded about 1790, was bought by its present owner/chef, Emile  Jung, in 1971. Jung earned his first Michelin star at the restaurant the  following year, and his second star in 1975.  </P> <P> Shut out of the three-star category was Paris' long-favored three-star  candidate, Guy Savoy, which almost every established French critic argues is  among the best and most consistent restaurants in France.  </P> <P> Paris is also abuzz over the demotion of four prominent two-star restaurants  that were dropped to one star. They include the Chantecler at the Hotel  Negresco in Nice (penalized because its high-profile chef, Jacques Maximin,  left to open his own restaurant) and the Beau Rivage Condrieu, whose longtime  patronne, Paulette Castaing, retired last year and sold the restaurant.  </P> <P> The guide, available in the United States in April, is expected to sell for  $17.95.

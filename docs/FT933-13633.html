			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Rich in quieter pleasures - Fiction A FAMILY ROMANCE by Anita Brookner Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 218 pages EYES by Maggie Hemingway Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 186 pages MUSIC FOR GLASS ORCHESTRA by Grace Andreacchi Serpent's Tail Pounds 8.99, 199 pages FEW contemporary novelists will be read 50 years from now but I am sure that Anita Brookner will be one. This is her 13th novel and while it will certainly please her admirers it is unlikely to win any converts among those who find her work rather tame and predictable. It is some time since I read Anita Brookner and I had forgotten how rich her work is in the quieter pleasures of fiction. The careful precision of her beautifully-balanced prose should not be underestimated, even if you cannot get excited by the subject matter. Once again, in A Family Romance, Anita Brookner writes about what the narrator, Jane, refers to as 'the quiet exigencies of my not very onerous life'. Jane, who was about five years old in 1969, is younger than many a Brookner heroine but equal weight is given to Jane's Aunt Dolly, who was in her early 20s during the American liberation of Paris. The title of the novel is mildly ironic, as Jane has very little family - soon only Aunt Dolly is left - and there is precious little romance. The story really concerns the strange relationship which develops between frivolous, worldly Aunt Dolly - 'Let them think of you always as singing and dancing' - and quiet, intellectual Jane, of the 'not very onerous life'. Jane is one of those people who are born middle-aged: a single, independently-wealthy writer of children's books who also lectures on fairy tales and is content to live in a small but sunny flat in Dolphin Square. She is acclaimed by feminist academics of her own age but finds she prefers company of 'placid, dignified women, mostly in their 50s . . .' There is no sudden conquering of Jane and Dolly's mutual dislike but over the years Jane comes to see a fascinating combination of toughness and simplicity in her aunt, one of nature's survivors. Eyes is, alas, published posthumously. Maggie Hemingway died at the age of 47 shortly after completing it. Four stories are told in alternating sections, each taking place at a different time and place in history. There is no obvious relation between the characters and events but in each there is a sense that something very nasty is about to happen and there is a witness to the growing evil who does nothing to avert it. We observe the courtship of a young Duchess in the Veneto in 1528 through the eyes of one of the Duke's secretaries; two French reed cutters, one of them dumb, witness their psychopathic neighbour's brutal treatment of his wife in 1871; a wealthy woman is picked up by a bounder in a Kensington hotel in 1928 and takes him off to her house in Keswick; a lonely spinster intrudes on the happy marriage of a farmer's friendly wife in the West Country in 1971 . . . The interwoven fragments of story get shorter and closer together and come to a climax in the last pages with four women meeting watery deaths. The horror bridges the centuries. The last three pages are a tour de force in stream-of-consciousness writing. This kind of thing can only be carried off by the very best and we have lost one of them in Hemingway. Grace Andreacchi is an American who writes about Paris in a way that is sometimes surreal, hence her publisher's claim that she is 'in the tradition of Djuna Barnes'. The difference is that the great Djuna knew what she was doing; Andreacchi does not. The novel is wildly out of control, exhibitionist and self-indulgent, veering from grim realism to high surrealism, coy confessional to learned dissertation. However, it is seldom dull. It begins well with the narrator's wry description of her escape from the Boston suburbs, her decrepit Paris apartment and her alcoholic violin-playing lover, Stephane. The Stephane sequences are the best thing in the book, dominated by images of shattered glass, music, predatory birds and wolves. In contrast to the poetic language and the erudition displayed elsewhere, sex is described either mechanically or with compulsive alliteration. The latter is truly awful: 'He pricked and pushed with his penis which protruded like a pink plant from his printed pants'. Even worse, in a novel which (believe it or not after that) does sometimes soar, is a bathetic use of the American wise-guy voice in sly asides. The true surrealist has no ego; Andreacchi has too much.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NOT FIRST TIME SLUGGER HAS HIT LEADOFF  </P> <P> I have to agree with Scott Ostler's defense of Tom Lasorda's decision to use  Kirk Gibson in the leadoff spot, although the glowing results to date are  self-evident.  </P> <P> There is also a precedent for Lasorda's move.  </P> <P> When Willie Mays was at his pinnacle in the mid- to late 1950s, an All-Star  manager received similar umbrage over his decision to have Mays lead off.  However, the National League lineup was so loaded that the manager drooled at  the prospect of affording Mays an extra at-bat.  </P> <P> I wish I could remember the results of Mays' efforts.  </P> <P> DON BUDAY  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P> <P>  Editor's note: It wasn't rare for Mays to lead off in All-Star games. He did  it eight times. The first six times (1958, twice in '60, '65, '66, '68), his  totals were 10 hits in 23 at-bats with eight runs scored. In '70 and '71, the  last two times he led off, he was hitless in five at-bats overall.  </P> <P> </P></p>

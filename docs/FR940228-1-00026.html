			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Equipment used in industrial radiographic operations must meet the following minimum criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Each radiographic exposure device and all associated equipment must meet the requirements specified in American National Standard N432&hyph;1980 ``Radiological Safety for the Design and Construction of Apparatus for Gamma Radiography,'' (published as NBS Handbook 136, issued January 1981). This publication has been approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a). This publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402 and from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018, Telephone (212) 642&hyph;4900. Copies of the document are available for inspection at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Library, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Lower Level, Bethesda, Maryland, 20814. A copy of the document is also on file at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC 20408.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In addition to the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the following requirements apply to radiographic exposure devices and associated equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Each radiographic exposure device must have attached to it by the user, a durable, legible, clearly visible label bearing the_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Chemical symbol and mass number of the radionuclide in the device;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Activity and the date on which this activity was last measured;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Model number and serial number of the sealed source;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Manufacturer of the sealed source; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Licensee's name, address, and telephone number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Radiographic exposure devices intended for use as Type B transport containers must meet the applicable requirements of 10 CFR Part 71.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Modification of radiographic exposure devices and associated equipment is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In addition to the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the following requirements apply to radiographic exposure devices, source assemblies, and associated equipment that allow the source to be moved out of the device for routine operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The coupling between the source assembly and the control cable must be designed in such a manner that the source assembly will not become disconnected if cranked outside the guide tube. The coupling must be such that it cannot be unintentionally disconnected under normal and reasonably foreseeable abnormal conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The device must automatically secure the source assembly when it is cranked back into the fully shielded position within the device. This securing system may only be released by means of a deliberate operation on the exposure device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The outlet fittings, lock box, and drive cable fittings on each radiographic exposure device must be equipped with safety plugs or covers which must be installed during storage and transportation to protect the source assembly from water, mud, sand or other foreign matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Each sealed source or source assembly must have attached to it or engraved on it, a durable, legible, visible label with the words:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> ``DANGER_RADIOACTIVE''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The label must not interfere with the safe operation of the exposure device or associated equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) The guide tube must have passed the crushing tests for the control tube as specified in ANSI N432 and a kinking resistance test that closely approximates the kinking forces likely to be encountered during use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Guide tubes must be used when moving the source out of the device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) An exposure head or similar device designed to prevent the source assembly from passing out of the end of the guide tube must be attached to the outermost end of the guide tube during radiographic operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The guide tube exposure head connection must be able to withstand the tensile test for control units specified in ANSI N432.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Source changers must provide a system for ensuring that the source will not be accidentally withdrawn from the changer when connecting or disconnecting the drive cable to or from a source assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) All newly manufactured radiographic exposure devices and associated equipment acquired by licensees after January 10, 1992, must comply with the requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) All radiographic exposure devices, source assemblies, and associated equipment in use after January 10, 1996, must comply with the requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) All associated equipment acquired after January 10, 1996, must be labelled to identify that the components have met the requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Section 34.21 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;34.21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Limits on levels of radiation for radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source changers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

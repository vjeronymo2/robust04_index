			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Mixed signals from China on Hong Kong: Patten prepares move towards democracy China is issuing conflicting signals over Hong Kong even though failure to reach agreement in Sino-British talks is expected today to lead Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, to announce he is pressing ahead with the first stage of his proposals for broader democracy. Mr Patten is expected to tell legislators that he will introduce a bill dealing with 'straightforward' issues concerning Hong Kong's elections next year and in 1995, leaving the most contentious aspects open for further discussion with Beijing if talks should continue. Although Chinese officials have warned against this step, there has been a softening in their rhetoric by comparison with other difficult periods in relations over Hong Kong. The threat that no more talks would take place if Mr Patten proceeds has so far been absent from their comments. Meeting businessmen from Hong Kong, Mr Lu Ping, director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, made no reference to talks ending if Mr Patten put his bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. However, it also emerged yesterday that Britain's confidence that China would honour the 1984 Joint Declaration on Hong Kong was shaken in the latest round of talks in Beijing at the weekend. It was understood that Beijing told British negotiators China would reintroduce appointments to Hong Kong's local government if Mr Patten abolishes this system and has all seats elected. According to the Hong Kong Economic Journal, a leading business paper, Mr Christopher Hum, head of the UK team, pointed out this went against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law which vest such power in the Hong Kong government that succeeds Mr Patten's administration. The Chinese remark was seen as potentially undermining the Joint Declaration's statement that after sovereignty reverts from Britain to China in 1997, Hong Kong will enjoy a 'high degree of autonomy', with 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong'. Despite the apparent breakdown of the talks, British officials point out that China has agreed to attend a meeting in London next week of the Joint Liaison Group, the body charged with working out details of the 1997 transfer. Beijing has not yet responded to London's request for a further round of talks on political development, the officials said. Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong politician, said in a radio interview from the Chinese capital that talks could proceed as long as Legco took no final decisions. Mr Zhou Nan, Beijing's top official in Hong Kong, assured Hong Kong political figures visiting Kunming that China would do its best to preserve Hong Kong's prosperity and stability even if Britain acted unilaterally on the political front. Lord Howe, the former UK foreign secretary who negotiated the Joint Declaration, said yesterday that it was overridingly important for Britain and China to renew their commitment to a common course leading to agreement over Hong Kong. Responding to questions from a parliamentary select committee, he said it was important for Britain to maintain consistency in dealing with China, but declined to be drawn into discussing the specifics of the current impasse.</p>

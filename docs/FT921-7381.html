			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Motoring: Safety first as VW goes for airbags LOOK back over the past 50 years and you find that what started out as unique features of cars then became commonplace and finally turned into essential equipment no buyer would dream of doing without. Take heaters. The first volume-produced British car to have one was the Austin 16 of the late 1940s. It took the chill off the inside but, as mature drivers will recall and young owners of collectable motors have discovered, if you wanted fresh air you had to open a window. Within 10 years, though, drivers of all but the cheapest vehicles had proper through-flow heating and ventilating systems which de-misted and de-frosted as well as keeping them warm. Other features first seen as revolutionary, but which soon became conventional, were independent suspension, five-speed transmissions with synchromesh on all gears, heated rear windows, radial-ply tyres and ABS (anti-lock) brakes. Most of today's motorists can have little idea what it is like to drive cars without screen-washers, radio/tape players, outside mirrors and double dipping headlamps, and with safety belts - if you wore them  - that pinned you immovably in your seat. Not all innovations have caught on. Two that came post-Second World War from the US and soon died in Europe were bench-type front seats and steering column gear-shifts (although both are still alive and well in the medium-size Toyotas and Nissans used as taxis in Japan). But two other US-inspired items, the catalytic converter and airbag, will fare better in Europe. The converter, invented to solve the smog problem in a few Pacific-coast cities, will be compulsory for all new petrol-engined European cars from next year. (Never mind that it has failed to clean-up California's air and diverted attention from the real, long-term answer - the development of lean-burn engines that reduce pollution by using far less fuel). So far, the airbag has played an insignificant part in reducing injuries and deaths to car occupants in Europe. There are two reasons: it has been very costly and seat belts must by law be worn in all European countries. In the US, there is no such requirement and only a minority wear them - an odd situation for a country that is, otherwise, hag-ridden by consumer protectionists. By itself, an airbag is much less effective at preventing injuries than a lap and diagonal seat belt. But, used in conjunction with belts - especially the kind that tighten automatically at the moment of impact - it offers a very high degree of protection. Mercedes-Benz invented the airbag and first fitted them to cars sold in the US in 1980. About 700,000 Mercedes cars with bags are in use round the world, although not many of them in Europe. Airbags have been an optional extra for Mercedes' buyers in Britain since 1984 but, at Pounds 1,433 each for driver and front passenger, there were not many takers. Last October, driver-side airbags were made standard equipment on the new S-class, the SLs and the 500E. And the option price for lesser models was almost halved, to Pounds 750 apiece. Now, Volkswagen has said that, for just Pounds 500 a pair, buyers of the new Vento (a booted Golf that arrives in Britain late this year) will be offered airbags for drivers and front passengers. These 'Euro-bags' are cheaper because they are smaller than those fitted by Mercedes. They are meant strictly to supplement seat belts, not to be used instead of them (as do many US drivers of cars with airbags). Their main job is to lessen the risk of facial injuries. Volkswgen's offer of cheap Euro-bags to Vento-buyers is courageous, It seems likely to be as trend-setting as was Ford's decision eight years ago to make ABS brakes standard on every Granada.</p>

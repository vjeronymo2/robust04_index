			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Information Service of the 107th Chivalrous </F> Motorized Gradacac Brigade]    [Text] This morning goes to prove the well-known fact that  the relative quiet in Gradacac is a delusion, as the aggressor  can turn this front quickly and suddenly into a scene of total  war. Gradacac and the surrounding area have been vibrating to  the thunder of heavy shells exploding since 0530 this morning.  The enemy launched this extremely powerful artillery attack  from Gornje Krecane with three tanks, 82-mm and 120-mm mortars,  recoilless guns, and all kinds of antiaircraft weapons. At the  time of this report, over 500 shells have already landed on the  defense lines in Novalici, (Osmanovici), and Vida. Over 50 have  been directed at the town center.    This situation reminds us of the time of July 1992. Gradacac  is experiencing true hell. This is the worst morning of the war  this year.    At about 0800 the chetniks launched an infantry attack at  the  area of (Osmanovici), but it was successfully repelled. [words  indistinct] Jasenica, and Rajska also came under a very heavy  artillery, infantry, and armored attack early this morning. As  we report, the situation on the front is deteriorating further  and the attacks seem to be intensifying. The aggressor is  firing howitzers at the town center. But despite everything the  defense lines are firm and stable.</p>

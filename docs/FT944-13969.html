			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Warrants issued on Italian index International investors should enjoy easier access to the Italian equities market following the launch of two new derivatives products. NatWest Markets will today launch a series of call warrants related to each constituent share of Italy's MIB-30 index, while Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, yesterday issued warrants on the MIB index itself. Both developments come ahead of the expected launch in November of stock index futures on the Milan exchange. They should help further improve market liquidity. NatWest has launched warrants exercisable into several Italian stocks, including Fiat and Olivetti, over the past 18 months. It will create a liquid secondary market in the warrants by publishing 'live' two-way prices on Reuters. 'This will give investors flexibility, choice and guaranteed liquidity,' said Mr Nick Conington, a director of derivatives at NatWest Securities. The new warrants will be offered with a one-year maturity to fill a 'perceived gap' in the market, explained Mr Conington. 'Options quoted on the Milan bourse, known as premi, typically have a life of just one or two months,' he said. Morgan Stanley's warrants are on the MIB-30 index, which has been chosen as the official index of the Italian stock exchange. The bank said the issues are 'intended to provide investors with similar exposures to those that would be obtained on a traditional traded option market.' Maturities coincide with anticipated futures expiry dates. Morgan Stanley is issuing calls and puts at each strike and maturity to allow investors to choose the warrant most suited to their needs. The bank launched warrants on Italy's BCI-30 index in July last year and remains an active player in that market. Trading is expected to start in the stock index future on November 28 on Milan's 'telematico' screen-based system.</p>

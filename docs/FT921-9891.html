			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Cookery: Savouries for sweethearts SWEET talk is all very well but even a romantic can have too much of sickly, sentimental things. The lead-up to St Valentine's Day, with its surfeit of foodie shop-window displays, restaurant promotions and magazine cookery features, tends to leave the punter more sick than lovesick. By the time February 14 arrives, many of us find it hard to stomach the thought - let alone the taste - of yet another passion fruit pud, heart-shaped chocolate confection or anything else drenched in a confetti of icing sugar. If you believe that the way to a (wo)man's heart is through the stomach, you might find that Cupid's arrow flies faster if more macho flavours than sugar and honey are used. Waving my match-maker's wand, I suggest you try the vivid tastes of spices, anchovies, kidneys and that unfailing aphrodisiac, oyster. Use these ingredients for old-fashioned savouries to round off dinner a deux. Serve them as light supper snacks for picnics by the fire. Or save them for midnight feasting. I await wedding invitations from satisfied readers. DEVILLED KIDNEYS This is enough for a small snack. Skin, halve and core 4 lamb kidneys. Dice  1/2 oz butter into a small, fire-proof dish and slip the dish under a hot grill. When the butter is sizzling, add the kidneys and coat them all over with the fat. Grill the kidneys cut side up for 1-1 1/2 minutes, then cut side down for 1-1 1/2 minutes. Meanwhile, mash 1 oz softened butter with two teaspoons English mustard powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcester sauce, and a shake each of cayenne pepper, anchovy essence and mushroom ketchup to make a sloppy paste. Turn the kidneys cut side up again. Dot the devilled butter over them and add any of the devilled juices the butter has failed to absorb. Grill for a further 1-1 1/2 minutes until bubbling, then serve on thick, hot rounds of fluted toast. SCOTCH WOODCOCK Romantics will abandon the kitchen stove in favour of toasting the bread on a fork and stirring the sauce in the fringes of a log fire. Crush the anchovy fillets from a 50g can into a little of their oil. Toast 2 large, half-inch thick slices of bread. Cut into crust-less triangles, spread with the pounded anchovies and keep hot. Melt  1/2 oz butter in a small pan. Add 2 egg yolks beaten with 3 tablespoons thick cream, some black pepper and a little salt. Stir over a very low flame until the mixture begins to thicken. Do not boil or the eggs will scramble. Pour the thick, creamy sauce over the toast, dust with a shake each of paprika and cayenne, and tuck in. SPICED CHICKEN WINGS Here is bone-picking, finger-licking food for Tom Jones fantasists. Mix together 2 heaped tablespoons each black peppercorns, cumin and coriander seeds. Reduce to a coarse (not fine) powder. Work in 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons chilli powder (or more for sting), some garlic cloves crushed with salt, and 2 tablespoons or so of sesame oil to make a creamy paste. Prick 4-6 meaty chicken wings all over with a fork. Coat them carefully with the paste, then cover and leave them in a cool place for several hours to absorb the flavours. Cook on a grid close to the flame of a hot grill until the chicken skin begins to crisp. Then, grill more gently and further away from the flame for about 15 minutes until well cooked, turning the pieces at least once during this time. Whizz the heat right up at the end to burnish and frazzle the skin deliciously. OYSTER GRATIN Six or nine oysters per person may be enough for an appetiser, but one dozen are better for a fireside supper dish. This way of cooking the molluscs makes a lovely alternative to serving them raw. Make a creamy and delicate sauce with  1/2 oz butter, 2 tablespoons flour, 3/4 pt milk,  1/4 pt thick cream, a bay leaf and a slice each of onion and carrot. (I tie the flavourings in butter muslin and cook them in the sauce - it saves scalding the milk and infusing it with the flavourings first.) Simmer the sauce gently without a lid, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or so until rich. Remove the bag of flavourings and stir in 3/4 -1 oz each freshly-grated Parmesan and Gruyere. Add the liquor drained from two dozen oysters and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Lay the oysters in their deep-curved shells in a shallow, heat-proof dish containing a bed of sea salt to hold the molluscs steady. Spoon a little of the hot sauce over each oyster (the sauce can be prepared ahead and re-heated just before using) and slide the dish under the grill for 3-5 minutes until the oysters are firm, plump and hot and the sauce is glazed lightly. A loaf of bread, a flask of wine and thou are the only accompaniments needed. BONE MARROW ON TOAST Leg and shin of beef stews are back in fashion now. So, savouries made with the fatty, rich marrow that lies in the bones surely will be next. In The Cook's Encyclopaedia, Tom Stobart suggested an admirable short-cut to traditional methods. He recommends extracting the marrow from the bones before poaching, which cuts cooking time dramatically. Use a Victorian silver marrow scoop or wield a skewer carefully to take the marrow out of bones cut into short lengths. Poach it for just a minute or so in salted water or stock. Drain thoroughly and lay it on fluted rounds of hot toast. Season with plenty of lemon juice, salt, pepper and chopped parsley. Stobart used also to rub his toast with a cut garlic clove for extra flavour. Others finish the dish with a shake of cayenne or Tabasco. I like a pinch of very finely-grated lemon zest.</p>

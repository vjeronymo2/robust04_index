			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: IT'S A LOCK: HOOPS TAKE OVER SPRING  </P> <P> Reading between the datelines . . .  </P> <P> NEW YORK -- Four months after the Berlin Wall, baseball's locked gates come  down.  </P> <P> Just in the nick of time?  </P> <P> Or does anyone even care anymore?  </P> <P> Last time we checked, everybody was watching Bo Kimble and Ball State.  </P> <P> Great timing, this lockout. While the owners and the players haggled 32 days  over the arbitration rights of 14 players, the rest of the country got hooked  on hoops.  </P> <P> Let's see what's on the tube tonight: Donald Fehr with sweat stains under his  armpits or Loyola running up 149 points on Michigan. No baseball in Mesa? How  about that Arizona-Alabama game?  </P> <P> Baseball may be back, but it's going to have to play catch-up. There's a new  national pastime in town and this one doesn't spit tobacco juice.  </P> <P> FULLERTON -- Augie Garrido returns to Cal State Fullerton, bringing his  nationally ranked University of Illinois team with him for a Thursday game at  Titan Field.  </P> <P> After much mulling, Fullerton officials have decided not to mark the occasion  by retiring Garrido's jersey. But then, what did Augie ever do for Fullerton?  </P> <P> Two College World Series championships. Tim Wallach, Greg Mathews, Mike  Schooler, Mike Harkey and nine other Titans in the major leagues. A baseball  stadium and a baseball program, both built from the ground up, both built on a  shoestring.  </P> <P> But these are sensitive times for Fullerton baseball and, somehow, an honor for  Garrido is viewed as a slam at the current Titan program. How, I'm not quite  sure. If the majors conducted their business the same way, the Atlanta Braves  never would have retired Hank Aaron's number. And Bob Feller would still be  waiting in Cleveland.  </P> <P> Ed Carroll, the opportunity is yours. Do the right thing.  </P> <P> OAKLAND -- Mater Dei and Servite high schools win the State Division I and III  basketball championships.  </P> <P> So what happened to Bishop Montgomery?  </P> <P> During the regular season, the Knights tied Servite for second place in the  Angelus League, four games behind Mater Dei. That Angelus must be a heck of a  league -- one league, two state titles -- but, hey, Bishop Montgomery has to  get with the program.  </P> <P> INDIANAPOLIS -- Eric Dickerson, 29, says he's planning to quit pro football  because running behind the Indianapolis Colts' offensive line is "like taking a  revolver and putting a bullet in it and spinning it around and sticking it to  my head and sooner or later, a bullet is gonna come out and kill me."  </P> <P> Dickerson used to have the best line in football in Anaheim, but he wanted more  money. Now, he has the money but wants the line.  </P> <P> Clearly, more thought should have gone into "Let him run 47-Gap." If you have  your health, Dick, you have everything.  </P> <P> OAKLAND -- After the Brea-Olinda High School girls' team lost the State  Division III basketball championship, a Brea-Olinda parent says there will be  no postseason celebration because "we don't celebrate second place."  </P> <P> Apparently, and hopefully, this was said in the heat of the moment. No doubt,  the defeat had to be disappointing, but if a 55-game winning streak, a return  trip to the state title game and a final record of 33-1 isn't worth  celebrating, some priorities ought to be rethought.  </P> <P> With a little reflection, the Lady Cats should be proud of the reflection in  the mirror.  </P> <P> NEW YORK -- Because of an abbreviated spring training, baseball will play the  first two weeks of the regular season under different rules, allowing starting  pitchers to receive credit for a victory after completing three innings.  </P> <P> And Commissioner Fay Vincent wants a regular season with no asterisks attached?  </P> <P> We can see it now:  </P> <P>  Bret Saberhagen becomes the first pitcher since Denny McLain to win 30 games  in a single season.*  </P> <P>  (* Saberhagen pitched a total of nine innings for his first three victories.)  </P> <P>  KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- UC Santa Barbara shoots 33% from the field and commits 14  turnovers in a 62-58 loss to Michigan State in the second round of the NCAA  Southeast Regional.  </P> <P> Could Cal State Long Beach have done better?  </P> <P> Some thoughts:  </P> <P>  -- Long Beach beat Purdue, which placed second to Michigan State in the Big  Ten.  </P> <P>  -- Long Beach beat Texas, which beat Purdue in the second round of the Midwest  Regional.  </P> <P>  -- Long Beach has more sources of point production than Santa Barbara. When  Michigan State clamped down on center Eric McArthur, the Gaucho offense was  down to Carrick DeHart and nothing but. Long Beach's better balance, and better  athletes, might have been better equipped to handle the Spartans' aggressive,  oppressive defense.  </P> <P> And that might have landed two Big West teams in the round of 16.  </P> <P> Which would be two more than the Big Eight.  </P></p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (5): Recovery package - Mr Mohsen Nourbaksh, minister of economy and finance, talks to Roger Matthews Overall economic strategy: In 1989-90, at the beginning of our first five-year plan, we tried to deal with the lack of balance in the economy. The priorities in the package for economic recovery included adjusting prices, diminishing the role of government, encouraging the private sector and developing exports. The private sector existed before the revolution and has its own role defined in our constitution. It is important to differentiate between east European countries and Iran. There has been a tendency to see the package of measures here as the same as those put forward by the IMF and World Bank for countries in eastern Europe. Our country is very different. One of the main issues with which we are struggling is the unification of exchange rates. The big difference between the official and floating rates of exchange is one of the legacies we suffered from the war. We are trying to move very smoothly towards unification of rates. Most of the industrial sector, so far as the production side is concerned, is using the floating rate, as is the trade sector. Assuming that parliament approves the budget we will have taken a very major step towards unification. We are generally pleased with the result of these policies so far as investment is concerned. Over the past two years the average growth in GDP has been more than 11 per cent, almost 3 per cent above what was predicted. Most of the growth has come from agriculture, industry and oil. We think the momentum will continue in the current year and we will have a GDP growth rate of about 8 per cent. Some Dollars 24bn has been invested in different sectors over the past three years. We think that we will be able to continue on the same growth pattern in the future. Unification of exchange rates: Not all rates can be unified in the budget. There are some specific parts of the budget that will remain at the official rate. But in 1993 we will take the major step towards unifying exchange rates. On the inflationary impact of unifying exchange rates: We intend to use subsidies, especially for essential goods and medicines, so that the cost of living does not rise too much. Most other imports are already on the floating rate, so there should not be much impact on prices. Basic foods will continue to be imported at the official rate. About 20 per cent will remain at the official rate. In other words, about 80 per cent will have changed. The only items that will be subsidised are those few remaining at the official rate of exchange. Use of subsidies: There are no plans at this stage to make subsidies more selective. Right now we subsidise many items, for example refrigerators and televisions, by allowing them to be imported at the official rate of exchange. By going over to the floating rate we remove this type of subsidy. Impact of current account deficit: Unifying exchange rates will help to reduce the deficit. Our prediction is that next year we will definitely have a positive balance of payments. Total expenditure in foreign exchange will be less than our predicted income, assuming that the price of oil is maintained. Imports for last year were running at Dollars 26bn-Dollars 27bn, but this financial year they are much lower, particularly because we have introduced the floating rate for the industrial sector. Since the beginning of this current year (March 21), when we introduced the floating exchange rate, consumption of foreign currency has fallen tremendously. Our estimate for the current year is that we will have a positive balance of payments. Delays on payments of letters of credit: Last year our imports were about Dollars 26-Dollars 27bn. That was because we introduced a floating exchange rate and allowed the commercial banks to operate it without any restriction. The same pattern continued this year. Because of that, and because previously we used to have a system of rationing foreign exchange, there has been some mismanagement. We did not intervene in the market because we thought that the pressure would diminish. That is what is happening now. This year, the number of letters of credit that has been opened and the level of imports is likely to be 50 per cent lower than the previous year. There was some interruption in payment of letters of credit but we consider that as having a short-run effect. We are negotiating with the banks and we think we will manage the whole thing satisfactorily. The size of the backlog is about Dollars 1bn. Very soon we are going to resolve the whole thing. I do not wish to give a specific time. Position on sovereign guarantees Commercial banks have their own business and have to issue their own guarantees. Those banks have to be acceptable to the international commercial banks. But if the government is going to receive a credit or facilities, such as those we are negotiating with the World Bank or with the Japanese for a yen loan, then this is government-to-government and we will definitely give a guarantee. But we do not see any reason for the government to give a guarantee for, say, a small textile manufacturing project. Even if western credit agencies say that we have to provide a guarantee, we are definitely not going to do so. If they do not wish to do business with us, well we shall have to wait and see. Recently we got a credit from a German bank using the same standard as we had before. We consider that as an indication that if we insist on this policy and stick to our principles then international companies will adjust. It is a matter of markets. We see enough competition between different companies in different countries, so why should we adjust? It is they who are competing. It is their duty to adjust their policy to what we need. Privatisation: It does not mean creating a private sector because that has always existed. What it means is that companies which for some reason are in the hands of government should transfer to the private sector. The main purpose is to increase the efficiency of those companies. We have listed more than 300 which are supposed to transfer to the private sector. Some have been privatised but most are still in government hands. We are trying to speed up the process. I do not consider privatisation as a source of revenue but as a way of increasing efficiency. Ministers responsible for running those companies are allowed to use the proceeds from sales either for completing projects or to renovate the technology in those companies they administer. Prospects for foreign investment: It is accepted without any limitation. It depends only on the nature and the type. We offer the same protection to foreign investors as is available in other countries. I do not have the data with me to say whether we have received one penny of foreign investment or not, but we have received several applications.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Excalibur raises Pounds 5.5m to fund expansion in music Excalibur Group, the precision engineering and giftware company, yesterday announced the acquisition of Lifetime Europe, a music and video distributor, to be funded through a 1-for-4 rights issue. Excalibur will make an initial consideration of Pounds 500,000 for Lifetime, plus a further sum of up to Pounds 3m. The rights issue, fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, is expected to raise Pounds 5.5m net, pricing the shares at 40p, which closed down 2 1/2 p yesterday at 46p. Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman, said the acquisition would complement Excalibur's presence in the budget music market. Lifetime showed turnover of Pounds 2.9m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 540,000 in the year to December. Excalibur also plans capital expenditure of Pounds 8m over the next two years. Mr Griffiths said it was necessary to invest in the company's two core divisions, precision engineering and consumer products, following a restructuring programme and the disposal of loss-making operations. In April Excalibur sold Premier Chain, its jewellery chain business, to its management. The precision engineering division, which contributed 50 per cent of turnover, has an order book of Pounds 17m and has won a four-year contract with LDV (formerly Leyland Daf Vans) for power and manual steering systems. The division will receive an injection of Pounds 5.9m over the next two years - Pounds 3.9m to increase capacity and Pounds 2m on plant replacement. A further Pounds 2m will be spent on the consumer products division. Gearing, which stood at more than 100 per cent in the last balance sheet, was 95 per cent at the April 30 year-end. Indebtedness related to gold bullion has been reduced by Pounds 4m to Pounds 266,000 during the year. Excalibur reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.6m, compared with Pounds 6.2m, for the year to the end of April on turnover down from Pounds 61.6m to Pounds 54.4m. The losses reflected goodwill of Pounds 3.3m written off following the disposal of Premier Chain. Profits before exceptionals were Pounds 2m against losses of Pounds 400,000. Losses per share fell from 10.5p to 2.8p with adjusted earnings per share of 3.2p, compared with losses of 1.8p. A final dividend of 0.4p (0.3p) has been recommended making an increased total of 0.65p, against 0.5p last time.</p>

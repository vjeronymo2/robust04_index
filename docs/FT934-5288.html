			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton bid lifts TV stocks Television took centre stage in the market as Carlton Communications launched a well-received takeover bid for Central Television. The offer came just five days after the government relaxed rules on mergers within the industry and is seen as the first course in a feast of bids within the sector. The bid values Central at Pounds 758m, or Pounds 26 a share, and was to the surprise of many analysts endorsed by Central's board of directors. It will create the country's biggest independent television company with an area covering 20m viewers. Predictably, Central's shares rose sharply, closing some 405 higher at 2573p. Less predictably, Carlton's share price also jumped significantly, finishing 30 stronger at 797p. The stock was helped by an increase in profits to Pounds 126.1m from Pounds 100.24m and a discussion aimed at defusing worries over inroads into Carlton's video sales and rental arm. However, the results were in line with expectations and the shares only started to lift when the Central offer was announced. Ms Chris Munro, media analyst with Hoare Govett, estimated that Carlton's 1993-94 profits would be boosted by Pounds 31m to Pounds 186m following acquisition of Central and earnings would only be diluted by 0.5p per share to 50p. Investors are now looking for the next bid in the sector, and many bets were riding on Granada making a move on LWT Holdings, possibly as early as today. Granada climbed 13 to 463p in spite of worries that it will have to launch a bumper rights issue to fund any bid. LWT shares jumped 45 to 579p.</p>

Vural noted that within this framework,  Ciller touched upon the development of regional economic  cooperation and the introduction of new institutions in the  region. Vural added:    [Begin recording] The prime minister underlined that new  institutions are needed in the Middle East. She suggested that  these institutions could encompass the development of economic  cooperation among regional countries, the creation of joint  projects, and the introduction of new structures that would meet  the regional security needs of all the countries in this area.

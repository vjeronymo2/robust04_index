			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Russia discovers the rape victim: Lori Cidylo looks at a growing, and surprisingly frank, public debate on what has long been a hidden crime When Kira, a 17-year-old university student, was raped by a neighbour in a rural village on the outskirts of Moscow, she agonised for months over whether she should tell her parents. Terrified and ashamed, the young woman, who had become pregnant as a result of the attack, decided to keep the knowledge to herself. But rumours of the incident spread through the small village. One night, a young man beat her mercilessly, calling her a 'tramp'. When Kira staggered through the door that evening, her father informed her that he 'could not live in the same house with a whore', and cast her out. Her mother added: 'You have shamed us.' A graphic account of Kira's rape, which appeared in the popular daily Komsomolskaya Pravda - the first article on rape the newspaper has published  -created shock waves in a country still reluctant to address crimes of violence against women. 'The most important thing I want to say is that what happened is not your fault,' Natasha Gaidarenko, a psychologist who has become a pioneer in rape crisis counselling, wrote in the same issue. 'Even if a woman flirts with a man . . . even if she lets him kiss her, it does not mean she has consented to what followed . . . In every case, responsibility always lies with the rapist . . . you are in no way responsible for the horrible things that happened to you.' That is a revolutionary notion in Russia, where many people still subscribe to the myth that rape is a crime of passion and that women 'provoke' rapists by dressing or behaving seductively. Under glasnost many explosive issues burst on to the printed page. But rape remained outside the selective sieve used by the communists to filter out unpleasant realities. Many Russians still believe that rape occurs rarely, if at all, in their country, although experts say the crime is endemic. 'Russia is an incredibly rape-prone society because of the high level of alcoholism and the low status of women,' says Martina Vandenberg, who has counselled rape victims in Britain and the US. Aleksei Ignatov, a lawyer who specialises in sexual assault, says the number of rapes reported each year - 13,600 in 1992 - represents about one-tenth the total actually committed. But there are signs that ideas about rape are beginning to change. Once regarded as a bourgeois crime that afflicted only the decadent west, rape has suddenly become the focus of an unusually frank debate. After Kira's story was published, Gaidarenko said she received more than 900 letters from women around the country who said that they, too, had been raped. Most had suffered alone, in silence, sometimes for decades. The few who dared to tell someone, usually a mother or a close friend, were often ostracised. Many wrote that they felt deeply ashamed and suffered from depression, insomnia and feelings of helplessness. Some said they had attempted suicide. 'When a woman is raped, she is afraid to go to the police and she is afraid of being judged by her family. Everyone turns away from her. She has nowhere to go,' says Galina Chentsova, a psychiatrist in St Petersburg. But Gaidarenko, who heads the Moscow Sexual Assault Recovery Centre, Russia's first rape crisis centre, is hoping to change all that. At the centre, which opened in April, women receive counselling and medical care from psychologists and doctors who are sensitive to the special needs of rape victims. Most of the women feel isolated because they are unaware of how prevalent rape is, Gaidarenko says. 'When we first bring a group of women together, each one thinks that this is her own unique experience. When they discover that they have all been through the same thing, they are in a state of shock. They wonder, 'Can it be true that this pain is not mine alone?' Then they start to talk about it and the healing process begins.' Rape counsellors say it is crucial that those dealing with the victim, such as police and doctors, understand her feelings of powerlessness and tendency to blame herself and not compound those feelings. But women who report that they were raped are often regarded by police with hostility, scepticism, salaciousness, and even mockery. One woman, whose boss forced her to perform fellatio, says that when she reported the incident, the police laughed at her and told her that she had not been raped. Doctors, too, are often insensitive and may adopt an accusatory tone. One 15-year-old victim recalls being asked: 'Did he take your pants off or did you take them off yourself?' Lola Karim, a gynaecologist who works at the centre, said: 'We tried to open the centre in a hospital, but all of the doctors we spoke to refused. They said, 'But women bring it on themselves.' They felt that this was not an important issue and that we were just a bunch of hysterical women.' Karim says that hospital personnel often turn victims away. 'They tell her to go to the police and file a report first, even if she is injured and needs care.' The few hospitals which can do an evidentiary exam, a necessity if the victim decides to prosecute, require a pass which only the police can issue. But police often refuse to issue the pass because they do not believe the victim or because they have been bribed by the rapist. Although Gaidarenko estimates that 70 per cent of women who are raped are raped by men they know, in Russia, acquaintance rape is largely ignored or denied. Women who are raped by men they trust, and often like, such as co-workers, friends or dates, often wonder whether they have 'really' been raped. Larissa Korneva, a psychologist at the Centre for Gender Studies in St Petersburg, says she questioned the validity of her perceptions even as she was struggling with a fellow student who tried to rape her on a beach. The two had spent the day picnicking and swimming with friends and, she recalls, she had felt attracted to him. Some American researchers believe that acquaintance rape is facilitated by a socialisation process which encourages sexually aggressive behaviour in men. In a three-year study by psychologist Mary Koss, 53 per cent of US college men admitted to kissing a woman against her will, 60 per cent admitted to touching a woman's breast against her wishes, 37 per cent said they had touched a woman's genitals without consent and 15 per cent admitted to attempting or committing at least one rape. The most striking finding was that 84 per cent of the men who had committed rape said that what they had done was definitely not rape. Although no comparable study has been done in Russia, many Russian experts agree that socialisation plays a primary role in cases of acquaintance rape. 'The cultural message given to Russian boys is 'take, don't ask',' while women are trained to submit, Korneva says. Olga Zayarnaya, a psychologist in Ekaterinburg who has counselled rapists as well as victims, says men often deceive themselves into thinking that acceptance of some type of sexual foreplay, such as kissing, means a woman is willing to have sex. Such men, she says, 'honestly do not believe that they have raped anyone'. Sasha, a 29-year-old translator, is a typical example of such a man. Although Sasha admits that he sometimes uses 'forceful persuasion' with women who are reluctant to have intercourse, he does not consider himself a rapist. While acquaintance rape is a serious and under-reported problem, some researchers believe that marital rape may be the most prevalent type of sexual assault because of prevailing social attitudes. When Marina Baskaova, a sociologist at the Moscow Centre for Gender Studies, attempted to study the issue, she discovered that her respondents 'didn't understand the question. It never occurred to them that a husband could rape his own wife.' Zayarnaya, who divorced her husband after he tried to rape her, recalls the reaction of her friends. 'They said, 'so what? That's normal. He is your husband. He doesn't do it every day. So he lost control once. What's the big deal?'' Rape counsellors agree that perceptions about rape are unlikely to change until attitudes towards the role of women change. 'Women must be equal partners, not servants who clean the house and fulfil their husband's sexual needs,' says Karim. 'Men - and women - must understand that every woman has the right to decide, 'do I want to be intimate or not?' and that no one has the right to invade her body and violate her soul.'</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Labour to stress 'green' economics Labour yesterday pledged to put greater emphasis on the environment in government, particularly where it can create new jobs and produce a more sustainable economy. The party sets out an approach to environmental issues in a new policy document which relies heavily on government action, particularly in transport and energy. Mr Chris Smith, environment spokesman, said: 'We have tried to integrate the environment into a whole range of policy areas. We view the environment not just as a challenge, but also an opportunity.' In a policy paper, In Trust for Tomorrow, Labour proposes to create jobs by encouraging energy efficiency conversions in homes; training young people to help clean up the environment; and promoting environmental industries which supply clean technologies and 'green' products. It would also offer protection to 'whistle-blowers' who reveal breaches of environmental law by their employers. The party acknowledges for the first time that increased protection for the environment could lead to a lower rate of growth in gross domestic product. The document says: 'A sustainable economic policy will aim to optimise environmentally beneficial activity, recognising that there are limits to the pollution that can be safely emitted, and that the consumption of non-renewable resources needs to be matched by the development of renewable technologies.' Labour would aim to change the national accounting system by 2000. A reformed measure of national income would initially be published alongside GDP figures. Transport policy would be reversed, with a shift of investment from road building to public transport. A moratorium on new road schemes would be declared pending a review, and it would aim to double the amount of long-haul freight carried by rail. The party would stress improving the energy efficiency of homes with incentives which could create up to 50,000 jobs in the building sector. Labour would also support the coal industry by promoting clean-coal technology and halting nuclear-power construction, and set a target of 10 per cent electricity generation from renewable sources by 2010. For the private individual, a Labour government would establish a set of environmental rights, such as clean air and drinking water, and access to open land. People would also have the right to compensation for environmental damage. The document received a broad welcome from the environmental lobby. The Council for the Protection of Rural England said Labour had 'woken up to the importance of having an effective environment policy'. Friends of the Earth welcomed Labour's recognition that the environment could create jobs. However, the Road Haulage Association attacked the document, saying it played down the environmental improvements made in transport and exaggerated the problems. Berrymans, a firm of solicitors specialising in pollution cases, said the policy had failed to deal adequately with environmental liability.</p>

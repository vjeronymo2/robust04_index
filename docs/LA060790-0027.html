			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COALITION ATTEMPTS TO RESTRUCTURE COUNCIL;  </P> <P> REPRESENTATION: THE CITIZENS GROUP SAID IT HAS GATHERED ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR A  BALLOT MEASURE TO BREAK UP GLENDALE INTO FIVE CITY COUNCIL DISTRICTS.  </P> <P> A petition drive that could shatter Glendale's political structure appears to  have gathered enough signatures to go before voters in November or April.  </P> <P> Nearing the end of a six-month effort, a small group of civic dissidents called  the Coalition for Electoral Reform this week claimed to have gathered at least  11,000 names on an initiative calling for a change to district City Council  representation in Glendale.  </P> <P> If approved by voters, it would divide the city into five council districts,  each with a single elected representative. The measure would probably cause at  least two current council members to lose their seats. It would also spark a  scramble for political power in sections of Glendale that now appear to have  little clout in the city's decision making.  </P> <P> Coalition members have accused the current council of catering to politically  active north Glendale neighborhoods and downtown business leaders while  neglecting less affluent south Glendale areas and remote communities such as La  Crescenta and Montrose.  </P> <P> The group has little funding and no support from Glendale's mainstream  political leaders, but its members believe they have tapped into widespread  discontent with the city's present leadership.  </P> <P> In the closing days of the campaign, coalition leaders continued to collect  signatures. Arthur Segien, a Glendale apartment owner and City Hall gadfly who  chairs the coalition, sat behind a card table outside a supermarket Monday,  vying for the attention of shoppers.  </P> <P> "Want to sign a petition for better government in Glendale?" he asked.  </P> <P> When Laurell Gaines stopped at the table, Segien showed her a map of the city.  Three City Council members live in the affluent Chevy Chase Canyon community,  he told her, and the other two also live in the northern Glendale.  </P> <P> Segien, 78, said his petition would require that council members come from all  parts of Glendale, ensuring broader representation.  </P> <P> "I don't like this city government," Gaines said after signing the petition.  "You don't have a representative in your area. You write a letter to the  council members and to the mayor, and they ignore it."  </P> <P> Segien smiled. "We get that all the time," he said. "They're not responsive to  the people at all. That's a big complaint."  </P> <P> The coalition leader said his group will submit its petitions to the Glendale  city clerk's office on Monday, two days before its 180-day gathering period  expires. With a week to go, he said the group had roughly 11,000 signatures.  </P> <P> Glendale had about 69,500 registered voters at the time the petition drive was  launched. The coalition needs valid signatures from 15% of them -- about 10,400  names -- to put the initiative on the November general election ballot. With  10%, the measure would appear on next April's municipal election ballot.  </P> <P> When the petitions are checked by the Los Angeles County Registrar, a number of  signatures will probably be disqualified because of duplication or because the  signer was not registered to vote in Glendale. As a result, it may be several  weeks before residents learn whether the measure has qualified for the ballot  and for which election.  </P> <P> If voters approve it, the council must divide the city into five districts,  each with roughly the same population. The measure forbids odd-shaped district  boundaries, which might allow all or most of the current members to continue in  office.  </P> <P> If the initiative is approved in November, the election for district council  members would occur in April. If the measure does not appear on the ballot  until April and is then approved, the first district council members would be  chosen in a later election.  </P> <P> The initiative also would require that a district council member receive a  majority of the votes, even if a runoff election is needed. Currently,  Glendale's at-large council seats go to the top vote-getters, even if the  candidates receive less than 50%.  </P> <P> If the measure qualifies for the ballot, it will undoubtedly trigger a powerful  opposition campaign by well-organized and well-financed Glendale leaders who  want to preserve the present system. A similar ballot measure was voted down in  1975.  </P> <P> The current council members have pulled no punches in attacking the district  elections plan.  </P> <P> "I think it's probably one of the worst possible things that could happen in  this city," said Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg.  </P> <P> Bremberg is one of the three council members who live in Chevy Chase Canyon,  and district elections could allow only one to remain on the council.  Nevertheless, Bremberg insisted that the current elected officials are opposed  to district elections "not from a position of saving our jobs, but saving the  city."  </P> <P> Glendale residents now vote for five council members. Under the district plan,  residents could vote only for the council member serving their area, and the  candidate must live in that district. The system is used in cities such as Los  Angeles and Pasadena.  </P> <P> Glendale's present council members say district elections would reduce a  resident's ability to influence City Hall.  </P> <P> "Instead of having five representatives to deal with, the residents will have  only one," Mayor Larry Zarian said. "I'm very concerned about pork-barrel  politics, Chicago-style."  </P> <P> He and Bremberg predicted that a district system would prompt more "back-room  deals" in which council members would trade support for projects in one  another's districts.  </P> <P> Bremberg, who is usually at City Hall every day, and Zarian, who conducts  regular public forums, said no south Glendale residents have complained to them  that their area is under-served. Bremberg and Zarian also said the council has  funded more improvements in south Glendale in recent years than in any other  part of the city.  </P> <P> "I have not heard any good arguments that Glendale needs districts," the mayor  said. Bremberg pointed out that the petition drive was launched by Richard  Seeley and Robin Westmiller, two candidates who lost in Glendale's April, 1989,  council election.  </P> <P> "I suspect that the defeated candidates want to see if they can get on the  council by reducing the number of votes they'd need," Bremberg said.  </P> <P> Westmiller, Seeley and Segien all deny that they are planning to seek a  district council seat. In fact, Westmiller said she is selling her Glendale  home and will move out of the city.  </P> <P> Seeley said fewer than 10 activists are doing the lion's share of the signature  collection. He and Segien have paid some people 50 to 75 cents per name to seek  signatures, but the coalition leaders said those names make up a small portion  of the total.  </P> <P> Westmiller said she hopes the measure qualifies for the November ballot, when  Californians will flock to the polls to choose a new governor.  </P> <P> "My preference right now is getting the darned thing passed," she said. In  November "it might get buried under everything, although we'd have the  advantage of a larger turnout."  </P> <P> Other activists said the city's own April ballot would focus more attention on  the measure and give the coalition more time to campaign.  </P> <P> "We'd have to seek contributions," Seeley said. "Obviously, you can't run a  campaign without money. The other thing is communication. That's the biggest  problem we have. Communicating with the public is very difficult."  </P> <P> He said the coalition will also have to combat widespread voter apathy and low  registration trends in some parts of Glendale. Without strong support from  those who feel neglected by City Hall, the voters who support the present  council will defeat the district plan, he said.  </P> <P> But Westmiller believes opposition to Glendale's present leadership is strong  enough to ensure approval of the council districts initiative.  </P> <P> "We don't have to do anything," she said. "The current City Council is doing  everything it can to make sure it does pass."  </P></p>

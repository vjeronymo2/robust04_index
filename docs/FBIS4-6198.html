			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-sik from Beijing] </F>   [Text] A Beijing-based source said that North Korea had  sent a special task force to Beijing during President Kim  Yong-sam's visit to China. The task force was made up of  responsible North Korean high-level working officials from  various sectors -- such as politics, international affairs, and  economics -- and arrived in Beijing two days before President  Kim Yong-sam's visit and collected information regarding the  contents of the ROK-PRC talks, including the summit talks  between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin, and the future  development of their talks.    The source stated that through the task force, in  particular,  North Korea prudently focused on China's position regarding the  nuclear issue and observed how the ROK-PRC talks could affect  the United States or the United Nations.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Tesco offer for Wm Low may spark rival bid Tesco, the UK's second largest supermarket chain, yesterday made a recommended offer for William Low, the struggling Scottish retail food group, in a deal worth Pounds 200m. But J. Sainsbury, Tesco's bigger rival, signalled later yesterday that it was considering its options, raising the prospect of a takeover battle for the Scottish chain. Both Tesco and Sainsbury are keen to expand in Scotland. Tesco is offering Pounds 154m in cash for the share capital of William Low and would assume debt of just over Pounds 50m. The deal was unanimously recommended by the William Low board. Sainsbury entered the picture when it told Reuters: 'William Low is something we have looked at before. It is an obvious candidate for takeover and has been for some time. As a result of this morning's takeover news we are reviewing the situation.' Sainsbury later told the Stock Exchange that it was requesting information from William Low and was considering its position. Analysts said it would be out of character for Sainsbury to become involved in a hostile takeover battle, particularly since the Tesco bid has the backing of the William Low board. Sainsbury has only four outlets north of the border - three supermarkets and one hypermarket. Tesco said its 16 Scottish stores would be a good strategic fit with William Low's 45 outlets in Scotland and 12 in the north of England. Strong competition from discount retailers and larger food chains has cut William Low's profit margins, and its sales are currently 5 per cent below last year's levels. Tesco said there would be few, if any, immediate closures of William Low stores. But it would be necessary to integrate the management and support services provided by just over 300 people working at the company's Dundee head office into Tesco's administration. 'Accordingly, there may be a significant number of job lossesif the head office were to close,' Tesco said. Tesco added it would offer relocation opportunities and give generous redundancy terms if the takeover went ahead. Sir Ian MacLaurin, the Scot who is chairman of Tesco, said the deal would be good for shareholders of both groups. The William Low outlets would be renamed Tesco, but he said an effort would be made to develop a distinctive Scottish identity - perhaps using a Tesco Scotland brand. The group would spend Pounds 35m on rebranding the existing William Low stores and introducing its own-label products. Tesco said its prices were on average 5 per cent lower than William Low's, thanks partly to the economies of scale achievable by the bigger group. Tesco is offering 225p in cash for each William Low ordinary share and 105.5p for each convertible preference share. There is a full share alternative, worth 236p per ordinary share at last night's close. William Low's shares rose by 67p to 236p, while Tesco's shares closed 10 1/2 p higher at 232 1/2 p. Tesco is advised by BZW and William Low by Barings. Lex, Page 16; Background, Page 17; London stocks, Page 36</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Storm Over Fascists Caused by </F> Translation Error"]    [Text] Strasbourg 6 May (ANSA) -- A translation mistake in  a text approved Thursday [5 May] by the European Parliament  [EP], which in the Italian version raised alarm about the  presence of Fascists in a new Rome government, appeared to be  the cause of heated protests by the Italian Right against what  it labeled interference in Italy's domestic affairs.    European Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch on Friday announced  that part of a sentence, referring to "the horrors of Nazism and  of Fascism," mistakenly was not removed from the Italian  language version of a motion approved by the assembly urging  Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to make it clear that the  new government under Silvio Berlusconi must "remain faithful to  the fundamental values underlying the creation of the European  Community."    The motion was evidently directed at the prospect that the  neofascist National Alliance would be given cabinet posts in the  new government and caused indignant and offended reactions from  members of the party.    The Socialist Party whip in the European Parliament, Jean  Pierre Cot of France, today stated that removal of the contested  phrase from the motion, a phrase which did not appear in the  other language versions, does not change the substance of the  message. "The Parliament has expressed its concern over the  Italian political situation," Cot stressed, adding that "the  form of the translation does not change the substance."    (National Alliance officials in Rome today continued to  issue  statements lambasting the European Parliament, claiming they are  not fascists and calling "unsatisfactory" the explanations given  by Klepsch. Party leader Gianfranco Fini also asserted he had  "several Jewish friends," was not anti-Semitic, and "loved  democracy and freedom.")</p>

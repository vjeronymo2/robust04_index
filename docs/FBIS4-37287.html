			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo and Kamal Hamid and </F> 'Umar Muhammad al-Hasan in Khartoum: "Egyptian-Sudanese  Contacts To End the Escalation"]    [Excerpts] AL-HAYAH has learned that unannounced  Egyptian-Sudanese contacts are currently under way as an air of  optimism prevails among diplomats concerned with the dossier of  relations between the two countries that a relaxation in these  relations is imminent in the form of mutual steps to end the  escalation and ease the tension between the two countries, at a  time when the Sudanese authorities seem to be considering  reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in Cairo.    According to informed sources in Cairo, extensive contacts  are currently in progress between Cairo and Khartoum on points  of disagreement, with an interest in keeping news of these  contacts out of the media. [passage omitted]    A Sudanese diplomat in Cairo has told AL-HAYAH that the  question of the presence of Egyptian forces in Hala'ib or in  'Arakiyin south of the 22nd parallel has not gone beyond  informing the authorities concerned that there has been some  transgression. He reaffirmed that his government cares about  its relations with Egypt. [passage omitted]    The Sudanese diplomat said that his government's position  "is  that all issues without exception can be settled through  numerous bilateral channels."    Meanwhile, AL-HAYAH has learned that the Sudanese  authorities  are considering reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in  Cairo in view of the tense relations between the two countries.    A high-ranking Sudanese official questioned by AL-HAYAH  about  these reports said that the government "is indeed leaning  towards reducing the size of its diplomatic missions in the  states where the size of representation is greater than the  level of their relations with Sudan." He said that the  "emphasis will be on the states with which we have vast links."  He added that the government was about to introduce major  changes in the Foreign Ministry's structures and organs in  implementation of that policy. But he refused to discuss  diplomatic missions in any particular state.    In another development, informed sources say that police  forces in the Sudanese capital launched a major campaign the day  before yesterday to assemble the homeless in Khartoum and then  send them to military training camps before sending to the south  to participate in the fighting there. The sources added that 10  million Sudanese pounds have been allocated for that task.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Konstantinova, Ye. F. Pen, A. M. Sinyukov, </F> V. V. Shelkovnikov; UDC 535.417:773.93]    [Abstract] Results are described in this article of studies  dealing with the optical amplification in amorphous photopolymer  materials GFPM-633 which exhibit a high sensitivity in the red  spectral region. The material is designed for recording phase  holograms by the He-Ne laser radiation (_l_=632.8 nm). The  experiments on optical amplification were made with a  holographic apparatus using a series produced LG-52-1 laser. The  dynamics of diffraction efficiency at _l_=760 nm for recording  with optical amplification on photopolymer material GFPM-633-2  is shown in a graph. For this type of material, the gain was in  the 2-60 range. Holographic characteristics were also obtained  for this material. The relationships of the initial, final and  corrected diffraction efficiency as a function of the initial  time of exposure for the 632.8 nm wavelength are also provided.  The gain corresponding to the diffraction efficiency curves is  also shown in the graphs. The mechanism of optical amplification  in the photopolymer material is discussed.

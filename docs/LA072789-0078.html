			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE IN COURT FOCUSES ON CONSENT ISSUE  </P> <P> In a new round in the intensifying debate over abortion, a state Court of  Appeal was asked Wednesday to uphold the constitutionality of a 1987 law  requiring unmarried minors to get the consent of a parent or a judge before  obtaining an abortion.  </P> <P> A state attorney defending the statute urged the panel to set aside a lower  court injunction that blocked implementation of the law before it could take  effect last year.  </P> <P> Minors do not have the same right to sexual privacy as adults and the law  serves a "significant state interest," said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Elisabeth  C. Brandt. An immature minor, she said, too often rejects childbirth without  adequate consultation and "goes through the process with anyone who will take  her money and give her an abortion."  </P> <P> "There is a long-term benefit in involving the parent," said Brandt. "There is  evidence that young minors tend to panic and give in to peer pressure. They  think, 'My parents will kill me; my boyfriend will kill me; I'll lose my  figure. I have to get an abortion.' "  </P> <P> But a San Francisco lawyer representing medical and civil rights groups  challenging the law urged the panel to leave the injunction intact and allow  existing statutes -- which require only that a doctor obtain the minor's  "informed consent" -- to continue to govern the issue.  </P> <P> "Minors do not have less privacy rights than adults," said Attorney Linda E.  Shostak , and the new law thus violates the privacy guarantees of the state  Constitution.  </P> <P> "The Legislature took a system that works pretty well . . . and changed it to  criminalize abortion for teen-agers, unless they get consent of a parent or  judge," said Shostak.  </P> <P> The panel heard argument for an hour on the politically charged issue, pressing  the attorneys with dozens of questions and, on occasion, appearing skeptical  about the validity of the 1987 law.  </P> <P> Appellate Justice William A Newsom said he saw "serious problems" in the law's  requirement that judges determine whether a minor is "mature" enough for an  abortion. In that respect, the statute may be impermissibly vague and force  judges to act without advice from psychologists or other experts, the justice  said.  </P> <P> Similarly, Presiding Justice John T. Racanelli expressed concern that the law  might be discriminatory by requiring minors seeking abortions to go through  legal procedures not required of minors choosing to give birth. "Aren't they  being treated unequally?" Racanelli asked.  </P> <P> The hearing was held in one of two cases now before the appeal court that could  change the state's legal course on abortion. The second case under review is a  challenge by civil rights groups to the validity of the most recent legislative  budget restrictions on state-funded abortions in the Medi-Cal program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Court Decision  </P> <P> The heated debate over the issue has taken on new intensity after a ruling by  the U.S. Supreme Court on July 3 giving states more power to limit abortion  under the federal Constitution. While the decision did not change California  law, it refueled hopes among anti-abortion groups that past state rulings will  be modified or overturned.  </P> <P> The law at issue Wednesday requires unmarried minors to obtain the consent  either of a parent, guardian or a judge, unless there is a medical emergency.  The statute mandates confidential and expedited proceedings -- free of charge  and appealable to higher courts -- and requires that judges must approve  abortions if they conclude that the minor is sufficiently mature and informed  to consent to the operation or that an abortion is in her "best interest."  </P> <P> The decision in the case will have wide impact. Of about 300,000 abortions  performed annually in California, an estimated 35,000 involve unmarried minors.  A ruling is due by October.  </P> <P> The statute was first challenged in November, 1987, two months before the law  was to go into effect, when the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups  represented by the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in San Francisco,  charging that it violated the state constitutional right to privacy.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin issued  an injunction preventing the law from going into effect while its legality was  tested in the courts.  </P></p>

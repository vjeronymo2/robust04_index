			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Re-routed via the Stock Exchange - James Buxton on the proposed flotation of Stagecoach Holdings WHEN THE river Tay burst its banks last week and flooded the offices in Perth of Stagecoach Holdings, Mr Brian Souter, chairman and chief executive, waded in, rolled up his sleeves and shifted documents and equipment up the narrow staircase to the first floor. Though Mr Souter now runs a company which employs 11,000 people and turned over Pounds 140m last year, he is a hands-on manager who on occasions still takes the wheel of one of the 3,300 buses which the company operates in Britain and overseas. Stagecoach is seeking a Stock Exchange quotation in April which could value the company at some Pounds 100m, a development which Mr Souter sees as a natural progression for a business which he and his sister began with a handful of buses in 1980. The story of Stagecoach is a lesson in the application of private enterprise to the often hidebound world of public transport. It has lessons for the privatisation of British Rail - indeed last year it became the first private company to operate a regular passenger train service by attaching carriages to BR trains. Stagecoach began when Mr Souter, a chartered accountant with Arthur Andersen, and his sister, Mrs Ann Gloag, then a nurse, began a long-distance coach operation between Dundee and London, undercutting the established Scottish Bus group operation. Their father was bus driver in Perth. The company's big expansion came when the National Bus Company was broken up and privatised after 1985. Stagecoach bought bus companies in Hampshire, Cumbria and the east Midlands. It then made further acquisitions among companies which had staged management buy-outs from National Bus Company whose managements, Mr Souter says, 'had exhausted themselves in the MBO process,' and also acquired three Scottish bus companies, two of them from the privatisation of the Scottish Bus Group. In each purchase the Stagecoach team acted as a catalyst, Mr Souter says, 'releasing energy which was buried there among the middle management.' The company cut out tiers of management, re-examined routes, introduced a variety of sizes of buses, as well as investing heavily in new fleets and agreeing productivity deals with the labour force. For a time the company benefited from sales of property acquired in privatisation. In one case it acquired the bus station in Keswick at a book value of Pounds 55,000 and sold it for Pounds 705,000. In another it sold the bus station in Whitehaven for Pounds 1.1m, having paid Pounds 165,000. Twice Stagecoach has had to comply with recommendations of the Office of Fair Trading to divest itself of acquisitions considered to be posing a threat to competition. Profit margins have been pushed up from the 5 per cent of turnover which Stagecoach says was being achieved under National Bus Company to between 10 and 15 per cent. Stagecoach now has a geographical spread from the south of England to the north of Scotland, giving some insulation from economic downturns in any single area. Its buses are painted in a single livery and can be transferred from one area to another to meet fluctuations in demand. The company has also applied its formula to bus companies in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, where the authorities have chosen the privatisation route. Stagecoach even operates buses in China, paid for with the proceeds of advertisements on their sides. In 1992 Stagecoach's pre-tax profits reached Pounds 8.2m, compared with Pounds 2.5m in 1991, on turnover which rose from Pounds 103.3m to Pounds 140.7m. The flotation, Mr Souter says, will give the company the resources it needs for further expansion. About 35 municipal bus companies in England are due for privatisation in the next year or two and the government is to privatise the London Buses. The franchising of British Rail services is an obvious opportunity to be looked at, though the overnight service between Scotland and London which Stagecoach launched last year failed to attract enough passengers and has been scaled down. Though Noble Grossart, Stagecoach's Edinburgh merchant banker, is sponsoring the share issue and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has been appointed stockbroker, no details are being disclosed, though it is likely to be worth about Pounds 100m. Of Stagecoach's 21m issued ordinary shares, Mr Souter, 38, owns 9.1m and his sister Mrs Gloag, the 50-year-old managing director, owns 8.7m. Eight Scottish institutions hold convertible cumulative preference shares worth Pounds 5m under a formula which was to give them between 16 and 25 per cent of the ordinary shares. Mr Souter evidently co-operates happily with his sister. While he provides the ideas, she runs the administration and negotiates some hard bargains with bus manufacturers and bulk fuel suppliers. On Sundays they go to the evangelical church of the Nazarene, where Mr Souter is an occasional preacher.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 12--The visiting French Senate  delegation says it is "convinced that dialogue (between India  and Pakistan on Kashmir) is necessary and the exclusive (only)  way to approach a solution."    This was stated by the delegation's leader, Mr. Xavier de  Villepin, at a press conference here soon after the team had a  meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, here on  Friday.    The influential French Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs,  Defence and the Armed Forces is to report its observations on  the Indian position with respect to Kashmir, human rights and  terrorism, besides non-proliferation and security-related  issues, to the French Government.    Mr. de Villepin said he delivered a letter to Mr. Rao from  the French Prime Minister, Mr. Edouard Balladur, in which the  French leader had suggested "across-the-border" intensified  cooperation with India in the political, economic and cultural  fields.    In response to questions, Mr. de Villepin said "We also have  respect for India's policy on Kashmir. We have no reason to  criticise the position. We will objectively report what we have  seen here. In France we are very concerned with human rights,  but we are against terrorism in the world. France has also  suffered on account of terrorism."    Answering another question, Mr. de Villepin said, "After  being briefed by the Prime Minister we understand the situation  much better than before and appreciate the risks and dangers  involved, should the dialogue process suffer."    At their "cordial" meeting, the Prime Minister, reportedly  stressed the overriding value of continuing dialogue with  Pakistan in dealing with all contentions bilateral issues,  including Kashmir. No development should be permitted to  intervene that could hurt the nascent process of dialogue that  commenced only last month, he said. In the context of the  publicised Pakistani intention to bring forward an anti-India  resolution on Kashmir at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights  (UNCHR) in Geneva.    In this context it is noteworthy that the French Foreign  Minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, told his Pakistani counterpart, Mr.  Asif Ali, who was in Paris on a private visit about a week ago  to canvass support for his country's proposed resolution on  Kashmir, that any resolution would be worth considering and  supporting if it furthered the prospects of ongoing dialogue.    When the resolution comes up for voting, members of the  European Union (EU) are expected to take a common position,  rather than individual country stances. The French view attains  significance in this overall framework.    EU sources here also suggest that member countries have not  been impressed by a Pakistani note accompanying a copy of its  proposed resolution being circulated among the 53 members of the  UNCHR. The note is remarkable for suggesting that India is  impervious to the human rights situation in the Kashmir Valley.  "This does not ring true," sources observed.    Delegation sources later said they did not appreciate the  idea of the kind of resolution Pakistan was proposing at a time  such as this as it could distract from ongoing discussions to  solve a very intricate problem.    "Just look at the Middle East. It is a great lesson. Where  would we all be if the dialogue between the contending parties  had broken down?" a Senate Committee source observed.    Mr. de Villepin said cooperation between France and India  could cover a wide field including defence, high-tech areas such  as satellites, telecom and electronics, and agro-business and  vaccine development, covering commercial arrangements in both  public and private sectors.</p>

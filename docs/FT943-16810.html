			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Collection of rare books sells for Pounds 3.2m One of the finest collections of incunabula - books printed before 1500 - to appear on the market for more than 50 years was broken up at Sotheby's in London yesterday. The 400 books come from the library at Donaueschingen, the home of the Furstenberg family, and sold, on target, for Pounds 3.2m. Almost every lot sold. Four of the books are inscribed by Count Wolfgang, the founder of the house and of the court library. Perhaps the rarest offering was a broadside printed in Vienna in 1461 giving the most suitable days in the year for medicinal blood-letting. It is the first known example of printing in Vienna, and sold, just below forecast, for Pounds 221,500.</p>

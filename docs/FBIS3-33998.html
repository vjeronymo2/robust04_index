In a statement to MENA today on the  sidelines of the committee meeting, he said that the paper still  contains numerous political items that are the jurisdiction of  the bilateral negotiations, which are considered to be the basis  of the political process. He noted that the paper that will be  adopted at the conclusion of the meetings in Cairo will not be  "a recommendation" but a "draft" that will be submitted to the  Arab countries to give their official view. It will then be put  forward to the general arms control committee meeting scheduled  for April.    Meanwhile, an official source in the United Arab Emirates  delegation participating in the meetings of the arms control and  regional security committee said that the United States and  Russia, in their capacity as cosponsors of the peace conference  should endorse on any joint principles adopted by the current  meetings in Cairo and not just take a neutral stand. In a  statement to MENA, he said that his country insists on the two  cosponsors' approval and endorsement of any formula on  principles reached by the Middle East countries so that both  countries will be committed to that formula in the future. He  said that this point is still under discussion because both  cosponsors favor a neutral stance on the position the conferees  intend to adopt.</p>

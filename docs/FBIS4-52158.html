			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Komeito leader Koshiro  Ishida, serving as director general of the Management and  Coordination Agency, said Monday [9 May] it was "only natural"  for Shigeto Nagano to have resigned as justice minister over his  remarks on Japan's wartime aggression.    Ishida said in a press conference that Nagano's "extremely  regrettable" remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never  happened and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II  "greatly impacted China and other Asian countries."    "So it's only natural that he took responsibility for it,"  he  said.    Nagano, a 71-year-old member of the coalition's core party  Shinseito and former military serviceman, resigned on Saturday  after holding the post of justice minister for only 10 days. He  was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic Socialist Party.    Ishida suggested that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata undertake  some kind of political overture vis-a-vis China in order to put  bilateral relations back on a firm footing. He refuted  criticism that the Nagano incident reflects the allegedly  hawkish nature of the Hata cabinet and said that Nagano's remark  was a personal observation.    In a separate press conference, Defense Agency Director  General Atsushi Kanda said Nagano's remarks were  "inappropriate," particularly so in light of the fact that it  has recently become the government's clearly established view  that Japan waged a war of aggression during World War II.</p>

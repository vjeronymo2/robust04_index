			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERICAL SCENE: NEW YORK BANKERS CHALLENGING L.A. BROKERAGES;  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SALES: EAST COAST INVESTMENT HOUSES CLOSE BIG DEALS IN CALIFORNIA BY  SHUTTING OUT COMPETITION IN SOUTHLAND.  </P> <P> When CalFED Inc. decided to sell its Miracle Mile office tower this year,  Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. was hired as the broker.  </P> <P> The sellers of the Ambassador Hotel retained Morgan Stanley to unload their  prized mid-Wilshire parcel.  </P> <P> And Salomon Bros. last month sold a prime Laguna Niguel property set to become  a high-priced resort hotel to Australian Quintex Group Chairman Christopher C.  Skase.  </P> <P> Left out of these New York investment banker deals were Los Angeles' own  commercial real estate brokers, who are not just competing against each other  anymore, but against the East Coast.  </P> <P> "They're taking people in the securities business and turning them into real  estate brokers," said Howard Sadowsky, vice president at real estate brokerage  Julien J. Studley in Westwood. "They've certainly gotten into our pockets and  affected the national marketplace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Land of Opportunity  </P> <P> Los Angeles is but one of several cities targeted by investment bankers as a  land of opportunity for real estate brokerage. Chicago, New York, Dallas and  Washington are on the list, too. Los Angeles, however, is attracting more New  York deal makers than ever before.  </P> <P> Goldman Sachs reports almost 20 real estate bankers at its downtown Los Angeles  office. Another 140 are dispersed among offices in Europe, Australia and, of  course, Asia. Goldman Sachs is credited with adding joint venture partners  Mitsubishi Estate and Ayshire Corp. to the 777 Tower under construction at 8th  and Figueroa streets in downtown Los Angeles; to the sale of the Dana Point  Resort this summer in Orange County, and refinancing of the Century Plaza Hotel  in Century City.  </P> <P> Morgan Stanley employs about 85 real estate executives worldwide and brokered  the sale of The Hotel Bel-Air and the Beverly Hills Hotel -- both at record  prices at the time they were sold.  </P> <P> "More of the major Los Angeles properties are being sold internationally," said  John Grinch, vice president at Morgan Stanley. "What we offer is international  financing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sellers Hold a 'Bake-Off'  </P> <P> "There is going to be more of a blend between real estate and the main line of  investment banking," he predicted.  </P> <P> Sellers increasingly are holding what Grinch calls a "bake-off" to decide which  company will get to represent their building. Global connections and name  recognition, he said, are increasingly giving his company and other investment  bankers an edge over many local real estate brokers.  </P> <P> But measuring the share of New York-based investment bankers in the Los  Angeles-area real estate market is very tough, said Studley's Sadowsky.  </P> <P> "There's no question that investment bankers have the contracts," he concedes,  "but they don't know the subtleties of the market."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreign Money Is Here  </P> <P> As for marketing local commercial property abroad, he said:  </P> <P> "You don't need to go to Japan to sell to the Japanese. A lot of foreign money  is sitting right here in Los Angeles already."  </P> <P> Dick C. Schnell, senior vice president at Cushman Realty in Los Angeles,  agreed.  </P> <P> "To succeed in sales you have to understand the local tenant market," he said.  "Access to capital is only part of what is needed from a good broker. . . .  Everybody thinks foreigners will buy anything at any price -- but they are very  sophisticated."  </P> <P> Most New York-based investment houses just do not have the local resources  needed to serve the Southland market properly, Schnell insisted. And, he said,  "New York's share of the market here hasn't been as great as they purport it to  be."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stearns Closed Office  </P> <P> In fact, Schnell said, while firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and  Salomon Bros. have managed to make their mark in Los Angeles, not all their  colleagues have been as successful. Bear Stearns Real Estate Group closed its  Los Angeles operations this summer for lack of business. First Boston, too, has  apparently retracted from earlier plans to claim a share of Southern  California's hot real estate market.  </P> <P> Brokers such as Grubb &amp; Ellis, Julien J. Studley and others are not  standing by idly either. They have formed international marketing and financing  teams for properties worth more than about $20 million.  </P> <P> L.A.'s top local brokers also make it their business to court Japanese and  European financiers so that they too can offer sellers their connections in  exchange for a top-tier listing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shmoozing in Japan  </P> <P> For example, broker John C. Cushman III, head of Cushman Realty, spends one to  two months a year in Japan shmoozing with other executives.  </P> <P> The success of New York brokers in Los Angeles will ultimately depend on who  they hire and how they are trained, Sadowsky said.  </P> <P> Investment banking houses that do not commit enough staff to the local market  will see their share of business erode, he predicted. And, he added, ultimately  "each player will have to decide on a well-defined market niche."  </P> <P> Columbia S &amp; L Opens Wilshire at Elm  </P> <P> Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association celebrated the opening of Wilshire at  Elm this month, the first of six new Beverly Hills boutique office buildings  being called the "Masterpiece Collection."  </P> <P> Designed by architects Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the 48,000-square-foot  Columbia Development Partners project features three levels of high-end office  space wrapped in black granite, limestone and stainless steel.  </P> <P> The style, critics say, could best be described as "deconstructivist," with  exposed beams and what looks like a peeled-away facade. Soon to come are the  Wilshire at La Peer South and Wilshire at Maple buildings.  </P> <P> Another project, slated for the site of the once-venerable Beverly Theater,  remains stymied as Columbia battles in court for the rights to demolish an  adjacent building. Blocking demolition is a Beverly Hills investment group, JPL  Properties, that claims its rights as the now-empty building's master lessor  are being violated by Columbia. Columbia counters that it has paid for all  rights to the building and should be allowed to proceed. Yet another hearing on  this dispute is scheduled for December.  </P> <P> In the meantime, both parties were urged this month by the judge to "work it  out among yourselves."  </P> <P> Teradata Corp. Signs $100,000 Million Lease  </P> <P> $100 million. That's the value being put on a 335,000-square-foot lease just  signed by Teradata Corp. with El Segundo's Pacific Financial building at 100 N.  Sepulveda. The 11-year lease deal is one of the biggest in Southland history  and sure to earn a hefty commission for Jay Borzi and Steve Silk of Cushman  &amp; Wakefield of California Inc., who represented Teradata, and John Ayoob  and Grafton Tanquary of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services, who  represented landlord Pacific Financial Group.  </P> <P> Also involved was Nelson T. Korchak, president of Los Angeles Realty Service  Inc., a division of Pacific Financial. Computer maker Teradata plans to  consolidate its growing work force next year -- relocating from three separate  Marina del Rey buildings it currently calls home.  </P> <P> $10 Million in Leases at Beverly Hills Site  </P> <P> Three leases totaling more than $10 million were announced at Security Pacific  Place, 9665 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. New York-based stock brokerage  Gruntal &amp; Co. Inc. signed for 15,000 square feet of offices in a 7-year  contract worth $4.5 million. Austrian merchant bank, Osterreichische Landerbank  will establish its first West Coast office at the building -- taking 6,000  square feet for seven years at $2.4 million.  </P> <P> And law firm Weissman &amp; Wolff renewed a 15,000 square-foot-lease for five  years in a deal worth $3.5 million. Gruntal was represented by Julien J.  Studley Inc. and Osterreichische Landerbank by New York brokerage Peter H.  Friedman Ltd. Joe and Fawn Bellavia of Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate  Services represented the landlord in all of the transactions, and the firm of  Weissman &amp; Wolff.  </P> <P> Developer Told Corp. Buys in Camarillo  </P> <P> Developer Told Corp. has purchased 24 acres of industrial property in  Camarillo, including a 310,000-square-foot Playtex warehouse and distribution  facility. Playtex plans to continue occupying 77,000 square feet -- the  remainder is up for lease at monthly rates of 35 cents to 37 cents a square  foot. The purchase comes just as Told welcomed guests to its new offices last  week. Headquarters for the company are now at Pacific Corporate Plaza in  Oxnard's Channel Islands Business Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW COLUMNIST  </P> <P> Ron Galperin's weekly column on the Southland commercial real estate scene  debuts this week. It replaces the commercial real estate listings column.  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Panic pleads his case at UN MR Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump state of Yugoslavia, flew to New York yesterday to plead his country's case at the United Nations. He held urgent talks with diplomats as the UN General Assembly prepared to consider ousting the delegation of Serbia and Montenegro, whose claim to succeed to the Yugoslav seat has been rejected by the Security Council. Diplomats said last night they had little doubt the 179-nation body would endorse the decision, making it necessary for Belgrade to re-apply for membership. Mr Panic argued that expulsion of Yugoslavia would be 'wholly unprecedented', adding: 'Countries at war like Iraq and Iran were never expelled even though they committed atrocities.' President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Hercegovina meanwhile urged the General Assembly to lift the arms embargo imposed when his republic was still part of Yugoslavia. Now, he said, his nation was being strangled by the ban, deprived of means to respond to an aggressor. Mr Izetbegovic flew to New York after attending peace talks in Geneva sponsored by the UN and the European Community. The Geneva negotiations will continue between lower-ranking officials. The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference, Mr Cyrus Vance, for the UN, and Lord Owen, representing the EC, fly to Athens today to discuss the situation in the former Yugo-slav republic of Macedonia with Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis. Greece has blocked international recognition of Macedonia, for fear the newly independent republic could pursue claims to Greek territory of the same name. Mr James Grant, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), said yesterday that all parties to the Yugoslav conflict had agreed special measures to protect children from violence. This would culminate in a 'children's week' in the first week of November, by which time Unicef hoped to have distributed clothing, restarted the immunisation programme and got children back to school. However, he admitted that he had nothing in writing. More than 1,000 children have died, and 30,000 have been wounded, in the Bosnian conflict.</p>

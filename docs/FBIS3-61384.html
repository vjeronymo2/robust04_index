			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oazu Nantoi: "Let Us Not Urge Going Forward </F> Looking Backward"]    [Text] The subject of the article "Who Is the Leftist of  Them All?" (KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI No. 51, 4 December of this  year) [For a translation of this article, see pages 75-77 of the  FBIS REPORT: CENTRAL EURASIA, FBIS-USR-002, dated 10 January  1994] was the difference between socialists and social-democrats  in Moldova. First, we have to thank Mr. Morev for drawing this  distinction, because at the other end of the polemic spectrum  there are attempts to discredit us--social-democrats--precisely  by putting us in the same boat with socialists.    Now on substance. Mr. Morev accuses us of being a party of  national bourgeoisie. Yes, the social democrats as early as in  the spring of 1991 submitted to the parliament an alternative  draft of the Law on Privatization, and this is just as true as  the fact that our draft contained a privatization mechanism  (which later was included in the final law) that gives every  citizen of Moldova a chance to own property.    It is this privatization mechanism in the social democrats'  version, that is based on the idea of privatization through  registered national wealth bonds (rather than through  depersonalized vouchers as in Russia), and that, if we finally  succeed in implementing this mechanism, will contribute to  forming in the Republic of Moldova a rather numerous and stable  stratum of property owners, who, as any schoolboy knows this  days, are a guarantee of social stability, dynamic economy, and  real social protection in the society.    It is not the social democrats' fault that the State  Privatization Program was adopted by the parliament (in which  the Conciliere--Accord club, currently headed by Mr. Morev,  carried rather substantial weight: more than 30 deputies) almost  two years after the adoption of the aforementioned law. And that  esteemed deputies, including Mr. Morev and his club mates,  should probably ask themselves: What kind of a government have  we formed that still does not implement the laws we have passed?    Or another example of election-time populism: "We think,"  Mr.  Morev tells us, "that on 27 February 1944 it is necessary to  submit to a referendum the question of the political  independence of the Republic of Moldova, and its joining the CIS  and its economic union." But why did you, the people's  representatives, not resolve all these issues when the  parliament still continued to function, albeit as a formality.    The SDPM [Social Democratic Party of Moldova] never  concealed  its position regarding the need to hold a referendum on the  issue of Moldovan statehood. Everybody who is familiar with our  activities, knows this, as well as that from the moment the  party was founded in May 1990, social democrats consistently  supported state independence. We present this position  absolutely clearly not only in Chisinau, but also in Moscow,  Bucharest, Tiraspol, and Komrat. This position is "what you see  is what you get"--when we proclaim ourselves supporters of state  independence in Chisinau, we do not send our  representatives--like the Socialist Party did--to the congress  of the peoples of the USSR (Moscow, September 1993).    Also very endearing is Mr. Morev's concern regarding  establishing "true people's power" on Moldovan soil. In short,  Soviet power. But have not citizens of our country had the  opportunity to see for themselves that what had been called  Soviet power could exist only in the environment of one party's  diktat, and as soon as this diktat disappears, Supreme Soviets  inevitably drive themselves into a dead end, and take the entire  society with them?    "Demo-cracy" is precisely "people's power." But democracy  can  only exist when there is a functioning law-based state: clear  separation of powers, multiple parties, periodic free elections  on a multiparty basis, and a referendum. And all of this only on  the foundation of a constitution, which the current deputies  also for some reason failed to adopt. But democracy is not a  "citizens rally" under the title of "High National Assembly" and  not 380 people's representatives who do not answer to anything  and who are holding sessions under the banner "All Power to the  Soviets."    Now regarding the Moldovan social democrats' position on the  tragic events in Moscow at the beginning of this year's October,  as mentioned by Mr. Morev. It is enough to read our official  documents of that time to see that the SDPM was not ecstatic  over the no-win situation in the Russian Federation, as well as  over the turn of events when instead of the force of law Moscow  chose the right of force. In our statement on the topic of the  latter, we expressed our deep concern over confrontational  processes in Russia and expressed hope that a way out of the  conflict would be found on the basis of free expression of the  people's will.    I would like to note, however, that while we strive to move  toward modern European social democratic values, the SDPM is  certainly not a "foreign-oriented" political force. After all,  the real orientation of a party shows, let me put it this way,  in the domestic market. And here I have to remind our political  opponents that when blood was being spilled in Moldova on the  left bank of Dniester, many now "bold" political parties for  some reason remained mum... And so did some individual people's  deputies, who now are very "brave."    The only party that issued a stern warning that the  resolution of the Dniester crisis by military means, reliance on  violent methods, will bring Moldova to a catastrophe to the  state structures and the public in the spring of 1992 were  social democrats. Unfortunately, our lone voice was not heard.    In conclusion I would like to point out that there are  people  now who are trying to resurrect a split in the society that  existed in 1989-1990. At the time the opposing forces "marked"  people by their ethnic attribute. Now the people are quite tired  of hysteria and are more inclined to think about the daily  bread. However, the temptation to divide everybody into "us" and  "them" turned out quite resilient, so now the readers are  reminded that Nantoi used to belong to the "front" (not as a  cochairman, though--just a deputy chairman)!    The Popular Front, just like the Communist Party, initially  brought under its umbrella people with very different political  views. I have never been a Communist Party member, but I  remember very well that some leaders of the National Front of  Moldova [NFM] had been, and so did Mr. Morev.    It took some time for the logic of political events to sort  out all this confusion and call things their proper names. At  least I do not intend to deny the facts of my biography: I broke  up with the NFM in the beginning of 1990 precisely because I  stuck to my beliefs and did not try to use my position in the  Front to secure some prestigious job.    By the way, a few words about the attitude toward  "frontism."  Social democrats have advocated early elections and forming a  professional parliament on a multiparty basis since last year.  The greatest rebuke of this idea came from NFM deputies, as well  as other parties of "democratic orientation." And, strange as it  may be, most deputies who belong to the Conciliere--Accord club,  not being "frontists," for all practical purposes ended up in  the same boat with the NFM. (And Deputy V. Krylov, who  carelessly voiced his support for an early disbanding of  parliament, which had discredited itself in the eyes of  citizens, was replaced as the club leader by "nonfrontist" V.  Morev).    Therefore, as Kozma Prutkov used to say, let us "look into  the root of things" and not count KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI readers  as people without memory and without ability to analyze facts.  As to taking politicians' words at face value, this is not  recommended in any country.</p>

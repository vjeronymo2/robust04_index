			<p>BFN     [Text] Residents of the Druze settlements on the Golan  Heights are saying they have learned from various sources in  Syria that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  deliver an Israeli proposal to Damascus entitled Majdal Shams  First. The proposal suggests that during the first stage, Syria  be given sovereignty and control over the four Druze settlements  on the Golan Heights.    Our correspondents Nati Zilberman and Hayim Hecht report  that  the Druze villagers on the Golan Heights are already preparing  for such a possibility.    Officials at the Prime Minister's Office, at the Foreign  Ministry, and in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] denied any  plans for a withdrawal from Majdal Shams first. Our  correspondents nevertheless report that the maps prepared by the  General Staff contain several possible options for the transfer  of the Druze villages to Syrian control.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION THE CLASH OF ABSOLUTES;  </P> <P> BOOK MARK: POSITIONING IN THE FIGHT OVER ABORTION LEAVES NO ROOM FOR  COMPROMISE. THE INTENSITY THAT SEARS BOTH EXTREMES PREVENTS EACH FROM  ACKNOWLEDGING THERE MIGHT BE POINTS OF AGREEMENT. IN "ABORTION: THE CLASH OF  ABSOLUTES," LAURENCE TRIBE EXPLAINS.  </P> <P> Most people are torn by the abortion question. There is something deeply  misleading about discussing the abortion debate solely in terms of a clash  between pro-life "groups" and pro-choice "groups," as though each of us could  properly be labeled as belonging to one camp or the other. For nearly everyone,  the deepest truth is that the clash is internal. Few people who really permit  themselves to feel all of what is at stake in the abortion issue can avoid a  profound sense of internal division. Whatever someone's "bottom line" --  whether it is that the choice must belong to the woman or that she must be  prevented from killing the fetus -- it is hard not to feel deeply the tug of  the opposing view.  </P> <P> A story told in a recent newspaper interview by Dr. Warren Hern, director of  the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado, demonstrates this. Hern recounts  calling one of his closest friends, a "strongly pro-choice" physician who had  "done abortions himself." When Hern told his friend that he was at work at his  office, his friend asked, "Still killing babies this late in the afternoon?"  Hern recalls: "It was like a knife in my gut . . . it really upset me. What it  conveys is that no matter how supportive people may be, there is still a horror  at what I do."  </P> <P> Something akin to horror must be felt by everyone involved in the question of  abortion who has not become anesthetized to the reality of what is at stake.  This feeling may be less intense with abortions performed in the beginning  stages of pregnancy, when the embryo is a tiny, visually undifferentiated,  multicelled growth without discernibly human features. But certainly by some  point in pregnancy, as soon as abortion involves a fetus recognizably human in  form, or involves a fetus one might imagine feeling pain, few can avoid the  sense of tragic choice each abortion entails.  </P> <P> The "absolutes" at issue are the fetus' right to life and the woman's right to  liberty. Neither "absolute" is really that. Whatever right a woman might have  to choose abortion would be undermined if the fetus could be saved without  sacrificing the woman's freedom to end her pregnancy. Most would intuitively  sense the force of any such fetus' claim to life.  </P> <P> The principal case in the abortion battle is named Jane Roe vs. Henry Wade,  where the Supreme Court said that, except in narrow circumstances, the U.S.  Constitution does not permit the government to interfere with a woman's right  to choose abortion.  </P> <P> Roe vs. Wade is many things. It is a legal decision by the Supreme Court; a  rallying cry for both sides in the abortion debate. But it is also, and was at  first, an entirely human story, one that has become by now familiar to many, a  story similar to other stories repeated all over the United States every day.  </P> <P> "Jane Roe" is not a real person's name, but a pseudonym. "Henry Wade" is the  real name of a Texas official, enforcing the criminal laws of a legislature  that had decided to protect unborn lives.  </P> <P> Soon after the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade, "Jane Roe" revealed  who she was. Her name was Norma McCorvey. She explained that as she walked home  from work late one summer evening in 1969, 25 years old and unmarried, she  became the victim of a gang rape. Her anguish grew several weeks later, she  said, when she learned to her dismay that she was pregnant.  </P> <P> Abortion was illegal -- except to save the woman's life -- in Texas where she  lived, and she lacked the resources to travel to a place where a legal abortion  might be obtained. McCorvey had little education, and did not realize the  attention her case might receive. When her lawyer informed her that the case  would be presented to the U.S. Supreme Court, McCorvey was dismayed. "My God,"  she said, "all those people are so important. They don't have time to listen to  some little old Texas girl who got in trouble."  </P> <P> A decade and a half after the court handed down its decision in Roe vs. Wade,  McCorvey said she had made up the story to hide the fact that she had gotten  "in trouble" in the more usual way. Many reacted with dismay. How could the  heroine of the most important abortion-rights case have deceived the advocates  of such rights? Few asked why she had felt a need to deceive them. In a  different sort of society, the life she would have faced as an unwed mother  might not have been nearly so lonely. In such a society she might not have made  up a story about how she became pregnant. In such a society she might not have  chosen an abortion.  </P> <P> It seems telling that in Roe vs. Wade both the woman on one side of the  "versus" (Roe) and the fetus on the other (represented by Wade) are nameless.  In much of the debate over abortion in our society, one side or the other is  reduced to ghostly anonymity. Many who can readily envision the concrete  humanity of a fetus, who hold its picture high and weep, barely see the woman  who carries it and her human plight. To them, she becomes an all-but-invisible  abstraction. Many others, who can readily envision the woman and her body, who  cry out for her right to control her destiny, barely envision the fetus within  that woman and do not imagine as real the life it might have been allowed to  lead. For them, the life of the fetus becomes an equally invisible abstraction.  </P> <P> Who knows the names of the countless women who have died from painful and  illegal abortions? What of the names of the countless babies who would have  been born but for all the abortions, legal as well as illegal, that have been  performed in recent decades? Melissa Able would have been aborted if Sandra  Race Cano, the "Mary Doe" in the case of Doe vs. Bolton, another abortion case  decided by the Supreme Court on the same day as Roe vs. Wade, had been able to  obtain in Georgia the abortion she sought there. Because abortion was so  heavily restricted, Cano ended up giving birth to a daughter -- Able -- whom  she put up for adoption. Biological mother and daughter have since met; indeed,  for several months they even lived in the same house. Remarkably, Cano and Able  are now playing out on a personal level the clash of absolutes with which so  many of us are familiar.  </P> <P> Although she was once a key pro-choice litigant, Cano believes today that  abortion should be illegal. She is now active in the pro-life movement. Her  daughter Able -- herself now a mother -- disagrees. Able knows she would never  have been born if abortion rights had been established sooner, but she said, in  November, 1989, that she believes women have the right to choose. Cano, Able  and McCorvey are three real individuals. That the names of millions of others  -- the women, the fetuses not born and the many who were born but unwanted --  are not known to us should not make them any the less real.  </P> <P> We must see the reality that "Roe" and "Wade" stand for if we are to move  beyond the clash of absolutes. Giving voice to the human reality on each side  of the "versus" -- keeping both the woman and the fetus in focus -- may be the  only way to avoid the no-win battle that mercilessly pits women against their  unborn children and leaves us all impoverished losers.  </P> <P> America is at a crossroads. In 1989, the 16-year era of judicial protection of  legal abortion rights that began with the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe  vs. Wade, ended with that court's 5-4 decision upholding certain state  regulations of abortion in the case of Webster vs. Reproductive Health  Services. A right that, since the time of Watergate and Vietnam, had been kept  by judges from the rough-and-tumble of local politics is now subject to  regulation -- and possibly even prohibition -- by our elected representatives.  A right that many Americans took for granted is now up for grabs. As the 1990s  dawn, the complexion of politics in America is changing daily, and the shadow  of the question of abortion rights grows, with widespread significance for our  society.  </P> <P> The debate is unending. None of its participants ever seems even mildly  persuaded by the arguments of the other side. As the apparently irresistible  force of the pro-life movement bears down on the seemingly immovable object of  abortion rights, local politics may at times be overwhelmed by the kind of  single-issue campaigning that has already distorted the face of national  elections. If this happens, the losers will be the democratic process and the  American people.  </P> <P> The traditions that divide us and the myriad difficulties that plague all  attempts at compromise in matters touching the absolutes of life and liberty,  and lying at the crossroads of power and sex, may seem overwhelming. But we  should not let them obscure the common ground we all can stand on.  </P> <P> If advocates on both sides of the abortion debate would just pause, they would  recognize at least one shared interest: working toward a world of only wanted  pregnancies. Better education, the provision of contraception, indeed the  creation of a society where the burden of raising a child is lighter, are all  achievable goals lost in the shouting about abortion. For while solving the  puzzle of the abortion dispute will take a journey of self-discovery, nearly  all of us agree that we should strive for a society in which every child a  woman conceives is wanted and every child born has someone to love and nurture  it.  </P> <P> Book Review: A review of "Abortion: The Clash of Absolutes" appears in the Book  Review section on page 1.  </P> <P> 1980 by Laurence H.

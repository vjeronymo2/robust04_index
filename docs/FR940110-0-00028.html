			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4201(c) of that same law provided for payment for EPO furnished to ESRD patients by Medicare approved dialysis facilities to be made at the rate of $11 per 1,000 units, rounded to the nearest 100 units, effective January 1, 1991. Section 13566 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) sets the rate at $10 per 1,000 units effective January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically, EPO is administered at the end of the dialysis treatment. Therefore, unless medical documentation shows that it is necessary to administer EPO at a time other than during dialysis, payment for patients who dialyze at a facility is made only to the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change made by section 13555(b) of OBRA '93, which provides for coverage of EPO self-administered by any dialysis patient (not limited to those who dialyze at home) will be implemented by separate regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For home use of EPO supplied to a home dialysis patient competent to administer the drug without medical supervision, HCFA pays only a Medicare approved dialysis facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies, if the patient obtains the drug directly from the supplier. In either case, payment for home use of EPO is made at the rate described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a home patient is competent to use EPO without supervision and the drug has been prescribed, generally the patient's dialysis facility would furnish it. If a physician administers EPO to the patient, it should be the physician who receives the Monthly Capitation Payment (MCP) for furnishing the beneficiary's renal-related services. If a physician other than the MCP physician furnishes EPO, this physician must look to the MCP physician for payment for EPO administration. In this latter case, HCFA pays on a reasonable charge basis for the drug, but makes no additional payment to the physician for administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA will announce annually, for public comment, whether an update in the EPO allowance is appropriate. By statute, any increase will not exceed the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for the gross national product for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the interim final rule with comment period, published on September 4, 1991, we made the changes discussed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Major changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We amended subpart U of part 405 of the HCFA rules, which sets forth the conditions for coverage of services furnished to ESRD beneficiaries, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Patient selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure the safe and effective use of EPO by home dialysis patients, we amended &sect;405.2163 to require that the patient's dialysis facility or the physician responsible for all dialysis-related services make a comprehensive assessment of the patient and the patient's needs at the time of selection for EPO therapy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We emphasized that proper patient selection is necessary for a safe, effective program of EPO therapy at home. It is necessary for the dialysis facility or the physician responsible for all dialysis-related services to assess_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Whether the patient will actually be able to administer the drug or have available the necessary assistance from a care-giver; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the patient complies with certain elements necessary for successful EPO therapy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, we required that, in order to be selected for home use of EPO, a patient must_  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Be a home dialysis patient (either peritoneal or hemodialysis method).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Have a hematocrit (or comparable hemoglobin) of less than 30 percent unless medical documentation justifies a patient's need for EPO with a hematocrit higher than 30 percent. For example, a patient with severe angina, severe pulmonary disease, or severe hypotension may require EPO to prevent adverse symptoms even though the patient has a higher hematocrit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Be under the care of the physician who is responsible for the dialysis-related services and who prescribes EPO, and under the care of the renal dialysis facility that establishes the plan of care for the services and monitors the progress of the home EPO therapy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Be trained by the facility to inject EPO or have an appropriate caregiver who is trained to inject EPO.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, as part of the assessment, we required the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The patient's hematocrit (or hemoglobin), serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and blood pressure must be measured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. An appropriate protocol, developed by the patient's physician or facility and including monitoring of blood pressure, must be given to the patient for the safe and effective use of the drug.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The patient must be capable of performing self-administration of EPO, be able to learn aseptic technique, and be able to read the drug labeling, or must have a primary care-giver who can perform these tasks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. The patient must be able to adhere to a disciplined medical regimen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Patient care plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure adequate monitoring of home EPO therapy, we amended &sect;405.2137(b) to add a new paragraph (b)(7) which requires that the patient plan for a home dialysis patient who uses EPO in the home include the following:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Review of diet and fluid modifications to monitor iron stores and hyperkalemia related to dietary indiscretion or elevated blood pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reevaluation of the patient's dialysis prescription taking into account the patient's increased appetite and red blood cell volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A method of teaching the patient to identify the signs and symptoms of hypotension and hypertension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The decrease or discontinuance of EPO if hypertension is uncontrolled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A method of followup on blood work and a means to keep the physician informed of the results.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Other concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to minimize possible abuse of EPO, we revised &sect;405.2163(g)(4) to require that the physician or facility ensure that ``on hand'' EPO is limited to a two-month supply.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

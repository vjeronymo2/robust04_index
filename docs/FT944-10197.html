			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cray unveils new supercomputer Cray Computer, the struggling supercomputer developer, has announced a new model which it claims will match the performance of any commercially available supercomputer at a fraction of the price. The new 'Cray 4' supercomputer is priced at about Dollars 6m for a system with performance equivalent to a Dollars 25m supercomputer sold by Cray Research, the world's leading manufacturer. Cray Computer is a spin-off from Cray Research, formed by Mr Seymore Cray, founder of the original company bearing his name. Cray Computer has yet to make a single sale and its future is largely dependent upon finding a buyer for the new Cray 4 over the next few months, according to industry analysts. In recent months two other US supercomputer companies, Thinking Machines and Kendall Square, have ceased manufacturing operations. Cray said, however, that it has some 'strong indications of interest' and believes that it is close to receiving its first order. 'We plan to be able to make our first delivery by the end of the first quarter of 1995,' said Mr Charles Breckenridge, executive vice-president of marketing.</p>

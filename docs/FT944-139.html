			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Thorp's orders for phase two halved The cancellation this week of a second German contract means that British Nuclear Fuels has lost nearly half its orders for the second phase of its Thorp spent fuel reprocessing plant. But it will receive cancellation penalties totalling nearly Pounds 100m from the two German utilities. The company confirmed yesterday that the Gundremmingen nuclear power station on the Danube has opted out of a contract for 425 tonnes of spent fuel. This is more than three times the size of the 125 tonne contract that BNF lost last week when the Hamburg-based HEW station also cancelled. The combined loss represents just under half the 1,200 tonnes BNF had secured for the 10 years from 2004 to 2014. Total capacity for that period is about 7,000 tonnes. Thorp, built at a cost of Pounds 2.9bn, received the go-ahead in 1993. Its operating life has been divided into two 10-year periods. The first, known as base load, runs to 2004, and also has a capacity of 7,000 tonnes which is fully booked. BNF said yesterday that the lost contracts represented about 4 per cent of its total Pounds 9bn order book. But it emphasised that the loss would not affect the economic viability of the plant, which was calculated on the base load period only. Although there had been concerns that more German utilities might pull out before the year-end deadline, after which cancellation charges rise sharply, BNF said it believed its other contracts were secure. The power stations that pulled out cited a recent change in German law permitting direct disposal of nuclear waste in an underground repository instead of reprocessing. Both utilities are also believed to have come under political pressure to use alternatives to reprocessing, which produces plutonium.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Thieves on rice rampage RICE thieves are on the rampage in Japan, attracted by the high prices created by the worst harvest since the war, according to the the national police agency. Thefts of the staple are increasing throughout Japan, traditionally known for an absence of petty crime beneath the big financial corruption scandals of the past few years. The agency said rice worth Y34m (Pounds 212,000) had been stolen in 208 incidents in the first nine months of the year, almost the same as for the whole of 1992. Police expect the number of thefts to rise as the harvest progresses from southern to northern regions. Police are worried by the spread in rice-stealing from criminals to ordinary workers, which they take to be a mark of the seriousness of the recession.</p>

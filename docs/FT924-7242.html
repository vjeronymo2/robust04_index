			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (15): Factories plug their leaks  -Fuel costs keep heavy industry on its toes ENORMOUS gains in energy efficiency have been achieved over the past 20 years by the world's manufacturing industries, which account for about 40 per cent of the world's energy use. But recession and energy policy uncertainties have demoted efficiency measures in the list of industry's priorities. The major energy-intensive industries - pulp and paper, chemicals, glass-making, iron and steel and non-ferrous metals - still recognise the need for further improvements on top of the gains already made. Even so, some large energy efficiency projects have been postponed to conserve cash. In industries where energy is a much lower proportion of production costs, the current record is rather patchier. Improvements, typically, are coming indirectly from manufacturing initiatives such as reorganisation and newer equipment which have been introduced for other reasons. A book by energy experts Lee Schipper and Stephen Meyers, to be published in the UK on Thursday*, chronicles the sharp reductions in energy intensity - energy use divided by production - made by manufacturing industries in eight key OECD countries between 1971 and 1988. The largest reduction, 37 per cent, was in chemicals, followed by the stone, clay and glass sector with a decline of 32 per cent, ferrous metals and paper and pulp with 27 per cent each, and non-ferrous metals with 26 per cent. Non-energy intensive industries also notched up a 37 per cent reduction, reflecting the trend towards higher value per unit of physical output as light manufacturing shifted towards 'high-tech' products. While structural change within the main energy-intensive sectors inevitably played a part in this achievement, the authors believe that most of the decline was due to the reduction in the energy intensity of producing particular products. Three main factors contributed to this, they say: improvements in operations and maintenance, and retrofits with low-cost equipment; changes in process equipment or 'add-on' energy technologies requiring significant investment; and introduction of new production processes, often involving construction of a new facility. In the UK, combinations of these options have been widely introduced by the main energy-intensive sectors, which are well aware of the sensitivity of energy efficiency in the broader environmental context. Investments can range from building an entire combined heat and power (CHP) plant to purchasing the latest 'widget' to control energy use in a particular production process. Over the past two years, total UK investment in energy efficiency has fallen by 28 per cent, according to the Association for the Conservation of Energy. Industry, it says, has probably been affected as badly as the residential sector, although manufacturers with high energy costs are continuing to spend. The overall reduction in investment masks some big variations. Spending on CHP projects has been less affected by the recession than other energy-efficiency investments, such as control equipment or cavity wall insulation. There are about 140 CHP projects in the industrial and commercial sector - the most recent was a 7.5MW plant developed by BP Energy for English China Clays near St. Austell, Cornwall, and opened last month. Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat &amp; Power Association, attributes the relative buoyancy of CHP to the higher priority given to energy efficiency because of the general 'greening of industry', and the fact that companies with more than 1 megawatt of annual demand can now shop around for their power needs. CHP consequently becomes an issue worth looking at. CHP can cut companies' power bills by 30 per cent, and most companies can make savings of 20 per cent, he says. It is because CHP can achieve this, and reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions, that the Government has set a target of at least doubling the current 2,000MW of CHP capacity by the end of the century. If companies are holding back from investing in CHP, says Mr Green, it is not because of the cost but because of the general uncertainty over UK energy policy, and remaining regulatory barriers to CHP which the association is working to have lifted. These include obstacles to the export of excess power generated at one site to an adjacent company. In the UK, ICI is a classic example of a company - and an industry - where controlling energy costs, and understanding the close link between energy efficiency and emissions, is crucial for business success. Over the past 20 years, ICI's worldwide production has more than doubled while energy use has been reduced by 10 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions cut by 20 per cent. Further reductions in energy use will come with the completion of the Enron power station at Wilton on Teesside, which will provide ICI's Wilton site with a significant proportion of its steam and power, and replace several older facilities. As for improving process efficiency, design and technology changes have reduced the energy consumption per tonne of ammonia produced by two-thirds in ICI's modern plants, compared with the old coke-based process. In the steel industry, constant improvements in energy efficiency are being made at individual plants. An example unveiled last month at British Steel's bloom and billet mill in Scunthorpe involves a bank of frequency inverters produced by the Powys-based Control Techniques. The 25 inverters enable the speed of the combustion air fans on the mill's soaking pits to be varied between 360rpm and 2,400rpm - they previously ran at a constant 3,000rpm. The energy saved this year will be enough to keep the whole mill running for a week. Another major energy user, the glass industry, has focused its efforts on the manufacturing processes to reduce energy consumption, along with glass recycling. Fuel for melting can be 20 to 25 per cent of manufacturing costs, and improvements in refractory technology and in regenerators have made a big difference both to product quality and energy efficiency. Furnace insulation has also been shown to reduce heat loss by 50 per cent. And some relatively low users of energy have also made impressive gains in energy efficiency. The UK brewing industry consumes more than Pounds 50m of energy a year - only about 3 per cent of production costs. But, according to Dr David Long of the Brewers Society, the average energy consumption to produce a litre of beer has fallen from 3.03 megajoules in 1976 to 1.97 in 1990. Some allowance, he says must be made for brewery amalgamations and closures, but that is offset by increased automation and the continuing swing to lager which have added to the electricity load. For the future, the major energy users will continue whittling away at their costs - and are being encouraged to do so by government agencies and industry organisations. One of ICI's key environmental objectives established last year was to implement an even more rigorous energy and resource conservation programme, from which substantial benefits are expected by 1995. There is also growing recognition that smaller companies need more help finding out about energy efficiency measures, and a need to end what ACE sees as a general reluctance to look at 'low-tech' solutions such as insulation. * Energy Efficiency and Human Activity: Past Trends, Future Prospects.

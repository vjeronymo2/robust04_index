			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Graham and Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Excerpt] The murder of six men in a village pub by  loyalist terrorists was condemned as "inhuman savagery" by  Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew today.    He pledged the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] would never  give up their hunt for the masked killers who struck last night  as customers at O'Toole's Bar in the hamlet of Loughinisland in  Down Patrick, Northern Ireland, watched the Irish team in their  winning opening match against Italy in the World Cup on the pub  television.    Sir Patrick said that in their grief and horror he offered  all his sympathy to the families of the dead and injured and  "denounce the inhuman savagery and injustice of this act. The  moral squalor of those who perpetrated it is beyond description."    The cheering stopped suddenly mid-way through the second  half  to be turned to screams of terror and pain when two killers from  the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force burst in and opened fire  indiscriminately.    They opened fire and kept firing into the crowd of 24 packed  into the tiny pub. Five men died instantly, another a short  time later in hospital. All were Catholics.    Among five men injured in the shooting one was today  critically ill. The four others were described as ill.    Sir Patrick said he had faith the Province was going to put  behind it "the foul madness and sectarian murder perpetrated by  so few. One thing is certain: it will achieve no political  purpose, no concession, no blackmailer's reward no matter how  long it continues. Let this revolting massacre now, therefore,  mark the end of it from whatever quarter."    He appealed to anyone who knew anything, or suspected  anything, to help the police catch the murderers.

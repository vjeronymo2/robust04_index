Even if Hosokawa's political reform  bills are killed, said Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan  Federation of Employers' Association (Nikkeiren), "it would be  irresponsible (for Hosokawa) to dissolve the house without even  compiling the budget for the next fiscal year."    Noting that two prime ministers in the past resigned after  their political reform bills failed in the Diet, Nagano said  Japan would lose its international credibility if Hosokawa  follows such a course just two weeks before the summit meeting  with U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The Hosokawa administration's political reform package is on  the verge of collapse following a rejection of the bills by the  House of Councillors last week.</p>

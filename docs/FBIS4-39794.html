			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Drozd from Kiev: "Who Is Last in Line for </F> Spies?"]    [Text] Last year PRAVDA reported on the enhanced interest  by foreign special services in secret installations located in  Dnepropetrovskaya Oblast. It seems, however, that an appetite  for secrets comes in the eating. Now, according to KIEVSKIYE  VEDOMOSTI, (citing an interview with V. Nazarenko, deputy chief  of the Ukraine Security Service Division in Zaporozhskaya  Oblast), foreign knights of the cloak and dagger are not content  with the "enhanced interest in secrets concentrated in the  region."    Recently the Ukraine Security Service caught red-handed  several residents of Zaporozhskaya Oblast who in exchange for  "greenbacks" transferred valuable information abroad. Without a  second's hesitation, special services are openly encouraging  "cooperation" not only among the recruited Ukrainian citizens  but also their relatives and friends. True, special services  display initiative in all directions. The FBI, in particular,  via the RUSSKOYE SLOVO newspaper, has called on the  "Russian-speaking public of the United States and the newly  arriving emigrants" to help their new country.... "Throughout  many years," the FBI recalls, "emigrants from the USSR have  rendered assistance to the FBI.... We request those who possess  any information to come to the local FBI office."</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / People: More power for Sir Colin Southgate Sir Colin Southgate, chairman and chief executive of Thorn EMI, is adding to his already full agenda by accepting the chairmanship of PowerGen, the smaller of the two privatised electricity generators, where he has been a non-executive director since the company was formed in 1990. He succeeds Sir Graham Day, who steps down at the agm in September. Sir Graham, who is steadily reducing his many other commitments at the top of British industry, had intended to leave PowerGen in March, according to chief executive Ed Wallis. 'But he held on until the uncertainties over recontracting quietened down a bit.' Wallis goes on: 'It was always our wish that his successor would be someone already on the board with whom we knew we could work and who knew the business.' Indeed, the board of PowerGen has been quite a tight-knit circle, with Sir Graham on the board of both Thorn (since 1990) and of Laird, whose chairman and chief executive John Gardiner is in turn on the board of PowerGen. Wallis says that Sir Colin will probably spend a bit more time with the company than did Day who, among his many commitments, was chairman of British Aerospace until last May. 'We would welcome that.' In order to do so Sir Colin will probably have to reduce other outside commitments. As well as combining the top roles at Thorn, he is a director of the Bank of England (a position he has no intention of relinquishing), and has a number of other non-executive directorships and educational and charitable posts. 'We are entering a different phase,' Wallis points out. 'Until now we have been much concerned with recontracting and relations with government in general. Now the priority is on diversifying the business.' Sir Colin is generally seen as having done a good job in disposing of non-core businesses at Thorn, though at least one of his purchases, that of Virgin Records where he was criticised in some quarters for paying too dearly, was more controversial.</p>

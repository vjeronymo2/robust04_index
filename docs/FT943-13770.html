			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Canadian wheat pool to go public The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the biggest of Canada's prairie farm co-operatives, is to convert to a listed public company. The Pool, with 1993 revenues of CDollars 1.62bn (USDollars 1.18bn), plans a share offering early next year and will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Its 60,000 members will initially convert their equity into shares, some of which may be offered to the public. However, farmer-members will continue to control the pool by being the sole holders of class A voting shares. No single shareholder will be allowed to own more than 10 per cent of class B non-voting shares. The Pool was formed in 1924 to handle Saskatchewan's grain crop. But about 40 per cent of last year's CDollars 28.5m profit came from non-grain businesses. The Pool's recent diversifications have included natural cosmetics (with a sizeable export market in Japan), pie fillings and a food-preserving process. The move to go public has been a controversial one. Critics have noted that the Pool was formed to make farmers more independent of commercial grain companies. But members have recently been swayed by arguments that the Pool needs to strengthen its resources to respond to far-reaching structural changes in North American agribusiness. For example, the North American free trade agreement and the Uruguay Round are expected to open the Canadian grain market to competitors. Almost half the Pool's members are over 55 years old and are expected to withdraw their equity as they retire over the next 10 to 15 years.</p>

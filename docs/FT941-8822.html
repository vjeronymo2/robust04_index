			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / BMW expects to regain ground BMW, the German carmaker, expects to boost its profits by 20-30 per cent this year, recovering much of the ground lost in 1993 when net profits slumped to about DM510m. The company, which plans to take control of Rover Group, yesterday forecast a 5 per cent increase in deliveries of BMW models, and said income from the British business could increase earnings even further. The buoyant predictions came as teams from BMW and Rover Group were understood to be preparing to fly to Tokyo for talks early next week with Rover's long-standing partner, Honda, on BMW's intended acquisition. The teams are expected to be led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, and Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. Honda has a 20 per cent stake in Rover and has made plain its anger and dismay over the Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn) sale to BMW by British Aerospace of its 80 per cent stake in Rover. The Japanese carmaker has indicated that its quarrel is not with Rover or BMW but with BAe. Both European parties hope to persuade Honda not to withdraw from its collaboration with Rover and point to benefits in long-term tripartite co-operation. Earlier this week Mr Pischetsrieder promised 'considerably higher' investment in Rover than had been planned by BAe. Yesterday, he vigorously denied rumours that BMW planned to reduce the Rover product range. He also repeated pledges that the British business would be run as an independent operation, adding that aggregate sales of DM40bn (Dollars 22.7bn) and the expected profits would offer job security at both companies. Mr Pischetsrieder based his optimism for 1994 profits on new models due on the market this year, economic recovery in Europe and accelerating demand in the US. A compact, two-door version of the successful 3-Series, launched this week, was expected to bolster turnover. Further impetus would come from the new 7-Series. He said the greatest uncertainty stemmed from unforeseeable exchange rate variations, but the board was 'well satisfied' with the situation. Lex, Page 14; VW and Fiat debt ratings, Page 16</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Swedish exporters warn of election threat to investment The chiefs of Sweden's four top exporting companies joined forces yesterday to warn that their planned domestic investments of up to SKr50bn (Pounds 4.27bn) a year were at risk if the ground rules for industry - including income tax levels - were changed for the worse after Sunday's general election. The intervention by the executives, whose companies together account for a third of the country's exports and whose combined annual turnover last year exceeded SKr250bn, was considered highly unusual for Sweden. In a joint newspaper article clearly aimed mainly at the opposition Social Democratic party, the heads of Volvo, Ericsson, the forestry group Stora and the local division of the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant ABB said their companies together planned annual investment at home or abroad of SKr40bn to SKr50bn over the next five years. 'With today's conditions, Sweden is an attractive choice. But uncertainty over labour market and economic policies, and the constancy with which they are applied, can hinder essential decision-making in a harmful way for Sweden,' said the article in Dagens Nyheter, the country's biggest-selling broadsheet. The four company chiefs - Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive of Volvo; Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive of Ericsson; Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of Swedish ABB; and Mr Bo Berggren, chairman of Stora - said the recent surge in profitability and competitiveness in Swedish industry wrought by sound government policies must not be upset. They called on policymakers to tackle the budget deficit and stabilise the fast-growing public debt. They also warned strongly that any increase in marginal income taxes would damage Swedish competitiveness. 'Marginal taxes over 50 per cent (the present level) would seriously reduce our attractiveness to recruits,' they wrote. The Social Democrats, who are expected in Sunday's poll to oust the right-centre coalition of Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, have proposed cutting corporate tax as part of measures to stimulate investment. But they plan to raise marginal income taxes through a 5 per cent 'emergency' tax and increase capital gains, wealth and dividend taxes. The intervention had an immediate impact on the election campaign. Mr Bildt, desperate to close the gap on a weakening Social Democratic lead in the opinion polls, welcomed the article, saying it showed that Social Democratic policies threatened industry and employment. But Social Democratic officials close to Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the party leader, dismissed it as crude election propaganda. Mr Carlsson said the party did not intend changing the basic income tax levels set in 1990.</p>

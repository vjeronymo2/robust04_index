			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY COPES WITH THE QUAKE ON 'FULL HOUSE'  </P> <P> Tonight's episode of ABC's comedy "Full House" finds the Tanner family dealing  with emotional aftershocks from the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake.  </P> <P> "The show is set in San Francisco, and we didn't want to pretend the earthquake  hadn't happened," said Jeff Franklin, the series' creator and executive  producer.  </P> <P> "Children all across the country saw the earthquake footage. We wanted to try  to help with their anxieties by showing the effect the earthquake had on the  Tanner family."  </P> <P> Franklin co-wrote the "Aftershocks" episode with Lenny Ripps, using input from  trauma experts at the UCLA School of Medicine. The program airs at 8 p.m. on  Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42.  </P> <P> In the show, 7-year-old Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) suddenly can't bear to be  separated from her dad (Bob Saget), even at bedtime. Dad becomes increasingly  concerned, not knowing what's wrong. A visit to a family therapist brings  Stephanie's fears into the open and even offers a sensitive alternative to  Stephanie's crawling into Dad's bed for reassurance.  </P> <P> Franklin explained in an interview that he wanted to address several issues.  </P> <P> "The episode is a reminder about earthquake preparedness, it's a look at how  scary these things can be for children and it's a reminder to parents that if  they encounter a problem with a child that they don't have the answer for, it's  good parenting to get some help."  </P> <P> Franklin also likes the idea of putting his show "in the real world."  </P> <P> "Our show is seen by millions of viewers," he said, "and we're aware of the  tremendous impact we can have on young people. So, of course, we try to do  shows that entertain, but we also want to give viewers something to think  about."  </P> <P> The show is special to Franklin for another reason. Erin McKnelly, a 7-year-old  with cystic fibrosis, plays a small role. Franklin cast her after hearing  through the Starlight Foundation -- an organization that tries to grant the  wishes of seriously ill children -- that McKnelly wanted to be "a movie star."  </P></p>

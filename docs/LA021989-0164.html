			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A predominantly Polish Roman Catholic church in Bridgeport, Conn., was closed  indefinitely hours after the city's bishop summoned police to evict dissident  parishioners. On Friday afternoon, about 100 dissidents shouted down diocesan  officials who came to St. Michael the Archangel Church to convey Bishop Edward  M. Egan's offer to meet with them if they would leave peacefully. About 200  parishioners, occupying the church in shifts, staged a weeklong sit-in to  protest the transfer announced in December of a popular priest, Father Roman  Palaszewski, brought from Poland three years ago. Regular church functions have  continued during the protest. The standoff ended when police arrived and  ordered about 80 dissidents present to leave. Two people were arrested on  trespassing charges.  </P></p>

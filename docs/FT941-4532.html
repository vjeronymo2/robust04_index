			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (1): Instant data at managers' fingertips / Comment - Financial control demands clear presentation of data to management. Here, David Carter looks at radical new developments in what are called 'super drill-down' accounts packages Despite the need for clear data presentation, surveys among users of accounting software consistently show poor reporting to be their greatest source of dissatisfaction. The standard response of the industry is to offer improved means of extracting information such as report writer packages, output to a spreadsheet or, current flavour of the month, by bolting an EIS (or 'executive information system') on the top. However, a number of package designers have realised that, in the end, these solutions lead nowhere because they do not go to the root of the problem. The answer lies in the way the data is organised in the first place. If users are going to achieve fast and effective reporting out of a package, it is because the package has been designed from the ground up, with the proper file structures in place to provide it. Over the last year or two, a number of packages with radically new designs have been coming on to the market, offering superb delivery of management information. It may be some time before they are sufficiently developed to offer all the modules and functionality of established systems, but their arrival surely sounds the death knell for the current generation of market leaders. How should management information be delivered? Most managers manage by exception - that is, they take corrective action when a situation goes out of line. Take, for example, a clothing retailer with 1,200 product lines falling into 15 product groups. The first facts the manager wants to see in his monthly sales report are the total sales figures versus budget for each group. If sales for 11 groups are on target, that's fine: he can now forget about them and concentrate on the task of sorting out the four under-performers. Initially, then, the manager wants to see totals at the beginning of the report, not at the end, and to see them at a high level such as product group rather than individual product. Only if a product group total requires further investigation does he need to 'drill down' and review the sales of the individual products that make up the total to pin-point exactly what went wrong. The obvious advantage of this 'totals first' approach is that the volume of data becomes so much smaller and therefore more manageable. While at the detail level a year's sales at the clothes retailer might comprise 1,200 individual product lines and 50,000 sales transactions, at summary level these could be summarised into 15 product groups each with 12 monthly sales totals - a mere 180 numbers fitting comfortably into a couple of screens. Unfortunately, instead of providing totals first and details second, most package designers are still stuck in the mould of manual reporting systems which give details first, totals last. The format of a typical computer report is exactly the same as a manual daybook - a transaction listing with the oldest transaction shown first and the most recent last, and the report total calculated at the end. Hence, the near universal defect of current accounting packages - that they offer the user little or no high-level summary information and he finds himself having to wade through floods of low level transaction data which simply obscure the wood for the trees. When defining the key features of a 'totals first' system, the first observation to make is that it has to be screen-based, rather than paper-based, with managers browsing through high level totals on screen and printing-off low-level transaction data only when a copy is specifically required. Secondly, the system must offer multiple totals at all levels. So, a manager might start by looking at total sales year-to-date for a product group, then drill down to the total year-to-date sales for each product within that group, then select one product and drill down to show total sales for each individual month. The manager could then select one month and drill down to the individual sales invoices within that month, then select an individual invoice and display it as originally entered on to the system. This is a one-dimensional series of views moving downward from one level to another. But totals must be held multi-dimensionally as well because users also want to view data 'sideways.' The clothing retailer, for example, might want to see total sales for a product group broken down into sales by individual store. In a similarly multi-level, multi-dimensional way, an accountant browsing through his general ledger might wish to see the monthly wages bill broken down by employee type across each of the company's divisions. Finally, and most important, all these monthly totals have to be available instantly. Users of screen-based systems will not be prepared to sit around and wait while the computer trawls through several thousand transaction records and calculates a total. There is only one way to provide instant totals, that is by storing them on-line, having already been calculated in advance. This is the fundamental difference between the new design and the old. Traditional packages comprise a layer of master files beneath which is a layer of transaction files. The new design packages interpose another layer between the two - a multi-level, multi-dimensional layer of on-line totals which are updated whenever a transaction is entered. I have used the term 'drill-down' when describing how these packages work. Unfortunately, virtually all software vendors claim 'drill-down' for their packages these days. By this, they mean the ability to trace associated transactions throughout the files in the manner of a relational database. To denote the quite different idea of zooming down from on-line totals one supplier has coined the phrase 'super drill-down.' It is important to differentiate between the two. Existing accounts packages can be adapted to some extent to provide 'ordinary drill-down.' However, adaptation to provide 'super drill-down' is not possible. The only way a software vendor is going to be in a position to offer 'super drill-down' is by a complete product rewrite. 'Super drill-down' packages are thin on the ground. They are technically difficult to write. In particular, it is difficult to update multiple monthly balances during data entry without slowing down response time. Object-oriented techniques seem to be an essential pre-requisite. The accounts package market: products on offer At the corporate and 'FT Top 500' companies level of the accounts package market are Oracle Financials from Oracle Corporation and Open1 from Financial Solutions. Oracle runs under Unix while Open1 claims 'total flexibility across all leading servers, operating systems and client interfaces.' Prices of each run from Pounds 30,000 upward. A third 'super drill down' supplier to the corporate market is Altair, whose best-known customer is the tour operator, Owners Abroad, running a 60-user RS6000-based system under Unix. At the medium-size company level, Altair also offer Altair Plus, which starts at Pounds 8,000 and competes against such products as Tetra Chameleon, Multisoft Premier and SunAccount. Altair plus runs under Unix and Novell, and a client-server version is due shortly which can be front-ended by a PC running Windows 3.1. At the smaller and medium company level, the admirable Exchequer from SBS Financial Systems competes with Pegasus Senior, Sage Sovereign and Tetra 2000. SBS have recently released Sales and Purchase Order processing for this package, and a full suite of modules, including multi-currency, costs Pounds 3,995. Finally, SBS also offer an entry-level version of Exchequer starting at Pounds 495 which competes with Sage Financial Controller.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- The government's new  economic package designed to provide greater access to the  Japanese market for foreign products will include plans for  continuous income tax cuts and greater expenditures for public  works projects, government sources said Wednesday [23 March].    The sources said the government of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa plans to complete the package by the end of March to  pave the way for resumption of stalled negotiations with the  United States on a new framework for bilateral trade.  Washington strongly demanded income tax cuts on a continuous  basis as part of macroeconomic measures to promote Japanese  imports and slash the country's swollen trade surplus.    The sources said the package will also include a further  increase in outlays for public works projects over the 430  trillion yen called for under the present program. The size of  the increment will be decided by the end of June when the  government will prepare another round of market-opening  measures, the sources said.    They said the government hopes the new package, to be worked  out by the end of this month, will satisfy the U.S. and pave the  way for resumption of trade negotiations between the two  countries. The program will include measures for areas of  principal U.S. interest, such as participation in government  procurement, imports of automobile and auto parts and  deregulation of the insurance industry, the sources said.    Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister in charge of  economic affairs, told a news conference earlier Wednesday that  measures for deregulation in the three priority areas are now  being scrutinized in response to Hosokawa's instruction.    Hayashi warned Japan will take retaliatory action under  rules  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if Washington  imposes sanctions on the country on grounds of unfair trade  practices.</p>

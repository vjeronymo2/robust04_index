			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests will be made monthly, will be cumulative, and will be mandatory to the extent that the Issuing Partnership has legally available funds and sufficient cash for such purposes. The availability of such funds will depend on the Issuing Partnership's receipt of the amounts due under the related Subordinated Debentures. The Issuing Partnerships will have the right to defer distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests for up to 60 months to the extent that the related company defers the interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures. If distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests are deferred for 18 consecutive months, then the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests will have the right to appoint a special representative to enforce the Issuing Partnership's rights under the related Subordinated Debentures and Guaranty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that the interest payments by each company on its Subordinated Debentures will be deductible for federal income tax purposes and that its Issuing Partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Consequently, the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests and the general partners will be deemed to have received partnership distributions, not dividends, from the Issuing Partnerships and will not be entitled to any ``dividend received deduction'' under the Internal Revenue Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Preferred Partnership Interests will be subject to redemption in whole or part on and after a specified date (``Earliest Redemption Date'') at the option of the Issuing Partnership, with the consent of its related company, at a price equal to their stated liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid distributions. The Earliest Redemption Date will be not later than 10 years after the date of issuance. The Preferred Partnership Interests may also be subject to other optional and mandatory redemption provisions. The companies also expect that, upon the occurrence of certain events, each company may also have the right to exchange its Subordinated Debentures for the Preferred Partnership Interests or to otherwise distribute the Subordinated Debentures to the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, as a result of the Subordinated Debentures not being treated as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes or the Issuing Partnership not being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the Issuing Partnership is required by applicable tax laws to withhold or deduct from payments on the Preferred Partnership Interests amounts which would not otherwise be required to be withheld or deducted, the Issuing Partnership may also have the obligation, if the Preferred Partnership Interests are not redeemed or replaced, to ``gross up'' such payments so that the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests will receive the same payment after such withholding or deduction as they would have received if no such withholding or deduction were required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Issuing Partnership, holders of Preferred Partnership Interests will be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Issuing Partnerships available for distribution to its limited partners, before any distribution of assets to the general partner, an amount equal to the stated liquidation preference of the Preferred Partnership Interests plus any accrued and unpaid distributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of the companies proposes to use substantially all of the proceeds of the proposed transactions to lower their after-tax cost of capital and/or improve the quality of their respective capital structures by redeeming or otherwise reacquiring a portion of their outstanding fixed-rate preferred stock and/or Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Preferred Partnership Interests will initially be marketed and sold pursuant to underwriting agreements (``Underwriting Agreements'') to be entered into by each company, its Issuing Partnership, and an underwriter or underwriters to be selected by each company. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreements, each underwriter will purchase the Preferred Partnership Interests directly from the Issuing Partnership and then sell the Preferred Partnership Interests to the public. Each company will pay an underwriting fee of up to 3.50% of the principal amount of its Issuing Partnership's Preferred Partnership Interests to be purchased by such underwriter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on market conditions, tax laws, and the views of the rating agencies, the companies may conclude that they can substantially obtain the benefits of the proposed transactions by directly issuing their Subordinated Debentures in a public offering. In such event, the companies may elect to undertake such public offerings directly without organizing the Issuing Partnerships and causing the issuance of the Preferred Partnership Interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, "vice president of </F> the Democratic Republic of Yemen," by Zaki Shihab; place and  date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Shihab] How can you tip the  military balance in your favor after all the achievements made  by the northern troops on various fronts?    [Al-Jifri] Following the creation of a political balance,  and  after the declaration of the DRY [Democratic Republic of Yemen],  the people's morale was lifted. Before this, they used to think  the regime would continue as it is. However, when the people  realized that this regime is for all citizens and that it is  defending a just cause, and that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  intended to move the battle into their territory, their morale  was lifted, and many of the DRY citizens began to go to the  battlefield. Many of them are now receiving good training and  we will send them to the battlefield in groups. We did not wish  for this, because we are against fighting. However, when we are  forced, we should confront them and our stands must be strong  and clear. We are advocates of unity, but they have forced us  to establish the DRY as a result of their arrogance and  crudeness. I am sure that the sons of the DRY can check this  arrogance.    [Shihab] You have spoken about measures that are being taken  to reinforce your steadfastness. What are the precautionary  measures taken to prevent the northern troops' advance toward  Aden?    [Al-Jifri] The pillars of steadfastness have always been the  same throughout history; the will, men, and capabilities. We  have all this. We have the will to defend what is right, which  gives us greater strength than the other side, even though the  majority is with the other party.    [Shihab] When you say that you will not go back to unity  until a regime which understands unity takes over, do you mean  that there will be no dialogue with the regime in Sanaa?    [Al-Jifri] There is only room for talks with the current  regime in Sanaa on one point; namely, on a cease-fire and on the  withdrawal of its forces to where they came from. However, if  wise people come from Sanaa to stop this madness, our hearts and  minds will be open to them.    [Shihab] Do you believe that it is possible to topple the  regime in Sanaa at the current stage?    [Al-Jifri] I am sure of this, because our people in the  neighboring republic have faith in unity and in modernization.  They have suffered from injustice, and have realized that 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's actions have led to secession, destruction,  and fighting. I do not think that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will  remain in power after this.    [Shihab] Who was convinced of secession from among the  [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] members?    [Al-Jifri] Brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who enjoys  sound experience and clear vision. Other members have continued  to look for other alternatives. [passage omitted]    [Shihab] Are you confident that you will be able to restore  the southern areas that have been occupied?    [Al-Jifri] One hundred percent. We will restore them either  peacefully or by force.</p>

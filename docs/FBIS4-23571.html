			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the FAA General Staff in Luanda on 9 </F> June]    [Text] The causes behind the unfortunate incident which  involved an Angolan Air Force fighter aircraft in Waku Kungo at  1220 on 6 June have been investigated. The conclusion follows:    The aircraft's mission was to carry out actions to support  our land forces on the outskirts of Waku Kungo, a distance of 40  to 50 kms. The aircraft showed a misreading in its course  indicator. This, added to the existence of thick fog in the area  experienced during this time of the year, hindered visual  observation. Thus, the pilot carried out maneuvers taking the  aircraft to the District of Waku Kungo.    Thinking that he was above his specific target, the pilot  carried out the stipulated actions, hitting a school in the  district. As a result of this involuntary incident, we lament  the death of 89 pupils and the destruction of the school.    The General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] deepely  regrets this very serious incident. It would like once again to  present to the bereaved families its deepest condolences and  promises to do everything in its power to minimize the damage  caused.    [Issued] Office of the Chief of the FAA's General Staff,  Luanda, 9 June 1994.    [Signed] Army General Joao Baptista de Matos, chief of the  FAA General Staff.</p>

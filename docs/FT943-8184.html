			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: C&amp;W warrants issued by BZW BZW yesterday issued 25m warrants designed to facilitate an arbitrage between the shares in Cable &amp; Wireless and Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a 57.5 per cent stake. Because of C&amp;W's exposure to Hong Kong, its share price tends not to fully reflect the value of its other activities. These include its 80 per cent stake in Mercury, the number two telephone services supplier in the UK, and telephone franchises in the Caribbean, North America and east Asia. According to BZW, C&amp;W's market capitalisation without HK Telecom is Pounds 0.9m. But it estimates that this non-Hong Kong business is worth a capitalisation of Pounds 3.6bn (USDollars 5.58bn). BZW believes this apparent 75 per cent discount could narrow to a 25 per cent discount. Many investors regularly seek to realise the true value of C&amp;W by buying its shares and taking out short positions in HK Telecom. By so doing they are hoping that C&amp;W shares will outperform those of HK Telecom and therefore make a profit. BZW said its warrants simplify this process and also allow investors who are not able to short HK Telecom shares to do likewise. Trading the difference between the two shares through the warrant will also save on stamp duty, commissions, stock borrowing fees and currency transactions. The warrants, which expire in one year, had an issue price of 105p and were trading at a mid-price of 112p yesterday.</p>

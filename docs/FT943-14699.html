			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies Even good news on inflation is now seen as an excuse to sell the dollar. Yesterday's better than expected data on US wholesale prices were taken to mean that there was even less chance of speedy action from the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. It could be argued that, with few inflationary signs, there is also less need for such action. But currency traders are having a field day given the White House's apparent indifference to what happens to the dollar. Moreover, even if inflation seems under control, worries remain over the yawning US trade deficit. The quickest way to bring the dollar slide to an end would be a cut in German interest rates balanced by a rise in US rates. In their absence, markets seem determined to drive the currency below DM1.50 and Y95. But if the fall continues much below those levels, dollar assets will start to look cheap. Following the recent rally in European bond markets, US Treasuries are yielding three quarters of a percentage point more than German bunds. The spread is probably still not sufficient to tempt international investors to buy US assets, but that point cannot be too far away. Meanwhile, sterling has been caught in the cross-fire. So long as it is merely the innocent bystander, there is little to worry about. The recent depreciation vis-a-vis the D-Mark will enhance industry's competitiveness in its main European export markets, while the earlier appreciation against the dollar should cushion any inflationary impact from higher commodity prices. Policymakers will only have to worry should currency markets start to focus on Britain's trade deficit.</p>

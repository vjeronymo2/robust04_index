			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Banks' action fails to lift dollar: Share and bond prices fall - US Treasury 'prefers' stronger currency Concerted central bank inter-vention failed to lift the dollar yesterday, prompting heavy declines in share and bond prices amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve would be forced to raise short-term interest rates again to defend the US currency. Up to 17 central banks, led by the Fed, bought in excess of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.95bn) three days after the dollar had fallen briefly below Y100, a post-1945 low. The dollar initially rallied on the intervention, climbing to Y101.8 and DM1.61, but then fell back to Y100.9 and DM1.5972 by the London close. It closed in New York at Y100.525 and DM1.584, below the levels at which the central banks first intervened. Confirming the action, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said: 'Our actions today in co-operation with our Group of Seven partners and other monetary authorities reflect a shared concern about recent developments in financial markets.' In a hint that central banks would try again to stabilise the dollar, he added: 'We look forward to continued co-operation to maintain the conditions necessary for sustained economic expansion with low inflation.' After the close of European trading, a senior Treasury official tried to revive confidence with a much stronger statement: 'We intervened today to demonstrate that this administration prefers a stronger dollar. In the context of recent economic developments, it is our view and the G7's, that further appreciation of the mark and yen would be counterproductive for global recovery.' The most that senior Clinton administration officials have previously said is that the US sees 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'. The statement about prefering a stronger dollar, however, came too late in the New York afternoon to influence market sentiment. The view on Wall Street was that the Fed might have to raise the short-term Federal Funds rate, currently 4.25 per cent, at, or before, the next planned meet ing of Fed governors and regional presidents on July 5-6. In London, traders said the central bank action had failed, reinforcing the view that intervention was ineffectual. 'If the best that the central banks can do is shift the dollar by one pfennig, they might as well pack their bags and go home,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe). The failure of the intervention depressed stock and bond markets in Europe and the US. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 62.15 at 3,636.94, having fallen fast enough in early trading to trigger the market's 'circuit breakers' which limit computer program trading. Treasury bond prices also fell sharply, with the benchmark 30-year government bond dropping 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield up to 7.517 per cent. The FT-SE 100 index fell 65.8 points to 2,876.6, a new low for the year. In Germany, the DAX index dropped 16.79 points to 2,005.31 to finish the week with a 2.2 per cent loss overall. Both German bunds and UK gilts fell by around  5/8 of a point yesterday. Yesterday's concerted intervention followed similar action on May 4 and intervention by the Fed in April to try to stem the dollar's decline. Earlier this week, President Bill Clinton, Mr Bentsen and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, attempted to talk the dollar higher by emphasising the strength of the US recovery and the encouraging outlook for inflation.

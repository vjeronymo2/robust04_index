			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: RECYCLING SYSTEM HELPS SORT HOUSEHOLD ITEMS  </P> <P> The Recycling File System can provide an easy way to sort and store recyclable  items -- paper, glass and aluminum -- at home or at the office.  </P> <P> The file consists of three reusable vinyl storage bags hanging from a  17x18x27-inch white PVC rack. The bags easily slide out of the rack so they can  be carried to curbside or a recycling center. One bag is leak resistant; the  other two are mesh. All are washable and come in a choice of white, black,  gray, blue or dark green.  </P> <P> Priced at $69.95, including shipping and handling, the system is available  through the Nature Company stores and catalogue; HOLD-IT stores in San Diego  and Carlsbad. If you can't find them in your area, contact the manufacturer,  Bring Your Own Bag (BYBO), P.O. Box 289, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Calif. 92007;  (800) 334-BYOB.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handy Holders for Heating Tortillas  </P> <P> Just introduced are Tortilla Pockets, round cloth holders that are handy for  heating tortillas in a microwave, or keeping them warm if you heat them the  traditional way, on the stove top or griddle.  </P> <P> The washable pockets, 9 1/2 inches in diameter, also can be used for rolls and  pita bread. One pocket holds up to a dozen corn or flour tortillas, or six  rolls or pita breads.  </P> <P> Developed by Kitchen Gear &amp; More in Visalia, Tortilla Pockets come in white  muslin with red, yellow, blue or green trim, or in eight floral prints in  cotton/polyester.  </P> <P> The holders are available, for $6.99, in most Friedman's Microwave Ovens stores  in Northern, Central and Southern California. Locally, you can find them at  Friedman's in Pasadena, Orange and Long Beach. Or you can order them from  Kitchen Gear &amp; More, P.O. Box 1943, Visalia, Calif. 93279; (209) 732-8281.  They're $6.99, including shipping and handling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Auto Sleeve Puts Beverages on the Go  </P> <P> Tired of trying to balance your coffee cup on the car seat while driving?  Consider Mobile Mate, a new beverage holder for autos and trucks. It's suitable  for cups, cans and bottles, even big 32-ounce containers.  </P> <P> If you have a car with a 5-inch armrest, the Mobile Mate sleeve -- with a 3  5/8-inch cup holder -- will fit snugly over it. If your car's armrests are  narrower, the unit comes with foam fillers so the sleeve will fit properly.  </P> <P> For cars without armrests, the Texas developer of Mobile Mate manufactures a  plastic adapter that the sleeve slips over. The holder is made of  Velour-covered foam and comes in burgundy, blue, gray, tan or black. It is not  adaptable for cars with bucket seats.  </P> <P> The standard Mobile Mate costs $10.95, plus $2.50 shipping and handling. With  the adapter unit, it's $13.95, plus $2.50 shipping and handling. To order,  contact Mobile Mate Inc., 628 Franklin St., DeSoto, Tex. 75115; (800) 421-3106.  </P></p>

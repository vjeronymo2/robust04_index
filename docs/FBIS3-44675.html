			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said here today that China attaches great importance to its  relations with Azerbaijan and is looking forward to a visit to  China by Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev.    "The exchange of visits by high-level officials will surely  promote the development of our bilateral ties," Li told visiting  Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and his party here  this afternoon.    In response, Gasanov said his country gives priority to its  ties with China and that President Aliyev is keen to visit China.    China and Azerbaijan are both Asian countries and the  friendly contacts between the two peoples date back to the "silk  road" period of 2000 years ago, Li noted.    Recalling his visit to Azerbaijan some 40 years ago, Li said  his memory of that visit is as fresh as ever, and the Baku  oilfield is well known among the Chinese people.    Li noted that the Chinese government gave Azerbaijan prompt  recognition after it gained independence, and the two countries  soon established ambassadorial-level diplomatic ties.    "For the past two years our bilateral relations have marked  steady and healthy development. I am satisfied with that," the  Chinese premier said.    During the meeting Gasanov conveyed to Li the regards from  President Aliyev to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other  Chinese leaders.    The current Azerbaijan-China ties are good, Gasanov said,  adding that his country is willing to co-operate with China in  every field.    He also expressed his admiration for the progress China has  made through reforms while maintaining its stability.</p>

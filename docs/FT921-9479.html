			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: Big business versus creativity - Television The opening of the winter Olympics, so clearly devised for television, was a collectors' item worthy of recording on tape and storing alongside those early editions of the Eurovision Song Contest in which Norway used to get 'Nul pointes'. Somebody had clearly decided that since the whole thing was, metaphorically speaking, a big pantomime, it might as well be literally that. So each team was led into the stadium by a girl fitted from neck to knees with a huge plastic fishbowl full of swansdown (we know it was swansdown because David Coleman told us so) which she flicked about with her hands to create the effect of a snowstorm toy. Then the teams were greeted by the Broker's Men - actually a man speaking French and a woman speaking, er, English - with rhyming couplets: 'From Latin America signor, signorina/Please welcome the athletes from Argentina'. The shade of McGonagall must have been squirming in pleasure. 'With a startling speed they cover the miles/The team from the Dutch West Indian isles'. Jets performed aerobatics, massed roller skaters swayed to Beethoven's Ninth, and the French president looked appropriately sheepish, probably digesting the French version of 'In summer and winter it's coastal and hilly/So welcome the team that's come here from Chile'. ***** Since it was used for the title, the phrase The Lost Language Of Cranes was presumably centrally important to BBC2's Sunday night drama. Did every viewer except me understand the significance? Who was the small boy who copied the movement of the cranes outside the high rise flats? Given that his behaviour was being studied by a social worker, was he supposed to have behaved like Lorenz's geese and modelled himself on the first thing he saw after birth? If so, what had this to do with homosexuality? Were we supposed to think that young Philip became a homosexual because he modelled himself on his homosexual father? Or what? I think we should have been told. Ironic that, in a drama where virtually everyone in sight was a male homosexual, the best acting came from Eileen Atkins, playing the heterosexual Rose. ***** For any viewer who is not entirely cynical about television, and who values high quality programmes, the 'resignation' of David Plowright from Granada is an ominous if not entirely surprising event. His enforced departure is the clearest sign yet that we are indeed going to be subjected to that downward-swirling vortex which some of us predicted when the asinine Thatcherite plans for broadcasting were first mooted. Those plans are now putting the accountants on top. Television is, of course, big business and needs accountants, but it is also a creative industry and once the Plowrights are driven out the prospects for any more Bridesheads, any more Worlds In Action, look pretty thin. Writing in the FT in October, Samuel Brittan, who served on the Peacock Committee, said: 'There is indeed scope in a civilised society for the provision of programmes in the arts, sciences, humanities, news, documentaries, and many other fields which cannot pay their way either by advertising or by subscription. Bodies such as BBC2 and Channel 4 exist for this very purpose; and Peacock proposed a much broader Arts Council of the Air. There is nothing, however, to support a grey in-between mess in which the BBC feels it has to compete in the mass market for pulp, while commercial entrepreneurs have to go through the motions of providing a due ration of what the regulators would regard as quality.' It can be argued, on the contrary, that there is everything in 46 years of the BBC/ITV duopoly to support the brilliant in-between mass, achieved more by guess than by god, which offered British viewers such a richly varied diet. That richness and variety resulted largely from ITV's efforts to win some of the BBC's kudos by making public service programmes, and the BBC's efforts to win some of ITV's popularity by creating more appealing comedies, drama series, and journalism. The system was not broke and did not need fixing, it was producing some of the most enjoyable (and, according to market research, most enjoyed) television in the world. It was envied the world over. Yet doctrinaire political thinking and hostility to television journalism in the last Thatcher administration ensured that the industry was well and truly fixed. Future historians may well conclude that one of Britain's more successful undertakings in the latter part of the 20th century was ruined for malicious reasons, and the departure of David Plowright may be seen as the beginning of the end. ***** Television is not a medium in which the use of language very often strikes you as expressive, and the odd thing is that on the rare occasion when it does, the programme almost always seems to be a comedy. Les Dawson on one of his higher flights of fancy can be both hilarious and linguistically rich, and the best examples currently available are in BBC2's repeats of Victoria Wood As Seen On TV. Her monologue for Patricia Routledge last week was so splendid that you needed to hold your breath and contain your laughter in order not to miss anything: 'I was in that mood when you eat dry Weetabix and watch the Open University . . . I'd left me cue-lottes on the Underground and it was apprentice day at the bikini waxers . . . I still can't polka without wincing but we're spunky in Cheadle, we totter on . . .' The only television regulars who can match Wood in this area of genteel suburban pretensions are Barry Humphries in his Dame Edna persona and Alan Bennett. It is doubtless not sheer coincidence that Bennett has used Routledge to deliver some of his best lines. She is so good at it. Talking of language on television, when did you last hear the word 'philippic' on the box? It cropped up in an unusually quirky and enjoyable item from David Sells on Newsnight last week. He took a train from Moscow to Kiev, crossing one of the new frontiers, and his piece reminded you of the great days of reporting by people such as James Cameron and Rene Cutforth. You suddenly realised what the 'Birtian revolution' is denying us. ***** Isn't Michael Gambon wonderful? Well, yes, he is a rather impressive actor. A better Maigret than Rupert Davies? Surprisingly similar, really, given the 32 years between their series. Doesn't Budapest stand in amazingly well for 1950s Paris? Amazingly. And wasn't it funny seeing James Cellan Jones taking off his producer/director hat to play the waiter and even giving himself a line? Terribly droll. Just like Hitchcock. You say he took off his hat but did he take off those sandals that he's always worn, even when he was head of plays at the BBC? You couldn't see his feet. At least you must admit there were no steam trains in this episode. True, but there were moments when you thought 'Oh dear, there's that spotless vintage motor again'. Why are you so grudging about this new ITV series, isn't it precisely what British television does so well, and just the thing for Sunday nights? Certainly it's awfully well done, but if you polled the viewers on what television drama needed most do you think they would say 'Another detective series, please, preferably period'? Does that mean you think it will get poor ratings? No, but the law of diminishing returns must set in eventually. We already have Spender, Taggart, Miss Marple, Poirot, Morse, Van der Valk, and more. There must be a limit. Mustn't there? Surely . . . ***** We can hardly begrudge Dan Maskell his retirement, after all he is 83, will be 84 in April, and in 43 years (he began his commentaries on radio in 1949) has never missed a day at Wimbledon. And yet, for fans of televised tennis, the prospect of getting through this year's Wimbledon without him is dreadful. He is still the best tennis commentator, being clear, calm though enthusiastic, urbane, and extraordinarily knowledgeable. It is difficult to think of any other sport with a commentator as good. He promises he will be at Wimbledon this year as a spectator; couldn't the BBC persuade him to pop into the commentary box occasionally, just for six or seven hours a day, say?</p>

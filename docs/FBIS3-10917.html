			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    During the Chiriqui province chapter of CADE [Annual  Conference of Business Executives] '94, held at the Bambito  Hotel, presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles (for the  National Renewal Movement, Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement, and Civic Renewal Party that comprise the Change '94  alliance) announced that he wants to establish a commission to  promote investments and jobs, "so that local and foreign  investors will not be lost like someone in the woods who doesn't  know where to go." Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate  for the Solidarity Party and the National Unity Mission that  comprise the National Consensus Alliance, promised he would  lower taxes on agricultural supplies to lower production costs.  "We would do this also by supporting and promoting the  appropriate producer organizations by giving them training and  orientation, as well as any technical and financial support they  may need." Christian Democratic Party presidential candidate  Eduardo Vallarino said: "Not being prepared for economic  aperture means certain death for the small production that still  exists in primary and secondary sectors." Ernesto Perez  Balladares, presidential candidate for the Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD), Labor Party, and the Liberal  Republican Party that comprise the United People alliance,  announced that he would create "irrigation provinces [provincias  de riego]." "Another element would be the development of  business organizations." The candidates concurred on the need  to decentralize public administration to expedite the autonomous  development of provinces, to protect national production,  improve the country's road infrastructure to and from Bocas del  Toro and Chiriqui, and upgrade ports on the Atlantic and Pacific  coasts. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT  28 February 94)    Four presidential candidates -- Jose Salvador Munoz, of the  Doctrinaire Panamenist Party; Eduardo Vallarino; Ernesto Perez  Balladares, and Ruben Carles -- have said that the Panamanian  Banking Center is solid and efficient, while acknowledging that  it must undergo some reforms to consolidate its prestige at the  national and international level. The candidates conveyed this  position on 8 March at a meeting organized by the National  Banking Association. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 March  94 p 1A)    The Change '94 presidential slate presented unveiled its  platform at a 3 March news conference. The plan "will promote  the creation of more and better jobs in different sectors and  improve the quality of current jobs, emphasizing different  training and job education programs. It will maintain the  13-month bonus and continue paying workers their second  allotment of the 13-month bonus," Carles said. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94)    A report detailing Carles' position on corruption  highlighted  the following points: As a result of the corruption that  prevailed during the military dictatorship, the Panamanian state  ended up "in the service of organized crime both inside and  outside the country, particularly in drug trafficking and money  laundering." Carles notes that this is why "the eradication of  corruption will be a slow, difficult, and complex task, but a  task that must be tackled." He added: "Public spending and the  use of state property must be strictly and fiscally controlled."  (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 March 94 p 10A)    Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] presidential candidate Ruben  Blades has said that now that the political campaign has gotten  under way "the people will really have choices." In response  to a reporter's question that his campaign seems to be  faltering, Blades noted that his is a "new group, and we lack  the economic means others have in the country's politics. Also  our group has been organizing as we grow." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 2 March 94)    Ruben Blades has said that newsmen will not accompany him on  his campaign visits because they work for news media "controlled  by" political and economic "interests." (Panama City LA PRENSA  in Spanish 7 March 94 p2)    Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the  Arnulfist Party, Authentic Liberal Party, Liberal Party, and the  Independent Democratic Union that comprise the Democratic  Alliance, has said that in line with her party's principles, she  will not participate in public debates. She also indicated it  is too late now to set up runoffs. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94)    On 8 March, Gruber came out in favor of a new law on the  banking system that would check money laundering. Regarding the  U.S. military bases in Panama, she noted that it is the people  of Panama who, through a plebiscite, must decide whether the  bases should stay or go. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in  Spanish 9 March 94 p 1A)    The Arnulfist Party announced at a news conference that it  is  ready for the 8 May elections. The party already has more than  10,000 party members to represent the party at voting tables  throughout the country. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 7 March 94)    Galindo has unveiled a plan to decentralize the executive  branch, giving ministries and autonomous and semiautonomous  entities the authority to implement their own plans and  projects. His plan calls for the creation of public security,  tourism, transportation, communications, environment, and  finance ministries, as well as a national secretariat attached  to the Presidency. "We will get nowhere so long as we continue  to not have a modern and agile government that facilitates  investment by local and foreign citizens." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 February 94)    The National Consensus Alliance candidate has proposed the  creation of a deputy minister's office to handle drug  prevention, penalties, and rehabilitation. Galindo said that  ethics standards in Panamanian banking must be reviewed "to see  if they should be expanded or if the government may take direct  legal action to prevent" money laundering. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 3 March 94)    Perez Balladares has reaffirmed the Torrijist doctrine  during  a visit Las Palmas District, Veraguas Province. In the company  of local leaders, the candidate listened to peasants, farmers,  and Indian representatives discuss their problems. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 February 94)    The United People alliance candidate has said that  Panamanian  society "faces an economic and moral crisis" that seriously  threatens peaceful coexistence. This situation is all the more  dramatic because in six years the country will assume control  over the Panama Canal, Perez added. He also decried the  government's failure to ease the problems of poverty and  unemployment. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 March  94 p 10a)    Perez Balladares has said that the PRD's government platform  is gaining increasing acceptance among the Panamanian people.  Polls continue to show him leading in voter approval ratings.  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7  March 94)</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aslan Abashidze by Yelena Imedashvili; place </F> and date not given: "In Batumi Everything Is Serene, It Is Warm  There..."]    [Text] Ajaria is the sole corner of present-day  Georgia not desecrated by civil war. This is undoubtedly to the  credit of Ajar leader Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme  Council of the autonomous republic. It appears that "Big  Granddaddy," as Abashidze is called among his own people, is  distinguished by a rare capacity for avoiding predetermined  conflicts and shunning dangerous alliances and burdensome  obligations. It is said that he knows how to make money and  loves Ajaria, Russia, and his grandson. In addition, he knows  how to "keep up his reputation." There are not that many  meetings between the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ajaria  and the head of the Georgian state, and they have all been held  either on neutral territory or in Ajaria.    [Imedashvili] Mr. Abashidze, when were you last in Tbilisi?    [Abashidze] I have not been to Tbilisi since October 1990. I  consider the situation in the country to be very unstable, and a  visit by me could be used to inflame the atmosphere. These  cannot be called apprehensions, I simply avoid needless  complications....    [Imedashvili] According to the information of sociological  polls, inhabitants of Georgia most often cite you as a possible  successor to Shevardnadze. You are also spoken of as the most  realistic candidate for the office of prime minister of the  country.    [Abashidze] It is not a new topic, but I believe that at  this  time I am needed by Georgia here more than in the office of  prime minister. As far as the results of sociological surveys  are concerned... We do not publish them in our newspapers. I am  skeptical toward this information; a poll of some 1,000 persons  is not serious. I personally know approximately what percentage  of the population supports me in this part of Georgia or in  another and, of course, in Ajaria.    [Imedashvili] How many in Ajaria?    [Abashidze] We know that the Ajar leadership has total  support.    [Imedashvili] There are stories to the effect that Ajaria  has  peacefully achieved full independence from Tbilisi, which  Abkhazia and South Ossetia have not managed. How true is this?    [Abashidze] As truthful as stories usually are. We sought  nothing, and it cannot be said that we had some special program  in this connection. As far as I am concerned, I have always,  wherever I have worked, defended the interests of my department.  I believe that everyone should defend his home, street,  neighborhood, city.    The legislative base that we used to have accorded the  regions quite extensive rights--we have not taken advantage of  even half of them. It is always the case that we say one thing,  think another, and do something else. The main problem in the  relations between the center and the regions today is not  legislation, the problem is the government bureaucrat, who sits  on a bench in Tbilisi and considers himself the sole arbiter of  fate. It may be said that it was this that brought about what  has happened in Georgia.    Ajaria is not threatened by the fate of Abkhazia or the  Tskhinvali region, our republic is populated by ethnic  Georgians. But the opposition of the center and the regions,  which exists at administrative officer level, could, of course,  lead to cataclysms because there is always the danger of the  accession to power of people who are totally uninhibited.    [Imedashvili] You are satisfied with your relations with  Tbilisi?    [Abashidze] I cannot speak of a complete idyll here. It  happens that some leader from Tbilisi will impede some decision  or other, and jealousy is sensed at times. When a little man  sits at a big table, it is always fraught with unpleasantness.    [Imedashvili] Your view of the future territorial  arrangement  of Georgia?    [Abashidze] The rayons and oblasts of Georgia took shape  over  many centuries. Territorially and ethnically, this is certain,  there is nothing that could be changed--there would be fighting  for each square meter. We are left merely with the question of  imparting to this reality a reasonable form and of precisely  delineating what pertains to the jurisdiction of the federal  authorities, and what to the regional authorities. And under no  circumstances can the nationality issue--Ossetian or Abkhaz--be  substituted for this problem.    [Imedashvili] You are the leader of the "For the Revival of  Ajaria" movement, and its motto is: "A wealthy individual means  a wealthy state." Are you a wealthy individual?    [Abashidze] The richest people, as we all know, live in  Georgia; everyone is a millionaire in Georgia (laughs). No, I am  not avoiding an answer. Economically, our family lives well;  there are no problems. The Abashidzes are not by nature  squanderers but accumulators. I have worked my whole life and  held quite high office and I was left a substantial  inheritance--my grandfather was a notable individual--even in  spite of the expropriation of 1937. Incidentally, the princely  Abashidze family ruled Ajaria from 1462 through the end of the  19th Century.    [Imedashvili] And as regards the "wealthy state?"    [Abashidze] Just as throughout Georgia, the same problems:  inflation, low living standard, decline in production. We are  trying to the best of our ability to get the work of the  enterprises back to normal and to help the population with  social benefits. In general, I feel sorry for today's Georgia.  It was created in order to be a prosperous country. Had we  immediately created a free economic zone in Ajaria, Georgia  would now be unrecognizable, but certain forces do not want  this--to the detriment of the entire country. This is beyond any  logic, but there are always some people who are afraid of new  things and who are protesting even the building of a pedestrian  subway.    I have seen films about the old Hong Kong before the  creation  of a free economic zone there. Compared with that Hong Kong,  Batumi is Paris. And had there been free economic zones in  Batumi, Poti, Sukhumi, things might not have reached the point  of explosion. When people live well, many problems are removed.  When they live badly, there are always political forces that  take advantage of this to assert themselves.    [Imedashvili] Georgia is integrating in several alliances,  among which are CIS and Black Sea economic cooperation. Which of  them is most promising, in your view?    [Abashidze] Friendship is an unparalleled value. We,  figuratively speaking, went a-hunting and all went separately.  Some people are the hunters, some, the prey. Georgia has fewer  chances of procuring rich spoils than others, and for this  reason we need to proceed together, having united on a new  basis, on a platform of sincerity. Sincerity, sincerity, and yet  again sincerity--this is my principle in all things. We need  first and foremost good relations with Russia. We are  interrelated and urgently need one another. Making friends with  Russia does not mean falling out with the rest. On the contrary,  stable relations with it will help us to more quickly begin  cooperation with other countries.    [Imedashvili] Is sincerity typical of your relations with  Shevardnadze?    [Abashidze] I have never concealed anything, I speak openly,  harshly at times, too emotionally at times. There are words that  I would not use at a grand forum, but I always say everything  one on one. This is my main weapon. Life is easier if you don't  harbor grudges. And you have more friends also. Don't they say  that everyone strives for the pure spring?    [Imedashvili] What do you do, aside from work?    [Abashidze] Now, only work. This is my sole hobby. I have,  in  addition, a grandson, we are great friends. It is said that I  have the capabilities of an artist, but I have no time for  drawing. Life has been such that I have been unable to take  advantage of what I was given from above.    [Imedashvili] What have you managed to get done in the time  that you have been leader of Ajaria?    [Abashidze] We do not have hundreds of thousands of refugees  or tens of thousands of people killed, disgraced, and destitute.  We have preserved peace at home, we have not made a single  mistake here. We have no nationality problem, no Abkhaz living  in Ajaria has taken part in the interethnic conflict. What have  I not achieved? I have not managed to school many officials in  executive discipline. They cannot work at full stretch, they  cannot learn to work in a team, everyone wants to be a soloist.  Perhaps this is an ailment of people of the Caucasus,  hot-blooded people....</p>

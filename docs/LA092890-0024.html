			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO SURVIVES SLOW START  </P> <P> After a sluggish first half, El Toro showed why it is Orange County's  top-ranked high school football team, cruising to a 39-7 win over Santa Monica  Thursday night at Mission Viejo High School.  </P> <P> El Toro's defense limited Santa Monica to 96 yards in the first half.  </P> <P> But the Chargers held only a 14-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "Who was sluggish in the first half, Santa Monica's offense?" El Toro Coach Bob  Johnson asked.  </P> <P> In its three previous victories, El Toro outscored its opponents, 116-6. El  Toro needed two big plays to score early against Santa Monica.  </P> <P> El Toro scored on its first possession when quarterback Rob Johnson found  Darren Doalson on a slant pattern for a 40-yard touchdown pass. Johnson  completed 19 of 25 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> El Toro scored its other first-half touchdown after the Vikings' Rashon Ivy  fumbled a punt return at the Santa Monica 25-yard line. Jason Rojas scored on  the next play with a run up the middle.  </P> <P> Santa Monica (1-1-1) made a threat early in the second half after defensive  back Jim Ramming recovered a fumble by Doalson, who had caught a Johnson pass  in the flat. Ramming ran the ball back to the El Toro 11, and one play later,  Demarco Scott scored on a six-yard run.  </P> <P> "That's high school football," Johnson said. "Plays like that fumble happen;  maybe that's what gives me gray hairs."  </P> <P> After the turnover, the Chargers' offense kicked it in gear, scoring on its  next four possessions.  </P> <P> Running back Bret Sanders, who had 79 yards in 13 carries, scored on runs of  four and one yards.  </P></p>

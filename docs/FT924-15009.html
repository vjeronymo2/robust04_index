			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Baker joins rebel ranks MR KENNETH BAKER form-ally joined the ranks of the Tory backbench rebels yesterday, making clear that, without significant changes to the text of the Maastricht treaty, he would not support government efforts to ratify it. But he was challenged by Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as home secretary, over whether or not he opposed Britain's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism two years ago. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Clarke asserted that 'in the end' only Baroness Thatcher and Lord Ridley were against entry. 'If any of the others were against it, they fooled me,' he said. In Mr Baker's words, however: 'I argued against it and against going in at DM2.95. I lost, but I was assured that there would be flexibility.' Britain was 'well out of' the European exchange rate mechanism, he argued later, saying the government must choose between floating exchange rates and a single currency, and that he would prefer the first of these options. Leading a number of leading Euro-sceptics on the conference fringe yesterday, Mr Baker outlined his reservations to Maastricht on subsidiarity, Commission powers and border controls, telling his packed audience he saw little prospect of amendments being adopted that would enable him to support ratification. 'It seems unlikely to me that these conditions on these three matters . . will be met,' he said. 'I don't believe that they can be fulfilled.' Questioned later, he said that if there were no changes, 'then I will not support the treaty'. Clearly relishing life outside the cabinet, Mr Baker called for European commissioners to be replaced by heads of department 'rather like the permanent secretaries of our own ministries'. These would simply execute decisions taken by the council of ministers and would not have 'their own political agendas'. On the domestic economy, he called for an immediate 1 point cut in interest rates 'with a target of 6 per cent within a matter of months.' He predicted: 'Even after interest rate cuts, inflation in Britain next spring could be below 3 per cent.' Elsewhere, Lord Tebbit characterised the Maastricht treaty as 'a timebomb' threatening to 'destroy utterly' what the Community's founding fathers set out to create. Speaking before his galvanic address to conference, he said that if there was not a UK referendum, voters would believe the democratic system did not work - and 'that is the language of the National Front'. Mr John Biffen, another former cabinet minister, predicted: 'The fight you have seen taking place in this conference will go on and on and on,' claiming that Euro-scepticism was 'no longer the gift of a handful of rather romantic Tory MPs'. Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, was on the rampage, claiming there would be no point in voting at the next general election if Maastricht were ratified. 'Our liberty is almost gone, this would be the end,' he said, also calling for a referendum on the treaty. '(The people's) advice and approval is needed before we sign.'</p>

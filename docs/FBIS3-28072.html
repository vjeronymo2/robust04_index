			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- American evangelist  Billy Graham said Thursday that a secret message from North  Korean leader Kim Il-song will reach U.S. President Bill  Clinton on Friday. Graham, fresh from a visit to Pyongyang from  Jan. 27 to Feb. 1, said the message was being delivered to  Clinton by a church associate at a press conference in Hong Kong.    The evangelist said he sent the associate to Washington  ahead  of him so that Clinton can receive the message by Friday,  showing the urgency he attached to Kim's message. Graham said  it was in reply to an oral message from Clinton which he had  passed on to North Korea's paramount leader, but declined to say  whether Kim's was oral or in writing. The renowned preacher  said he spent more than three hours with Kim and talked about  issues ranging from religion to politics, hinting that Clinton  had touched on the North Korean nuclear issue in his oral  message. He did not, however, elaborate on the content of the  messages, nor that of his talks with Kim. He said he had  discussed his planned visit to the Stalinist country earlier  with Clinton, who strongly backed the idea.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: The new age of uncertainty - Serious Money WE are living in uncertain times in which the expected does not happen and the unexpected does. The recovery, which everyone hopes to meet around the next corner, remains as elusive as ever. The stock market, even putting fears of a Labour government behind it, dropped to almost its pre-election level this week. Investors who thought they would be spoiled for choice, because of the number of new issues coming to the market, are finding their indecision being taken care of for them. First, GPA, an aircraft leasing company, cancelled its Pounds 3.5bn flotation just days before it was to go on to the market. Then, the share issue by the Daily Telegraph ended in ignominy when only 3m of the 13m shares available to the public was taken up. 3i and Del Monte have postponed their flotations. The bitter vagaries of the stock market are illustrated only too well this week in our own stock market round-up of leaders and laggards. Ailing Midland bank has become the market leader, while Wellcome, the successful drugs company and leader one year ago, is now a laggard. 'We go into work every day, wondering where the next shock will be coming from,' confided one fund manager this week. With the experts worried, it is hardly surprising that consumers are keeping their heads down. A report this week from Mintel, the market research organisation, examined whether consumer confidence, supposed to rise in the wake of the general election, has returned. It found that although people are optimistic about the long term, they are uncertain and cautious for the present. After the spending spree of the 1980s, the level of indebtedness has risen; with real interest rates still high, people have learnt the lessons of easy borrowing the hard way. The survey found that just under 60 per cent felt that borrowing for anything other than a house should be avoided and almost two-thirds said they would not use a credit card to buy goods. Surprisingly, more than half the 15-to-19-year-olds, whom one would have expected to be carefree, also concurred. The reluctance to borrow shows that a consumer-led recovery is a long way off, said the report. This conclusion was further strengthened with the release of figures from the Central Statistical Office showing that savings by consumers are at a 10-year high. Real personal disposable income is up but people are choosing to save the increment rather than spend it. Of course, if you have enough money to spend and save, it is a good time to do both. Inflation at around 4 per cent is low while interest rates at 10 per cent are high. For the same reasons, it is a bad time for borrowers. Those who are in debt, although under less pressure than a few years ago, when interest rates were 15 per cent, will be better off spending their money on reducing their level of indebtedness and the amount of interest they have to pay. Where should investors be keeping their money? The big debate is between equities as a long-term investment, and money on deposit or fixed rate instruments such as gilts, which are offering attractive yields. There are two points to consider in any investment - the level of return and the security of capital. The volatility of the stock market in an uncertain economic climate is not good for frayed nerves and private investors appear to be turning more in favour of security than dreams of capital gain. The Mintel survey found that more than two-thirds of respondents wanted to put money into a 'rainy day' savings account. Safe products, such as Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts and National Savings, have reported a buoyant inflow of funds. Some Pounds 10bn has been put into Tessas since their introduction last year, with Pounds 3bn of this deposited in the first three months of the year. National Savings contributed Pounds 552m to the Exchequer during May, the fourth best month on record, increasing the total to Pounds 40.8bn. The launch of a new fixed rate product later this month will increase this intake still further. But it would be a mistake to eschew equities altogether. The argument that equities will not outperform as they did in the 1980s, because Exchange Rate Mechanism discipline means we are entering a low inflation era, is sound enough. But the rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danes last month was an another surprise that served to increase uncertainties about the fate of the ERM. There is still investor interest in collective funds, such as unit and investment trusts, which lessen the risk of equity investment by diversifying into numerous holdings. More than half the people surveyed by Mintel said they would consider this sort of long-term investment, while the Unit Trust Association reported an all-time high of Pounds 60bn in funds under management last month. Although the crystal ball is looking very cloudy at the moment, the basic rules of investment hold good now as much as ever before. Hold on to safe products such as Tessas and National Savings by all means; but, since the unexpected can happen, it is as well to spread some investment into equities in case the stock market does take off later in the decade.</p>

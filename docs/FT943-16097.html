			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Cracks merely papered over: Deborah Hargreaves says pulp price rises come at a difficult time for the industry Writing a letter is about to become a more expensive pastime; so too might reading glossy magazines or books. The cost of paper is rising steeply. In Britain, prices have risen so rapidly that printers and publishers complained earlier this year to the Office of Fair Trading that paper makers were operating a cartel. But for the paper companies, the response has generally been 'if only that were true'. They argue they are only passing on the sharp increases in the cost of their raw material - wood pulp. After five years of falling prices, pulp manufacturers had by this year cut back output. An unexpected pick-up in demand has therefore led to price rises of up to 50 per cent since January. To a large extent, the pulp market is following the pattern of other commodities, such as coffee and copper, which have risen in price as the world's economies have emerged from recession. North American producers recently announced their fourth rise in pulp prices this year, due to take effect later this month or in August. By that time, the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp - used as the benchmark in the industry - will have risen from Dollars 390 a tonne last year to Dollars 620 (Pounds 408). Paper producers are passing on these increases to their customers - printers and publishers - with varying success. They have been most successful in the market for high-quality paper. Prices for the highest grades of paper have been marked up by 20 per cent since the beginning of the year. In the newsprint market, many paper manufacturers have stopped discounting prices they charge newspaper publishers. 'The moment we have the opportunity, prices will inevitably go up,' says Mr Andre Van Hattum, chairman of Bridgewater Paper, one of the UK's largest newsprint manufacturers. But media moguls such as Mr Conrad Black, publisher of The Daily Telegraph, who is engaged in a price-cutting war with other newspapers, will be anxious to resist further increases when annual supply contracts are renegotiated towards the end of the year. That raises the question of which sector will suffer the biggest squeeze on profits - pulp producers, paper manufacturers or printing? If paper mills and pulp producers are unable to pass on the rising cost of raw materials, their already low margins will fall further. Many have been operating at a loss for the past three to five years. Mr Ronald Oberlander, president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, says his company has not made a profit for four years, and during that time has lost CDollars 460m (Pounds 218m). He estimates his return on capital employed has averaged less than 3 per cent over the past 10 years - a figure regarded as typical in the industry. But there are signs the tide may be turning, and Mr Oberlander says he is confident that the industry is heading for a period of improved financial performance. His optimism is based on the assumption that manufacturers will be able to continue pushing up prices. Certainly paper makers are able to argue increases are justified: in the past five years, during the worst recession the industry has suffered, prices fell sharply and have not yet returned to previous peak levels. Newsprint prices, for instance, dropped last year to their lowest point in real terms since records began in 1924 and so far have returned only to 1990 levels. Nevertheless, paper manufacturers are still being squeezed, as the prices they charge paper users are not yet rising as fast as their raw material costs. Pulp prices are being driven upwards by supply shortages caused by three main factors: The steep fall in prices pulp manufacturers were willing to pay over the past few years has meant many lumber farmers in Nordic countries, which account for about 17 per cent of the world pulp market, decided not to harvest their trees last year. The collapse of the former Soviet Union - one of the largest producers of high-quality birch pulp - has disrupted supplies to the large pulp manufacturers in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Many pulp makers in countries around the world have shut down operations, temporarily or permanently, as prices declined to below their costs of production. In large part, the crisis in the industry has been exacerbated by the pulp producers themselves, which had previously built up capacity to such an extent they were forced into cut-throat competition to hold on to markets. Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman of KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, describes the overcapacity as a 'home-made mess'. That overcapacity has now been reversed, thanks to a rise in paper consumption. Mr Roger Digney, marketing director at UK Paper, Britain's biggest supplier of high-quality printing papers, says: 'The huge growth in orders has been quite uncanny and it seemed to hit the whole of western Europe simultaneously.' Paper and pulp manufacturers appear to have been caught out by the strength of world economic recovery and the growth of the paper market. At the same time, strong growth in Asian paper markets has boosted Japanese paper mills, which in turn have bought more European pulp. The industry also appeared to have assumed the problems of excess supply would remain for some years. When the pulp industry was dogged by overcapacity, paper mills and printers became used to ordering raw materials for instant delivery. As a consequence, they ran down their stocks. Now paper mills are finding it hard to offer quick deliveries. 'We're finding it extremely difficult to buy the amount of pulp we need to keep our machines going,' says Mr Digney. In spite of the recent rise in prices, he says some smaller paper mills have shut through lack of supplies. There has been a knock-on effect on pulp makers, which are eating into their own inventories of timber as they rush to meet world demand. It is estimated the world stock of pulp will last 22 days at current consumption rates - down from 35 days' supply last year. Mr John Bingham, at the London office of consultancy Hawkins Wright, which advises the forest products industry, says most pulp makers have full order books for the next three months. The capacity utilisation rate - the proportion of the industry's production facilities in use - among the industry's largest and most efficient producers has risen to 92 per cent from about 80 per cent last year. Another factor is adding uncertainty to an already over-heated market. There is the threat of a strike by British Columbian pulp mill workers, who recently rejected management attempts to introduce mill-by-mill wage bargaining. The possibility of disrupted pulp supplies from one of the largest markets has encouraged the build-up of supplies. The danger the pulp and paper manufacturers now face is that the cycle of chronic overcapacity followed by a rapid fall in prices will be repeated, if the supply of pulp now grows too rapidly. 'Pulp makers can't expect to keep pumping it out at this rate indefinitely,' says Mr Bingham. Mr Oberlander argues pulp and paper manufacturers are their own worst enemies. 'If history has judged this industry harshly, it's because of our inability to manage the periods of prosperity and our inability during these periods to spend money wisely,' he says. Unless manufacturers are able to predict with greater accuracy the future patterns of demand, they may find that users of their products - the printers and publishers - will retain the upper hand in price negotiations. Mr Oberlander calls for a more co-operative approach among pulp and paper producers to deal with issues that go beyond short-term competitive pressures. They need to address such long-term subjects as the competition from multimedia and environmental issues, he says. But as one paper producer comments: 'In a business where the margins are virtually nil, what can you do but concentrate on immediate market prices?'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Graphic paper production*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual                          1993                       1994 % change        Q2    GDP     Q3    GDP     Q4    GDP     Q1    GDP  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany        0.4  -2.46    0.9  -1.09    5.9  -0.79    8.9   1.57 France        -4.1  -1.55   -3.9  -1.27    8.2  -0.94    6.4   0.77 UK             6.2   2.04    2.3   2.26    1.7   2.66    8.4   3.07** Italy         -7.0  -1.01    2.1  -0.68   -1.4   0.31    5.2   1.30 US             7.3   2.94   -2.6   2.80    0.7   3.10     na   3.77 Japan         -1.0  -0.05    0.3   0.29   -0.9  -0.12   -1.7  -0.02  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Main consumer of bleached wood pulp            ** Estimate Source: Pulpwatch, Datastream  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Gambia leader given asylum Senegal said last night it had granted political asylum to ousted Gambian president Sir Dawda Jawara who had arrived in Dakar on a US warship. Earlier the warship had steamed out of Banjul, the capital of neighbouring Gambia, while the leader of the coup which toppled Sir Dawda received ambassadors and religious leaders. Coup leader Lieut Yayeh Jameh was reported to have told the latter that he and Sir Dawda had failed to agree terms for the president's return. Sir Dawda fled after young army officers announced a coup against him on Saturday after what began as a rampage through Banjul by soldiers demanding back pay. Officials said 10 Nigerian officers working with the military had been put under house arrest. They included the former commander of the 800-strong Gambian army, Col Boubakar Dada, who was preparing to leave Gambia. Banjul was calm, the market was open and people were going about their business normally. An overnight curfew was in force.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OVERTURNS ENCINO RESTAURANT'S DISCO PLAN  </P> <P> Encino homeowners persuaded a Los Angeles City Council planning committee  Tuesday to overturn a zoning board decision and prevent a Ventura Boulevard  restaurant from opening a disco.  </P> <P> A.J.'s Supper Club had applied for permission to add a small dance floor to its  restaurant and bar at 17337 Ventura Blvd., operating until midnight weekdays  and 1 a.m. weekends. A city zoning administrator had denied that application,  but the Board of Zoning Appeals overruled the administrator's decision.  </P> <P> Speaking before the Planning and Land Use Management Committee on Tuesday,  residents of adjacent neighborhoods said there already are at least four  establishments within a block of A.J.'s that offer late-night dancing.  </P> <P> Neighbor Emanuel Sedacca said patrons "get a head start" by drinking while  waiting in line to enter the clubs. One more disco would be too much to bear,  he said.  </P> <P> Committee members voted unanimously to support the neighbors' appeal and deny  the dance floor proposal. The issue is scheduled to go Oct. 11 to the full City  Council.  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Israel to settle for 10% inflation rate ISRAEL will settle for near 10 per cent inflation next year - a rate well above that in its main European and US trading partners - in a drive to sustain growth and reduce record 11 per cent unemployment caused by mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, the Governor of the Bank of Israel said yesterday. Mr Jacob Frenkel said he was not 'playing a game of trade-offs between unemployment and inflation' because inflation would stay on a downward path. But a dramatic fall in the rate this year to an expected 11 per cent, from 18 per cent in 1991, allowed for a period of 'consolidation' when inflation would fall less quickly. 'We are very very sensitive to the social and economic dangers that high and sustained unemployment can bring to the nation,' he said in an interview. He was speaking after the Labour-led government moved to bolster growth, which is set to reach about 6 per cent in real terms this year, by announcing it would let the value of the shekel fall by 11 per cent over the next year. It also announced a package of tax cuts and incentives for the business sector. These included a cut in VAT from 18 to 17 per cent from the start of next year, a four point cut in the corporate tax rate to 36 per cent spread over the next four years and 50 per cent rise in depreciation rates allowed on fixed assets for tax purposes. Mr Frenkel said he fully backed the measures. The prior announcment of the rate of shekel devaluation over the coming 12 months continued a policy of a 'diagonal crawling peg' in place for the last year. It combined 'flexibility and stability' while excluding damaging sudden lurches in exchange rates, he said. Although the projected devaluation will more than cover the difference between domestic inflation and inflation in Israel's main export markets, the Manufacturers' Association said it was not enough.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Europe focuses on currency tension TENSIONS in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System provided the main focus of attention for Europe's government bond markets yesterday with the weakness of the lira, sterling and French franc depressing sentiment in the respective bond markets. The Italian government bond market fell back sharply due to the combination of a poor bond auction and the weak currency. The treasury's L1,500bn issue of 10-year, 12 per cent fixed-rate notes was fully subscribed, but dealers said the price at which the stock was allocated was well below previous auction levels. The bonds were sold at 92.10, resulting in a gross yield of 13.91 per cent, compared with 13.22 per cent at the previous auction of 10-year notes. The futures contract, which opened at 92.40, fell to a low of 91.48 before ending the day at around 91.52. French government bonds drifted lower on currency and opinion poll worries ahead of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 opened at 9.17 per cent and ended at 9.18 per cent. The latest opinion poll from France forecast an equal split between yes and no votes in the referendum. The French treasury announced that it will offer FFr10bn-Fr12bn of OAT tap stocks at Thursday's auction. US TREASURY prices firmed across the board after the Federal Reserve injected reserves into the banking system by purchasing coupon-bearing securities from dealers. At the close the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  11/32 at 98 13/32 , yielding 7.377 per cent. There was less movement at the short end of the market, where the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.102 per cent. Although the dollar weakened yesterday, its first serious decline in three trading days, it had little impact on bond market sentiment. Investors paid more attention to the day's main economic news, which was a drop in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index from 54.2 in July to 53.7 in August. The figures suggested that the pace of activity in the manufacturing sector remains extremely sluggish for the current stage in the economic cycle. Prices did not take off, however, until the afternoon when the Fed made its 'coupon pass' by buying coupons maturing in April 1993 or later for delivery tomorrow. The pass had been expected but not until later in the week, and had the greatest effect on intermediate prices. IN THE UK government bond market, gilts drifted lower with the Liffe gilt futures contract falling from 94.29 to 94.25 by late afternoon. In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 slipped  1/32 to 100 19/32 . JAPANESE government bonds continued to fall back yesterday as hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates faded in the wake the government's emergency spending package. The markets had hoped that the Y10,700bn fiscal package, which was announced last Friday and which is aimed at boosting economic growth, would be accompanied by a cut in the official discount rate. However, in the absence of such a cut, the bond cash and futures markets have fallen back from last week's high levels. The key December futures contract ended at 104.69 against 104.78 at Monday's close, and compared with last week's high of 106.65. In the cash market, the yield on the new 10-year benchmark - the No 145 JGB  -opened at 4.99 per cent and traded in a range of 4.955 per cent to 5.055 per cent, before moving to 5.06 per cent in London trading. Short-term interest rates rose with the rate on three-month certificates of deposit climbing to 3.82 per cent from 3.76 per cent on Monday. Dealers said that the bond market remains 'slightly concerned' about the possibility of new bond issuance even though the government said it would not issue additional bonds in order to pay for its spending package.</p>

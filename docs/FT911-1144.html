			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers may market more Argyle diamonds THE JOINT venturers in Australia's Argyle diamond mine, CRA and Ashton Mining, are poised to sign a new five-year agreement with South Africa's De Beers to market the Argyle stones through the Central Selling Organisation. CRA and Ashton have already signed heads of agreement with the Swiss arm of the South African group, De Beers Centenary AG. A joint statement which was issued yesterday by CRA, Ashton and De Beers said that details were being finalised but that outstanding matters were expected to be resolved quickly. The major change to the CSO's marketing of Argyle diamonds since the Australian group began supplying diamonds to the South Africans eight years ago is that the entitlement of the third shareholder, the West Australian Diamond Trust, which had been sold separately, will now go through the CSO. WADT is 97 per cent owned by CRA and Ashton and has been managed by Ashton since October, 1989. CRA owns 56.8 per cent of Argyle, Ashton owns 38.2 per cent and WADT owns five per cent. In exchange for selling more of the diamond output through CSO, the Argyle partners will keep more of the high value gem stone quality, white and coloured stones, for sale through Argyle Diamond Sales. Argyle Diamond Sales is a company which is owned proportionately by the joint venturers.</p>

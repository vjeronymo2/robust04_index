The energy producers are inclined to consider the situation that  has come about as catastrophic.    VLADIVOSTOK reported that since 25 December the miners of  Eastern Siberia and Southern Yakutia have stopped unloading coal  at the Maritime Kray electric power station. The Maritime Kray  energy industry is presently being supplied only by enterprises  of the Primorskugol association, which are in no condition to  eliminate the fuel shortage. The four large state regional  electric power stations and thermal electric power facilities of  Maritime Kray require 50,000 tonnes of coal daily, while local  miners are delivering just 20,000 tonnes.    Yesterday aggregate coal reserves on hand at the electric  power stations amounted to 720,000 tonnes. This supply is  diminishing daily by 30,000 tonnes. Thus, unless coal deliveries  from outside Maritime Kray are resumed and measures taken to  conserve fuel, all local electric power stations will shut down  in 24 days. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko acknowledged in his decree that  the situation regarding supply of electric power in the kray was  critical.    The reason for the situation that has unfolded lies in  Dalenergo's lack of money to purchase coal outside Maritime  Kray. This financial shortage, in turn, arose because local  consumers are simply not paying for their use of thermal and  electric energy. In order to surmount the fuel crisis, the  Maritime Kray energy industry must pay 32 billion rubles [R] for  coal and fuel oil--this is the approximate amount of Dalenergo's  indebtedness.    In order to discipline the debtors, who account for just  about all the industry of the kray, and reduce the fuel shortage  at the same time, beginning 8 January heat deliveries to the  industrial enterprises have been curtailed 50 percent--once  again, based on the governor's decree. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko has  tasked Vladivostok head of administration Viktor Cherepkov with  eliminating almost R3 billion of the indebtedness of the  municipal enterprise for heating systems prior to 18 January.    Today at the directive of the governor, Dalenergo  specialists  are drawing up an electric power shut-down timetable, indicating  the substations, lines, and times of shut-down. Dalenergo chief  engineer Vladimir Patsev stated, however, that it would not be  in the very near future that residential lights will be turned  off--not during the present freezing weather ("not in January or  February"), but sooner or later it will be necessary to do so.    And whereas in Vladivostok the hope still exists of getting  through the cold period without damage, in Dalnegorsk, for  example, according to Dalenergo information, several residential  buildings have frozen through due to the shortage of fuel oil in  the boiler facilities, and residents are being saved only with  the help of electric heaters.    The R32 billion financial problem of the energy  industry--resulting in the emergency situation regarding fuel  supply for Maritime Kray--can be resolved, in the view of  Dalenergo specialists, only through the affording of grants to  the production association, insofar as "Dalenergo is in no  position to obtain credits--no one will extend them credit."  Yesterday it was planned to hold a session of the Emergency  Situations Commission in the kray administration building,  chaired by Vice Governor Igor Lebedinets. Two questions were on  the agenda: the state of the fuel and energy complex of the kray  (Yuriy Basharov, general director of Dalenergo, delivering the  report); and the life sustenance capability of the city of  Vladivostok (report delivered by Viktor Cherepkov, head of the  city administration).    Please check tomorrow's newspaper to read about the measures  adopted by the kray Emergency Situations Commission.</p>

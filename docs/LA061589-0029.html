			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: GRAINS, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CAN PROVIDE THE NEEDED  DIETARY FIBER  </P> <P> Although there is no Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for fiber, 25 to 30  grams per day is considered a desirable intake. This can be accomplished by  including two to three servings of cooked whole grains and four to five  servings of fresh fruits and vegetables in the daily diet.  </P> <P> Wheat germ, buckwheat and barley are a few of the more familiar grains that can  be baked into breads or used to complement ingredients in both sweet and savory  dishes. They are easy to use and are an economical way to sneak additional  fiber into the diet.  </P> <P> Wheat germ, the embryo portion of a grain, is usually separated during the  milling process because of its high oil content, which contributes to rancidity  in the final product. Like oat and wheat brans, it can be used to coat pans for  cakes and quick breads or to oven bake fish and poultry. Sprinkle wheat germ on  top of unbaked cookies. Or, roll hot baked cookie balls in a mixture of  powdered sugar and wheat germ. It will add a nutty crunch to streusel toppings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Barley Is Versatile  </P> <P> Barley, another hardy cereal grain, is useful as a thickener in soups, in a  main dish or casserole recipes or as a substitute for rice and potatoes. It can  also be baked into desserts. Barley is rich in protein, thiamine, niacin,  phosphorus and iron.  </P> <P> The entire buckwheat kernel is known to most as kasha, but it is also available  cracked into coarse pieces (buckwheat grits), or milled into a heavy powder  (buckwheat flour). It can be cooked like rice, though the traditional recipe  for cooked kasha recommends stirring an egg into the grains before hot liquid  is added. This is done to separate each grain and bring out its nutty flavor.  </P> <P> Wheat germ makes a tasty foundation for poultry or vegetable stuffing, yet it  can be stirred into prepared pudding or yogurt for crunch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHERRY-OAT BRAN MUFFINS  </P> <P> 3/4 cup oat bran  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups flour  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 3/4 cup non-fat milk  </P> <P> 1/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1 egg or 2 egg whites  </P> <P> 1/4 cup melted margarine or oil  </P> <P> 1 cup maraschino cherries, drained and chopped  </P> <P> Combine bran, flour, baking powder and salt in large bowl.

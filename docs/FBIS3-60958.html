Shaykh Hasan  'Awwad was the students' imam in the regional mosque.    Shaykh 'Awwad was not a member of al-Da'wah Party because,  he  said, he did not want to commit himself to any one party,  regardless of what that party was. If he did [Shaykh 'Awwad  thought], his conscience would be subject to the party's  decisions and not to the credibility of faith.    At that time the most prominent figures of al-Da'wah Party  were Shaykh Na'im Qasim, the party's current shaykh; Muhammad  Ra'd, his current deputy; Muhammad al-Khansa; and Mahmud  al-Qimati. In Lebanon their immediate loyalty was to Shaykh 'Ali  Kurani, who was the brother-in-law of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn  Fadlallah. Kurani, who is married to the sister of Sayyid  Fadlallah's first wife, was preoccupied with the concerns of  wealthy Shiites in the Gulf countries. He was therefore unable  to maintain a harmonious relationship with members of Lebanon's  al-Da'wah Party who, at the same time, were frequenting a  turbaned member of al-Da'wah Party from al-Najaf. That man from  al-Najaf, namely, Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, had pledged  to Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, the man who founded al-Da'wah  Party in Iraq between 1957 and 1959, that he would become his  representative in Lebanon. Sayyid Fadlallah, who started his  activity in the Brotherhood Society in East Beirut, was forced  by the civil war to leave East Beirut and go to the southern  section of the city where he started his activity in the mosque  of al-Sallum Quarter (al-Karamah Quarter).    The activity carried out by Sayyid Fadlallah as a member of  al-Da'wah Party did not prevent him from speaking out on certain  occasions as the representative of Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi  Shams-al-Din, president of the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council.    Hizballah's most prominent leaders now may have been members  of al-Da'wah Party. Among them we mention Shaykh Na'im Qasim,  who serves as vice president of Hizballah. At the same time  Shaykh Qasim serves Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah in a role like that,  which was played by Saddam Husayn when Saddam served as deputy  to then Iraqi president Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr. And there is  Muhammad al-Khansa who functions in the political office.  Actually, he is the one who runs that office in the presence of  its chief, al-Hajj Husayn Khalil, one of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn  Fadlallah's two former attendants.    Mahmud al-Qimati serves as the officer who is responsible  for  Hizballah's central funds.    Hasan Nasrallah, Na'im Qasim, and Muhammad Ra'd make up the  trio in Hizballah's Consultative Council, which represents the  fanaticism in al-Da'wah Party.</p>

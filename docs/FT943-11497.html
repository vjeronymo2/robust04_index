			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Newcrest Mining ahead midway Newcrest Mining, the group formed when the gold-mining subsidiaries of Broken Hill Proprietary and Newmont Mining merged their Australian operations, has reported after-tax profits of ADollars 23.8m (USDollars 17.6m) for the six months to June, a 25.3 per cent increase over the same period a year earlier. Sales were ADollars 212.2m, compared with ADollars 217m in the first half last year. Newcrest said that gold sales totalled 183,241 ounces, up from 171,838 ounces last time, at an average realised price of ADollars 605 per ounce. The cost of sales was ADollars 374 per ounce, compared with ADollars 364 previously. Group equity production was 173,419 ounces, up from 167,229 ounces. The company said that production costs in the second quarter to end-June had been adversely affected by a write-off of deferred costs associated with its Pernatty pit at the New Celebration gold project in Western Australia. All costs related to Newcrest's unsuccessful legal action over the sale of stake held by one of its joint venture partners in the Boddington gold mine were also accounted for during this quarter. Pasminco, the Australian lead and zinc producer, is to spend ADollars 45m at its Rosebery mine in Tasmania in an effort to develop ore bodies below the current mine working levels. The company said the four-year project would aim at the development of an additional 10m tonnes of ore reserves.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Nova may split into two NOVA, a large Canadian energy, pipeline and petrochemicals group, is considering splitting its business into two separate companies, with shareholders maintaining their proportionate interests. Nova is the main natural gas pipeline operator in Alberta, a provincially-regulated business and hiving off this activity would ease the task of raising new capital. The other entity would hold the oil and gas and petrochemical interests and raise capital on its own. Petrochemicals and plastics are subject to big price swings. At present the gas transmission business accounts for more than half Nova's total business. In 1988 Nova bought Polysar's petrochemical business for well over CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.7bn) and last year sold the synthetic rubber division for CDollars 1.35bn. Its 43 per cent interest in Husky Oil would be rolled into the new energy and petrochemicals company. RBC Dominion Securities and Morgan Stanley of New York are advising Nova on the restructuring.</p>

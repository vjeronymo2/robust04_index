			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> San Francisco-based Community Arts Inc. has been chosen by the Orange County  Board of Supervisors to curate the inaugural exhibit of an arts program at the  new John Wayne Airport Terminal, slated to be dedicated Sept. 7. The nonprofit  firm has been coordinating San Francisco International Airport's exhibition  program for 10 years, a county official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The inaugural exhibit, expected to last through December, will focus on Orange  County artists.  </P> <P> Seminal British punk-era band Wire will not perform Friday at Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre as originally announced. No replacement has been set for Wire,  which was scheduled to open for Erasure. A spokeswoman for Avalon Attractions,  which books Irvine Meadows shows, did not give a reason for the change.  </P> <P> "Parents Come Out," a video that profiles six families and how they cope with  the news that a child is gay or lesbian, will air today through Friday on  Irvine's public-access cable station, Channel 3. The 30-minute video was  produced by the San Francisco chapter of Parents and Friends of Gays and  Lesbians. The screenings, at 8 p.m. today and 7:30 p.m. Thursday and Friday,  are sponsored by Irvine Citizens United, a group formed last year to combat  Measure N, the Irvine initiative that eventually eliminated protections against  discrimination based on sexual orientation from the city's human rights  ordinance.  </P></p>

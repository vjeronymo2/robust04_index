			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Ireland faces pressure over EC regional aid THE IRISH government will this week come under strong pressure from its partners to lift its veto on the European Community's biggest regional development programme, worth Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.4bn) for 1994-99. After 17 hours of often ugly disputes among the 12 on Friday and early Saturday morning over how to divide the spoils, Ireland blocked a deal. It held out for its full target of IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) against the IPounds 7.5bn it was offered. Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, which now holds the EC presidency, said 'I'm waiting for a signal from the Irish government', reminding Dublin that it was blocking a package 'three times greater than the global Marshall Plan' of US aid to reconstruct post-second world war Europe. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he had firm pledges of IPounds 8bn immediately after last December's EC summit in Edinburgh, where the size of the package, but not how to divide it, was agreed. Since then he has been under intense domestic political pressure to deliver. Unlike Spain, however, which got written assurances from the European Commission for the Pta6,400bn (Pounds 33bn) it now expects to get, Ireland's understanding was oral. Per capita, Dublin in the last share-out got 2 to 2 1/2 times more than Spain, Portugal and Greece, with which it makes up the so-called 'Cohesion Four' of the poorest member states. Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, looking drawn at 4am on Saturday after protracted telephone negotiations with Mr Reynolds, said: 'We were looking for assurances based on the understanding at Edinburgh, and they were not forthcoming. In the national interest, we felt we had no choice.' If the impasse is not broken this week, the rules governing the aid programme will miss their second reading by the European Parliament next week and be cast into a far longer procedure. This means the aid will almost certainly not start flowing in January. Nevertheless, the shape of the deal for Ireland's partners is emerging, even though the weekend negotiations were supposedly only on the framework. Objective 1 regions, which get the best aid terms and biggest grants reserved for the EC's most backward areas, will get Ecu96.3bn. The 'Cohesion Four' will get Ecu70bn of this, plus an additional Ecu15.5bn from a separate Cohesion Fund which has already started up. The UK, the next poorest member state, got Merseyside and the Scottish Highlands and Islands included in Objective 1, with the latter accepted at the last minute as the whole 'enterprise area' it encompasses, including therefore Argyll, Bute and West Moray. Northern Ireland was already eligible. But with this coup, and adding in its other funding entitlements, the UK could get Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn over the next six years. Cantabria in northern Spain, and Hainaut in southern Belgium, like Merseyside traditionally industrial areas, were also reclassified as backward. France thereby secured Objective 1 status for its Valenciennes and Sambre-Avesnois areas bordering Hainaut, arguing that their problems were structurally identical even though they are not recognised as a department. Inventing a French Hainaut, a Frenchofficial said unimprovably, was 'an existential problem.' Germany got its eastern states eligible for Objective 1 funding as part of the Edinburgh deal. But other stricken areas across the EC will get lesser Objective 2 structural aid grants, for areas in industrial decline. The UK, which opposed spending part of the package's money for training the unemployed on instead retraining workers in danger of losing jobs because of industrial restructuring,got the latter portion reduced from a third to a fifth of the still undecided total.</p>

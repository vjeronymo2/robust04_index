			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: GREETING AT ENTRANCE NOT A MUST  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I live in a secure building that contains eight  apartments. When guests arrive, they must first ring my apartment from the  front door. I may then use the intercom system to allow the guests to announce  themselves, and I then electronically unlock the entrance from my apartment.  </P> <P> This seems to be somewhat inhospitable, as the guests must then find their way  up a flight of stairs and through a series of doors. Should I be greeting them  at the door and saving the intercom for package deliveries?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- While appreciating your hospitable intentions, Miss Manners  believes it superfluous for you to greet your guests in the lobby. (It is even  considered a politeness, for those who have the luxury of a household employee  to open the door, to allow guests to collect themselves and smooth the ravages  of the weather before being greeted by their hosts.)  </P> <P> This is not to say that you want them stumbling about the building. You have an  intercommunication system, so use it to say a pleasant word of greeting and  give your guests instructions. In these circumstances, a hospitable gesture  would be to be waiting at your open apartment door when they arrive.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- At a wedding reception we attended in a country club, they  were serving free drinks. I was surprised to see on the trays of the waiters  and waitresses, along with champagne, small containers for tips. Many people  thought they were to pay for the drinks.  </P> <P> Am I wrong in thinking that this wasn't proper and that it was up to the bridal  party to take care of the tips?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- While Miss Manners shares your distaste for this crass  maneuver, she is not as quick as you in placing the blame. Let us hope that the  hosts were unaware that their guests were being solicited for money. Miss  Manners would go so far as to hope that the trays were there for the guests to  deposit soiled cocktail napkins before taking fresh drinks. In any case, the  practice should be reported to club management, which may not have authorized  it -- or may decide not to authorize it if people oppose it.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My niece, who was married and divorced, is remarrying, and  we are all invited to the wedding, dinner and reception. We each gave her a  nice wedding gift for her first marriage.  </P> <P> Are we to give her another big gift? What is the correct thing to do?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- The correct thing to do is not always what the principals most  want. (For example, it is incorrect to tip the owner of an establishment, such  as a restaurant or a hair salon.) But those who follow it have the comfort of  knowing that it is correct.  </P> <P> Now -- it is perfectly correct not to give a present for a second wedding. Most  people generously ignore this rule, because if they feel close enough to attend  the wedding at all, they are moved to give a present as well. But it is  perfectly sensible to invoke the rule when you have already given the same  person a substantial present.  </P></p>

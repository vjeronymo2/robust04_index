			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT : 'AWAKE AND SING' AT ACTORS FORUM; 'POPS' AT THE RICHMOND SHEPARD;  'POLITICS' AT ITCHEY FOOT; 'MATINEE' AT 2ND STAGE; 'IRISH STEW' AT GYPSY  </P> <P> You keep waiting for the curtain to rise on "Awake and Sing" at the Actors  Forum Theatre, but it never does. Instead you watch Clifford Odets' struggling  Bronx family through a gauzy, semi-transparent scrim -- an experience akin to  watching quarrelsome neighbors through a screen door.  </P> <P> French director Rene Migliaccio's expressionistic design also transfers this  very realistic, 1935 Depression saga to a dreamlike setting of bare, gray walls  that suggest a padded cell. These highly stylized features are initially  infuriating because they seem to distance you from the otherwise naturalistic  acting.  </P> <P> As the show progresses, however, with the actors deliberately emoting like  banshees in some cases, these stylized devices enable you to see the play anew,  without clutter and from a purifying distance. The Bergers, Odets' unhappy  Jewish family, are seen here as quintessential fish in a bowl.  </P> <P> This is a good time for Odets' fans. The playwright's "Waiting for Lefty" (also  from 1935) is receiving a fully realistic staging across town at the Company of  Angels, and the two productions are a rare opportunity to view an important  playwright from different perspectives.  </P> <P> Even when the scenery chewing in "Awake and Sing" is outrageous and funny, the  result is arresting. Prominent here are Steven Rosenbaum's coiled histrionics  as the young son (a role created by John Garfield in the 1935 Group Theater  production) and Anthony Gioia and Lisa Zebro in a Valentino-like seduction  scene that pulls out all the stops and, remarkably, works.  </P> <P> As the smoldering, sultry daughter, Zebro almost walks off with the show. Her  presence is palpable merely smoking drearily in a chair and saying nothing.  </P> <P> Among the nine-member cast, Gioia bristles as the love-smitten boarder. Larry  Turks' slavish in-law and Archie Lang's Caruso-playing grandfather add  pen-and-ink detail. The production's serious misstep is Audrey Marlyn as the  mother figure. Her scratchy voice and snarling demeanor are tiresome and  unrelenting.  </P> <P>  At 3365 1/2 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7  p.m., through July 9. Tickets: $10-$12.50; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> 'Pops'  </P> <P> Another New York family, an unsavory Italian household in contemporary  Brooklyn, populates playwright Dennis Manuel's "Pops" at the Richmond Shepard  Theatre. The is dirty-undershirt drama, salvaged by a son's quest for his  father.  </P> <P> The unredeeming title character is every woman's nightmare, complete with a  tattoo, hairy arms, a volatile temper. And Eddie Zammit as the entitled Pops  Vitelli delivers a furious, scabrous performance. Director Gary Blumsack stages  a sexual abuse scene, central to the point of the play, that is notable for its  ugly veracity.  </P> <P> The human squalor is offset by the decency of Pops' common-law wife (Jean  Sagal), his endearing mother (a feisty Eda Reiss Merin), his loyal buddy (Greg  Mullavey), and, most important, his young adult, long missing son (Sandor  Black, whose tremulous and sensitive performance is the show's ultimate  strength).  </P> <P> Vibrant acting here redeems to a measurable degree a predictable and surly  play, which is further hampered by a flavorless and skimpy apartment room set.  </P> <P>  At 6478 Santa Monica Blvd., Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., through July  23. Tickets: $12.50-$15; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> 'Politics of the Heart'  </P> <P> The Itchey Foot's potential as a downtown cabaret theater is evident in its  musical production, "Politics of the Heart," which is a winsome summer  valentine.  </P> <P> Subtitled "Recent Musical Findings Regarding Modern Love," the show is a homage  to love created and performed by Ed Munter, who cleverly and literally animates  his songs with live sketches of hearts that materialize in assorted states of  bliss and captivity.  </P> <P> Guitarist-songwriter Munter, fronting his local band Izeneers (eyes and ears),  is a down-home troubadour, effortlessly charting the faces of love on guitar,  sketch pad and easel, harmonica and, humorously, over the phone.  </P> <P> Under Bryan Rasmussen's blithesome direction, Munter and his two musicians  (guitarist Larry Giannecchini and bassist Jay Mueller) conjure a pointed spell  that never slips into sentimentality or mere balladeering. The most genuine  touch in the intermissionless evening, though, is Munter's witty dexterity with  his drawings.  </P> <P>  At 801 W. Temple St., Wednesdays only, 8:30 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $8;  (213) 680-0007.  </P> <P> 'Matinee'  </P> <P> The stage is a movie house about to be torn down, where motley characters are  in their seats waiting for the last matinee to unreel.  </P> <P> The unseen, mysterious projectionist (God? The Reaper?) never does start the  movie. A quarrelsome patron, an old man, dies and is left sprawled between the  seats. A bag lady, a kid, a bartender and an usher act weird. The central  character, a troubled ambulance driver (Douglas Van Leuven), tries to make  sense of it all and goes off to find his destiny.  </P> <P> Beware of murky, ambitious plays that take place in movie theaters. "Matinee"  at the 2nd Stage is incomprehensible.  </P> <P> Playwright Joseph D. Grantham, taking his inspiration from Joseph Campbell's  classic study of a hero's mythic journey, "The Hero With a Thousand Faces," has  attempted, he says, "to merge myth and reality in the dream world of the movie  theater." The dreams here, modern exploration, mythic adventure, are grueling,  garrulous and grinding.  </P> <P> Craig M. Dickelman directed.  </P> <P>  At 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7  p.m., through July 9. Tickets: $10; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> 'Irish Stew / Yorkshire Pudding'  </P> <P> You also might want to beware of Irish plays distinguished by great Irish  accents -- and almost nothing else.  </P> <P> "Irish Stew and Yorkshire Pudding," at the Gypsy Playhouse, is comprised of  three one-acts by Charles Kray that are, in each case, shaggy-dog stories that  would make cute telling in a pub or amusing five- to 10-minute comedic  sketches. But "The Darlin Hero, "Droit du Seigneur," and "A Tale of a Cat" each  run on endlessly, way past their mischievous points.  </P> <P> There are no characterizations or relationships or social contexts worth  savoring, beyond little elfin-like yarns. This is truly theater of the absurd.  Some of the actors, who play multiple roles, are quaintly funny -- if you like  quaint.  </P> <P> John York directed.  </P> <P>  At 3321 W. Olive Ane., Burbank, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7  p.m., through Aug. 13. Tickets: $6-$10; (818) 954-9858.  </P></p>

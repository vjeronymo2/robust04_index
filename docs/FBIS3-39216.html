			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at an international </F> symposium on the 175th anniversary of the Friedrich-Wilhelm  University in Bonn on 19 January]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Ladies and Gentlemen, the  European orientation of our country is among the greatest  achievements accomplished during the 40 years of the FRG's  existence. Today, it is a natural foundation of our political  culture.    Even though it has become fashionable again among some  people  to preach "Europessimism," no one can ignore the fact that  Germany's integration into a union of European democracies has,  meanwhile, become irreversible. We would fail in the eyes of  history, yes, we would deliberately gamble away great capital,  if we were to bow to that advice today that says we should,  first of all, deal with the challenges resulting from German  unification and only secondly take care of European unification.  Leaving European integration would not only be suicidal in  political terms; it would also destroy the bases of our  prosperity and, not least, millions of jobs.    I deliberately say this in such dramatic terms, because many  people have meanwhile forgotten why we have lived in peace for  such a long time. We owe this to European integration to a  decisive extent. It has contributed to overcoming rivalries and  conflicts that had existed for centuries between the various  nations. As a result of the process of European unification, we  have been able to unite our strengths in Europe for mutual  benefit.    In view of the dramatic changes in the world over the past  years, common action by all Europeans is as important today as  it was during the years after the end of World War II. It is  now necessary to prove that this old continent does not suffer  from decrepitude, but that it is able to develop its entire  dynamism and a really youthful strength.    This is not only a question of economy and finances. Whoever  believes -- and this is understandable in times of high  unemployment and difficult economic problems -- that he can  solve all problems via the economy, will be wrong. We have seen  again and again that the decisive precondition for a change for  the better is remembering one's intellectual-cultural bases.  Therefore, the issues of education and training belong at the  center of the discussion about safeguarding our future.    The German education and training system has a traditionally  good reputation. Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves today  whether this system fully lives up to the changed requirements  and conditions. Whoever undertakes university studies in Germany  after leaving school is almost 30 years old on average when he  enters professional life. At the same time, the average  retirement age of men is 59 years. This means that, in many  cases, 50 years of training and retirement are set off by only  about 30 years of productive work. This calculation cannot be  positive.    What we need is a young generation that is confident it can  live up to the challenges. However, we need an older generation  that conveys this confidence and also points out opportunities  just as much. Furthermore, our country needs the creativity and  the intellectual mobility in particular of young people in  professional life.    On the international labor market, the German university  graduate has clear disadvantages compared with his younger  foreign competitors. Structural reforms in the university  sector leading to a reduction of the average studying time are  long overdue. This is also necessary to strengthen our  universities in research and scientific teaching.    The number of drop-outs is too high. In addition, almost  one-fourth of university graduates work in a job that does not  correspond to their academic training. The time is ripe to also  come to structural decisions in education policy that make the  overall system of education and training, science and research  more efficient and flexible. This is not so much a question of  finances, but, rather, one of being open-minded to new ideas.    As a convinced federalist, I respect the distribution of  powers between the Federal Government and the laender, which is  set down in the Constitution. However, the questions of  education and training are also issues of national importance.  Whoever is responsible is also obligated to act. I cannot  understand it at all when the laender block urgently needed  modernization measures. It is the laender that can and must  make decisive progress with the necessary structural reforms.  University reforms cannot be carried out successfully against  the universities, but only together with them.    Our country's ability to face the future is decided in the  university sector, in science and research. We depend more than  others on innovations, on intelligent products and qualified  services, that is, in particular, from the creativity and the  training qualifications of our working people. In this  connection, it is particularly important to bring together at  the universities young scientists and future managers from the  most varied range of countries.    Despite the need for broad education at a high level, one  thing is indispensable: Our universities must once again be  able to work under conditions that facilitate and promote top  achievements. Liberal democracy, more than any other form of a  state, needs a good atmosphere, a common will to promote  achievements. This has nothing to do with a so-called elbow  mentality, but is an important precondition for a country having  a future at all.    The essential element of a university is autonomy. In our  German university system we must expand the leeway for the  individual universities' own responsibility. The universities  in Germany must have the opportunity -- yes, they must be  motivated -- to try out new approaches themselves and to give  themselves an independent profile with innovative forms of  teaching and research. Basically, it is a question of internal  readiness and intellectual attitude whether we will be able to  manage the breakthrough to structural changes and to overcoming  ossification. This applies to the education sector just as to  other fields of politics.    Ladies and Gentlemen, progress in European integration also  requires further modernization in economy and society in our  country. Already in the past, the opening of borders in Europe  essentially contributed to growth and employment in Germany and  among our neighbors.    We must realize that international competition is  intensifying. In addition to the expanding national economics in  the East Asian and Pacific area, we now have an industrious and  highly motivated competition right in front of our own door. I  am thinking of countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, or  Hungary. Their production costs only a fraction of what it  costs here. We want these countries to be economically  successful. They should not remain dependent on Western aid,  but be able to earn their foreign currency themselves. Also  with a view to these developments, we must make changes in our  country and change our way of thinking.    Even though some people no longer want to recognize this  today, we Germans owe the European Community an unprecedented  degree of prosperity. About three-fourths of our exports today  go to the European economic area, about two-thirds of our  imports come from there. Thus, whoever today calls for "less  Europe," puts at stake many millions of jobs that are  safeguarded by the interlacement with our partners in Europe.    What we have achieved in Europe in the past must be  safeguarded and expanded for the future. The Maastricht Treaty,  which came into force on 1 November last year despite all the  pessimistic predictions, gives us new opportunities for that:    First: In order to lastingly ensure employment, growth, and  prosperity in Europe and in Germany, we will implement the  economic and monetary union. The future European currency will  be as stable as our tested German mark. In order to ensure  this, we have pushed through strict criteria for participation  in the economic and monetary union in the Maastricht Treaty. In  part, these preconditions include a solid economic and financial  policy. We will never agree to weakening the criteria of  stability!    For us, the decision of the European Council in favor of  Frankfurt/Main as the seat of the European Monetary Institute,  and thus also of the future European Central Bank, was  particularly encouraging for us. This is a convincing sign of  trust in our stability policy and an encouragement to continue  on this course with determination.    Second: We want a common European policy in the important  field of internal security. For many years I have stressed this  necessity to the German and the international public -- in  particular in view of the spread of organized crime and the  international drug mafia. We must assume that, in 1993, the  drug mafia has smuggled an amount into Europe -- primarily, of  course, into the hard-currency countries -- that corresponds to  the budget of the Kingdom of Belgium.    One need not be an expect to realize the changes that can be  caused by this in the substance of our community. Since the  wirepullers and helpers of crime operate all over Europe and all  over the world nowadays, we must organize the struggle against  them accordingly. No country in Europe is able to master this  growing danger on its own.    In the interests of our citizens we want open borders in  Europe. However, this must not go hand in hand with a loss in  internal security. With Europol we have taken a first step  toward pursuing the struggle against international organized  crime together and with determination. In talking with my  European colleagues, I emphatically express the conviction that  the instruments of the Maastricht Treaty are not yet sufficient.  Beyond them, we must think about what we can do specifically --  not least on the basis of the experiences gathered by the U.S.  authorities -- in combating organized crime and the drug mafia.    Third: In particular from the German viewpoint, the  development of a common foreign and security policy is an  existential question. We have more neighbors than any other  country in Europe. We have lived in peace for 48 years now, but  it would be a fateful error to believe that this is guaranteed  for eternity. The evil spirits of the past are not only alive  in the Balkans.    We need Europe's political unification so as to prevent any  relapse into the national rivalries of former times. Some sort  of elevated free-trade zone is not sufficient for this purpose.  War and peace in Europe depend on whether we manage to build  this "European home" firmly, so that it can weather any storm  and cannot be destroyed anymore.    In the future, the Europeans can only master the great  foreign and security policy challenges together. The war in the  former Yugoslavia, not least, has demonstrated the current  limits of the European Community in crisis prevention and crisis  management. For two years, we have seen the terrible pictures  of the suffering people in Sarajevo and elsewhere on the  television news every evening. What is at stake here is the  credibility of the European democracies.    In many countries -- also in Germany -- the efforts to end  the conflict are considered to be insufficient. In view of the  horrible pictures in the areas of war, many people ask whey the  West and, in particular, NATO are not doing more to end the  conflict. I have much understanding for these questions.  However, here one forgets how much this war is characterized by  hatred and irrationality, which have grown over centuries.    In reality, there is no omnipotent prescription for solving  this conflict. We Germans in particular should be especially  careful with our advice. We do not have the moral right to  demand more of those responsible in other countries than we  ourselves do. Rather, we should express respect for those young  soldiers, and their relatives, who risk their lives and work  there for the United Nations.    Ladies and Gentlemen, a common foreign and security policy  of the European Union would remain piecemeal if European defense  were not added. The WEU [Western European Union] has a key role  in this. Atlantic alliance and European defenses must  supplement and strengthen each other meaningfully. In this  connection, it was a great success of the latest NATO summit in  Brussels that cooperation between NATO and the European Union  will be essentially expanded. In the future, the WEU will be  able to use NATO forces for its own mission. At the same time,  the Eurocorps, which was established by President Mitterrand and  myself, will soon be available for the common defense of the  alliance, for peacekeeping missions, and for humanitarian tasks.    Ladies and Gentlemen, we want to build this Europe as a  Europe of the people. This Europe is to be a federal construct.  Federal means that the authority and decisionmaking power lies  there where the decision can best be made. In case of doubt,  this is at the level that is closer to the citizens.    Only those things that really have to be decided there are  to  be decided in Brussels. Some EC guidelines are certainly  superfluous. However, for the sake of fairness, one must also  admit that many of these guidelines are due to initiatives of  national interest groups. Therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen, a  year ago in Edinburgh we decided to establish criteria and  control mechanism so as to make such developments impossible in  the future.    We do not want to build a European superstate, we want a  European community, a "European home," in which people feel  comfortable and in which many things will remain different.  This Europe is not to have a uniformly gray facade, but all the  facets and the entire wealth of colors, the entire colorful  bouquet of Europe is to become visible. In the Europe of the  future, we will remain Germans, Britons, Italians, or French.  We remain firmly rooted in our home regions. In this sense,  Maastricht does not stand for a European leviathan, but for a  decentralized and democratic Europe that is close to the people.  In particular, the variety of the peoples in Europe offers the  preconditions for a synthesis that links the best qualities of  the peoples. Europe's strength lies in the fruitful  relationship of tension between the unity and lively variety of  our cultural heritage.    In this connection, it must also be noted that the European  Union, as it now stands, is only a torso. I hope that in 1995,  Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will join the European  Union as planned. Certainly, there are still difficulties in  the current negotiations. However, we must try to follow the  difficult path in the future together. Just as the accession of  the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states is a natural  part of the development of the European Union, in my view, it  would be unacceptable for me, if, in the long run, the border of  the political union were to remain the Oder-Neisse border.  Therefore, at the European Council in Copenhagen last June, we  also opened up clear prospects for membership to our eastern  neighbors.    Ladies and Gentlemen, I know we are facing enormous tasks in  Europe. I know that one could despair because of that.  However, I also know that it is not the business of one single  generation, but these are tasks of generations -- still, we can  make progress in Europe. This path has brought us much  happiness. It has brought German unification.    When we now say in the spirit of Thomas Mann: "We are German  Europeans and European Germans," then this is a wonderful thing  for the future -- to be able to live in freedom and in peace!  We can do something with a view to the hopes of large parts of  the Third World, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, those  countries and peoples who have not only experienced good things  from Europe, but also many unpleasant things in the course of  their history.    We must make wealth of cultural assets, of intellectual  developments of the most varied kind usable. It is a very  essential basis of human creativity, and thus also a basis for  political and economic success. I believe that we should think  primarily of the next, the young generation, and act in its  spirit. Young people in Germany -- that is you, who are  studying here -- have the opportunity to live in peace and  freedom in the future, a bit of luck that no other generation in  Germany has ever had. However, we must also do something for  that.    Today, we have the opportunity to link up with good  traditions -- from that time before the era of nation-state  rivalries -- when one began one's studies in Oxford, for  instance, continued them in Bologna, and then went to Paris.    You, dear students, live a life in Europe already, now, that  we want to achieve for tomorrow: a continent of open borders,  of good neighborliness, and friendship. What is needed is your  initiative, your creative intelligence, your self-confidence,  and also your ability to make a contribution to the future of  our country and of Europe.    In particular, I address you, the students, because actually  it is rather more your Europe of which I am speaking than mine.  When your are 63 or 64 years old, you naturally think of how  much time you still have. You think differently than the  20-year-old student I was in 1950. But I remember one thing,  namely that we were a generation that was confident it could  build this Europe.    Therefore, there is no reason for that cultural pessimism  that is, unfortunately, paid for highly in Germany. I feel  primarily gratitude that in my generation it has been possible  to continue the work of the wonderful founders of the FRG.    Europe -- that is the future that I wish for us. In  particular, however, for you, the students.</p>

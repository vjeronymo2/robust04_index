			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Short-term attitude of banks denied THE FINANCIAL system has been unfairly blamed for short-term attitudes among UK companies, Professor Harold Rose of London Business School said last night in a memorial lecture for Harold Wincott, the former Financial Times journalist, John Gapper writes. Prof Rose argued that finance had been 'more scapegoat than villain' in limiting Britain's economic growth. Many traditional criticisms of banks and securities markets were contradictory, and lacked supporting evidence. In the 23rd annual Wincott Lecture, Prof Rose said that while banks were criticised for their short-term view, 'it is the large British corporate customers rather than the banker who is reluctant to enter into the marriage'. He said that British companies preferred to take advantage of wide access to different forms of finance. 'I submit that the real fault in the British capital market is not that good firms cannot raise enough finance but that it is too easy for badly managed firms to do so.' However, he said he 'would not completely absolve' bankers whose training was 'short of education in the principles of portfolio risk management'.</p>

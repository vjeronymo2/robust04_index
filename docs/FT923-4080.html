			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Angolan rivals accept proposal for a coalition ANGOLA'S ruling MPLA party and the former rebel movement Unita have accepted a proposal to form a coalition government after this month's elections. The announcement was made in Luanda by senior officials from Portugal, Russia and the US - the countries monitoring the peace process - after two days of meetings with Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, who also heads the MPLA, and Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of Unita. 'The observers are pleased to report the willingness of President Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi to form a government which will ensure the viability of a project of national reconciliation and reconstruction, taking into account the results of the elections,' the statement said. The Portuguese secretary of state for co-operation, Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, made it clear in remarks from Luanda to Portuguese state television that the future government would reflect proportionately the results of the elections. 'The idea is that a future government, whoever it is, whatever the results of the elections, will obviously have to reflect the dominant political force,' Mr Durao Barroso said. 'But it will try to integrate other forces according to their electoral representation in order to guaranteee a sufficient base of support for national reconciliation,' he said, adding that both sides had accepted the proposal. A power sharing deal would significantly reduce prospects for widespread election violence in Angola's first free polls on September 29 and 30. Without a coalition agreement observers have been predicting that neither side would accept defeat but would incite ethnic violence over election results. Unita has its stronghold in the southern Ovimbundu tribe, which accounts for 35-40 per cent of the population and the MPLA draws its support from the Mbundu, who form a quarter of the population. If the agreement is formally ratified before polling day it could mark a fundamental turning point for an economy which could be one of Africa's economic power houses. A reform programme aimed at tackling the effects of years of mismanagement, a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.5bn) external debt and an overvalued currency have been overshadowed by the political tensions of the transition to democracy. Little divides the two parties on economic policy. Both subscribe to the free market structural adjustment polices set out by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - although Unita can point to a long-standing commitment to capitalism in contrast to the MPLA's relatively recent conversion from Marxism.</p>

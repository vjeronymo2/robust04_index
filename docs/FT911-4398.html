			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Loud clash over tin rights - A Brazilian courtroom battle IN A stuffy courtroom in the jungle town of Porto Velho last week, Justice of the Peace Adamar Maciel presided over a case described as 'Brazil's big-time mineral companies try to oust small-time miners from gigantic tin reserve'. The fight was over the mining rights to Bom Futuro, one of the biggest tin reserves in the world. Its outcome could alter international tin prices. The question is whether the mine will remain in the hands of the 'little guys', poverty-stricken fortune hunters with no regard for international supply, or the large mineral concerns which would control output to boost prices on the world markets. The battle is between the Garimpeiros' Production Union and Ebesa, a company held by a conglomerate of big oil companies. Paranapanema, the mineral giant, has a 49 per cent stake in the group, which aims to take control of the area. If it succeeds, Brazil's tin production would drop sharply. On April 9, the judge decided the miners' union would need to show more evidence to support its claims to the area. Paranapanema prematurely crowed victory. 'Bom Futuro is ours,' said Mr Samuel Hanan, a director at the company. The miners' union vowed to continue the battle. 'We have a duty to defend our interests against monopolistic and corrupt forces,' said Mr Dirceu Almeida, the union's lawyer. Mr Hanan is counting on victory to lift sagging tin prices. 'I predict that with the demise of Brazil's small-time miners, tin prices will hit Dollars 6,200 by 1992,' he said. He bases his claim on a prediction that tin consumption will exceed output this year by about 23,000 tonnes. Ebesa has been trying to kick Bom Futuro's garimpeiros out for three-and-a-half years, but the miners have stayed put. Now, Ebesa's luck may be turning, not because of any legal success, but because of changing circumstances. From a peak of 20,000, Bom Futuro's garimpeiros now number less than 1,000. Market observers say that with the price of tin at its lowest level in real terms since the Second World War, many garimpeiros have simply decided it is no longer worthwhile to mine it. Second, the differential between Brazil's official and black market exchange rates has narrowed, from 100 per cent last year to about 10 per cent. The change has deprived the garimpeiros of the huge exchange rate profits they previously made on smuggling. Finally, it has become increasingly difficult for small-time miners to work Bom Futuro. Three years ago, garimpeiros were pulling the metal out of reserves two to three metres below the surface. Now, most of the tin reserves lie some 12 to 15 metres deep. The Brazilian government has also done its part in pushing out the miners. The garimpeiros' lack of concern for the environment provided welcome ammunition. 'The garimpeiros cut down trees and pollute the rivers indiscriminately,' said Mr Carlos Borba, economist at the minerals division of the ministry of infrastructure. Paranapanema's Mr Hanan also said the miners only succeed in extracting 50 per cent of the metal from the rock, whereas the company can take out 85 per cent. The government last year enacted two new laws to give the garimpeiros a shove. First, none of the tin production from Bom Futuro could be ex-ported. As Brazil consumes little tin domestically, that gave the miners no legal market. Second, the government required that any tin leaving Brazil must be accompanied by certificates of origin, which has curbed smuggling. Bom Futuro's output is already well down. In 1990, the mine produced 17,000 tonnes of tin, compared with 32,000 in its heyday. As Ebesa tightens its grip on the area, that level may fall even further.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Glaxo asthma drugs cleared BETA AGONISTS, a class of asthma drugs attacked last year for possible deadly side effects, were yesterday given a clean bill of health by the UK Committee on Safety and Health of Medicines. The news gave Glaxo a boost ahead of its interim figures tomorrow - the company dominates UK sales of beta agonists with its products Ventolin and Serevent. Glaxo's shares rose 8p to 848p. Other companies selling them include Schering Plough of the US, Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland and Astra of Sweden. The CSM report runs counter to evidence revealed in Canadian studies last year which seemed to link the use of beta agonists with the deaths of some asthma sufferers. The controversy is likely to be revived shortly when the latest set of results from the Canadian studies are published. Doctors expect them to repeat the findings first publicised last year. The CSM report says 'the evidence does not suggest that the use of beta agonists is associated with asthma mortality'. It found that the death rate per 100,000 people from asthma was the same as 10 years ago, despite a trebling of the number of prescriptions in that time. It nevertheless recommends changes in the wording on the data sheets, which doctors use when prescribing drugs. 'Patients should be warned against repeatedly increasing the prescribed dose of a beta agonist without medical advice,' it says. Allen &amp; Hanburys, a Glaxo subsidiary, said it would examine its data sheets 'to ensure consistency with the CSM's recommendations'. Dr Michael Rudolph, of Ealing Hospital, London, a member of the International Asthma Council - a newly-formed group concerned about possible dangers of the class of drugs - said yesterday: 'Many people feel that beta agonists have been useful, but patients can over-use their medication'. In 1989 the National Health Service spent Pounds 217m, or 8 per cent of its drugs budget, on treatments for the country's 3m asthmatics. The US Food and Drug Administration is still evaluating the class of drugs in the light of the Canadian and other studies.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Producer to Cut Agents' Cuts: Producer Cameron Mackintosh, who made Broadway  history by charging $100 for top seats to next season's "Miss Saigon," is  causing more woes among New York theater ticket agents. Mackintosh, who also  produced "Les Miserables" and "Phantom of the Opera," has told the agents, who  sell millions of dollars of tickets in advance block ticket sales, that  "Saigon" will not pay the flat 10% commission that has long been standard  industry practice. His new flexible commission scale will range from 5% for the  best seats to 10% on the hardest-to-unload. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROSOFT HELPS SET MULTIMEDIA COMPUTER STANDARDS  </P> <P> In an effort to boost the development of a major new market for personal  computer hardware and software, Microsoft Corp. and a number of PC  manufacturers on Tuesday announced a set of basic standards for so-called  multimedia computers.  </P> <P> Multimedia combines traditional computing functions with high-quality sound and  video, thus opening a broad new range of possible applications. Technological  advances over the past several years have rendered multimedia practical on  standard personal computers, and many companies have seized on multimedia in  recent months as a key growth area.  </P> <P> Tuesday's announcement was an effort to establish a minimum set of criteria for  multimedia personal computers, thus allowing software developers to write  multimedia programs with a knowledge of what kind of hardware will be  available.  </P> <P> Tandy Corp., parent company of the Radio Shack electronics chain, joined with  nine other computer vendors in agreeing to ship a multimedia machine by next  year. Such a system will include an IBM-compatible personal computer with  either a 286 or 386 microprocessor from Intel Corp. that's equipped with at  least 2 megabytes of memory, a 30-megabyte hard disk drive, VGA graphics, a  digital audio system and a CD-ROM laser disk drive. In addition, the machines  will include Microsoft's Windows operating software equipped with special  multimedia extensions.  </P> <P> A multimedia package would add about $1,000 to the cost of a typical business  PC.  </P> <P> International Business Machines, while not committing to specific hardware  deliveries, is supporting the initiative in promoting the development of  multimedia software for its OS/2 operating system.  </P> <P> Among the computer vendors joining Tandy in supporting a multimedia platform  are AT&amp;T, NEC, Fujitsu, Olivetti and Zenith. Tandy said it would promote  multimedia through special promotions in its Radio Shack stores.  </P> <P> While Tuesday's announcement should give a lift to multimedia development  efforts, it did not resolve many of the thornier issues, such as exactly how  full-motion video will be handled in future multimedia computers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, computer vendors whose machines are not IBM-compatible, such as  Apple Computer and Next Inc., are pushing ahead with their own multimedia  plans.  </P></p>

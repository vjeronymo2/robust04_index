			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Warm response for Ontario's Dollars 3bn global issue THE Province of Ontario's third global bond received an enthusiastic welcome in the international bond markets yesterday. The 10-year issue, which will be priced today to yield between 76 and 79 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, was increased to Dollars 3bn after being launched at Dollars 2.5bn. That makes it one of the largest fixed-rate dollar issues to date, equalling the UK's last December. Bankers said the indicated pricing looked very fair. Salomon Brothers, leading the issue with Goldman Sachs, agreed the spread was high, but said it is not out of line with secondary market prices. The increase reflects the relative shortage of dollar supply in the Euromarkets and the re-weighting by fund managers towards dollar assets, it said. This completes the province's budgeted 1992-93 borrowing programme and prefunds part of its 1993-94 requirement. Ontario plans to borrow CDollars 9.2bn (USDollars 7.6bn) in the next fiscal year, to cover a projected deficit of CDollars 8.1bn and CDollars 1.1bn of refinancings. Of the total, it will raise around 60 per cent internationally. Deutsche Bank in London's Dollars 100m, 10-year collared floating rate note issue for the Province of British Columbia offers a minimum coupon of 5 1/2 per cent, an indication that such rates are edging up. Deutsche Bank said the issue is structured as senior debt rather than subordinated debt, and was based on orders from investors switching out of existing collared floaters with lower minimum coupons. Much of the demand came from Germany, said Deutsche Bank, which kept 70 per cent of the issue on its own books. Portugal is set to become the latest European sovereign to borrow in the international bond market, writes Richard Waters. Portugal is under little pressure to raise the Dollars 3bn ceiling it has set for foreign borrowing this year, said Mr Manuel Pinho, director of the Treasury, in London this week to brief investors on the country's borrowing plans. It has a budgeted government deficit of around 4 per cent in the next fiscal year, and foreign exchange reserves standing at Dollars 20bn, up from Dollars 7.5bn three years earlier. However, it sees foreign borrowing as a way of reducing overall borrowing costs and opening up the market for other Portuguese public sector borrowers in future.</p>

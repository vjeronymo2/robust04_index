			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Lawyers get video links in chambers SIR NICHOLAS LYELL, the attorney general, yesterday opened Britain's largest set of barristers chambers - and the first in the country to be equipped with video-link conference facilities. New technology will enable the 57 barristers working out of Number 5 Fountain Court in Birmingham to speak to clients on remand without visiting prisons. Mr Henry Wolton QC, head of chambers, said the video links could lead to considerable savings in legal costs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In addition to the Shamgar Commission report,  another issue raised in today's cabinet meeting was that of  Jerusalem, following the prime minister's remarks regarding the  possibility of the PLO chairman's visiting the city. Minister  Shetrit spoke about the need to intensify building activity in  Jerusalem, but the prime minister noted the legal problems  involved in land confiscation. Minister Bar'am urged that  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert not be left out of the picture in  order to avoid playing into the hands of the extremists in the  city. Police Minister Shahal complained that Olmert routinely  fails to appear at meetings of the subcommittee on security  affairs -- which operates in the framework of the Ministerial  Committee on Jerusalem Affairs -- but rather sends a different  representative on his behalf each time.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the  ministers were told that those running the autonomy are  attempting to spread their authority beyond the regions of Gaza  and Jericho, and efforts are being made to stop this.    The ministers also dealt with the tough living conditions of  foreign workers in Israel. Minister Peres said it was a mistake  to bring in workers from abroad. Ministers Peres and Shohat  criticized Minister Shetrit for encroaching on their ministerial  spheres.</p>

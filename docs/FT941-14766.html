			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Rules on relocating homeless to ease The government will tomorrow publish plans for easing the requirement on local authorities to rehouse homeless families in permanent accommodation. Under the proposals, homeless single mothers with children would no longer be given priority for local-authority or housing-association homes. Councils would instead be able to house homeless families in temporary accommodation such as flats owned by private landlords. Local authority and housing association homes would be allocated to those in greatest need, including those already housed who need larger accommodation. The move follows a promise to review the allocation of housing to the homeless made by Sir George Young, housing minister, at the Conservative party conference in October. Sir George told the conference that it was hard to explain to a young couple who wait for a home before starting a family 'that they cannot be rehoused ahead of the unmarried teenager expecting her first, probably unplanned, child'. Speaking at a housing debate organised by Roof magazine, Sir George yesterday repeated the government's commitment to providing a safety net for vulnerable people such as homeless single mothers. But he said that homelessness should not necessarily mean priority for getting local authority or housing association homes. Increasing the supply of housing for rent was the key to tackling homelessness, the minister said. He added: 'I see no reason why the private sector shouldn't play a far greater role in helping the homeless.' The plans were condemned as 'indecent, unpleasant and amoral' by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman. He said they were an attempt to punish those the government believed had acted irresponsibly.</p>

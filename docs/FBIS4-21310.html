			<p>BFN     [Text] Akita, April 19 KYODO -- Police said Tuesday [19  April] they have arrested two Iranians on suspicion of receiving  opium in parcels mailed from Russia, the first time Russia has  been implicated as part of an opium drug route into Japan.    Police said they seized some 2 kilograms of the drug with a  street value of about 16 million yen when they arrested Saeid  Molaei Kineh Varsi, 25, and Karimi Davoud, 26, both living in  Gunma Prefecture.    Police said the two are suspected of conspiring to receive a  parcel containing heroin sent from Moscow to the Central Post  Office in Akita in northern Japan last Wednesday.    Mail to Akita normally passes through Tokyo and police said  it was at that point the heroin was discovered during a customs  investigation.</p>

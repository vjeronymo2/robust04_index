			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> E. GERMAN TEACHERS GET FACTS IN O.C.  </P> <P> From now on, when Gudrun Sickert teaches her East German students about life in  America, she will be teaching them lessons she has learned herself.  </P> <P> Until a month ago, the 34-year-old teacher's impressions of the United States  were limited to the movies and to what she had been taught in school. But now,  after spending a month in Orange County along with 10 other East German  teachers, those impressions have changed forever.  </P> <P> As she prepared to return home on Friday, Sickert expressed her excitement over  no longer being limited to showing her students slides provided to her by the  government, which she said depicted a slanted view of the United States.  </P> <P> "Half of the slides were of the homeless," Sickert said in fluent English. "The  other slides consisted of workers in factories who appeared extremely  exploited. These did not present a very good view of America. Now I can tell my  pupils much more about the United States, and I think they will believe me."  </P> <P> During their monthlong stay, the teachers were matched with host families  throughout the county. They participated in several forums at local colleges  and visited typical tourist attractions such as Disneyland, Sea World, Palm  Springs and Hollywood.  </P> <P> Their trip was arranged by the American Host Foundation, a Garden Grove-based  organization which has brought more than 16,000 teachers to the United States  from overseas since 1962.  </P> <P> These teachers were selected by the foundation because of their stand against  Marxist-Leninist teachings. Shortly before political reforms took place in the  country, the teachers had formed the Union of Independent Teachers for  Democracy, which was opposed to teaching children communism as a way of life.  </P> <P> "The only places we were allowed to speak was in churches," said Sickert, who  serves as spokeswoman for the group. "We met with parents who were having  trouble with the education system and with all people interested in changing  education."  </P> <P> In October, several teachers in the group were in danger of being dismissed  from their jobs when they backed a colleague who refused to continue with  traditional teachings. But in the midst of the controversy, the opening of the  Berlin Wall and other changes took place in the country and the controversy  faded.  </P> <P> "When we formed the organization, we just wanted to improve things," Sickert  said. "We didn't think there would be such changes. It took us some time to  understand it all.  </P> <P> "I think only a person who has been to prison for many years could understand  how we felt," Sickert said. "We were treated like small children and told how  to do things and what to do. Now, we use our brains and can be human beings."  </P> <P> Although they are experiencing freedom for the first time, the teachers said  their country is still struggling through great economic problems.  </P> <P> "We are glad to be free, but there are many troubles," said Heidemarie  Schoeler, who teaches engineering. "The factories don't know how to stand the  competition of the Western world. They have old technology and machinery."  </P> <P> But the euphoria of freedom has yet to wear off.  </P> <P> "We feel as if we were born again," said Monika Beul, who teaches Russian and  music. "It's a new life." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

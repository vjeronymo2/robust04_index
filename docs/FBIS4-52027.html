			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano (a member of the House of Councilors  from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) said: "I believe the  Nanjing atrocity [Nankin gyakusatsu] is a fabrication." In  reaction, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], stated on 4 May: "Nagano's  remark raises questions about his qualifications as a cabinet  member. The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his  remark. His remark carries a heavy responsibility." Kubo made  it clear the SDPJ will hold Nagano and the Hata cabinet  responsible for the controversial remark. With regard to the  Nanjing atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers during the  Pacific War, the Tokyo High Court admitted the occurrence of the  event in its ruling on the Ienaga textbook trial in October  1993. China is expected to react against, and the Hata cabinet  will certainly be hard-pressed to deal with, the justice  minister's controversial remark.    Commenting on the MAINICHI SHIMBUN report, Kubo lashed out,  saying: "There is much evidence that substantiates the Nanjing  atrocity. Denying the atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers  is tantamount to denying Japan's war of aggression. His remark  is based on a wrong position. On what ground did he make it?  The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his remark, and  questions about Nagano's qualifications as a cabinet member  should be raised."    During the interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice Minister  Nagano said: "It is wrong to view the Pacific War as a Japanese  war of aggression." Kubo took this part of his remarks  seriously. Noting that former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  definitely stated that "it was a Japanese war of aggression and  a wrong war," Kubo stressed: "A minister of the Hata government  that is supposed to have succeeded the Hosokawa government made  clear his view that flatly denies former Prime Minister  Hosokawa's view. We have no choice but to think that the  character of the coalition government has changed."</p>

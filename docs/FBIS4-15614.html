			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, As UNIAN reported earlier, Ukraine's Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko was in Turkey on 7 April on a one-day  official visit. In the opinion of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry  officials, the visit was quite successful. Ways to intensify  bilateral economic relations were discussed. According to the  Foreign Ministry, the two sides attach particularly great  importance to the interaction within the Black Sea Economic  Cooperation framework, especially the fulfilment of bilateral  and multilateral cooperation projects in investments, first of  all in the sphere of infrastructure modernization and  integration in sea, automobile, and air transport.    Turkey is looking for access to the Ukrainian market and  proposes cooperation in such spheres as metallurgy and metal  work, food processing, ship-building, carriage and bus  construction, textiles, sewn goods, cellulose and paper, mining,  coal, chemical and petrochemical industries.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAND OPENING OF ISLIP RIDGE TRAIL  </P> <P> Completion of a new trail is always a cause to celebrate. And that's just what  the San Gabriel Mountains Trail Builders intend to do next Saturday at the  grand opening of the group's Islip Ridge Trail.  </P> <P> The trail provides a new route from the Crystal Lake Recreation Area in Angeles  National Forest to the top of Mt. Islip. The Trail Builders, a volunteer group  under the leadership of Charles Jones, worked thousands of hours to blaze, then  build, the pathway.  </P> <P> Trail connoisseurs will appreciate the look -- and feel -- of a hand-built  trail. The moderate grade, well-engineered switchbacks, rock work and the way  the path gently crosses the land are due to the skill and hard work of many  dedicated volunteers.  </P> <P> Mt. Islip (pronounced eye-slip) is not named, as you might guess, for a clumsy  mountaineer, but for Canadian George Islip, who homesteaded in San Gabriel  Canyon a century ago.  </P> <P> The mountain is not one of the tallest San Gabriel Mountain peaks, but its  relatively isolated position on the spine of the range makes it stand out. The  summit offers the hiker fine views of the middle portion of the Angeles  National Forest high country and the metropolis.  </P> <P> Mt. Islip has long been a popular destination for hikers. The mountain was  particularly popular with Occidental College students, who, in 1909, built a  huge cairn (heap of boulders) dubbed the Occidental Monument atop the summit.  </P> <P> The monument, which had the name Occidental on top, stood for about two decades  until the Forest Service cleared the summit of Mt. Islip to make room for a  fire lookout tower. Today, the monument and fire lookout are long gone, but the  stone foundation of the fire lookout's living quarters still remains.  </P> <P> The new trail to Mt. Islip climbs the forested shoulder of the mountain, and  intersects a summit trail that leads to the peak.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Azusa, take the  Highway 39/Azusa Avenue exit. Drive north on Highway 39 for 24 miles to the  turnoff for the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. After a mile you'll reach the  Forest Service entry station ($3 per vehicle).  </P> <P> Continue another mile to the Crystal Lake Visitor Center, which is open on  weekends from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., then a half-mile to a large dirt parking lot  on your right and signed Windy Gap Trail on your left.  </P> <P> (Next Saturday morning only, you'll be able to continue past the parking area  another mile to Deer Flat Campground, where the trail dedication ceremony takes  place.)  </P> <P> The hike: Ascend moderately on Windy Gap Trail, which passes near a campground  and heads into the cool of the forest. The trail crosses a Forest Service road  leading to Deer Flat Campground, ascends some more and reaches the dirt South  Mount Hawkins Truck Road. Cross the road and look left for the beginning of  Islip Ridge Trail, which some of the Trail Builders like to call the Big  Cienega Cut-off because it passes near Big Cienega Spring.  </P> <P> Enjoy the pleasant trail as it ascends moderately, more or less west, through  pine, spruce and cedar forest. A bit more than a mile from the top, Islip Ridge  Trail turns sharply north into a more sparse alpine forest.  </P> <P> The trail intersects the path coming from Windy Gap. Turn left and walk a short  but steep distance to the top of 8,250-foot Mt. Islip.  </P> <P> Dedication ceremonies for the new Islip Ridge Trail will be held next Saturday  at Deer Flat Group Campground in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. Breakfast  will be provided by REI outdoor gear and clothing store of San Dimas and the  Big Santa Anita Historical Society.  </P> <P> Breakfast will be from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., dedication ceremonies from 9:45  to 10:15, with a 10:30 hike along Islip Ridge Trail to Mt. Islip.

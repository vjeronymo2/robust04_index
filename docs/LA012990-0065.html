			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> THERMAL;  </P> <P> BACK PAY AWARDED IN 9-YEAR DISPUTE  </P> <P> A nearly decade-long labor struggle came to an end as 58 packing shed workers,  46 of them women, collected compensation checks from a $1.4-million settlement  with Sun World Inc. The packing firm was found guilty of unfair labor practices  in failing to rehire the members of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Workers Local  78-B after a brief strike in 1981. U.S. Supreme Court justices ruled last year  to let the back-pay award stand. Some workers received checks for more than  $50,000.  </P></p>

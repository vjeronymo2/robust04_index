			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: TSW and UK Safety delay talks until March TELEVISION South West, the former ITV company, will in March re-open talks about a reverse takeover with UK Safety Group, the Bristol-based specialist shoe manufacturer. TSW, shares in which were suspended at 29p yesterday, and UK Safety decided that a full set of 1992 accounts would be needed for detailed negotiations to get under way. The group, replaced as the ITV broadcaster for the west of England by Westcountry on January 1, expects to complete its final set of trading accounts by the end of February. A reverse takeover of UK Safety to give the shoe manufacturer a Stock Exchange listing is the most likely future for TSW, although a liquidation has not been ruled out. An auction of remaining equipment will be held in April and attempts will be made to sell the Plymouth headquarters site. Because of the depressed state of the property market short-term lets are more likely. TSW's assets include a tiny, but valuable stake in Astra, the Luxembourg-based satellite system.</p>

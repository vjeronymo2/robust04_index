			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> It is possible to estimate the error in altitude for pressures above 31.00 inHg by adding 100 feet in aircraft altitude for each .10 inHg. However, significant recurring training would be required to ensure all pilots correctly apply the appropriate correction during the appropriate phase of flight. If two pilots flying aircraft in the same vicinity are not applying the same correction, a highly dangerous situation is created when they are at the same altitude although they believe they are at different altitudes relative to each other. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accurate altitude information is essential for normal flight operations and critical to certain phases of flight. Without an accurate altitude reading, a pilot cannot safely execute an instrument approach in instrument weather conditions unless certain restrictions are followed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Proposed Rulemaking and Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On March 12, 1992, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) inviting all persons to submit written comments on the proposed amendment to &sect;91.92 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (57 FR 8830). The FAA received comments to the NPRM from the Air Traffic Control Association, the Air Transport Association (ATA), the Airline Pilots Association, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), and the Canadian Airline Pilots Association (CALPA). All five commenters responded favorably to the amendment; however, the ATA, KLM, and CALPA had additional comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA requested, for purposes of clarification, that the final rule state that the restrictions are to be applied in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> region when the barometric pressure exceeds 31.00 inHg. The FAA disagrees that the suggested additional language is needed. The application of this rule is not intended to be limited to any geographical area, and discussion of regions may lead to confusion concerning the rule's applicability. The final rule clearly states the rule is applicable to any route of flight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) suggested that a note addressing the Outer Marker (OM) crossing altitude as published on the applicable instrument approach procedure be added either to the rule or as part of the NOTAM implementing the rule. It argued that very low temperatures require an increase of the published (standard atmosphere) crossing altitude, while extremely high barometric pressures would call for a decrease in the crossing altitude and that, in most cases, both effects would cancel out each other. KLM stated, however, that if flight crewmembers only increased the crossing altitude for temperature, as is the normal procedure, an incorrect crossing altitude would be computed that would not provide an accurate check for intercepting the instrument landing system (ILS) glidepath. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA agrees with KLM that extremely cold temperatures and high barometric pressures, which usually accompany one another, normally cancel out the effects of each other in altitude computations. The FAA does not believe, however, that a note concerning this phenomenon is appropriate for the FAR. An appropriate note might be included in the Airman's Information Manual (AIM). CALPA also commented that the NPRM contained no reference to corrections for extremely cold air temperatures. It stated that Canadian airline procedure compensates for lower than normal ambient temperatures. CALPA suggested adding to the final rule instrument approach procedures that contain tabulations allowing the pilot to make corrections when very cold temperatures are experienced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA is aware of the Canadian procedures on altimetry and recently completed a study entitled ``Extreme Cold Weather Altimetry.'' At this time, however, the FAA has not developed any procedures as a result of the study. The FAA will amend the rule should procedures formulated from this study dictate an amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Temporary Restrictions on Flight Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the above discussion, the FAA finds that the occurrence of abnormally high barometric pressure conditions creates an operational situation that requires immediate action to maintain safety of flight in the affected areas. It is necessary for the FAA to issue temporary restrictions on certain instrument flight rules (IFR) approaches and visual flight rules (VFR) operations while extreme weather conditions exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

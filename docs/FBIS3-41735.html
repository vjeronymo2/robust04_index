			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Tutorskaya, IZVESTIYA correspondent: </F> ``Ministry of Health Experts Report Hundreds of Thousands of  Pediculosis Cases'']    [Text]Last year, there were 337,333  officially recorded cases of human louse infestation, which is  what we diffidently call pediculosis.    Specialists equate those who have lice with carriers of  infection.    Because no one knows the moment and hour that, for example,  an epidemic of dreaded, in the memory of the older generation,  typhus will spread together with these lice. Typhus strikes the  heart and central nervous system, and there were in the past  quite a few cases of patient death. Experts of the Russian  Ministry of Health emphasize in particular that it is very  difficult to detect everyone with pediculosis. While 136,222  people were recorded in the first 5 months of 1993 (which is  slightly less than last year on a monthly basis), this is no  reason to rejoice:in what places are adults and children the  focus of attention in this respect? Obviously, in hospitals,  children's institutions, hostels and summer camps. But many  hospitals are shut down in the summer for repairs. Students have  gone home. And the number of camps where children can improve  their health is rapidly declining.... So that this figure of  136,000 plus people could be considered the result of screening  a sample.    Mikhail Narkevich, Russian Ministry of Health expert,  believes that ``The cause does not lie only in dirt itself. In  the course of civilian unrest, major migrations and roaming, not  only the lifestyle but also the emotional status of people  changes. Stress, apathy, nervousness and lack of self-confidence  pave the way for infections in general. And for pediculosis too.  The present ``surge'' started before the cost of soap and of  washing at a bath house rose. And the insects have been found in  many apartments with all the amenities, with rows of shampoos  and hot water. Pharmacies are being supplied very poorly with  louse-control agents.''    There is another real threat that has arisen in the last few  days, cholera in Tadjikistan. It arrived there from Pakistan,  with tourists. With the present increase in migration and  enormous flux of refugees, there is the possibility of cholera  ``arriving'' in Russian cities too. It is transmitted through  dirty water, insufficiently pure food and dirty hands.    The saddest thing of all is that, in general, the means of  salvation are simple. As for pedi..., that is to say, pardon me,  lice, we postwar children were spared by kerosene. It is simple  and effective.</p>

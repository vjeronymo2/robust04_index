			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TESTS FIND NO RADIOACTIVE POLLUTION IN CITY WATER WELLS  </P> <P> Radioactivity levels in water from city wells in the San Fernando Valley were  five times below state drinking water standards in recent tests, indicating  there has been no radioactive pollution of the water supply, Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Reports of contamination at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, run by the  Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International in eastern Ventura County,  prompted Mayor Tom Bradley to ask the DWP to investigate possible pollution in  the northwest San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> With the Rocketdyne lab more than 15 miles from the nearest city water well in  North Hollywood, it would take "many hundreds of years" for contaminants from  the lab to reach the wells, said Bruce Kuebler, DWP engineer in charge of water  quality.  </P> <P> In disclosing the recent test results, DWP spokesman Ed Freudenberg said water  officials "are obviously concerned that people will think there's a connection  between a potential problem out in the Santa Susana area and . . . our water  supply."  </P> <P> Bradley asked the DWP to conduct an investigation of ground water in the  Chatsworth area in response to news accounts of a U.S. Department of Energy  report on contamination at the Rocketdyne lab. Water officials said they will  provide their report to the mayor by May 24.  </P> <P> Kuebler said the DWP is testing all its wells for radioactivity on a quarterly  basis this year, in compliance with state drinking water regulations. "If any  changes in the very low natural radioactivity levels occur, we certainly would  be aware of those changes," he said.  </P> <P> About 15% of the Los Angeles water supply is drawn from wells in North  Hollywood and near Griffith Park.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Shilnikov, economic correspondent: "The </F> Negotiations Are Over"]    [Text] On 11 February "groups of experts from Tyumen  Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the  Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, having discussed the drafts of  the treaty submitted by the State Committee of the Russian  Federation and Tyumen Oblast in conjunction with the  Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs, agreed on  the following":    Subsection One: "It is necessary and possible to combine"  the  drafts of the treaty submitted by Tyumen Oblast and the  Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs for the  purpose of elaborating a single, agreed draft treaty on this  basis.    "Necessary and possible"--this is quite good in itself. What  is the subject of the treaty? Take a look at the second  subsection: "The subject of the treaty is the whole group of  interrelations" between Tyumen Oblast and the two okrugs.    Let us move on from the subject of the treaty to the title.  It is listed in the third subsection: "The working title of the  treaty is the Treaty on the Interrelations of Tyumen Oblast, the  Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the Yamalo-Nenetsk  Autonomous Okrug--with a specific reference in the text of the  treaty to the status of the parties to the treaty as autonomous  and equal members of the Russian Federation."    An old Russian adage tells us: "Go ahead and call it a pot  if  you wish, but do not put it on the stove." This is not the case  here, and this is why I have quoted the third subsection in its  entirety.    This is the time to say something about the structure of the  treaty. Experts are experts, and they make provisions for these  "minutiae." This, therefore, is the structure: the preamble, the  general provisions, the principles of interrelations, the  interrelations of state governing bodies, interrelations with  agencies of local self-government, interrelations with federal  government agencies and their territorial structures,  humanitarian contacts, the settlement of disputes, and the final  provisions.    As we can see, everything is specified in detail. This was  the fourth and last subsection of the protocol of consent, and  now it is time to move on to the protocol of dissent. It  consists of only one sentence: "The groups of experts from  Tyumen Oblast, the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, and the  Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug, having discussed the drafts of  the treaty submitted by the State Committee of the Russian  Federation and Tyumen Oblast in conjunction with the  Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous okrugs, could not  reach a general consensus on the interpretation of the term used  in Article 66 (4) of the Constitution of the Russian  Federation--autonomous okrugs constituting part of the  oblast--and the term proposed jointly by the groups of experts  from the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous  okrugs--`autonomous okrugs located within the  territorial-administrative boundaries of the oblast.'"    The protocol of dissent is cited exactly as written, down to  the last comma. The fourth subsection of Article 66 of the  Constitution is a serious matter and, in general, there is no  reason to expect the parties to find a common language in a  hurry. After all, why would an okrug want to give up its  constitutionally guaranteed status as an equal member of the  federation? The very fact that the experts met for this  conference suggests that the oblast administration has  reconsidered its methods of solving the problem of oblast unity  and has given up making decisions "from a position of strength"  in favor of making decisions "from a position of probability."    This is not a bad change, particularly from the standpoint  of  the economy. After all, while they were fighting, they managed  to cause considerable destruction. To put it more precisely,  they managed to miss several opportunities. All I have to add is  that the oblast administration was represented by the following  experts: G. Chebotarev, L. Berezin, and S. Nikitin; the  Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug was represented by G. Tikhonov,  N. Usoltsev, and V. Sharafilov; the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous  Okrug was represented by A. Arteyev and G. Chudnovskiy.    Now all of this is a matter of public record.</p>

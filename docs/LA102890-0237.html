			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHERCE, BUT CRIBBED  </P> <P> In Kenneth Turan's review of "Preston Sturges" (Sept. 16), you quote Spencer  Tracy from the movie "Pat and Mike" in praising the book (". . . may be lean,  but it is cherce").  </P> <P> Spencer Tracy may have interpreted the lines beautifully, but Ruth Gordon and  Garson Kanin wrote them.  </P> <P> I have seen reviewers and journalists quote actors' lines from films for years  as if the actors who spoke the lines actually invented them. This is a sorry  practice, if journalistically convenient, especially when the article is about,  in your own words, "the most gifted writer/director of comedy that Hollywood  has ever seen."  </P> <P> SHARON SPELMAN  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY  </P></p>

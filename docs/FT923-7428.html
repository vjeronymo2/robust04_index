			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Early rally peters out on lack of buying interest LAST week's excitement in Europe, generated by the thought that a German economic slowdown must eventually lead to lower interest rates, subsided yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT tried to go with the flow but, after an intraday high of 1,563.49, the DAX index came back to close just 7.72 higher at 1,555.42. Dealers said that there was a lack of follow-through buying, as turnover fell from DM4.9bn to DM3.7bn. Hopes rose last Friday when the deputy president of the Bundesbank, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, said that German interest rates would be reviewed in a couple of months' time - this after a sharp fall in German wholesale prices in June. But they dissipated after two other council members, Mr Otmar Issing and Mr Lothar Muller, appeared to take a hard line, Mr Muller saying that Buba would raise the Lombard rate if last month's discount rate rise turned out to have no effect, and Mr Issing that the conditions for a rate cut were a virtual halving of money supply growth, and inflation below 3 per cent. Mannesmann stood out among the day's declines, falling DM5.20 to DM267.30 ahead of Tuesday's first half results. Lufthansa recovered DM2 to DM93, after an intraday high of DM97; yesterday, Germany's DAG white-collar union offered the airline a package of cost-savings which, it claimed, were worth DM500m. PARIS had its thinnest day's trading since January 4, 1991, as volume came to to a paltry FFr933m. The CAC-40 index came off the day's low of 1,741.39 on rumours that a new poll on Maastricht would show support for the treaty, closing up 3.85 at 1,757.31. Eurotunnel rose in early trading on reports of an early settlement to the dispute between the consortium and its contractors. The stock peaked at FFr36.40 before closing down 10 centimes at FFr35. Among gainers, Olipar jumped FFr12.50 or 16 per cent to FFr90 in speculative trading while institutional buying lifted Credit Local by FFr7 or 2.8 per cent to FFr262. MILAN saw a classic technical reaction after last week's heavy losses and dealers said the rise was due to a lack of sellers rather than any buying interest. The Comit index rose 9.73 to 403.43 in turnover estimated at L60bn-L70bn after Friday's L65.9bn. Among leading blue chips, Fiat rose L125 to L4,210 at its official close although it pared its gains later to stand at L4,190. Some shares were suspended temporarily due to excessive gains, including Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura and the insurer Sai. BNA closed up L250 at L4,550 and Sai was up L660 to L12,110. The transport group, Ausiliare, was readmitted to trading after its suspension last week pending details of negotiations for a change in ownership of the group. AMSTERDAM closed early as the stock exchange extended the share suspension caused by a computer failure earlier in the day. The market, extremely quiet before the interruption, will re-open as normal today. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.4 to 113.7. Recent losers rose on bargain-hunting with Daf rising 80 cents to Fl 18.10 and Hoogovens 30 cents firmer at Fl 38.20. STOCKHOLM was largely unchanged, a morning rally fading after a rise in domestic interest rates, and on the softer dollar. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 2.5 to 820.7 in thin turnover of SKr282m after SKr330m. Ericsson B rose SKr2 to SKr116 after last week's weakness and on hopes that its six-month report, due on Thursday, will beat expectations. VIENNA leapt more than 5 per cent on a long-awaited technical reaction to its summer slide. The 18-share ATX index rose 37.43 to 733.51 and the all-share Vienna bourse index gained 12.16 to 354.68. ISTANBUL started the week mostly lower on profit-taking after last week's gains. The 75-share index lost 27.45 to 4,076.98.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1047.72  1046.22  1046.30  1044.77  1044.30  1044.12  1044.52  1045.00  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1047.72    Day's Low  1043.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Aug 14    Aug 13     Aug 12    Aug 11    Aug 10 1042.13   1035.59    1037.76   1044.92   1049.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Marlboro cut points to price war in US PHILIP MORRIS declared an all-out price war in the US tobacco industry yesterday by slashing the price of its Marlboro brand to protect its market share from the rise of discount brands. The cut in the price of America's most popular cigarette and one of the world's most valuable trademarks reductions is restricted to the US market. It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the European Community cigarette market. A packet of Marlboro costs on average around Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that of discount cigarettes selling at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to Philip Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, or nearly 20 per cent, although Philip Morris declined to spell out details. The move sent the shares of tobacco companies plummeting in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At lunchtime, Philip Morris was down 20 per cent, or Dollars 13 1/4 , at Dollars 51 3/8 , while RJR Nabisco dripped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 and American Brands stood Dollars 3 3/8 lower at Dollars 30 3/8 . In London, BAT's share price tumbled 71p to 928p on exceptionally heavy turnover as traders feared that the move could dent the UK group's profits. Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its new strategy. Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market share. The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dropped to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991 as smokers have switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties with no brand image. Philip Morris, which belatedly entered the discount market two years ago, has become a big player in the sector, rivalling RJR Reynolds for market leadership. Philip Morris said its shift in Marlboro strategy was designed to 'grow market share rather than pursue rapid income growth rates which might erode our leading market place position.'

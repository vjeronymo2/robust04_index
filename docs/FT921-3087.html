			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (16): Hottest place in the world - Edward Balls visits Chevron's oil terminal on the Niger delta MONSTROUS ham sandwiches, Folger's coffee and the singing drawl of southern US accents are a rare combination, seldom found more than a few hundred miles north of Jackson, Mississippi; apart, that is, from the rig control room of Chevron's main Nigerian oil terminal at Escravos, perched on the mouth of the Niger delta. It is more than coincidence that so many of Nigeria's expatriate oilmen hail from the south-eastern states of America. Many of them, including the terminal's new production manager, Mr Guy Hollingsworth, learned the oil trade in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico: perfect training for the hot, tranquil and oil-rich seas off the west African coast. 'Nigeria has one of the most benign offshore environments in the world,' Mr Hollingsworth says. With no hurricanes, no big winds and platforms very close to shore, the average North Sea oilman might be forgiven for thinking these Nigerian-based guys have an easy life. Yet while offshore Nigeria may be tranquil, things are far from benign back on land. 'The biggest difficulties we encounter here are the logistics of getting supplies in and out, and security - theft, threats and violence,' he explains. Security at the terminal is very tight. Armed guards now patrol 24 hours a day after a riot last autumn. That followed the swamping, by a terminal-bound supply ship, of a canoe full of villagers early one morning. Fourteen people drowned, and the local inhabitants took their revenge. Chevron's Nigerian employees fled and most of the expatriate staff were helicoptered out to a platform at sea, while Mr Hollingsworth's predecessor cowered in an attic. The scars of the disturbance - boarded-up windows and damaged vehicles - remain. It is not only security and the difficulty of getting a really cold beer that differentiates producing oil in the Niger delta from the Mexican Gulf. On almost every score - facilities, safety, environment, food - Chevron's Nigerian operation falls short of its US standards. Chevron's corporate policy, I was regularly informed, is to maintain the same standard across its entire global operation. But the company readily admits that this remains an aspiration rather than reality in Nigeria. The sun danced across oil-skimmed water as our helicopter swooped over the Okan field to land on Nigeria's oldest offshore platform. This, I was informed, was the least well maintained, most uncomfortable to live on and most environmentally unfriendly platform Chevron maintains; it showed. Nigerian government regulations permit only 100 parts of oil per million parts of water per day, and an average of 75 parts per month, to be pumped into the sea as the oil is filtered on the platform before being piped ashore. That day the Okan platform was pumping anywhere between 90 and 150 parts per million. Not that the government is particularly stringent about monitoring the standards it sets. 'We could lie about it,' explains Chevron's young American safety and environment manager. 'But I want to tell the truth; and the truth is that we are not complying.' Chevron's problems stem in part from the way in which the Gulf oil company neglected necessary maintenance work before Chevron took it over in 1985. But the depressed state of the whole oil industry in the mid-1980s and the subsequent rush to squeeze out as much production as possible during the Gulf war means that all companies face similar problems. Okan's capacity is 50,000 barrels a day, but it is currently producing 70,000 a day including 15,000 barrels of (oily) water. The company is now taking steps to improve its safety and environment record. It has a Facilities Upgrade Project in place which will consume Pounds 125m a year over the next five years to upgrade the decaying infrastructure. Oil filtration units will be installed at all platforms. Already, the Escravos operation is complying with environmental standards 40 per cent of the time, up from 20 per cent last year. But maintenance must go hand in hand with production and expansion. Chevron has responded smartly to the incentives to increase reserves embodied in the new Memorandum of Understanding, signed last year. Three drilling rigs were working out of Escravos last year. Now there are five, with plans to add two more. 'Nigeria is one of the hottest places in the world in the oil business,' says Mr Hollingsworth, 'and for Chevron it is the hottest.' Oil is not the only valuable resource concealed within the Delta. Flying to Escravos from Lagos, the first signs of industry below are the associated gas flares which continually burn off the gas produced as an offshoot from the oil production process. Nigeria is rich in natural gas; but more than 70 per cent of gas produced each year is burned away. 'There are very few places in the world where associated gas is flared,' explains Mr Donald Mahura, managing director of Chevron's Nigerian subsidiary. One important reason why so much gas is wasted in Nigeria is the low level of prices set by the government which removes the incentive for the companies to exploit these gas reserves. The government has been trying to persuade the joint ventures to exploit this gas. Chevron is planning to build a terminal at Escravos to tap this associated gas and sell the bulk of it to the domestic electricity industry. Construction should begin in 1993 with production on stream by 1995. But the scheme will go ahead only if the company's Lagos-based executives can negotiate a sufficiently attractive supply contract with the government. So the problems faced by the oil and gas industry in Nigeria are very different from those thrown up by the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea. The challenges which animate the conversation of Chevron's US oilmen are to found onshore: security at Escravos, politics in Lagos. 'Sometimes these guys might think this is Mississippi,' Mr Hollingsworth says. 'But it sure ain't' In Nigeria, finding and extracting the oil seems to be the easy part.</p>

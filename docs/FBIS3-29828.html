President Kim Il-song in his historical letter reviewed the  glorious course of struggle covered by the Korean young people  and their immortal contributions to the advance of the Korean  revolution and gave a comprehensive exposition of the fighting  tasks facing the Korean people and youth to meet the  requirements of a new, higher stage of the developing revolution  and ways for their fulfilment.    President Kim Il-song said that the young people should  support the leadership of the party with loyalty, united in one  mind around Comrade Kim Chong-il, and thoroughly establish the  party's leadership system in the league.    Chairman of the Central Committee of the LSWYK Choe Yong-hae  in his report at the meeting said that the letter is an immortal  great programme of the youth movement indicating the way to be  followed by the socialist youth movement and a highly important  work giving the conviction of victory and courage to the world's  revolutionary people and youth.    The reporter referred to a new upswing effected in the work  of the LSWYK and a great change in the ideological and spiritual  traits through energetic efforts to implement the tasks set  forth in the letter.    "The officials of the LSWYK and the young people are now  striving hard to prepare themselves to be young vanguards  defending the party and the leader in the van with their lives  and lifeguards and death-defying corps defending and glorifying  Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses, holding  aloft the slogan `Let us uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il with singlehearted unity!' and loudly singing the song  `No Motherland Without You'", the reporter said, and stressed:    "All the young people should firmly prepare themselves to be  true vanguard fighters unfailingly loyal to the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, united around him in one mind in order to  carry through the tasks set forth in the historical letter of  the great leader President Kim Il-song and successfully carry  forward the revolutionary cause of chuche to completion."</p>

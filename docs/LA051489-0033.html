			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR A FIRST  </P> <P> While I agree with Boyd that "it's high time someone set the record straight on  when the first TV movie was made," his assignation of that honor to NBC's "The  Pied Piper of Hamelin" is seriously misplaced.  </P> <P> During the first season of "Playhouse 90" on CBS (1956-57), no fewer than 10 of  this renowned live drama show's 39 presentations were feature-length films  produced especially for television. (The first was "The Country Husband," based  on a John Cheever story, which aired on Nov. 1, 1956.) It seems to me that  these qualify as "made-for-TV movies" by any but the most hair-splitting  definition.  </P> <P> Even these had at least one antecedent, however: a 72-minute film called "Black  Forest," starring Peggy Ann Garner and Akim Tamiroff, made in Germany by an  American company, for distribution to independent stations. Variety reviewed  this production on Feb. 3, 1954, noting that "the 'expressly-for-TV' angle  lends itself strongly to prestige-type ballyhoo on the part of station and  sponsor, and its effect on the public is not to be minimized."  </P> <P> HOWARD H. PROUTY  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

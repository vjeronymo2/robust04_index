			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CRICHTON'S 'JURASSIC PARK' IS AN OLD-TIME THRILLER NOVEL  </P> <P> "THE ENTIRE world is increasingly described by the metaphor of the theme park.  Paris is a theme park, although it's too expensive, and the 'park employees'  are unpleasant and sullen," writes Michael Crichton in his new novel from  Knopf, "Jurassic Park."  </P> <P> This thriller is for adults who are still fascinated by dinosaurs. What a  whopping story it is and what a movie it will make. (Steven Spielberg already  has the rights.) The thing about Crichton is that while he tells us his  exciting story, he also fills the reader up to the brim with scientific facts  and lore.  </P> <P> THE APPEALING star of "Pretty Woman" -- Julia Roberts -- has her next film  beginning on Nov. 12 and, as I've said before, it will be titled "Dying Young."  </P> <P> Director Joel Schumacher and 20th Century-Fox have been casting about for a  male star and now they've found one. He is Campbell Scott, who racked up raves  with his onstage "Hamlet" recently in San Diego. He scored in the AIDS movie  "Longtime Companion" and has another big film for Bernardo Bertolucci under his  belt. It is based on the famed Paul Bowles novel "The Sheltering Sky."  </P> <P> The fascinating thing about Campbell Scott is that he is the son of the great  actor George C. Scott and the great actress Colleen Dewhurst. Talk about acting  genes -- this kid has them!  </P> <P> HASN'T THE Donald Trump relationship with that New York City powerhouse of  P.R., Howard Rubenstein, come unraveled? The Trump One is looking around for a  new representative between himself and the press.  </P> <P> And in the meantime, although Marla Maples came off looking quite impressively  spectacular in Vanity Fair, she is not happy about the story. Says they  promised her a cover!  </P> <P> And hasn't Ivana made a big decision we'll be hearing about at the end of this  week -- and isn't it about time?  </P> <P> Incidentally, if you think that just because every time she puts her nose out  in public, Ivana is surrounded by photographers, don't make the mistake of  believing she is kicking up her heels. Everything Mrs. Trump does these days is  strictly business -- either for her coming book career, her designing label, or  her running of the Plaza Hotel. She has the picture that her economic future  could be strictly up to her! So Ivana has been working like a dog the last few  weeks while her doctor and friends beg her to lie down and rest. She is taking  antibiotics for what has been described as "walking pneumonia." And those trips  to Europe are also to shore up business and lure travel agents to the Plaza.  </P> <P> ONE OF the famous triad of America's most famous female TV cops is Kate  Jackson, who helped create "Charlie's Angels." Kate has had some ups and downs  and hasn't really worked in almost two years. She had a bout with breast  cancer, but says she is now A-OK.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm starting over," Kate tells me. "I am better than ever in my  whole life. I have an entirely new outlook on life and I have back the  enthusiasm I had when I was 20!"  </P> <P> Kate has a project in development at ABC, but more than that we'll see her in  the CBS-TV movie "The Stranger Within" on Nov. 27. This was written by John  Pielmeier, who also wrote "Agnes of God."  </P></p>

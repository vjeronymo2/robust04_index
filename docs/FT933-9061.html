			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Cuba tipped as holiday hot spot TWO LARGE travel companies yesterday designated Cuba as the next mass-market holiday destination and announced programmes which will immediately quadruple the number of UK visitors to the island. Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, is offering two-week holidays at the beach resort of Varadero from next May, with prices from Pounds 299 to Pounds 1,399. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours marketing director, said the resort has several foreign-managed hotels. Mr Carrick refused to say how many holidaymakers Airtours would take to Cuba. He said, however, that the company would offer weekly charter flights from Gatwick via Manchester to Varadero from early May to mid-October. This suggests that Airtours plans to fly about 8,000 travellers to Cuba during this period. Mr Carrick said the programme would be extended into the winter if it proves successful. Unijet, another tour operator, said it also intended to announce a programme to Cuba. Mr Chris Parker, Unijet chairman, said the company planned to take 1,000 holidaymakers to Cuba next year and hoped to increase its capacity to 3,000 a year. Mr Carrick said authoritative statistics were not available, but an estimated 3,000 UK residents are believed to have visited Cuba last year. The island is a popular holiday destination for Canadians, Germans and other Europeans. The growth of Cuban tourism has been hampered, however, by hostility from the US. Mr Carrick said he believed the UK market had been slow to take off because attitudes to Cuba had been affected by Britain's close ties with the US. He said tensions between the US and Cuba had led to a 'somewhat jaundiced' view of the island in the UK. Americans made the island a playground of the Caribbean in its pre-Communist days. Mr Carrick said Airtours would not hide Cuba's problems from its customers. Brochures would tell them that buses in Cuba were irregular, that taxis were sometimes hard to find and that petrol was rationed. He said he had been assured that visitors to Varadero would have enough petrol for their hire cars.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: The bulls among the fund groups - Serious Money NEVER MIND the new funds which investment managers keep advertising in newspaper and mailshots. Would it be better for investors to buy shares in the fund management groups themselves? The question is given particular topicality by the forthcoming offer of a 25 per cent stake in Gartmore, the fund management group owned by Banque Indosuez. But it is also prompted by investment conditions, which are bringing fund management groups a double benefit. First of all, world stock markets are reaching all-time highs. Secondly, low interest rates are persuading private investors to switch out of the building society and into equity-based products such as unit and investment trusts. Both factors serve to increase the level of funds under management, on which the managers' fees are based. Better still, the two elements are mutually reinforcing. The surge of private investor money is helping to push the stock market to new heights, and the sight of higher share prices is encouraging more investors to enter the market. It is an old maxim that it costs no more to manage Pounds 150m of funds than it does to manage Pounds 100m. Once a fund management group has covered its fixed costs (office space, computers, salaries and so on), any increase in revenue goes straight through to the bottom line. Conversely, a fall in funds can have a disproportionate effect on profits. Accordingly, as Graeme Caton, of James Capel, puts it 'fund management group shares are highly geared to world stock markets.' So if you believe that stock markets will continue to enjoy their bullish run, and that the low-inflation, low-interest-rate scenario will continue, fund management group shares might, on the surface, seem a highly attractive investment. Looking at the US, one can see the phenomenal amounts of money which can be shifted into collective funds, once investors decide to make the move. In 1980, only 6 per cent of US investors owned mutual funds; today it is 27 per cent. Leading US group Fidelity had Dollars 20bn under management 10 years ago; it now has Dollars 220bn. Rival Vanguard has grown from Dollars 7bn to Dollars 114bn over the same period. US investors have been placing around Dollars 1bn a day into mutual funds (the American equivalent of unit trusts) this year, in response to low interest rates. While UK investment flows will never match the absolute levels of those in the US, an equivalent shift in British investors' portfolios would have an enormous impact on the profits of UK fund management groups. Traditionally, the average Briton has been happy to keep savings in building societies, which have a much better reputation than the US savings and loans institutions. Just 4 per cent of UK investors own unit trusts. As ever, there are no free lunches. The markets have already taken into account the bull factors for fund management group shares and have reacted accordingly. M &amp; G shares, for example, passed the Pounds 10 a share mark yesterday, around 50 per cent up from their low for the year. Perpetual shares have now climbed to 807p, compared with 142p a year ago. The ratings accorded to some of these companies are discounting a lot of future growth. Perpetual's shares are now trading on a historic p/e of 64; Aberdeen Trust shares are on a p/e of 39. On the other hand, the last time that Perpetual announced results (in May), interim pre-tax profits had more than doubled from Pounds 2.18m to Pounds 5.09m, on the back of a climb in funds under management from Pounds 846m to Pounds 1.34bn Funds have since risen to Pounds 2bn thanks to the host of performance awards Perpetual received at the end of 1992, which have made it a prime choice for IFAs and retail investors in 1993. Perpetual represents one of the purest plays on the growth in retail funds in the UK fund management sector. Other companies, such as Mercury Asset Management, depend to a much greater extent on managing pension fund money. While this rises in line with markets, it is a mature industry, with improving market share the best way of increasing funds under management. Pension fund management is also a much lower margin business than managing unit or investment trusts - which is one reason why a group such as MAM trades on a much lower multiple (around 17) than Perpetual. (Another factor, of course, is Mercury's much greater size; it cannot grow as fast as Perpetual.) Around 77 per cent of Gartmore's assets under management are pension funds. However, its strong recent performance record means it is gaining new pension clients and since it already manages around Pounds 2bn of unit and investment trusts, it should benefit from the private investor effect. Graeme Caton, of James Capel, thinks Gartmore shares will 'probably be floated on a small p/e premium to MAM, and there will be no difficulty in selling them.' The bull arguments could be easily undermined, by one thing: a bear market. Although there is good reason to expect that low interest rates may be here for a while, the high ratings mean that fund management shares must be vulnerable to a correction. So if you are already nervous about the market's dizzy heights, fund management shares are definitely not for you.</p>

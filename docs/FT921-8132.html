			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Time is up for plastics About 6m items of large electronic equipment which have reached the end of their use will be disposed of this year in the UK by dumping them in landfill sites. They include computers, photocopiers, TVs, video recorders and microwave cookers. But most of them contain untapped wealth in the form of metals and plastics which can be recycled. The material produced in Britain alone is worth about Pounds 50m a year and if re-used it would save industry Pounds 10m a year. The problem has been examined by the Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology (Cest), an independent organisation funded by 19 companies and working with government and higher education. Cest has established a technical advisory group to encourage industry to develop solutions to recycling these materials. It includes large companies like Dow and IBM and local authorities and the Departments of the Environment and Trade and Industry. The report says there is a market for reclaimed metal but the market for recycled plastics has only been for inferior applications. This is because the manufacturers of plastics, electronic equipment and waste processors have spent little effort to use high-quality plastics that could be recycled. Modular construction of equipment makes dismantling much easier. Loewe, the German TV manufacturer, makes televisions which divide easily into four main sections. Various methods to encourage recycling are examined in the report. These include levies on electronic equipment and plastics to finance recycling. National governments and the EC should co-operate with industry to implement a recycling policy, it says. If manufacturers fail to respond to environmental pressures they will lose out because consumers will buy products from companies with a better environmental message.

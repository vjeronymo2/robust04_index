			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Continental top ten invaded by pharmaceuticals - How equity investment fashions changed as last year split into two PHARMACEUTICALS took over the running among European blue chips in the second half of 1991 while cyclicals and banks, which featured earlier in the year, dropped out of the reckoning. Dreams of economic recovery, inspired by a quick end to the Gulf war, were replaced by renewed worries about recession, and a move to defensive stocks. Volvo and Philips in consumer durables still made the top 10, but this partly reflected the severity of their share price losses in 1990. Drug companies have visible earnings, a quality lacking in former luminaries such as real estate developers which, along with worries about Soviet debt, have troubled the banking sector. In addition, continental European drug companies are benefiting from US investment interest, in anticipation of harmonisation in corporate accounting procedures. Mr Mark Tracey, European pharmaceuticals analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, says that US investors have raised their stake in the UK's Glaxo, part of the sector's quality triumvirate along with Astra and Roche, from 9 per cent to around 26 per cent. Information suggests that US investors hold 7 to 8 per cent in Astra and Roche, the former with 60 per cent of its equity restricted to Swedish investors but prospectively wide open to foreigners as Sweden enters the European Community. Other companies, particularly Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, probably generated around 60 per cent of their profits last year from pharmaceuticals as industrial chemicals dropped their contributions; these two are seen as beneficiaries from the growth in drugs, and the more cyclical recovery prospects in bulk chemicals. But why should the continentals be doing so well? Prospects for UK pharmaceutical companies are under threat from inflation, and world-wide pressure on drug pricing. That, says Mr Tracey, is because UK companies get between 35 and 65 per cent of their profits from the US market while the continentals ascribe between zero and 25 per cent to that source. France, depressed for most of November and December by interest rate uncertainty, the Bundesbank's rate rise on December 19 and its own four days later, still managed to produce three of the Eurotrack top 10, and five of the top 15 while Germany was noticeable for its absence. France performed better over the year, as Germany's expansion to the east came to be perceived as an economic liability, rather than an opportunity. But it also had more big companies in defensive and consumer-oriented areas. Mr John Fordyce of Ferri International in Paris sees technical features, and timing, in Euro Disney's gallop up the charts lately. The technicality, he says, is a Dollars 3.3bn Walt Disney issue, convertible into the cash value of Euro Disney shares, which should provide support for the share price of the French offshoot. The other, he says, is that Euro Disney's leisure park is due to open on schedule on April 4, well located and served by transport facilities, amid a rising tide of highly professional publicity. Of France's other two top performers, L'Oreal is a world-wide leader in cosmetics and, once again, it is also liked for its pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Synthelabo. Total, the oil company, has seen a lot of US buying  -as has Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications network operator and another recent climber in the charts. France had its losers. Paribas, the diversified banking group, ran into more problems in the corporate finance market, high provisions against conventional banking risks and the unexpected deterioration in specific situations such as companies owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, and the Soviet Union. Meanwhile Axa, the insurer, saw general pressure on the industry: from non-life losses, a consequence of recession; pressure on net assets, from the softening of the bond and real estate markets; and from the French government's decision to make insurers pay compensation to Aids sufferers as a result of the maladministration of the national blood transfusion service. Mr Jonathan Walker, European insurance analyst at Baring Securities, adds that Axa was weighed down by a misunderstanding of its Dollars 1bn-plus investment in Equitable Life of the US which, he says, has significant upside potential; a rise in the shares from FFr645 to FFr758 in two weeks indicates that the market is beginning to see the light. Insurers also provided a top 10 entrant in Skandia, depressed at the end of 1990 by sky-high interest rates in Sweden, a very weak stock market and a fast weakening one in real estate. It had fire losses in Sweden, an Italian acquisition doing extremely badly and UK motor business which, for competitive reasons, was seriously unprofitable. However, Skandia was also the focal point of plans for a strong Scandinavian insurance industry which eventually brought its Norwegian counterpart, Uni Storebrand, into the market. That was in December, and this particular pot is only a little off the boil. Being involved in merger situations was no guarantee of stock market success. In a bottom 10 riddled with depressed Italian blue chips, Pirelli SpA had to pull out of negotiations with the German tyremaker, Continental, as Pirelli forecast worse-than-expected losses and its share price collapsed. Ferruzzi Finanziaria and Montedison, members of one family group, reflected industry problems; as did the car manufacturer Fiat (11th from bottom) and the Agnelli family holding company Gemina. Olivetti suffered from the recession in the computer industry. Among former darlings of the Scandinanvian markets, Ericsson ran into third quarter losses; in November, management was cautious and sombre about prospects for 1992. From October, Norsk Hydro dropped on a Norwegian market already demoralised by the collapse of its banking industry, uncertain short-term earnings prospects and the fact that it ran ahead of itself in 1990. Finally, Asea and Brown Boveri, the Swedish- and Swiss-quoted companies which merged their operations several years earlier, also hit trouble in the third quarter of 1991. Asea nearly slid into the bottom 10 (coming 12th) and Brown Boveri got there, on third-quarter figures which were worse than reduced expectations; as with Ericsson and Norsk Hydro, premium ratings for both stocks have had to be reconsidered.</p>

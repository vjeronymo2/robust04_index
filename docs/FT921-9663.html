			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fall in advertising hits NY Times A DECLINE in advertising due to the US recession contributed to a 27.5 per cent drop in 1991 net profits to Dollars 47m at the New York Times Company. The decline in profits was struck on revenues of Dollars 1.7bn, 4.5 per cent down on 1990. The company said that 1991 earnings - which were 61 cents a share against 85 cents in 1990 - would have been higher had it not been for a series of special charges, including a Dollars 20m second-quarter 1991 charge to cover severance payments for 160 employees at the flagship New York Times. The company's fourth-quarter 1991 net profit was nearly treble the low 1990 level, at Dollars 34.6m (45 cents a share). Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 452.5m, compared with Dollars 456m in the last quarter of 1990. A series of special charges affecting the company's 1991 earnings included a Dollars 10m provision for income tax contingencies related to a settlement dating from the 1980-1984 period. Magazine acquisition costs also affected 1991 earnings, as did the discontinuing of the capitalisation of interest in connection with the New York Times's automated colour production and distribution facility in New Jersey. If these factors are excluded, the company's 1991 earnings would have been 97 cents a share. Operating profits in the newspaper group - which includes the New York Times, 32 regional papers and a 50 per cent share in the International Herald Tribune - rose to Dollars 49.2m from Dollars 32.1m in the fourth quarter. Revenues were Dollars 345.7m, against Dollars 350.1m. Fourth-quarter operating income from the magazine division was Dollars 1.4m, compared with a Dollars 6.3m loss in the last quarter of 1990. The broadcasting and information services business recorded Dollars 4.8m of operating profits, against Dollars 4.7m in the same period of 1990.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Major fights to restore authority: PM warns Tory rebels economic recovery is closely bound with UK's place in Europe MR JOHN MAJOR fought to restore his authority yesterday with a stark warning to Tory rebels that Britain's economic recovery and its place at the heart of Europe were inextricably linked. In a tense and frequently angry House of Commons debate which turned into a crucial test of the prime minister's standing, he warned that failure to proceed with the ratification of the Maastricht treaty could leave Britain 'scowling' in frustration on the fringes of Europe. Mr Major's rallying call came in a last-ditch plea for House of Commons backing for his European strategy from Tory Euro-sceptics pledged to wreck British ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But as MPs prepared for last night's vital vote on whether to press ahead with the ratification process, the outcome still looked dangerously uncertain. Senior ministers privately predicted a narrow victory for Mr Major with 19 of the 20 Liberal Democrats MPs pledging to vote alongside the Conservatives. But a hard-core of more than 30 Tory Euro-sceptics insisted that when their votes were added to those of Labour and other opposition parties, the government's majority of 21 would be overturned. Mr Major, who called yesterday's vote in an attempt to restore his authority at home and strengthen his negotiating hand in the European Community, sought to turn the debate into a fundamental choice about Britain's place in Europe. In a powerful speech which brought noisy applause from most Conservatives but left many of the hard-line Euro-sceptics unmoved, Mr Major said: 'The essential question is simply: are we or are we not in this country to play a central role in Europe's development?' Warning that an attempt to renege now on the Maastricht treaty would severely damage Britain's economic prospects, he said the 'centralist' Europe feared by the Euro-sceptics was most likely 'if we do stand aside and let others run Europe, while Britain scowls in frustration on the fringes'. Clashing repeatedly with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, over an opposition amendment which would delay resumption of the ratification process at least until after next month's Edinburgh summit, Mr Major added: 'I have to tell the House, and I have to tell the country, that we cannot continue to make a success of our membership of the Community unless we ratify the Treaty that we have agreed to.' But conscious that Tory party managers were still scurrying around the lobbies of Westminster seeking to win back waverers from the rebel camp, he sought also to assuage their fears that Maastricht was a step towards a federal Europe. He insisted that Britain would retain freedom over when to rejoin the Exchange Rate Mechanism and whether to move to a single currency, that it retained a veto over European-wide immigration policies, and that the powers of the Brussels Commission would be curbed. As Mr Smith swapped insults with Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, over the latter's support for the government, Mr Major bitterly attacked Labour for its about-turn on the treaty. But in a less than confident speech which exposed many of the tensions in his own party over Europe, Mr Smith insisted that the debate was not about Maastricht but about a desperate attempt by the government to shore up its authority. Insisting it had 'more to do with the internal problems of the Conservative Party, than it has to do with the European Community', Mr Smith added: 'The truth of the present situation, the background to the debate, is that an increasingly angry and bewildered nation is watching with astonishment and dismay as this Government stumbles from one disaster to another.' Mr Ashdown, however, also accused Mr Smith of 'discreditable opportunism', dismissing Labour claims that the vote was one of confidence in the government or the prime minister.

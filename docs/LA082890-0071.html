			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLYMPIAN GONZALES STALLED BY LOSS TO LEON;  </P> <P> BOXING: AFTER FAILING TO MAKE WEIGHT, HE IS BEATEN IN UNANIMOUS DECISION.  </P> <P> The once-promising professional boxing career of Paul Gonzales, launched with a  gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, looked very much like it had  gone dead in the water Monday night.  </P> <P> Fighting with extreme caution and almost entirely lacking in what boxing people  like to call "fire in the belly," Gonzales lost his second fight in 10 weeks  when he dropped a unanimous decision to virtually unknown Mexican 18-year-old,  Javier Leon.  </P> <P> The heady days of the Olympics, when Gonzales not only won a light-flyweight  gold medal, but the outstanding boxer award as well, seemed long, long ago  Monday night. On the day he won a gold medal, Gonzales predicted he'd win pro  world titles in six weight divisions.  </P> <P> But on Monday night, before 6,080 at the Forum, Gonzales, 26, looked like a  very ordinary bantamweight. And an overweight one.  </P> <P> Not so ordinary was a new face on the L.A. boxing scene, super- featherweight  Genaro Hernandez, who raised his record to 20-0 with a third-round knockout of  Richard Abila. In a third 10-rounder, Phoenix featherweight Louie Espinoza  knocked out Fernando Teran, also in the third round.  </P> <P> Six years ago, Gonzales looked as though he had chance to be one of Los  Angeles' great boxing attractions. He had good looks, a marvelous left jab,  outstanding boxing skills and he came from the streets of East Los Angeles, a  community that has been producing world-class fighters for most of this  century.  </P> <P> Gonzales did nothing right Monday. He missed making weight by four pounds,  coming in at 122. But Leon didn't make 118 either, so their bout -- a  first-rounder in the Forum's eight-boxer bantamweight tournament -- went on.  </P> <P> Gonzales' new trainer (he split with longtime trainer Al Stankie nearly a year  ago), ex-bantamweight champion Albert Davila of Pomona, was livid.  </P> <P> "I don't know why he didn't make weight, and I'm very unhappy about it," Davila  said, suggesting he'd have a long talk soon with Gonzales about his boxing  future.  </P> <P> Gonzales seemed in shock. What happened to all the cheers of '84? He was booed  Monday night.  </P> <P> "I can't explain it," he said, through bloody lips. "I weighed 119 dried out  yesterday, and I woke up this morning at 122. I've never failed to make weight  before, not even as an amateur. I don't want to take anything away from the guy  (Leon), but he was just a guy. I let a guy with just basic skills beat me.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'm discouraged. I wanted to win this tournament (and first-place purse  of $75,000). But I'm not going to quit. I just wasn't right tonight. I couldn't  get off (a punch), I couldn't reach him. These things happen, I guess."  </P> <P> Gonzales (14-3-1) lost on an eye cut in a bantamweight title fight against  Orlando Canizales in El Paso June 10. Leon (31-2-2), from Michoacan, wasn't  supposed to be much of a challenge. But the much shorter, poker-faced fighter  beat his more-famed opponent to the punch for 10 rounds, largely ignored  Gonzales' vaunted left jab and scored repeatedly with left hooks inside and  long lead rights.  </P> <P> Two judges scored it for Leon, 95-94, and another had it 97-92. The Times card  had Leon, 96-93.  </P> <P> Hernandez, managed by Nori Takatani, presumably took another step toward a  super-feather championship opportunity. His opponent was to have been Ben  Medina, who pulled out of the fight late last week. Saturday night, he fought  in a main event in Mexico City.  </P> <P> Abila (15-6), the sub from Las Vegas, wasn't prepared but also wasn't in  Hernandez's league. Hernandez, 24, is a tall (5-feet-11), angular fighter. He's  a right-hander but sets up in a squared-off fashion so as to deliver straight  rights with the same motion as his effective left jabs.  </P> <P> He's a patient fighter who likes to throw short, hard uppercuts inside. In the  third round Monday, he chased Abila across the ring, pounding him and dumping  him on the deck with a jolting left hook. A moment later, Abila was flat on his  back under a bottom rope, with his handlers cutting his gloves off.  </P> <P> It was Hernandez's second fight since recovering from surgery on his left hand  last October. Although he has yet to be tested by a world class  super-featherweight, he's ranked second by the World Boxing Assn. and No. 3 by  the World Boxing Council.  </P></p>

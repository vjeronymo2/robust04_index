			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Tories' tax record challenged: Treasury discloses tax burden will be heavier than under Labour The Conservative party's credentials as the party of low taxation were under fierce attack at Westminster last night after the publication of damaging figures showing that the government will from April take more in tax from the average family than Labour did. The opposition parties pounced gleefully on the disclosure, with Labour accusing the government of making the 'biggest tax demand in history'. Labour hopes to make it impossible for the government to label it as the high-tax party, a tactic the Conservatives used to great effect in the last election. Ominously for the government, some Tory backbench MPs were comparing the political impact of the tax rises with the poll tax, which attracted terminal unpopularity after it was implemented. Tory MPs are now braced for pressure from their constituents over the heavier tax burden once people realise how much extra tax they are paying. People will find out either by being informed by the Inland Revenue or simply by higher deductions taken from their pay in April. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke hit back at Labour, arguing that taxes would always be lower under a Conservative government than under Labour in any given year. At the centre of the row, which arose just ahead of tomorrow's crucial House of Commons debate on the finance bill, was the Treasury's disclosure that a married man on average earnings with two children would this year pay 32.9 per cent of his earnings in direct and indirect taxes, rising to 35 per cent in 1994-95. That compared with 32.2 per cent under Labour in 1978-1979. Labour backed up its attack by highlighting official figures showing that the proportion of gross domestic product taken by tax, excluding oil taxes, would rise to 35 1/2 per cent in 1994-95 and 38 1/2 per cent in 1998-99. That would outstrip the high of 36 3/4 per cent taken under the last Labour government in 1975-76. Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Clarke insisted that comparing current levels of taxation with the last year of a Labour government was 'false'. He said: 'If you had a Labour chancellor now, taxes would be much, much higher. 'At the very end of the Labour government, they did actually get tax down below where we are at the moment, but that was one of the most irresponsible things that Denis Healey (then chancellor) did in the run-up to the election.' But Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, accused his opposite number of 'tax deception'. 'The facts are incontrovertible,' Mr Brown said. 'Tax is higher than under Labour. Because the Tories will never tell the truth about their tax bills, the country will never trust them on tax again.' Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, joined the attack, saying that forthcoming tax increases were 'so large they have put the recovery at risk'. Mr John Townend, chairman of the influential Tory backbench finance committee, said it was vital for the government to re-establish itself as a tax-cutting administration.

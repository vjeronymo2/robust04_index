			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Hilary Term cases ENSIGN TANKERS (LEASING) LTD v STOKES (FT, March 17) Ensign and four other British companies participated in a scheme whereby they contributed Dollars 3.25m to the cost of the making of a film in return for 25 per cent of the exploitation receipts. The scheme was a single composite transaction embodied in 17 documents. Under the scheme, a partnership agreement was made between Victory Film Productions Ltd as general partner and the five British companies as limited partners. Victory was a wholly-owned subsidiary of LPI, the Californian production company. The partnership was granted worldwide exploitation rights by LPI. In the tax year 1980 to 1981, the partnership incurred capital expenditure of Dollars 3.25m in the provision of 'plant', namely the film. The negative belonged to the partnership, subject to the distributors' exclusive exploitation rights. It also owned 25 per cent of the exploitation receipts. The partnership therefore fulfilled the conditions necessary to generate a first year allowance of Dollars 3.25m under section 41 of the Finance Act 1971, provided the expenditure was incurred 'for the purposes of the trade'. Allowing Ensign's appeal that the transaction was a trading activity, the House of Lords stated that the Ramsay principles did not apply to the Dollars 3.25m, because that was a real - and not a magical - expenditure, so that a trading transaction could plainly be identified. DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD (FT, March 18) By a contract dated November 30 1992 between Emerald and Davy, Davy was to supply a platform called a floating production facility (FPF) and other works. Davy was concerned that title to the goods and works might pass to Emerald before it had been paid the greater part of the contract price, and without its receiving some of the documents necessary to operate a letter of credit opened in its favour. In determining when and in what circumstances title would pass, Mr Justice Hobhouse concluded that the property was to pass upon acceptance by the bank of the documents, that is, at the time when the bank decided that they complied with the requirements of the credit. Dismissing Emerald's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated business sense supported that construction. One would not expect the parties to provide that passing of title should be deferred until trivial amounts were paid, but not until Davy was in a position to draw the largest proportion under a letter of credit. THE LAW DEBENTURE TRUST CORPORATION v THE URAL CASPIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD AND OTHERS (FT, March 20) By agreements in 1986, each of the four Russian companies, who were the first four defendants in the present action, entered into covenants with Law Debenture Trust as trustee for the shareholders. Each company covenanted to pursue its compensation claim for loss of business since the Russian revolution and confiscation of their assets by the Soviets and to pay any compensation it received to the trustee. In each agreement, Leisure which had made an offer for the entire share capitals of the Russian companies, covenanted to procure that the company could perform its covenants and not part with control unless the transferee entered into similar covenants. Leisure then agreed to sell its entire shareholding to another company H, (the fifth defendant) and imposed no requirement that H should covenant with the trustee. H transferred its shares to C, the sixth defendant. In striking out parts of the statement of claim and in giving leave to amend, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated that the question was whether there was an authority to impose a positive duty to perform the covenants of a predecessor and whether interference with contractual relations could be extended to interference with the remedies arising out of a broken contract. The case would be argued at the trial when the relevant facts could be established. THE REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA v WOODHOUSE DRAKE &amp; CAREY (SUISSE) SA &amp; OTHERS (FT, March 24) When a cargo of rice, bought and paid for by the Republic of Somalia, arrived off Mogadishu, the master refused to enter port because of the fighting. In the shipowners' summons against the charterers as to what was to be done with the cargo, Mr Justice Hirst ordered that it be sold and the proceeds paid into court. The 'interim government' of Somalia now sought the funds in a payment out of court. Refusing, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated that whether a government existed depended on: (a) whether it was the constitutional government; (b) the degree, nature and stability of administrative control it exercised over the territory; (c) whether the UK government had any dealings with it; and (d) (in marginal cases) the extent of international recognition. On the evidence of the instant case, the 'interim government' did not qualify as an existing government under those criteria. ISC TECHNOLOGIES LTD AND ANOTHER v GUERIN AND OTHERS (FT, March 25) The plaintiffs, who were English companies, were the subsidiaries of International Signal and Control Group plc (ISC) which merged with Ferranti plc in 1987. The plaintiffs claimed that between 1983 and 1989, Mr Guerin, executive chairman of ISC and other persons, conspired to commit fraud falsely to inflate ISC's profits and deceive Ferranti. After final judgment had been entered against all but two of the nine defendants, leave was granted to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction on an ISC director, Mr Pindell, on the allegation that he had knowingly participated in the fraud. Refusing Mr Pindell's application that leave should be set aside, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated that in Cordoba Shipping (1984) 2 Lloyds Rep 91, it was held that where the substance of an alleged tort was committed within a certain jurisdiction, it was not easy to imagine what other facts would displace the conclusion that the natural forum was the courts of that jurisdiction. In the instant case, that prima facie conclusion had not been displaced. POLLY PECK INTERNATIONAL LTD v NADIR &amp; OTHERS (FT, March 27) The administrators of Polly Peck International had been granted a Mareva injunction inter partes against Central Bank, a North Cyprus bank, within the UK and limited to Pounds 38.9m. The administrators contended in a pleaded case of constructive trust, that Central Bank either had actual knowledge that the funds were being improperly diverted away from PPI, or that circumstances should have put the bank on inquiry that that was so. Discharging the injunction, the Court of Appeal stated that first, PPI's case against Central Bank was no more than speculative. Second, it was wrong in principle to grant a Mareva injunction so as to interfere with the normal course of the defendant's business. To impose a Mareva injunction that would have that effect in order to protect a cause of action that was no more than speculative was not simply wrong in principle, but positively unfair. REGINA v SPENS (FT, March 31) The fraud proceedings against Lord Spens were discontinued when the health of his co-defendant, Roger Seelig, broke down and it was decided not to proceed against Lord Spens alone. In refusing an application that a verdict of not guilty should be entered, Mr Justice Henry stated that Section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 provided that where the prosecution proposed to offer no evidence, the court 'may if it thinks fit, order that a verdict of not guilty shall be recorded'. In exercising that discretion, the court would grant a permanent stay by ordering the indictment to lie on the file so that Lord Spens would be treated in the same way as Mr Seelig. Further, the defendant's costs under section 16(2)(a) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1986 would be refused because, by his conduct, he had brought prosecution on himself. However, with regard to his legal aid contribution, on the figures before it, the court was satisfied that Lord Spens' financial position was not such as would enable him to pay legal aid contribution and, having regard to his overall liabilities, the entire contribution would be remitted.</p>

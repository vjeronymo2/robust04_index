			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Seafield gearing up for battle Mr Brian Chilver, chairman of Seafield, the Dublin-based transport, warehousing and property group, has emphasised the board's intentions to defeat the proposals by Waterglade International. 'We have a clear strategy for growth and during the next few weeks we will tell our shareholders why they should support the board', he said. Waterglade wants an extraordinary meeting, yet to be fixed, to seek the removal from the Seafield board of Mr Chilver, Mr David Burke, and Mr David Stacey. In their places it proposes Mr David Cunningham, Mr Thomas Megas, Mr Peter Voller, and Mr David Grove, all directors of Waterglade. Mr Chilver felt 'very uneasy at these underhanded attempts to gain control of companies without making a cash bid. 'Waterglade's directors should be clear - Seafield will be no push over'.</p>

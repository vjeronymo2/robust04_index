			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in three installments by political reporters, Shuzo </F> Sato for the first installment, Koichi Kobata for the second  installment, and Isamu Niwa for the third installment: "Stormy  Sailing--Hata `Minority Coalition' Regime"]  <H5>  [30 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] "Recalling the period of eight months, I am proud to  say that the coalition government has curved out a path for  great and new Japanese politics. Ours has now become a  government of a minority coalition, but we will do our best for  smooth progress of Japan with sincerity and joint efforts."    On the night of 28 April [1994], at his first press  conference since assuming the office, Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata showed a touch of vexation at the condition in which he was  forced to start the "Hata regime" with the minority of the  ruling coalition.    Prime Minister Hata is "the choice" of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], and his government was born by easily obtaining  a majority of votes--274 votes in the lower house and 127 votes  in the upper house. Although the second coalition government  appeared to make a smooth start, the foothold of the government  crumbled from its foundation all at once when the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition  government.    The genuine ruling coalition bolstering the government  numbers 182, a little over one-third of the total in the lower  house. The coalition force will only be 202 members even if to  count the members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the new party of  Mirai [the Future Party]. Sakigake left the coalition, pledging  to cooperate from the outside of the cabinet and Mirai broke  away from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and is assuming the  pro-coalition stance. Things are severer in the upper house as  the coalition holds 62 persons which account for only about  one-fourth of the total strength. This explains the conditions  under which "none of the bills can be passed" (a leading member  of the ruling coalition in the upper house).    In his cabinet formation, Prime Minister Hata picked eight  members from Shinseito and six from Komeito. The "Shinsei-Komei"  tie has thus become strong. He has staffed his official  residence by an excellent pair from Shinseito, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary  Naoto Kitamura. He reappointed Mr. Hirohisa Fujii to the post of  finance minister who deals with tax system issue and Mr. Hajime  Ishii to the post of home affairs minister who takes charge of  political reform. Both of them are Shinseito members and thus in  essence the prime minister has clearly indicated the "Shinseito  leadership."    In the Hosokawa government, a rift between Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  deprived the official residence of its centripetal force. That  became a factor in inviting bureaucratic leadership. Hata seeks  to solidify his official residence thereby to exercise power of  control over bureaucrats. There are such aims in "Hata's  personnel management."    The fate of Hata government hangs on a tax system reform and  a bill for rezoning of single-seat constituencies with a  proportional representation system. We can see that Hata  cabinet poised to attempt a frontal breakthrough on these two  pending bills.    With the SDPJ's secession from the government and Sakigake's  cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, policy  coordinations within the ruling coalition are likely to proceed  smoothly unlike in the past. However, problem lies after that.  At his press conference, Prime Minister Hata expressed his  expectations for cooperation from both the LDP and the SDPJ,  saying that "there was a word (from the SDPJ) that it would  cooperate as best as it can for the benefit of the nation" and  that, although we and the LDP may have clashes over some issues,  "I believe the LDP will extend its cooperation on policy  matters, and I would like to ask it to do so." However, the  situation is not as optimistic as that.    The ruling coalition government desires to present the  rezoning bill to the Diet as soon as possible after the fiscal  1994 budget is approved. In addition to the election strategy of  Shinseito which wants to carry out the election under a new  system, the coalition government believes that "such a step can  forestall the introduction of a no-confidence motion against the  cabinet by the LDP and the SDPJ" (a leading member of the ruling  coalition).    However, there is a tenacious voice, within both the LDP and  the SDPJ, calling for the dissolution of the lower house and a  general election under the existing system; therefore,  undoubtedly there will be fierce quarrels between ruling and  opposition parties after passage of the proposed budget.    With the "question of 100 million yen loans" from the Sagawa  Kyubin trucking firm to former Prime Minister Hosokawa still  remaining unsettled, the issue may easily turn into a factor for  a great turbulence, depending on the opposition parties'  approach to the issue. There are many seeds of fiery  confrontation between ruling and opposition parties, including  measures to cope with issues of nuclear development in the DPRK  (North Korea).    In the Hosokawa regime, the initiative under the "Ichi-Ichi  [Ichiro and Yuichi] line" by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa and Kometo Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa surfaced in  various aspects. With the SDPJ and Sakigake having left the  coalition, the "Ichi-Ichi line" could very well be brought out  in relief in the Hata government. In what form will the  opposition to such development take place?    Sadao Yamahana, member of the SDPJ and former minister in  charge of political reform, asserted at a meeting of the party's  Diet members on 28 April [1994] that "the Hata cabinet will be  unable to fulfil the role greater than one assigned to a budget  management cabinet." Voicing his feelings of desperation, a  leading member of the ruling coalition made the following  remarks: "We have no other choice but to make desperate efforts  for the first two months. If we keep striving with the given  minority, we may enlist sympathy for the weakling."    Without carrying enough "fuel," the ship "Shinsei-Hata Maru"  is compelled to launch out on a stormy sea, bearing the destiny  of the coalition government on its shoulder. The sea route to  follow is invisible. The "political change in June theory" is  increasingly acquiring a flavor of reality.  <H5>  [1 May 94 p 2] </H5>   }[Text] "Nobody knows what may happen tomorrow in the  political world. Nothing has shown this more vividly than the  recent political change," deplores one of Shinseito leaders.    Before dawn of 26 [April 1994], SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama announced his party's secession from the coalition  government at a press conference he held urgently.    The SDPJ's secession from the government, the new Hata  regime  suddenly slid down to a "minority ruling coalition." A Komeito  leader said, "A momentary judgment often sways one's fate,  bringing one's prosperity or fall."    At his first inaugural press conference on 28 April, Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata touched on the formation of a joint  parliamentary union called the "Reform" which led to [Hata's]  "fall into Hell from Heaven" (a leading Shinseito member)  through the SDPJ's secession from the government. Gnawing his  lips, the prime minister made the following remarks: "I did not  know that things were proceeding that way. As things were  getting serious, I became aware that there were some mutual  misunderstandings, but it was already too late then." His words  sounded as if to suggest a difficult future of the Hata regime.    The unfolding new political situation of the Hata regime  foreshadows a desperate struggle and confusion involving both  ruling and opposition parties. There are three major forces: the  "ruling coalition" formed by Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New  Party [JNP], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the  Liberal Party; the LDP; and the SDPJ. In addition, Sakigake,  which shifted to cooperation from the outside of the cabinet,  and Mirai, a new party which has broken away from the LDP, will  also be entangled complicatedly.    China's RENMIN RIBAO reported: "Viewed from a historic  angle,  Japan's political situation is reminiscent of its `age of civil  strife.' A great upheaval is continuing, and the map of the  political quarters will remain unclear until the end of the next  election."    The "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa  displayed a initiative in the former Hosokawa regime and also in  making the current Hata regime. The high-handed political  methods of this line drove Sakigake, which is led by former  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, into outside-Cabinet  cooperation and invited the SDPJ's "rebellion." Though not  openly, a voice calling for reconsidering the "Ichi-Ichi line"  is being raised gradually inside Shinseito and Komeito, and the  "Ichi-Ichi line" appears to have reached the crucial point.    Mr. Ozawa and his followers are now elaborating on the next  gambit to make up for their "great miscalculation" that resulted  in the SDPJ's secession from the government. It is a gambit for  setting off a split between the LDP and the SDPJ and making the  political situation fluid toward a new realignment of the  political world. To this end, it will be sought to pass a bill  on rezoning of single-seat constituency system for lower house  even at the cost of prolonging the current Diet session  (scheduled to end on 29 June). This is because when the  single-seat constituency system is realized, a large number of  LDP and SDPJ Diet members will lose their seats, thereby  inevitably accelerating the realignment of the political world.    Prior to such a development, both the LDP and the SDPJ, the  two giants of the "1955 system," with their strategies to expand  their influences by bringing about a Diet dissolution and a  general election under the existing medium-size constituency.  After its secession from the government, the SDPJ immediately  had its general secretary talk with the LDP's secretary general,  exploring the way for the "LDP-SDPJ tieup." Fierce offensive and  defensive battles are inevitable between new and old forces over  handling of the proposed budget and the single-seat constituency  rezoning bill until the end of the current Diet session.    Amid this process, activities for "liquidizing" the  political  situation will further deepen, and "various combinations of  alliance and league will be groped for below the surface of the  water" (a leading SDPJ member). The minor new parties, Sakigake  and Mirai, "must rack their brains over how to steer themselves  among alliances and leagues and grab a casting vote" (a leading  Sakigake member).    Only a few days have passed since the Hata cabinet started,  but a theory is already afloat in Nagata-cho [where Diet  building is located] that "the general election will be held on  24 July." This marks the beginning of a war of information on  the political situation.    The plot of the "24 July" theory is as follows: Toward the  end of June, the issue of extending the session of the Diet will  be raised over the handling of the proposed budget and the  singel-seat constituency rezoning bill. Such an extension will  conflict with deadlines set for the settlement of the ruling  coalition's tax reform bills and the government's market-opening  measures. There is also a strong possibility that the LDP and  the SDPJ will jointly bring forward a no-confidence motion  against the cabinet. The political situation will get  "liquidized" at a stroke. The Naple summit (the meeting of  leaders of advanced countries), to be held from 8 to 10 July, is  also around the corner. Under this scenario, through a period  covering before and after the summit meeting, the lower house  will be dissolved and the holding of the general election will  be publicly announced.    "Anything could happen from now on and I will not be  surprised."    "I will race ahead, bracing myself like a soldier on the  battlefield."    These sharp words have been uttered successively by ruling  and opposition party lawmakers who were leaving for their local  constituencies to spend a long consecutive holidays.  <H5>  [2 May 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] "It is an extremely weak cabinet by a minority  ruling coalition. More than half of the lawmakers elected by the  people do not entertain expectations." "When the prime minister  is not the top strong man leading Shinseito (the largest party  in the ruling camp), we know that the power has a dual  structure."    On the evening of 28 April [1994] when the Hata regime  started, LDP President Yohei Kono scathingly criticized the  Shinseito-led new government. The use of the phrase "extremely  weak cabinet" was even suggestive of his tenacious desire to  overthrow the cabinet.    The LDP was cheered by the SDPJ's secession from the  government. It sets out to build a "joint front" with the SDPJ,  saying that "the LDP versus non-LDP shackles have now been  removed" (a leading member). On 27 April, the day after the  secession was declared, [LDP] Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and  [SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo confirmed close tieup in  the future Diet operation, and this position was reconfirmed at  a later meeting of the Diet Affairs Committee chairmen.    The catchword of the tieup is "opposition to the high-handed  use of power." This means that they will join hands under the  logic that "an enemy's enemy is a friend" in opposition to the  so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" political method employed by  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary  General Yuichi Ichikawa, "a method ignoring parliamentary  democracy" in the LDP's view.    One of the leading members of the LDP says that "when the  LDP  and the SDPJ join hands, they can grab and exercise  life-and-death power over all bills." Their strategy is very  clear.    Their position is that they may allow the proposed fiscal  1994 budget to be approved, but that "things will be different  after that." Immediately after the budget is approved, they will  submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet and ask for  its general resignation. While taking these actions, they will  be even ready for the dissolution of the lower house and the  general election.    LDP President Kono even went so far as declaring that "after  the budget approval, there will be no more work to do for the  new government." Until then, they are planning to undercut the  government by thoroughly inquiring into former Prime Minister  Hosokawa's alleged improprieties.    Under this strategy, they are going to take the offensive  for  the "recapturing of standing committee chairmanships." The LDP  and the SDPJ have 280 seats (206 seats for the LDP and 74 seats  for the SDPJ) in the lower house, and this strength enables the  opposition camp to form, so to speak, a "stable majority (270  seats). They thus reckon that "theoretically, every post can be  recaptured" (a leading member of the Mitsuzuka faction). As a  first step, to bind the new government's hands and feet, the  focuse of their target is in having surrendered the chairmanship  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Rules and  Administration--the the key post for steering of the Diet.    However, at this stage, such tieup between the LDP and the  SDPJ aims at no farther than the "overthrowing of the cabinet."  In addition to the fear of the tieup being exposed to criticism  that it marks a retrogression toward the 1955 system, there is  an opposing view within the LDP that "the SDPJ is too afar from  LDP in terms of policy" (a leading member of the Watanabe  faction). Secretary General Mori, at the 28 April summit  meeting, stated that "the joint struggle will be restricted  within the house (Diet steering)," stressing that it did not  presuppose a great coalition. The same is the case with the  SDPJ. Immediately after the tieup was mutually confirmed, the  party headquarters was flooded with the calls of protest, and it  was busy explaining that "we are not joining in the work of  restoring the LDP regime" (a leading member).    Since it lost the office in July 1993, the LDP has  constantly  been exposed to the danger of another split. During the period,  20 members left the party through confrontations between  supporters of the political reform legislation and those calling  for a prudent approach, and the post-Hosokawa turmoil over  former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's defection and  formation of a new party. The intraparty situation is not  monolithic, and the aftereffects of those events are lingering.  The executive leadership is busy working to avoid a split, and  party reform is also left halfway. A leader admits the actual  situation that "people see the coalition shaking; yet we hear no  voice saying that let the LDP have power."    There are signs that the political world is drifting toward  a  "tripolar structure" divided largely by the ruling coalition,  the LDP, and the SDPJ-Sakigake. Amid these signs, it is doubtful  that any one bloc can single-handedly assume power. Both the LDP  and the SDPJ are not free from the danger of intraparty split as  well.    An elder lawmaker says: "From now on, we will be in the  world  of the history of the `Three States' [China's old wartime  history book]. Activities will be swayed by party interests and  individual interests. You may see a friend yesterday turn  against you today." The LDP clearly upholds the position of  overthrowing the present cabinet, and yet it fails to depict a  firm scenario of its seizure of power. In such a condition the  LDP is about to rush into the work of promoting fluidity in the  political situation.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (7): Keyed up for the world stage - Profile of Acer TAIWAN manufacturers have not traditionally focused on marketing their own brand-name product. Instead, they have favoured high-volume production of low cost goods on an original equipment manufacture (OEM) basis, and the comparatively low financial risk which OEM offers. Acer, however, has always sought to be the exception. The company's chairman, chief executive officer and founder, Mr Stan Shih, says he is in the process of transforming Acer into a multinational computer company, capable of competing with the main global players. According to Mr Shih: 'Our aim is to motivate Taiwan's people to succeed in removing the negative image of 'Made in Taiwan'.' Although Mr Shih believes that he can only increase international awareness of Acer products through marketing, Acer still relies on OEM for 30 per cent of its business, a proportion which Mr Shih would like to see augmented to 45 per cent. 'On the whole OEM and our brand name business complement each other,' he says. 'OEM is also a very good way to share the cost of developing new technology.' Underlying Acer's strategy is Mr Shih's personal blend of ancient Chinese philosophy and modern management techniques. 'In the game of Go, first you conquer the periphery, then you conquer the centre,' he explains. 'Because Acer is not yet big enough to compete with the big US companies, we have found a niche in smaller markets, like South America and south-east Asia.' In Chile, says Mr Shih, people speak of Acer-compatible computers, rather than IBM-compatible. 'We targeted the markets that none of the big players had reached yet. So even with limited resources we were able to dominate those markets,' he adds. Acer was set up in 1976 as Multitech International with 11 employees, and began production of IBM-compatible personal computers and software in the early 1980s, using the same microchip and software as the IBM equivalent, but selling for two-thirds of the price. By 1991, annual sales had totalled around USDollars 1bn. At a time when its competitors are hoping to sit out the downturn in the global computer industry, Acer's own-brand business actually grew by 45 per cent in 1991. Acer has an annual corporate budget to boost brand awareness, of TDollars 25m, which is considered high by Taiwanese standards. It has also restructured into a series of independent business units, designed to decentralise decision-making, which can spend up to four times that amount on marketing in various regions. Earlier this year, a glossy Dollars 5m advertising campaign which uses shadows thrown by Acer products to convey hidden qualities of the product and images of the user, ran throughout Europe and the US. The 'shadows' theme was conceived by Dentsu Young and Rubicam of the US, and is intended to suggest that there is more to Acer than meets the eye. Despite the emphasis on marketing, repeated attempts to penetrate the US computer market have produced mixed results. In 1990, Acer tried to buy market share by acquiring a financially stretched US minicomputer manufacturer, Altos, for Dollars 94m. The company had hoped to integrate its business hardware systems with Altos' Unix-based systems thereby gaining a ready-made foothold in high end production in the US. But minicomputers went out of fashion, and Altos continued to lose money. Analysts say Acer paid too much for the acquisition. Altos' losses, and price-cutting due to the downturn in the computer market, led to Acer reporting a net loss of USDollars 22.7m last year. However, Acer has since reported net earnings of USDollars 3m in the six months ending June 30, 1992. Acer's mass-merchandiser and superstore business fared somewhat better than Altos in Europe and the US. The company's exports of lower end products bound for outlets such as Best Buy and Bizmart of the US and Dixon's of the UK grew by around 170 per cent in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER OFF THE HOOK ON BOND WITH BABY  </P> <P> When babies fail to form trusting relationships with their mothers,  psychologists have long offered a quick answer: Blame Mom.  </P> <P> A new view is taking hold. Some infants -- especially fussy ones -- put up a  barrier that has nothing to do with their mothers' skills or compassion.  </P> <P> In short, the new wisdom holds: Blame Baby too.  </P> <P> "The mother is off the hook, at least in part," said Dr. Carroll E. Izard.  </P> <P> Delving into infants' emotions has become a rich field of research.  Developmental psychologists are busy sorting out emotionally responsive infants  from stoic ones, tracking down the source of emotional responses inside their  young heads and even measuring which side of babies' faces break into the  brightest grins and the deepest frowns.  </P> <P> Izard, a researcher at the University of Delaware, is challenging the  traditional notion that mothers are entirely responsible for building secure  relationships with their babies.  </P> <P> He has found that babies who respond strongly and negatively to noises and  other stimulation -- in short, the very fussy ones -- are also most likely to  develop poor bonds with their mothers.  </P> <P> "Previous research puts the onus on the mother," said Izard. "I'm saying this  is a two-way street. Characteristics of the infant contribute as well."  </P> <P> His study, conducted on 81 infants, found that those who cried the most, who  demanded the most attention and who put up the biggest fuss during mildly  stressful situations during their first months of life also turned out to be  the least secure at 13 months of age.  </P> <P> He and his colleagues found that they could use an electrocardiogram to predict  which newborns would go on to have insecure bonds with their mothers. Those  with the strongest vagal tone -- a measure of the influence of the brain on the  heart -- later produced the highest insecurity scores on psychological tests.  </P> <P> In Izard's study, a quarter of the babies formed poor bonds with their mothers.  Other research has shown that such children are more likely to have  psychological problems when they reach school age, such as extreme shyness and  difficulty playing with other youngsters.  </P> <P> The latest work suggests that the seeds for these social problems are sewn in a  baby's genes at birth.  </P> <P> Izard outlined his findings recently at a meeting of the American Assn. for the  Advancement of Science in New Orleans. Other researchers at the meeting  described other ways of delving into the earliest emotions of childhood.  </P> <P> For instance, Dr. Tiffany Field of the University of Miami Medical School has  tested babies' willingness to mimic grown-ups' facial expressions of happiness,  anger, sadness and surprise. About 20%, it turns out, are great apers, bursting  into wide grins and gaping surprise in response to adult cues. Another 20% stay  stone-faced, while the rest fall somewhere in between.  </P> <P> "Expressivity is something that is individually different right from the  start," she said.  </P> <P> Dr. Nathan A. Fox of the University of Maryland has found that different  emotions are seated in different sides of babies' brains. He measured  youngsters' brain waves on EEGs. Among other things, he found that when babies  smiled at their mothers, the left side of their brains was usually more active,  while the right side seemed to be busier when they cried in anger.  </P> <P> He believes that learning more about how the frontal lobes of babies' brains  mature will provide important clues to understanding the development of  differences in personality.  </P></p>

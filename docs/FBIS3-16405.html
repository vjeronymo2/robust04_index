			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "First Results"] </F>   [Excerpts] Elections to representative state power bodies  within the Council of the Federation were held in five regions  of Russia on Sunday. They were declared valid in the majority  of districts. According to preliminary figures, sufficient  numbers of voters went to the polls in 35 of the 47 districts in  the Chuvash Republic.    The elections were declared valid in 34 out of 50 districts  in Altay.    In Khabarovsk Kray, the corresponding figure is 23 out of 25  districts.    In Kostroma Oblast, elections were validated in 14 out of 15  oblasts.    In the Jewish Autonomous Oblast the figure is 11 out of 15  districts.    The Central Electoral Commission announced that more precise  figures will be known tomorrow.

By  far, the greatest number of candidates for the Kray legislative  assembly registered here were administration heads or directors.  According to legal experts, if the elections end in their favor  the principle of the division of powers expounded in the  Constitution will thereby be violated. After all, the job of  the majority of contenders for the kray legislative assembly is  to resolve economic problems, while the functions of the  representative power consist of adopting laws and monitoring  administration activity, whereas administration heads and  leaders of all ranks involved in the executive structures are  going to start adopting laws, so to speak, "to suit themselves."  It is not difficult to guess where this could lead. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Axel Florijn: "All We Could Do Was Watch Them </F> Slaughter Each Other -- Colleagues of Murdered Paratroopers  Burning Their Blue Helmets"]    [Text] Ninety paratroopers of the 3d Unit from Tielen, and  51st Mounted Chasseurs from Arnsberg, which took part in the  evacuation operation Silver Back in Rwanda, landed in Melsbroek  yesterday on two Boeing 727's. There were also 43 disappointed  UN blue helmets from the 2d Unit from Flawinne aboard. Out of  helpless anger over the murder of 10 companions on 7 April by  the Rwandan army, some of them tore up or burned their blue  helmets on the spot.    "This was the most dangerous of the four missions I  accomplished in Africa," Corporal Ronny Van Sey (39) of the 3d  Unit from Tielen said. "When we arrived at Kigali, we went  through several hours of suspense. The landing had been  refused, and we knew from the French paratroopers that nine  Rwandan antiaircraft batteries were positioned along the runway.  We circled around for an hour or so, but there was no doubt  about the assignment: To `protect' the Kigali airport by force,  if necessary. We were heavily armed. I was in the first C-130  which landed in Kigali. The Rwandans understood that we meant  business, and backed off."  <H5>  No Use </H5>   The mortar attack on the airport Thursday [14 April] last  week, was a second moment of suspense. "During the withdrawal  toward Nairobi, mortars fell close to the hangar. One mortar  fell right behind a C-130. My company covered their retreat.  At such a moment, one falls back on one's training, and fires  automatically. Afterwards, everything remained quiet. No shot  was fired near the airport on Sunday. I don't think that the  men who stayed behind to guard the control tower, will have any  trouble. The Rwandans know that we won't be kicked around."    "Horrible. Never again in these circumstances," UN blue  helmet Hussein Benbouhout (27) shouted against the noise of the  airplane engines. "Those 10 murdered paratroopers were friends.  They gave their lives for a useless peacekeeping mission. They  were powerless against a gang of murdering Rwandan soldiers.  Insane. I never want to go through this again," he said.    The sergeant of the 2d Unit from Flawinne hardly controlled  his emotions. "We arrived at Kigali on 14 March. We guarded  the cooperation assistants near the Don Bosco school, and  prepared their evacuation. We drove through the city several  times to pick up fellow Belgians. I was always in the first  vehicle, because I have no family, no children. I am not scared  to fight either, this is what I was trained for."    He lashed out again: "But we were not allowed to shoot. We  might just as well have left our weapons at Don Bosco. My heart  was pounding at each roadblock. The blacks constantly pointed  their guns at us. Some of them gestured that they would cut our  throats with their machetes. We were only allowed to react in  self-defense. Which is no use against a bullet in the back or a  machete in your throat. Training is of no use then."    "What can you do when you are surrounded by 50 blacks, when  one of them presses the barrel of his gun against your chest?  Three of us were guarding a Rwandan lawyer in Kigali. Five  minutes after we left, he was slaughtered," Corporal Fabien  Vanhee (30) of the 2d Unit from Flawinne said, shrugging his  shoulders. This was my second mission in Africa. "All we could  do, was watch people slaughter each other like animals," he said  in a flat voice.    Colonel Walter Balis (52) was liaison officer for the UN  with  the "rebels." "Fortunately, we lived under the permanent  protection of the rebels. They protected us against the  massacres of the presidential guard and of Interahamwe, a  militia of former President Habyarimana's united party MRND  [National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development].  We were hoping that the so-called rebels would conquer Kigali  as quickly as possible, and end the `beastly actions.'"</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Still Considering Defense </F> of UN Troops Adequate"]    [Text] The Hague -- Defense Minister Ter Beek is convinced  that the Dutch troops can defend themselves adequately in  Bosnia, even if tension rises as a result of airstrikes around  Sarajevo.    During a 10 February television program, he said it was very  important that the UN commanders on the spot be able, in  agreement with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's  representative, to decide quickly to request air support for  their self-defense. In Parliament last week, Ter Beek labeled  the possibility of requesting air support "an additional  precaution for our ground forces."    Organizations of draftees are concerned about the  consequences the NATO ultimatum and the threat of air strikes  could have for the Dutch military in Bosnia. They say that this  threat involves a shift of tasks and powers, because the UN  troops are no longer deployed exclusively for peacekeeping  operations, but also for peacemaking operations. In Bosnia,  there will soon be some 500 draftees out of a total of 2,000  troops. They volunteered for this mission.    Ter Beek disagrees with the interest groups. The job of the  Dutch military did not change after NATO's decision. The Dutch  are deployed in Bosnia to carry out humanitarian tasks, and  their assignment and rules of engagement are unchanged: Force  can only be used in self-defense, and for defending the  population of the "safe areas" of Zepa and Srebrenica when it is  at risk.    Should tension in the field rise as a result of the air  strikes, ground forces can be concentrated in one place, so that  they can defend themselves more efficiently.</p>

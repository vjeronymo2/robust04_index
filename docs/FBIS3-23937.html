			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "There Is a Little Tatar in Every </F> Russian"]    [Text] Fedor Mikhaylovich Burlatskiy, candidate for deputy  in the State Duma for Moskovskiy District No. 24, opened his  press conference with this witty statement on the eve of a  series of meetings with voters. Responding to journalists'  friendly question why he is being nominated from the Republic of  Tatarstan when he is not a resident of Tatarstan, the candidate  said the sovereign republic's concerns are close to him, for as  a member of the USSR Supreme Soviet he studied the problems of  state organization, took part in preparing the federative  agreement, and spoke out in support of granting autonomous  Tatarstan the status of a union republic at that time.    Burlatskiy told the journalists that, as a deputy in the  State Duma, he could be useful to Tatarstan in several areas.  First of all, he has good contacts in the current parliament and  the parties of democratic persuasion. Secondly, by having high  international prestige, being in favor with many presidents, and  by being a professor at three universities (Oxford, Harvard, and  Heidelberg), he could help to strengthen Tatarstan further in  the international arena.    Noted commentator Burlatskiy really is tremendously popular.  He is familiar to many people from television and his articles  in LITERATURKA, where he has been a political columnist and the  editor in chief. Fedor Mikhaylovich has written political  biographies of Khrushchev, Dobrolyubov, Mao, Kennedy, Franco,  and Machiavelli...    He has been persecuted repeatedly by the powers that be. in  1967 he was dismissed from PRAVDA for articles aginast the cult  of personality and censorship. Even before that, in 1964, he  resigned from a prestigious position as head of a group of  consultants in the International Department of the CPSU Central  Committee to show his disagreement with policy based on a  revival of Stalinism.    Acquainting the journalists with his work as a former  people's deputy of the USSR, Burlatskiy said he was involved in  drafting laws on freedom of the press, religion, and movement.  As chairman of the public Commission on Human Rights and the  International Human Rights Movement (Carter's wife is cochairman  of the latter), he brought about the release of over 400 persons  who were imprisoned for so-called religious crimes. The  commission has provided assistance in resolving political,  housing, and other problems for 300,000 persons.    At present, Fedor Burlatskiy is working at the State and Law  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He has three  children, and his wife is a journalist at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA.  Burlatskiy's favorite hero is Don Quixote.</p>

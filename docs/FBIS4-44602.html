This QWIP is composed of 50 GaAs quantum wells and  Al[.sub]0.28[/]Ga[.sub]0.72[/]As barriers. The device was  made on a 320-m-diameter mesa. Its primary characteristics,  i.e., responsivity and detectivity, are highly dependent upon  bias current and operating temperature. The performance of the  device was further upgraded through delicate design and improved  fabrication technique. The peak detection wavelength is 9.2  m. At an operating temperature of 77 K, the peak current  responsivity is 9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] V/W, the peak detectivity  exceeds 1 x 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W and the  dark current is less than 0.1 A.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   An IR photodetector that relies on the transition of bound  electrons in a quantum well to continuous states near the top of  a potential barrier is developed on the basis of research on  superlattice semiconductors. The QWIP has advantages such as  fast response, high quantum efficiency, variable wavelength,  good thermal stability and uniformity. Furthermore, it can be  made into a large-area IR focal plane array (FPA), which plays  an important role in IR imaging technology, novel IR  spectrophotometers and space precision guidance systems. This  new QWIP is a direction of further development in IR sensing  technology and has become a leading-edge research topic  worldwide.    In 1985, West and Eglash first observed the light transition  effect inside a GaAs quantum well.[.sup]1[/] Later, Levine  and coworkers accomplished a great deal in the development and  improvement of a practical device.[.sup]2-10[/] A GaAs/AlGaAs  MQW IR photodetector (MQWIP) was developed in 1987.[.sup]3[/]  Initially, the device was designed to have two bound-state  quantum wells. To improve its performance characteristics, they  designed a novel superlattice structure,[.sup]4[/] which  involved the transition between bound states in the wells to  extended states in the conduction band to prevent light excited  electrons from tunneling the barriers. Consequently, the barrier  thickness can be increased to suppress dark current and thus  raise detectivity. The best MQWIP was also developed by Levine  et al; its primary specifications are as follows: operating  temperature 77 K, peak wavelength 8 m, and peak detectivity  D* = 4.0 x 10[.sup]10[/]  cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W.[.sup]7[/] Currently, besides trying  to improve performance further, the device has entered an  application stage, i.e., fabricating it into a GaAs/AlGaAs FPA  QWIP array.[.sup]11[/] It has already been successfully used  in IR photography.[.sup]12[/]    Based on research done on the physics associated with the  growth of GaAs/AlGaAs MQW materials, we began to develop QWIP.  The emphasis is placed on structural design and fabrication  technique improvement to further enhance performance. A  high-sensitivity, low-dark-current, long-wavelength MQWIP has  been successfully developed. Its performance characteristics  have reached optimal levels known to date.  <H5>  2. Device Preparation </H5>   We went through the entire process of quantum-well design,  material growth, device development and electrical and optical  measurements. A 50-rectangular-MQW (75 Angstroms) GaAs/(300  Angstroms) Al[.sub]0.28[/]Ga[.sub]0.72[/]As structure was  prepared using a VGV80H MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) system  manufactured in the UK. The growth and study of this  high-quality QWIP material will be described in a separate paper.    Figure 1 [photograph not reproduced] shows the structure of  the device. The device is a 320-m-diameter mesa made with  conventional lithographic and chemical etching techniques. Thin  AuGe/Ni layers are evaporated on the N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layers  on the top and bottom of the mesa. Excellent ohmic contacts are  made after alloying. A thin Au layer covers this ohmic layer  before a metal lead is ultrasonically welded to it. In order to  increase the area of the ohmic contact layer and avoid shorting  between electrodes to improve yield, it is required to have a  good design for the lithographic pattern, to simplify the  technique and to locate the optimal alloying conditions to make  the best ohmic contact. The etching depth must be accurately  controlled so that it penetrates the quantum well. The  N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs layer at the top of the mesa must be exposed  to make a good ohmic contact. In order to determine the etching  depth, a new microscopy technique was developed: REM (Reflective  Electron Microscopy) is used to observe the cross section of the  etched mesa to directly and accurately determine the etching  condition of the MQW mesa. Figure 2 [photograph not reproduced]  shows a REM cross-sectional view of an etched mesa. It clearly  shows the 50-period GaAs/AlGaAs MQW structure. The bright narrow  lines and wide dark lines in the photograph are GaAs quantum  wells and AlGaAs barriers, respectively. N[.sup]+[/]-GaAs  layers are located on top and beneath the quantum-well region.  The dark area on the right is an etched pit (the inclination of  the pit is due to a slanted incident beam). From this picture,  we can see that the etching depth is being controlled just right  at the quantum-well region.    On the basis of the selectivity principle, the optical  coupling of a MQWIP that relies on transitions between sub-bands  within the conduction band is different from that depending on  transitions between bands. The former requires that the  polarization of light hitting the MQWIP must have an electrical  vector perpendicular to the mesa. Hence, it usually enters at 45  degrees from the back or uses a diffraction grating. We used a  45-degree incline coupling method, as shown in Figure 1. This  incline is mechanically ground and polished on the epitaxial  substrate.  <H5>  3. Device Characteristics and Results </H5> <H5>  3.1 Voltage Versus Current Characteristics </H5>   To test the quantum-well structure, dark current and leakage  current due to electrode quality, the voltage/current curve was  measured at 77 K with no light and the result is shown in Figure  3. The curve clearly shows negative impedance damping. This  illustrates the destruction and establishment of resonance  between two neighboring wells as the electric field varies. In  addition, it shows that dark current primarily comes from  resonant tunneling current and it is below 0.2 A. If the  barrier is made thicker, such as 300 Angstroms in specimen G122,  then dark current could be reduced by two orders of magnitude to  0.002 A. This will drastically increase detectivity. The  apparent negative impedance damping and low dark current clearly  prove that the MQW epitaxial material is of high quality and  that the device has no leakage and has excellent ohmic contacts.  We also calculated differential resistance as a function of bias  from the 77 K current/voltage curve. Over the range of bias, the  differential resistance is 1-10 M_O_. The low-temperature  resistance of this QWIP is much larger than those of other types  of photodetectors (such as a HgCdTe waveguide IR photodetector).  Special care should be given to avoid loss of signal due to  distributive capacitance of the leads.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-02A>      Figure 3. Voltage vs. Current Curve at 77 K Without Light </FIG>   <H5>  3.2 Measurement of Voltage Responsivity and Detectivity </H5>   The photodetector was placed in a low-temperature E-1332  freezer and the temperature was varied from 10-300 K. A 500 K  blackbody source was modulated at 800 Hz and then entered the  photodetector at an angle through the freezer window. The  viewing angle of the photodetector is 136. A Keithley 220  current supply is used to provide the constant bias current. An  EG&amp;G 5210 lock-in amplifier is used to measure the rms signal  voltage V[.sub]s[/] and rms noise voltage V[.sub]n[/].    ``Introduction to Optoelectronic Devices,''[.sup]13[/]  edited by Tang Dingyuan [3282 1353 0337] et al., describes a way  to calculate blackbody voltage responsivity R[.sub]b[/] and  blackbody detectivity D*[.sub]bb[/], i.e.,    R[.sub]b[/] =  V[.sub]s[/]/_Ph_[.sub]s[/](V/W) (1)    where _Ph_[.sub]s[/] is the rms fundamental frequency power  of incident radiation which can be determined from some  parameters related to the measurement system and test conditions  (such as blackbody temperature, modulating disk temperature,  blackbody emission aperture and photodetector illumination  area). The blackbody detectivity is   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-02B>      Equation </FIG>     when A[.sub]d[/] is the photodetector area and _D_f is the  bandwidth of the measurement circuit. The GaAs/AlGaAs MQWIP is a  narrow-band photodetector. Therefore, its performance is usually  expressed in terms of its peak detectivity  D*[.sub]_l_p[/].[.sup]10[/] Its equation is as follows:   Equation     The correction factor &Ggr; can be expressed as follows:   Equation     where _n_ is the wave number. M[.sub]b[/](500K, _n_) is  the blackbody radiation power distribution function which can be  expressed by Planck's equation that describes blackbody  radiation. R(_n_), wave-number responsivity, is expressed by a  peak normalized Gaussian distribution. Its peak position and  half-height width can be determined from the IR spectrum of  sub-band transition. Reference 3 confirms that the  frequency-response spectrum is similar in shape to the sub-band  transition IR spectrum. Therefore, the above analysis is  reasonable.  <H5>  3.3 Dependence of Peak Detectivity </H5> D*[.sub]_l_p[/] Upon Bias Current and Temperature    Optoelectronic performance characteristics such as peak  detectivity D*[.sub]_l_p[/] of a sub-band transition QWIP are  closely related to its operating conditions. We found that  detectivity varies significantly with the bias current, as shown  in Figure 4. Furthermore, a different curve exists for each  temperature. Obviously, each photodetector has an optimal  operating point at a specific temperature. At that point, it has  the maximum detectivity. The corresponding current is the  optimal bias current (which varies as a function of operating  temperature). Hence, it is very important to ensure that a QWIP  operates at this optimal point. Figure 5 shows detectivity as a  function of operating temperature. Especially after the  operating temperature exceeds liquid-N[.sub]2[/] temperature  (77 K), detectivity drops even faster. The MQWIP developed  should also have blackbody response when the operating  temperature exceeds 100 K.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-03A>      Figure 4. Detectivity vs. Bias Current at Different Temperatures </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-03B>      Figure 5. Peak Detectivity vs. Operating Temperature </FIG>   <H5>  3.4 Measured Results </H5>   Five different sets of QWIPs of different dimensions have  been prepared. Table 1 shows their primary performance  characteristics at 77 K. The measurement of responsivity and  detectivity was discussed earlier. Specimen parameters and test  conditions are as follows (for specimen G236): photodetector  area 8.04 x 10[.sup]-4[/] cm[.sup]2[/], blackbody emission  aperture 0.4 cm, distance between emission aperture and  photodetector 20 cm, modulation frequency 799 Hz, measurement  circuit bandwidth 24.08 Hz, and window transmissivity 63  percent. Table 1 only gives the voltage responsivity  R[.sub]_n_[/]. The current responsivity R[.sub]i[/] can be  calculated from R[.sub]_n_[/] and the calculated differential  resistance r, i.e., R[.sub]i[/] = R[.sub]_n_[/]/r. For  instance, the optimal bias current for specimen G236 at 77 K is  9 x 10[.sup]-7[/] A (from Figure 4). The corresponding  differential resistance r = 2.4 x 10[.sup]6[/] _O_ (which is  looked up from the differential resistance vs. bias-current  curve). Corresponding to voltage responsivity R[.sub]_n_[/] =  9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] (V/W), the current responsivity  R[.sub]i[/] = 0.4 A/W. This is comparable to the highest  value ever reported worldwide. In addition, from Table 1, the  most important indicator of the GaAs/AlGaAs long-wavelength  MQWIP developed, D*[.sub]_l_p[/], i.e., peak detectivity at  77 K, has exceeded 10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W.  This is higher than the best level ever reported  worldwide.[.sup]7[/]       Table 1.

Conclusion </H5>   The MQWIP, a recently developed IR photodetector, is an  important direction of development in IR sensing technology. It  has advantages such as fast response, high quantum efficiency,  good thermal stability and excellent uniformity, and has become  a leading-edge subject worldwide.    This paper reports the preparation and characterization of a  high-sensitivity, low-dark-current GaAs long-wavelength MQWIP.  By way of careful design and process improvement, the  performance of this device is further enhanced. At 77 K, the  peak detectivity, D*[.sub]_l_p[/], has exceeded 1 x  10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W and the dark current  is below 0.1 A. These are better than anything else reported  worldwide.

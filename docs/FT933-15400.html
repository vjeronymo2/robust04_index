			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Nightclub expenses repaid by Attali THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's audit committee has uncovered further details of personal expenses incurred by its president, Mr Jacques Attali, initially charged to the bank but since reimbursed. The committee, which is close to completing an investigation into overspending at the bank, has discovered Mr Attali repaid Pounds 20,000 in personal expenses charged to the bank, including nightclub expenses. The charges were incurred on his EBRD corporate credit card, issued by American Express and repaid 10 days ago with a series of cheques. A bank official said the nightclub expenses could have been considered 'legitimate' bank expenses since Mr Attali was entertaining bank clients, businessmen and government officials. But Mr Attali decided to 'err on the side of caution' and repay the expenses. Mr Attali had reimbursed personal expenses charged to the bank in a similar way on 'many previous occasions'. The audit committee has been told Mr Attali repaid Pounds 41,000 for four or five flights in private jets taken at the bank's expense but for private purposes. The repayment was received by the bank's finance department in April, after the Financial Times highlighted overspending at the bank, including Mr Attali's use of private jets. But the cheque was dated February 10. The committee has also been told Mr Attali was bought four company cars in the two years since becoming president. His current car is Renault's top-of-the-range executive car, the Safrane. The committee has been told that, prior to that, he was bought a Jaguar, a Citroen XM and a Renault Espace. But a bank official said the Renault Espace, a multi-purpose vehicle, had in fact been bought for the bank's administration department, rather than Mr Attali. When Mr Attali finished using the Citroen, it was transferred to Mr Mario Sarcinelli, a vice president. Mr Miklos Nemeth, another vice president, now uses the Jaguar. The Renault Espace is at the disposal of Mr Bart le Blanc, the secretary general. Mr Attali resigned two weeks ago after the FT disclosed he had been reimbursed twice for a first-class ticket to Tokyo. Mr Attali has given instructions for the bank to be repaid the ticket costs. The audit committee's report, which will be finished by July 15, will concentrate on Mr Attali's use of private jets and the Pounds 55m cost of furnishing its City of London head office, though it is also examining other costs. Mr Attali was not available for comment yesterday.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Ibrahimli, first deputy chairman of </F> the APF, by Elchin Seljuk: "`The Fate Of The APF Is More  Important For Me...'"]    [Text]    [Seljuk] Ibrahim, What duties stand before the APF  [Azerbaijan People's Front] after the cadre changes in its  leadership?    [Ibrahimli] At this stage, we have laid the foundations of a  principle of changing from quantity to quality. Determining the  place and role of a social and political organization in society  depends on this factor to a great extent. We can say that in our  inner-organizational work questions of revival are over despite  the fact that for well known reasons great obstacles stood  before the solution of these questions. Many offices of rayon  departments of the APF were empty and there was uninterrupted  persecution and pressure on our members. Although preparatory  work for our regular congress had stalled, the organizational  conferences had concluded.    Some mechanisms to enable the APF to perform its role in the  political process again have been prepared. Primarily, the  creation of an alliance of democratic forces has turned into the  need of the day. The deepening of the economic crisis in the  country and problems in the war zone have created a bad  psychological mood among the people. The number of those looking  optimistically toward the future has fallen. In such a  situation, no political group can influence public opinion  alone. We will join in a democratic alliance and also reinforce  the guarantees of democracy in the country. This alliance, as a  guarantor of democracy in Azerbaijan, will awaken the special  interest of international organizations acting according to the  general game rules in government-opposition relations.    [Seljuk] For a number of months preparatory work has been  done for the regular congress of the APF. When is it planned to  hold this event, which will bring clarity into a number of  issues?    [Ibrahimli] As you know, since the day the organizational  committee for congress preparation began to work, we have not  been satisfied with inner-organizational discussions connected  with the activity of the APF. With the goal of bringing the  public into these discussions, a series of articles have been  published in the mass media. Thanks to these, we have drawn the  necessary conclusions from our mistakes. Purely organizational  conferences for holding the congress are over. We have begun to  hold theoretical conferences as a preliminary step, and broad  discussions on the status of the APF, and on its place, role and  duty in the system. Analysis connected with the sociopolitical  and military situation in the republic have been conducted at  these conferences.    [Seljuk] Ibrahim, how much time was set aside for these  theoretical conferences you mentioned?    [Ibrahimli] Taking into consideration the breadth and  actuality of the questions proposed for discussion, it would not  be correct to set time limits on the organizational conferences.    [Seljuk] How are intergroup relations regulated in the APF?  As first deputy chairman of the APF, those who wish to have  "talks" with you connected to the fact that you are a member of  the Musavat Party...    [Ibrahimli] The broad social basis of the APF differentiates  it from other political groups. Thus, the activity of different  groups within the APF is natural. The basic issue is finding the  mechanism of common principles among these groups and conducting  a joint struggle for the goals of the program of the  organization. The cadre changes in the higher organs of the APF  were born from this need.    As for the gossip about my membership in the Musavat Party,  in order to cast some light on this question I want to talk  about it in some detail. I have been in the front ranks of the  people's movement in Azerbaijan since the day it began. At that  time I conducted my activity in Nakhchyvan. As a result of this  activity I was elected a people's deputy of Azerbaijan from the  district in which I declared myself, and then a member of the  National Assembly. Since I had the idea of reviving the Musavat  Party in Azerbaijan, I was in a position to realize this  question. As I was a member of the revival bureau of the  Musavat, we held a revival congress. Then I was elected to the  Board of Musavat. During the June events the chairman of the APF  and the chairman of the APF Executive Committee left Baku for  well known reasons. Those coming into the government selected  the APF, which was a real force, as their first target. Driving  this organization from the political arena was carried out  without deviation. APF members were persecuted at various  levels. In such a tense political atmosphere, I took on myself  the defense of the overthrown government and the democratic  opposition in the National Assembly. Because of my speeches in  the National Assembly and the position I held, I was both  praised and reviled.    The electoral organs of the APF recommended my candidacy for  the duty of chairman of the APF Executive Committee to E.  Elchibey. Although I was a member of the electoral organs of the  Musavat Party, I wrote a petition saying that the fate of the  movement and the APF was the more important for me, and left  Musavat. I returned once again to the Zeyneddin village support  point of the Babek Rayon chapter of the APF -- to the  organization of which I was a member until Musavat.  Subsequently, the instructions of the APF chairman were turned  over to the High Assembly.    [Seljuk] Can Ibrahim Ibrahimli, who was elected as the  second  man in terms of duties in a large organization like the APF,  fulfill his commitments?    [Ibrahimli] It would be better if you asked those of the  members of this organization who are engaged in policy.    [Seljuk] What do you think about the recent use of force by  the police in Khachmaz Rayon against opposition forces wishing  to hold a meeting, and the arrest of a national representative,  journalists, and members of the APF, Musavat and the ADP?    [Ibrahimli] I view the Khachmaz events as part of an  intentional policy conducted at the state level conducted  against the opposition. This fact shows once again that the APF  leadership, taking the dangerous situation in the republic into  consideration, has listened to proposals on general game rules  in government-opposition relations for the protection of  stability.    The application of these measures against members of the  opposition weakens the government's position. As in every other  time, this time we turned officially to law enforcement organs  in the name of the organization. We will try to place questions  connected with this fact on the daily agenda of the National  Assembly. At the same time, we have submitted documents to  international organizations connected with human rights in  Azerbaijan.</p>

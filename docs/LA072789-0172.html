			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR PROPERTY RIGHTS: HOW TO PROTECT THEM  </P> <P> Monterey Park, where are you going?  </P> <P> Frequently, I hear accusations of bribery, observe traffic problems, businesses  changing, concerns about store signs, controversy in choosing a new police  chief, chaotic City Council meetings, citizens being denied the opportunity to  address an issue and now the council's plan to reduce building -- after, long  after the issue should have been resolved. ("Monterey Park Rejects Plan to  Change Zoning in Residential Areas," Times, April 27.)  </P> <P> Some of the council members' solutions are to downzone property, change  property definitions and other thoughts. Are there more equitable alternatives?  Personally I can't afford the losses that would occur if the present plans were  adopted. And, I wonder how many other Monterey Park property owners (I have  owned property in Monterey Park for 29 years) can afford to lose the value of  their property. I can't and I feel that some council members are impervious and  insensitive to their constituents and to the losses that could occur if any of  their present plans are implemented.  </P> <P> Why does the council have "continued meetings" or "recessed meetings" about  issues that drastically affect property or people without adequate  notification. Posted notification is legal but not always adequate. Is there  something to hide?  </P> <P> Some civic-minded people are part of several different groups in the city to  ensure citizen representation and to protect their property. They have found it  necessary to monitor the Planning Commission and City Council meetings to  protect their rights and investments.  </P> <P> You can do the following:  </P> <P> 1. Write or call City Council members and inform them about your concerns for  property downzoning, changing the definitions of the zoning code or whatever  other plan is being proposed. Your property value will be affected.  </P> <P> 2. Attend the City Council meeting on Aug. 14 to protect your property.  </P> <P> Remember, there is little help after a decision has been made and you have to  live with the decision. Join us to protect our property rights and to ensure  that our property values will be upheld.  </P> <P> DONALD J. SKRABA  </P> <P> Walnut  </P></p>

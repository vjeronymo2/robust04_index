			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Palermo mayor refuses to quit Mr Leoluca Orlando, the leader of the Sicily-based reformist movement La Rete (Network), has refused to resign as mayor of Palermo following the announcement last week he was under investigation for alleged abuse of office. He told Palermo city council yesterday he would not step down but agreed to waive his immunity as a member of the European Parliament. His position contrasted sharply with his demands that politicians under investigation resign immediately. The investigation relates to his previous period in the 1980s as Christian Democrat mayor of the city and concerns delays in restoring Palermo's opera house, the Teatro Massimo. The saga of the opera house is one of Sicily's better known instances of bungling officialdom. It has been closed since 1974when it was declared unsafe. So far L65bn (Pounds 26.7m) has been spent intermittently on restoration but at least a further L32bn is required.</p>

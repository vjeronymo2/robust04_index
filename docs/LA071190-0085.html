			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-W. VIRGINIA GOVERNOR SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS, FINED  </P> <P> Former three-term Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., convicted of corruption and  characterized as remorseless by prosecutors, was sentenced Tuesday to five  years and 10 months in prison and fined $170,000.  </P> <P> Moore, 67, pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud, extortion, obstruction of  justice and filing false income taxes during his 1984 and 1988 campaigns and  during his third term, from 1985-89. He lost the 1988 reelection bid.  </P> <P> He was ordered to report to the Federal Correctional Institution near  Petersburg, Va., by July 31.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman on Monday had refused to let Moore withdraw  his guilty pleas.  </P> <P> "No governor or other public official of that responsibility has ever been  convicted for election fraud of this scope," Assistant U.S. Atty. Joe Savage  said before sentencing.  </P> <P> "Arch Moore is a criminal," he said. "If there is one thing missing from that  man, it's remorse."  </P> <P> Moore, a Republican who also was governor from 1969-1977, and a U.S.  congressman for 12 years, appeared stoic during the sentencing and later  declined comment. An appeal is pending, said defense attorney William Hundley.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Michael Carey said Moore likely will serve at least 2 1/2 years  before being considered for parole.  </P> <P> "I think it sends a very clear message," Carey said. "If you violate the public  trust, you go to jail."  </P> <P> Carey's investigation into state government corruption also has netted the  convictions of five legislators, three lobbyists and a state Senate aide.  </P> <P> Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to extorting $573,000 from coal operator H. Paul  Kizer in return for a $2.1-million refund from the state's Black Lung Fund,  which provides benefits to coal miners.  </P> <P> Moore also pleaded guilty to trying to block a federal grand jury investigation  into corruption in his Administration.  </P> <P> And he admitted filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985 and defrauding  the state of his salary and benefits by funneling $100,000 in illegal cash  payments into his 1984 campaign, to buy votes.  </P> <P> Hoffman sentenced Moore to five years for extortion, six months for mail fraud  and two years each for the tax fraud charges, all concurrent.  </P> <P> Moore also got 10 months for the obstruction of justice charge, which carries  that mandatory prison term.  </P> <P> Hundley said Moore's corruption involved campaign funding violations, not raids  on the treasury, and added: "I submit he served well and honorably."  </P></p>

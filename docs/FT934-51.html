			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Ugly duckling sheds old-fashioned feathers: The rehabilitation of Standard Chartered bank Musing on the sudden popularity of Standard Chartered, Mr Malcolm Williamson compares his bank with a teenager who is leaving behind the awkwardness of childhood. 'As you cease to be an ugly young girl and become attractive, some of the boys are bound to get excited,' he says. Excited is putting it mildly. Even by the standard of banking - one of the strongest performing sectors in the London stock market in 1993 - Standard Chartered blossomed. The old colonial bank that has not yet shaken off the image of being accident prone and indifferently managed has nonetheless managed to double the price of its shares to a heady 1234p. Unfortunately for the new management, which took over in May on the retirement of the former chairman and chief executive, Mr Rodney Galpin, this has little to do with them. It is mainly a matter of history: Standard has an exceptionally strong franchise in the growing markets of Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific, built up over 140 years by the chartered banks from which it was formed. Standard's transformation into being a prime emerging markets play has been sudden indeed. It has been an ugly duckling among UK banks for most of the past decade, with a chapter of accidents including last year's Pounds 293m provisions and write-downs against the Indian securities market scandal, contributing to an indifferent rating and speculation about it being taken over. Mr Williamson, who became chief executive with the accession of Mr Patrick Gillam as non-executive chairman, argues that it has now emerged from the worst vulnerability. 'There is no particular reason why anyone should have a tilt at us, and it would be quite expensive now,' he says. Yet he and Mr Gillam have a lot to achieve before Standard's rehabilitation is assured. The bank has suffered from three core problems: Earnings have been extremely volatile. Earnings per share fluctuated from 113p to a loss of 53.6p between 1988 and 1989. This is partly because it has consistently poured cash down unexpected holes such as Bombay, but also because it operates in many fast-growing economies which produce high returns at the top of the cycle, but are also at risk from sudden falls in asset prices. Management has been poor. Standard's colonial roots created a federal structure which gave its country managers a lot of autonomy. The bank exerted too little control from London on the balance of its businesses and did not monitor adequately the operational, credit and market risks it was running. It has been under-capitalised. Its equity to assets ratio has fallen steadily over the past five years and it has just bolstered its capital with a Pounds 100m issue of preference shares. Apart from paying uncovered dividends between 1989 and 1991, the devaluation of sterling against the dollar has weakened the ratio of its sterling equity to overseas assets in currencies which track the dollar. In spite of the weight of history, most brokers are now bullish. 'There is a good story here,' says Mr Robert Law, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. 'Standard now has a very strong management team that is focusing on business where they have a good franchise and running down the marginal ones. You are starting to see the underlying profitability of the bank coming through.' There is little disputing Standard's formidable earnings potential. Its shares, despite their rise, are still only trading at between 10 and 12 times brokers' estimates for full-year earnings, which is not demanding for banks in the Asia Pacific area. Such earnings should ease its capital problem, but will not address those of poor management and earnings volatility. Mr Gillam lists the ways he and Mr Williamson are trying to address these two issues. He has attempted to improve management by recruiting senior executives from outside the bank and by imposing stronger controls. Among those recruited this year are Mr Peter Wood, the former Barclays finance director, to head the new combined function of finance and risk management. The bank is now trying to set stronger central guidelines from London. These are implemented by regional management 'hubs', including one in Dubai controlling the Middle East and South Asia. Mr Williamson says this means that Indian operations are now monitored from a hub 'only a couple of hours flying time away. That gives us an infinitely better degree of control.' The need to improve the quality of earnings is being addressed in several ways. One is to reduce assets in countries which produce poor returns, including Africa and most OECD countries. Mr Gillam says that it may eventually confine operations outside Asia and other fast-growth economies to trade finance, and capital markets and treasury functions. Standard is also trying to increase its flows of non-interest income, both by providing services to companies, and by acting as a financial intermediary rather than using its balance sheet. Mr Gillam cites the example of China, where it lacks the capital strength to lend large amounts for big projects, and wants to act more like an investment bank by arranging and syndicating loans. This raises the question of how much capital it needs. Mr Law is among those who argue that Standard needs a much stronger capital base to operate in risky countries, and points out that other Asian banks maintain a ratio of tier 1 capital (largely equity and retained earnings) to risk-weighted assets of more than 7 per cent. Standard's tier 1 ratio in the first half was 5.4 per cent. Mr Gillam believes the bank would be over-capitalised if the ratio rose above 7 per cent, although he is aiming for at least 6 per cent. That does not seem too testing a target given the earnings which Standard can expect over the next three years. But he says that even when capital is restored to a healthy level, the bank will remain cautious about expanding assets in the Asia Pacific. Indeed, the whole mood at Standard is one of caution. Mr Gillam admits that the management has not yet demonstrated the ability to produce consistently high returns. But he brushes aside talk of the bank being an untameable beast. 'I do not think it is axiomatic that this institution is more hazardous than others, providing it is well run. That is our challenge.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------- BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                  Trading Profit   Total Assets                                     Pounds m        Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Asia Pacific                           382.4        14,050.4 Australia                               (1.7)          294.7 North America                          (19.7)        1,538.4 UK and Europe                          (64.4)        6,920.7 Africa                                  43.6         1,333.1 Middle East and South Asia            (267.7)        2,285.0 Continuing business                     72.5        26,422.3 Problem country debt unit               (2.2)          904.0 TOTAL GROUP                             70.3        27,326.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream/Standard Chartered  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

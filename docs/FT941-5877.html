			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Oxbridge benefits from grant share-out Oxford and Cambridge are among the greatest gainers from the reallocation of government grants to universities for the academic year 1994-5. Both received increases of 5.8 per cent compared with this year's total funding. Only the London Business School and the Open University are ahead of them. Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, said both universities had benefited from a reassessment of research funding. They also avoided being penalised for over-expansion last year. Less traditionally prestigious universities which also secured funding increases of more than 5 per cent included Coventry, Plymouth, and Portsmouth, all of which were polytechnics until two years ago. The London School of Economics and Political Science, educator of numerous world leaders, is one of nine universities limited to a below-inflation increase of only 1 per cent. Bristol, another traditionally prestigious university, is also among the nine. Last year the LSE announced a plan to charge students an extra fee for tuition, claiming this would be necessary to maintain academic standards. This was eventually voted down by lecturers, but the move indicated that the LSE was unhappy with its level of funding. Some specialist institutions that do not have university status enjoyed spectacular shifts in funding. Lackham College of Agriculture near Chippenham secured the greatest rise in grant - 55.4 per cent. The effect on intakes next year will vary widely between different universities. Changes in overall funding will have less impact than the target figure set by the funding council. The University of East Anglia, despite an increase of 3.4 per cent in funding, predicted it would have to cut intake by about 8 per cent compared with last year. It said the funding council had not taken into account the number of four-year courses it offered, so it would be able to accommodate its cap on total admissions only by cutting the number it introduced in the first year. It said that other universities could be affected by the same problem. Prof Davies predicted that the sharpest cuts, of around 10 per cent, would be made by the former higher-education colleges, such as Derby and Luton, which boosted their admissions while pre-paring bids for university status.</p>

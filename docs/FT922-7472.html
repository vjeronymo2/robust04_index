			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Weary leader may never see his dream come true: Julian Ozanne finds Col Gadaffi seeking how to end United Nations sanctions LIBYA'S tug-of-war with the United Nations over the fate of two Libyans charged with organising the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland has left its mark on Colonel Muammer Gadaffi. The Libyan leader, looking more like a defeated boxer than the passionate revolutionary, told the Financial Times at the weekend that he expected UN sanctions against Libya to be lifted following the regime's 'categorical' renunciation of international terrorism and its acceptance of a UN resolution. He spoke inside a Bedouin-style tent covered with Persian carpets at a farm 10km from Tripoli. Female bodyguards with holstered pistols strapped to their belts lay on the ground in front of a huge mobile home. A lone anti-aircraft gun, mounted on the back of a Toyota land cruiser, was visible in the distance. The Libyan leader said that both men were ready to stand trial anywhere in the world but feared whether they would get a fair hearing. Preparing what western diplomats in Tripoli believe is a face-saving way out of the stalemate between Libya and the UN, Col Gadaffi said: 'This is not my personal problem or the problem of the Libyan state. It is a problem which concerns the two men and their lawyers.' He said that Libya's acceptance of UN Resolution 731 to cut all links with terrorist groups and invite UN monitors to confirm that his regime was no longer training terrorists meant that 'anyone who has ever been involved in terrorism should be thrown out of Libya. 'There is no justification for a confrontation between Libya and the US and Britain and no justification for sanctions because the Libyan people are not guilty,' he said. He said the two Libyan suspects' confidence in American and British justice has been shaken by the verdict in the Los Angeles police case and the recent reversal in Britain of Ms Judith Ward's conviction for terrorism, which he described as an 'historical scandal'. Col Gadaffi, dressed in a dark brown jerd - a traditional Libyan lamb's wool blanket - draped over his shoulder, said the aviation sanctions imposed by the UN had caused much suffering, particularly to those who needed to travel abroad for medical treatment. He said he feared that forthcoming US presidential elections, which he compared to a fabled beast which needs to be offered sacrifices every four years, would influence how the west acted towards Libya. Throughout the interview Col Gadaffi spoke softly in Arabic. At times he appeared disoriented and occasionally he rested his head in his elbow. He insisted that his personal renunciation of terrorism was genuine. 'You cannot spread ideals by force or they won't be ideals any more. You can only spread ideals by convincing people,' he said. He also appeared to show a new-found respect for the UN. 'I am happy that everybody is refering to the UN to solve international disputes like the Pan Am case,' he said. Reflecting on his 23 years in power, the colonel said his greatest achievement had been the establishment of the people's authority and his green book of philosophy, blending pan-arabism, nationalism, socialism and Islam with prophecy. The worst failure, he said, was that he had not been 'able to change the world. But, he added, 'it is going to change. We only regret that we may not be here to see it, but it will change to our ideas.'</p>

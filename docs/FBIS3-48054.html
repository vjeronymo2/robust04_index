Briefing reporters on the talks between Dr. Mahathir and  visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija Izetbegovic,  Abdullah said discussions at ministerial and senior official  level between the two countries would be held to work out  details of the aid.    Izetbegovic, who is on a four-day visit to Malaysia, and Dr.  Mahathir met alone before being joined by their respective  delegations for another meeting which lasted more than an hour.    The president also delivered a keynote address at the  influential conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia, which  began here Saturday.    The Malaysian delegation to the meeting included senior  officials from the Prime Minister's Department, the Foreign  Ministry, the Defence Ministry, and the National Unity and  Social Development Ministry.    Abdullah said the discussions between the two delegations  had  resulted in a very clear understanding of the problems facing  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He said apart from strengthening cooperation between the two  governments, the meeting had also enabled Malaysia to understand  Bosnia's stand in declining the offer made at the latest peace  talks in Geneva.    We understand their position and will continue to support  them at international conferences, Abdullah said.    He said Bosnia regretted very much the West's accusation  that  they were the obstacle to peace in the Balkans for refusing the  offer made by the West.    How will they accept the offer when land seized from them is  given to the Serb and Croatian invaders and also when they have  no access to the sea. It tantamounts to surrender, Abdullah said.</p>

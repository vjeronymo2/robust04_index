Either there are  many disagreements among cabinet members or you actually  threatened to resign...    [Cavallo] Well, I made a communications error. In one way or  an other I was the cause of the storm over the past two weeks.  I admit my responsibility and will do everything in my power to  avoid a repetition. People inside and outside the government --  not the media -- have used the mistakes I made to harm me. They  believe it would benefit the country if I had a setback and had  to step down as economy minister. That is nothing new: in all  governments there are people who dislike some cabinet members.  I have faced many problems within the government but I have  always had Carlos Menem's full support. The ministers who have  generally and repeatedly disagreed with me or confronted me have  had to listen to the president's reiterated support for my work.  The current cabinet composition will enable the entire  government and I to work together very well.    [Diaz] What about the other ministers? How are your  relations with them?    [Cavallo] Let us take the case of the labor minister  (Armando  Caro Figueroa): I believe there is full consensus between us,  like never before, but there was also quite a good understanding  with former Education Minister Rodolfo Diaz. Former Labor  Minister Enrique Rodriguez and I viewed labor problems very  differently. Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and I have a close  understanding -- much better than with former Minister Erman  Gonzalez. I have always been on good terms with Foreign  Minister Guido Di Tella. I never had problems with former  Education Minister Antonio Salonia, while Jorge Rodriguez is an  excellent education minister: I would say his personality leads  him to become engaged in matters that are common to the economic  area. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf and I are managing  regional economies quite well. He placed Juan Antonio Zapata  [not further identified], who is one of my team. Secretary  General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza always helped to make a  harmonic government, he always played the role of moderator. In  addition, he is the closest man to the president and can best  interpret the president's thinking and mood. In other words,  the government is running well...    [Diaz] How come? Now you have no problems with anyone?    [Cavallo] There are obviously snipers; some of them from  Congress, others from the government. Then there are people  like Barrionuevo [not further identified], who attacked me in a  shameful manner. There are also those who always take advantage  of each of my mistakes to try to undermine my position. Then  there is the Radical Civic Union, especially its leaders, who  want me out. They do it because they are electorally strained.  Three or four months ago, before signing the pact, Alfonsin  spoke about me and the economic team with high regard, while he  strongly attacked President Menem. His aggressiveness returned  after he signed the Olivos pact when the problems of outlining  an opposition stand appeared because he had to give up his  political opposition. This time he spoke against the economic  plan. He said inflation and recession will return within two  years -- as if that trend will yield some political benefit for  him.    [Diaz] It is incredible that just 40 days before the  elections, confrontations within the cabinet have intensified  and Cavallo is suddenly be seen to be alone... Are you alone?    [Cavallo] I can tell you that last week I felt alone -- and  I  said so at the cabinet meeting. That was unfair because the  president has always given me his full support. Yet I did feel  alone, especially when I was the target of the shameful attack  by Judge Roberto Marquevich. The only voice I heard in my favor  was that of Eduardo Menem, who very rightly noted that when I  said there was vagueness in the DGI [General Directorate of  Taxation], in no way was I meddling with court decisions or  speaking against the judge or the courts. People like Deputy  Alberto Piotti praised Marquevich and criticized me, thus giving  the impression that I caused a controversy with the courts,  despite the fact that I never mentioned the judge or commented  on what he had to decide.    [Diaz] But the judge was about to prosecute some officials  on charges of perjury...?    [Cavallo] I suddenly realized that versions were being  fueled  from the court itself. The judge personally leaked that he  would prosecute Gustavo Andres Parino, the national customs  administrator. That was outrageous: Parino was being attacked by  those who previously managed the customs finances. He was  implementing a substantial transformation there, with Tacchi and  Cossio [not further identified]. Having heard Marquevich's  attack and reviewed the generalized media opinion that the judge  was right -- without anyone standing up to defend me, and with  some Justicialist Party members attacking me -- I felt alone on  that day. That is why I raised the point at the cabinet.    [Diaz] Did you threaten to resign...?    [Cavallo] Never. I never threatened to resign. Neither once  nor on many occasions, as some people have said. I would never  resign in a situation that could jeopardize the continuity of  the economic program and the success of our government work. I  would never step down for my own personal benefit, jeopardizing  what we have accomplished through the Menem government. The  president knows this very well.    I am also convinced that -- contrary to what many have  suggested -- President Menem's is not trying to overshadow me.  I believe it is natural that Menem should claim for himself the  leading role in this process, because he is the one who has led  it. I think he should feel uncomfortable when people want to  make me appear almost on the same footing with him, as far as  the merit for what is being done is concerned. I may have my  own merits, but the factor that led to Argentina's  transformation is the political determination, leadership, and  courage of Menem. Some people believe I say this just to please  Menem. It is, however, how I feel...    [Diaz] You believe there was a minor conspiracy against  you...    [Cavallo] No... Some people tried to use my communications  mistakes or those verbal confrontations to attain sectorial  objectives or to defend personal interests or the interest of  groups with respect to the economic policy. To me this is very  clear.    [Diaz] What interests?    [Cavallo] Economic and political interests. Economic  interests, like all that occurred in connection with the  automobile regulations. Such regulations, which are eight years  old, stem from a total ban on importing automobiles. The ban is  temporary, it is similar to the ones that are being enforced in  Mexico, it was accepted by NAFTA countries, and it was suggested  at the Uruguay round of GATT talks. Even though the automobile  sector is today much more liberal than it was four or five years  ago -- despite the fact that when this campaign began the  newspapers reported a drop in car prices -- despite all that,  they intend to compel us to enforce total liberalization. They  took advantage of that opportunity to insist on their  objectives. I believe they are being driven by economic  interest. Others are doing it for, say, political motivation:  it is undoubtedly tantalizing and attractive for the middle  class to buy cars at half the current price, in a much larger  number of installments, and with the choice of any model. Yet  any responsible person will understand that transition from a  totally closed economy -- like that of Argentina's automotive  sector -- to a totally open economy in a technically complex  sector with strong world competition, is not that easy.    [Diaz] Are there any other economic sectors or interested  groups that seek to sabotage your plan?    [Cavallo] There was a lesser-known sector that tried it.  They began to attack the customs office. There is a set of  businesses linked with mail, transportation, and cargo services,  which seeks to remain as a monopoly. They want me out to avoid  disclosure of what comes through the airport... Nothing will be  left of this monopoly, even though it began during the military  government, it flourished during the Radical administration, and  it managed to survive at the beginning of the Menem  administration.    [Diaz] Some people think your work may now begin to fade,  because there will be no more income from privatizations, while  public spending will grow. Is the economy doing well?    [Cavallo] I want people to be totally reassured. Argentina  is doing very well. In the past two months we had very  important news, to which no attention has been given. There is  no reason to be afraid. There is no problem whatsoever between  President Menem and Minister Cavallo. Quite the contrary. I  don't feel discouraged as economy minister and I am not giving  up.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> YEARLONG STUDY OF TRASH IS UNDER WAY  </P> <P> At first glance, the four men sifting through the trash appeared to be  archeologists searching for discarded artifacts from past civilizations.  However, at closer inspection, these artifacts smelled bad and were only about  a week old.  </P> <P> This month, the city of Fullerton, along with the Environmental Institute at  Cal State Fullerton and MG Disposal Systems Inc., started a yearlong study to  determine exactly what local residents throw away.  </P> <P> The study is being done in compliance with a new state law that requires all  cities and counties to reduce their solid waste and start recycling programs.  </P> <P> California cities are expected to reduce their waste flow 25% by 1995 and 50%  by the year 2000, according to the law. Fullerton is the first Orange County  city to undertake a trash survey as the first step in that process.  </P> <P> The sorting was taking place in a corner of a warehouse at the MG Disposal  facility in Fullerton. The four men were surrounded by at least 20 barrels of  trash marked with identification tags.  </P> <P> It's important to classify all the waste that's picked up by the special team  of trash collectors to "get a feel for the trash," said Stewart L. Long,  Environmental Institute director and Cal State Fullerton economics professor.  </P> <P> "We want to know exactly what's being discarded by residents, business and  industry," he said as buzzing flies played tag over his head. "The city wants a  program that fits the community. We don't just want a curbside program that  would only partially handle the waste flow."  </P> <P> Overseeing the study is Black &amp; Veatch, a Santa Ana engineering firm hired  by MG Disposal.  </P> <P> Chris Meyer, assistant to the city manager, said that the study will help  Fullerton customize a recycling program to its own particular waste flow.  </P> <P> "Several cities in the county have instituted recycling programs costing  millions of dollars to implement. Many of these programs are based upon  waste-stream assumptions that may or may not be accurate for Fullerton," Meyer  said. "Our study will identify the sources and quantities of recyclable  materials generated here and will enable us to tailor a recycling program to  the actual recyclable waste stream produced by the city."  </P> <P> The waste is sorted into eight categories: paper, plastics, glass, metals, yard  waste, other organics, other waste and special waste.  </P> <P> The study is utilizing trash picked up randomly from about 600 homes and 150  businesses throughout the city. All sites are selected by a computer.  </P> <P> After the study's completion, expected by May, 1991, the city will develop a  recycling plan and submit it to the county for approval.  </P> <P> The study is expected to cost the city about $215,000, said Meyer, noting that  Fullerton will pay for the study through a one-year surcharge of 25 cents for  residents and $2.10 for businesses on monthly trash rates.

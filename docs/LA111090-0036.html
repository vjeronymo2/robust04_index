			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY MUST BE STOPPED  </P> <P> The Department of Transportation has proposed a nationwide ban on the use of  radar detectors on big rigs and is seeking public comments on this issue.  (Business, Times, Nov. 4)  </P> <P> I wholeheartedly support this measure.  </P> <P> Radar detectors, also know as "fuzz busters," are designed solely to encourage  drivers to exceed the speed limit and thwart speed enforcement efforts. This  endangers lives.  </P> <P> More people die or are injured in truck-involved accidents each year than in  all casualties involving airplanes, trains and boats combined. Speed accounted  for 37.8% of truck-driver-at-fault fatal and injury accidents in California in  1989.  </P> <P> Trucks with radar detectors are more likely to speed and SPEED KILLS!  </P> <P> Legislation is necessary to prevent trucks from killing and injuring on our  highways.  </P> <P> HELEN SHANBROM  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

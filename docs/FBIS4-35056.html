			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adriana Cortes] </F>   [Excerpts] The report by the Evaluation Commission  appointed by President Rafael Caldera to diagnose the ills of  basic industry enterprises indicates in its final conclusions  regarding the mining sector that the Venezuelan Corporation of  Guayana (CVG) should have more control over the country's mines.  This would mean transferring to the CVG some of the powers now  exercised by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.    The document contains a recommendation that the national  nature of property ownership should be retained in the mining  sector, which has a great deal of potential for the country. For  this reason, administrative procedures should be adopted to  assign to the CVG all tasks related to the administration,  provision of services, control, supervision, and monitoring of  mining properties.    The commission, which was headed by Asdrubal Baptista,  minister for economic reform, suggested in its report that the  Ministry of Energy and Mines should maintain control over the  granting of mining concessions, and that improvements should be  made in the legal aspects of that mechanism. The CVG would deal  with administrative matters as well as monitoring and overseeing  mining, in accordance with legislation.    The report contains an expose making it clear that not  enough  control has been exercised over the mining areas in the region,  and that functions should be clearly delineated and carried out  more strictly.    "It is a question, then, of designing a system in which the  Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana carries out all administrative  procedures with respect to investigating and confirming  compliance with regulations, and improving the legalities of  granting mining concessions should be left up to the Ministry of  Energy and Mines. Moreover, in this model, the CVG would be  responsible for all monitoring and overseeing of the mining  itself." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Guarantees for Workers </H5>   Another important conclusion in the Evaluation Commission's  report -- although it has not received a lot of attention -- has  to do with industrial management. It proposes that a significant  percentage of the shares in the industrial firms of the CVG be  used as compensation in lieu of benefits to public employees who  opt for early retirement.    The clarification of providing a guarantee for workers can  be  deduced from one of the well-publicized conclusions of the  report, the one referring to the privatization of basic industry  enterprises. The offer of shares would be limited, in this case,  to employees who retire from their jobs, and would serve as  partial payment of the various benefits to which they are  entitled.    In addition, to keep the CVG from completely abandoning  social and labor programs after the decentralization and  privatization take place, the commission proposes that a  significant amount of the proceeds the state receives from the  sale of its property be used to finance a Permanent Occupational  Education Plan, as well as job retraining and continuing  education programs, in which private industry would participate.    One noteworthy aspect of the report is that it does not rule  out the possibility that the entities associated with the  Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana may be privatized under the  Privatization Law.    The document, signed by Minister for Economic Reform  Asdrubal  Baptista, states that "the legal nature of the process that will  lead to the desired objectives should be made very clear, and it  should be established whether the provisions of the current  Privatization Law, which could hinder the process, are to be  applied here, or whether other, more effective and expeditious  avenues can be opened up."    Another major difference between this plan and the ones the  CVG has advanced so far is the fact that it does not exclude the  possibility that even electric companies could be privatized  some day, once total maturity is achieved, without harming  rational economic interests.</p>

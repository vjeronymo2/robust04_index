			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Increased Norwegian National Debt </F> Worries Central Bank Chief"]    [Text] Oslo -- "Regardless of whether the price of oil  rises to $18 or more, it is still necessary to make cuts in  public spending in Norway. Otherwise the result will be that we  too build up a huge state debt," Torstein Moland, Norwegian  Central Bank chief, said.    Even though most of the curves are positive for Norway at  present there is one that is falling sharply -- that which shows  state assets. When at their highest, these were over 200  billion kronor in 1990. A couple of years earlier the  government began an expansive finance policy which threatens to  wipe out the whole of the Norway's fortune before 1997.    Torstein Moland took up his post at the beginning of the  year. As a result of a private investment, which is now the  subject of a police investigation, he has already been the  target of tougher criticism than any of his predecessors.  Nevertheless he is determined not to tell the Norwegians things  they would prefer to hear. But he has the same educational  problems as everyone else who tries to explain how the Norwegian  economy hangs together.    Why be worried when Norway is the only country in the OECD  which does not have a national debt, which has lower interest  rates than Germany, which has improved its competitiveness by 12  percent over five years, and whose Central Bank has not needed  to intervene in the currency market since 1992?    "It is tempting and quite understandable to breathe a sigh  of  relief when optimism returns to the Norwegian economy and to be  happy about the upturn we we can see coming. But it is  indefensible," Torstein Moland said.    He warned that Norway like other countries must adapt itself  to structural changes which go deeper than the shifts in the  market.    "Compared with other countries we had the advantage of  building up an oil fortune in the eighties. But the freedom of  action we have had thanks to it is now largely a thing of the  past. There are not many countries which have spent money at  the same rate as Norway without acquiring serious national  financial problems."    Torstein Moland pointed out that Norway's surplus in its  balance of payments is also a result of the fact that there has  been too little investment in mainland industry.    "We need a large sector that is exposed to competition.  Simply increasing oil production is not enough. Even though  the Norwegian Bank is not expecting prices to rise by more than  a couple of percent this year, there is still a certain amount  of uncertainty.    ``We have never been in a situation in which unemployment  falls from the high level we have had for several years. It is  possible that despite unemployment levels, shortages will occur.  In the construction sector there are already signs that there  will be a shortage of qualified labor when construction takes  off again at the same time as large public projects, such as a  new main airport, are carried out.''    Thus Torstein Moland's message to Finance Minister Sigbjorn  Johnsen is that the national budget should show a surplus as  soon as possible.    The budget deficit for 1994 is the equivalent of 3 percent  of  GNP. "It is only now that we can begin to tighten our belts  without strangling economic growth," he said.</p>

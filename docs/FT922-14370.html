			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Yeltsin survives Congress vote MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday narrowly defeated a parliamentary motion of no confidence in his government. However, his opponents demonstrated a new determination to force their demands on to the political and economic agenda. The first day of the Russian Congress of People's Deputies demonstrated a groundswell among deputies against Mr Yeltsin and left Russia's economic reform process in the balance. During the proceedings, deputies showed determination to force a change of economic course, even if this meant the appointment of a new government. Mr Yeltsin defeated a direct vote of no confidence by only a slim margin, of 447 votes to 412, from a total of 1,003 deputies. He was also forced to abandon plans for Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, to deliver his report on economic reform yesterday. Instead, Mr Yeltsin, agreed to make the report himself today. It became clear that the pro- and anti-reform factions have organised into two political blocs. These reflected alliances formed at the weekend to try to instil voting discipline into previously diverse and loosely organised factions. The hardline bloc, Russian Unity, which brings together the patriotic and communist groups, is pressing for the resignation of the government, an end to radical reform and - in a number of cases - the resignation of Mr Yeltsin as prime minister. The pro-government bloc, including Democratic Russia and others that formed Mr Yeltsin's main support during his presidential race, has submerged its various criticisms of the government in favour of a 'co-operative coalition of reform' with the president. Both groups number somwhere around 400 deputies, with the hardliners probably slightly ahead. The position of the Industrial Union, which numbers around some 56 deputies and represents industry's interests, is seen by the government and the presidential apparatus as crucial. They are claimed as members by the hardliners, but this is denied by their leaders. Instead, they are bargaining behind the scenes with ministers for further tax breaks and credits in return for their support. Mr Mikhail Bocharov, a leading businessman and deputy, said: 'The industrialists are worried about taxes and the rise in energy prices (set for June). If they find if necessary to vote with the hardline parties, they will make up more than half the congress. However, I think they will reach agreement with the government. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said: 'We are working closely with the industrialists to try to find practical solutions.' If the government succeeds in buying off trouble, it will be at the cost of a further weakening of a reform programme. There were announcements last week that Rbs200bn credit would be made available to agriculture and industry, and promises by Mr Yeltsin at the weekend that he would cut taxes and bring businessmen into the cabinet.

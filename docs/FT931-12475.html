			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: Holdings up after sales Sir, In your report of share price movements under the heading 'Highlights of the week' (January 23), the reason given for the fall in Thames Water's share price was directors' share option sales. You may like to know that while it is true that the directors exercised a large number of share options - and sold a total of 1.2m of those shares - the executive directors' total holding in Thames Water shares actually increased by an aggregate of 124,533. I myself converted all my options to new shares in the company. Roy Watts, chairman, Thames Water, 14 Cavendish Place, London W1M 9DJ</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Arts: Rostropovich plays Shchedrin - Concert On Tuesday, thanks to a London Symphony commission made possible by Sir Jack and Lady Lyons, we heard Mstislav Rostropovich at the Barbican, London, in the world premiere of a cello concerto, a 'Sotto voce concerto'. The composer Rodion Shchedrin, now 62, is (slightly) known in this country for his ballet The Little Humpbacked Horse and for his ballet-adaptation of Carmen - not sotto voce music at all. His new concerto has been brewed in quite a different samovar. It is whispery, nostalgic, evocative; and highly personal, in the double sense of intimating things close to the composer's heart, and of being specifically conceived for Rostropovich's rare powers. The solo instrument is rarely silent, but mostly muted, even in the huge cadenza that leads to the Finale. The full orchestra is used very sparingly; the most prominent sounds are those of three soft, intertwined flutes - and of all the other cellos, generally divisi. A solo recorder lends a pastoral note, for Shchedrin is thinking of his childhood in 'the sleepy tiny little place of Alexin on the Oka', in Tolstoy country. Most of the material suggests shepherds' songs and peasant rounds, mused and rhapsodised over by the cello with spectral orchestral echoes. Toward the end, quite unexpectedly, the heavy brass come to angry life with rat-a-tat fanfares: war gripping the countryside, perhaps? Rostropovich wrung 'meaning' from every phrase, of course, and we listened compulsively. But despite the best efforts of the conductor Seiji Ozawa, the score sounded awkwardly diffuse for a 37-minute piece: amid so many elusive sounds and colours, we needed more palpable structure, less stop-go. Probably Russian ears can fasten more quickly on ghosts of traditional tunes, and maybe discern a development that remained opaque to the rest of us. As a matter of fact the largest faction in the audience was Japanese, drawn presumably by Ozawa. He conducted a scrupulous Beethoven 'Pastoral' too, tame in the peasants' Scherzo but limpid by the stream: pleasant, unmemorable. Sponsored by Yamaichi</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gold explorers head south LEADING US gold producers are cutting exploration spending at home while increasing it substantially in Latin America, according to a survey by the Gold Institute, a Washington-based, industry-financed organisation. Worldwide exploration spending by the 18 companies surveyed - which together accounted for 73 per cent of 1991 US gold output - fell by 16 per cent last year from Dollars 280m to an estimated Dollars 235m. Their gold exploration in the US fell by 18 per cent to a four-year low of Dollars 149m. This represented 63 per cent of total exploration budgets, down from 65 per cent in 1991 and 71 per cent as recently as 1989. 'This is the first time spending and share simultaneously declined - clear evidence that the US market is growing unattractive for investment,' the institute suggests. Meanwhile, exploration spending in Latin America, which was only Dollars 14m in 1989, increased by a further 16 per cent last year, from Dollars 30m to and estimated Dollars 35m. 'Latin American nations are taking deliberate and aggressive steps to recruit US investment. Mining is an internationally competitive business and capital will flow to those nations which have mineral wealth and offer an attractive business climate,' the institute says. It admits its survey excludes exploration work by small companies, prospectors and independent exploration companies - an important part of the business - but points out that 'the presence of a senior (big) gold producer in a given country is a sure sign that smaller companies have led the way'. The survey shows spending by US gold producers in Canada remained steady at an average of Dollars 27m a year or 10 to 11 per cent of exploration budgets. However, 'US producers appear to be wrapping up their efforts in Australia where spending (down from Dollars 14m in 1991 to an estimated Dollars 10m last year) and share (down from 5 per cent to 4.25 per cent) declined over the period of the survey'. In 1992 US producers cut spending in the rest of the world by 42 per cent to Dollars 15m. The survey will provide the US mining industry with ammunition as it battles against efforts being made in Congress to impose a national royalty on mineral production and other measures that the industry suggests would discourage investment in mining in the US. The institute points out that during the 1980s the US became the world's second-biggest gold producer and adds: 'As congressional and administration leaders consider measures to reform laws regulating this industry, they must carefully consider how their actions will affect the competitive position of the US'.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish of 14  April 1994 reports on page 4 that Sandinist National Liberation  Front (FSLN) member Fernando Cardenal criticized the National  Directorate (DN) for the actions it has taken since Chamorro  took office. These include the lack of criticism of the pinata  (the confiscation of property by FSLN leaders following the  party's defeat in 1990). By not rejecting the pinata the DN was  "discredited" in the eyes of the rank and file to the point that  its subsequent actions were rendered ineffective. The DN also  erred, Cardenal says, when it forced Sandinist Assembly members  to elect the DN as a slate rather than by secret ballot prior to  the first party congress in 1991, and when it refused to  recognize the Assembly as the party's highest authority between  congresses. Furthermore, the DN has ignored "the minimal and  most basic ethical principles...and has been unable to prevent  detractions, insults, and calumnies on the part of Sandinist  militants." Cardenal refers to an interview by DN member Henry  Ruiz who said in February that the FSLN secretary general makes  decisions in lieu of collective decisionmaking by the  Directorate so that "today there is no National Directorate but  rather a leadership crisis." Cardenal hopes that his reflections  will serve as a guide to participants in the FSLN extraordinary  congress which will be held on 20 May.</p>

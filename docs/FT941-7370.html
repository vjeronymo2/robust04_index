			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: A delicate mission to Beijing - Tony Walker on Sino-EU talks complicated by China rejoining Gatt and by Hong Kong Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, faces a delicate task in Beijing this weekend in discussions with Ms Wu Yi, the tough-minded Chinese trade minister. Sir Leon will be obliged to complain about Chinese threats against British business over Hong Kong; although as a former British cabinet minister he will not want to appear to be engaging in special pleading. London expects, nevertheless, a robust performance since anxiety is growing among British businessmen about the impact of the lingering row over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's democracy proposals. China's strong desire to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is seen as a possible lever. 'It's certainly not in the spirit of Gatt to discriminate against British commercial interests,' said an official in Beijing. Sir Leon is visiting Beijing for a meeting of the Sino-EU Joint Commission, which convenes annually to review trade and related issues. This joint session will have a sharper focus since the pace is quickening on discussions about Beijing's application to rejoin Gatt. The process has been in train since 1986, but the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 slowed progress until late 1992 when the US resumed closer consultation. The Uruguay round, to which China was a party, and the birth next year of the World Trade Organisation to replace Gatt have further stimulated discussion. China wants to be a founder member of the WTO, just as it was of Gatt in 1948, the year before the communist takeover. Sir Leon will be left in no doubt by Ms Wu of Beijing's wish that deliberations in Geneva in mid-March of the Gatt working party on China should take on more urgency. At a meeting this week in Beijing with Dorothy Dwoskin, the chief US Gatt negotiator, China's trade minister spoke of a willingness on the part of the Chinese to be flexible, but US and EU officials say that significant obstacles stand in the way of China's Gatt entry. The EU's main concern is to see a strong and enforceable safeguards clause built into the protocol outlining terms for China's Gatt accession. The EU fears surges of Chinese imports, and points to a host of what it sees as dumping problems - discounted pricing of Chinese goods in the European market - as an example of what might lie ahead. China is resisting a safeguards clause, fearing that such a measure, providing for the imposition of quota restrictions, would be used arbitrarily to stifle Chinese exports. EU officials argue that because of China's market reforms it should not be treated differently from other 'free-market' Gatt signatories. Countries of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are intent on ensuring that China's entry to Gatt is subject to the most rigorous terms. China's boisterous trade performance in the past decade, and expectations that this marks just the beginning, loom large in western concerns. Ten years ago China, with exports of little more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn), accounted for just 1 per cent of world trade. Exports last year reached Dollars 92bn, or more than 2 per cent of the total. But more immediately it is trade imbalances that are worrying China's main trading partners. The US trade deficit with China for the first 11 months of 1993 was Dollars 21.4bn; the EU deficit for last year was expected to be slightly down on the 1992 figure, which some estimates put as high as Dollars 12.1bn. Japan's deficit exceeded Dollars 3bn. US and EU officials, with the Japanese experience in mind, fear that such imbalances will be perpetuated unless China is obliged further to open its markets and reduce the monopolistic powers of its state trading corporations. 'Lack of transparency in their import regulations and their licensing requirements constitutes in our mind one gigantic tariff barrier,' said an EU official. The US, for its part, is arguing that China should not be allowed to impose import restrictions in any individual case unless rules governing those restrictions are published. China, whose tangled web of trading rules has been obscured for decades from the outside world, has undertaken to publish an official journal of its regulations, but foreign officials in Beijing are sceptical about this undertaking. They also have doubts about Beijing's ability to enforce standardised trading rules across its vast terrain, especially in light of the growing power of individual provinces and regions. Among principle US concerns - and this may well be an issue raised by Sir Leon - is that of access to the China market for service organisations such as banks, retailers, accountancy and law firms, and advertising agencies. 'They are resistant - very resistant on services,' said a US official. Rampant counterfeiting of such items as computer software and compact discs is another issue likely to emerge, with both the US and Europeans determined to tie respect for intellectual property rights to Gatt entry. China, in spite of having reduced numbers of items subject to import licensing, abolished some non-tariff barriers, and unified its currency as a step towards convertibility, is finding Gatt entry a frustrating process. While Sir Leon is not likely to adopt a confrontational stance, he will be duty bound to remind China of the fairly stringent requirements for Gatt entry. China cannot, for example, expect to get in to Gatt and then negotiate terms for entry. 'We're trying to get it right before they get in,' said an EU official in Beijing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China's trade and  investment fair in New York closed here today, and organizers  and participants described it as "a complete success."    The fair, which started Tuesday [19 April] afternoon,  attracted more than 700 business people from about 300 U.S.  firms. The Chinese and U.S. businessmen have signed 62  contracts and agreements valued at 5.4 billion U.S. dollars,  according to the spokesman of the fair.    The spokesman said these deals include six contracts on U.S.  investment in China and agreements on China's purchasing of 600  million dollar U.S. commodities.    The 200-member strong Chinese trade and investment mission  came to the United States two weeks ago with the Chinese  economic and trade delegation, headed by Wu Yi, Chinese minister  of foreign trade and economic cooperation.    While the minister and her delegation was in Washington to  attend the eighth session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on  Commerce and Trade last week, the Chinese entrepreneurs also  held a trade and investment fair in Los Angeles.    In Los Angeles fair, the two sides have signed 11 contracts  worth 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and 134 agreements valued at 4.4  billion dollars.    Shen Yonglie, one of the chiefs of the Chinese mission, told  the press that he had found that U.S. business people are  extremely active in trying to understand China and in finding  ways to do business with China and to invest in China.    "A number of senior U.S. business leaders had proposed,"  Shen  said, "that Chinese fairs of this kind should be held in the  United States once a year."    Chinese entrepreneurs, he added, were also very much  interested in establishing closer business ties with their  American counterparts.    "In this regard, we have already achieved our goals," Shen  said. "we have set up a lot of contacts with U.S. firms, far  more than we had expected."    The Chinese official expressed his belief that these  contacts  would result in much closer business relations between the two  countries.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Agnelli finance company improves to L218.4bn ISTITUTO Finanziario Industriale (IFI), the financial holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, lifted net profits to L218.4bn (Dollars 190.24m) in the 12 months to March 31 from L206.6bn a year earlier. Consolidated net earnings - reported for the first time - amounted to L285bn, while shareholders' funds came to L3,954bn. A large part of IFI's earnings stemmed from extraordinary gains, amounting to L71.5bn, on the continuing reduction in its holding in the Fabbri publishing group, which is being sold to Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera. Dividend receipts from companies in which IFI has a stake, notably Fiat, rose to L174bn from L170.9bn. IFI is paying an unchanged dividend of L315 per ordinary share and L365 for savings stock. The entire ordinary share capital is held by the Agnelli family. Sprind and Finanza &amp; Futuro, the two Italian investment funds controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cofide group, are to merge. The deal will create the country's third-biggest fund management group. The joint concern will have about L4,500bn under management, giving it a combined share of about 7.5 per cent of the Italian fund management market. Mr Antonio Corti, managing director of Finanza &amp; Futuro, said the merger was designed to allow the two companies to meet the Bank of Italy's recently announced new capital adequacy rules for investment funds without the need to pump in extra cash. Under the central bank's new requirement, Italian fund management groups will have to have shareholders' funds equivalent to at least 0.5 per cent of their total funds under management, up to ceiling of L20bn. One of the Cofide companies meets the new level, the other does not. The combined operation will have a capital base of over L20bn.</p>

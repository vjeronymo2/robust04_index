			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Cathay order for Boeings gives R-R big boost CATHAY PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-based airline, placed firm orders yesterday for 11 Rolls-Royce-powered Boeing 777 widebodied aircraft worth Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 980m), with options to acquire an additional 11 airliners, which would take the order to Dollars 3.4bn. The deal is a significant boost for Rolls-Royce, currently in fierce competition against Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US for the new Boeing 777 wide-bodied market, and for Boeing, which wants to expand the customer base for its latest aircraft programme. Rolls-Royce said the order for its heavy-thrust Trent engines to power the Cathay Pacific Boeing 777s was worth about Dollars 500m. Rolls-Royce has undergone widespread restructuring in the past two years with the loss of about 7,000 jobs. The latest deal is unlikely to have any impact on employment at Derby where Rolls-Royce produces its commercial aircraft engines. Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company would continue to keep a firm grip on costs and productivity to maintain its competitive edge against its US rivals. The UK engine maker powers the entire fleet of Cathay Pacific jets but Sir Ralph said his company had faced tough competition from Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE. The order is particularly important for Rolls-Royce because it has given the UK manufacturer a strong position in the market for heavy-thrust engines to power the new generation of wide-bodied aircraft being developed by the main airliner manufacturers. Rolls-Royce is investing about Pounds 400m in developing the heavy-thrust Trent variant of its RB211 engine family. Rolls-Royce lost last year to GE in the contest for a British Airways engine order for new Boeing 777s, but the Cathay Pacific deal has given the UK manufacturer a 28 per cent share of the engine business of the 777. Rolls-Royce has already won orders from Emirates, the Dubai airline, and Thai International Airways for its Trent engines to power 777 airliners.</p>

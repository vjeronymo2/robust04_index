			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (15): Gains despite loaded dice - Tea industry FATE could not have been more cruel to the 22 companies which last year were awarded five-year profit-sharing management contracts to run Sri Lanka's decaying state plantation sector. When they picked up the reins at 450 government-owned tea, rubber and coconut estates in July 1992, they were well aware that the sector was losing about SLRs5bn (Dollars 114m) a year - just over SLRs400m a month. Some estimates put losses over the last few decades as high as SLRs50bn. What the companies could never have forecast was a year in which the worst drought in the living memory of many planters caused output in the sector's most lucrative crop, tea, to fall to just 179,000 tonnes - the lowest level for 36 years. If that were not pain enough, earlier this year they were forced to absorb a 25 per cent government-imposed pay increase in an industry where wages already account for over 75 per cent of total costs. In spite of the loaded dice, the companies contrived to make a sharp dent in overall losses by mounting a successful drive to eliminate theft, waste and poor labour management. They saved tens of millions of dollars in stolen tea, fertilisers, wages to ghost workers, bribes to officials and outrageously over-priced transport costs. Says Mr LG Munasinghe, Sri Lanka's Tea Commissioner: 'Pilferage in the state sector may have accounted for between 8 to 10 per cent of total turnover.' The companies introduced new financial management techniques, fired some of those caught thieving, sidelined the most inefficient and, most important of all, began the long process of improving agricultural field practices. Some notable gains have already been made. Average losses for the second half of last year were cut sharply to around SLRs133m a month, and more dramatically, in the first half of 1993 to SLRs83m a month - just 20 per cent of the average monthly loss when they first took over. Four companies say they hope to make a profit this year. Equally encouraging is the belief that better field practices have already helped to achieve a slight boost in tea output, though nobody can put a figure on the exact size of the increase. This year Sri Lanka is expected to regain its position as the world's largest exporter of tea, after falling into second place behind India in 1992. According to Mr Munasinghe, production is likely to end the year at around 222,000 tonnes - up about 25 per cent on last year, though not as high as the record 241,000 tonnes produced in 1991. He believes better used of fertiliser and other improved practises may enable Sri Lanka to boost output to 250,000 tonnes next year, if the weather is favourable. Further good news for companies struggling to turn their estates round is that Colombo is expected soon to announce substantial changes in the contracts awarded last year. These will probably include a decision to extend the contract from five years to 30 years, possibly with the option of a further 30-year extension. 'Before the end of the year, I fully expect to be in a position to grant a new contract, possibly a usufruct contract of 30 years,' says Mr Rupasena Karunatilleke, Sri Lanka's minister of plantation industries. The contract, which will be similar to a lease, is tantamount to privatisation. The companies will no longer merely share in the profits - if there are any - but will bear all the risks of any losses too.' The longer contract is vital if companies are to take a long-term view and raise much needed capital to modernise the country's ageing plantations. Many of the tea bushes are 50 years old and of the wrong type, with scores of estates averaging output of just 1,000kg a hectare  - less than half that of India and Kenya, Sri Lanka's main competitors. The expectation is the Asian Development Bank will come up with about Dollars 60m in low interest loans, which the government will lend to the industry, providing companies put up capital of their own. Many estates are already improving their finances by diversification. Some have switched a proportion of their land into cash crops, while a few are looking at the feasibility of gem mining. Others are selling valuable timber resources, while one company is hoping to build a golf course and another is looking at the possibility of turning an old tea factory into a hotel. All this is heartening news for a sector stifled for decades by the dead weight of a top-heavy management and bureaucracy that often seemed hardly to care whether the industry remained solvent or not. Turning the industry around will nevertheless be an uphill task. Unacceptably high wages are likely to remain a feature for several years to come, while labour agitation in a highly unionised sector has already manifested itself in several strikes against management efforts to cut labour costs. Above all, it is in tea that Sri Lanka has the experience and expertise. But tea prices seem so often to favour the industrialised countries at the expense of third world producing nations.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: More acquisitions for Coats Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Europe's largest textiles company, and Sir David Alliance, chairman, have set their sights on more acquisitions this year, writes Daniel Green. New companies made a strong contribution to Coats' annual results published yesterday. The company has brought gearing down to 31 per cent, the level it was three years ago before it took over Tootal, the thread maker, in a Pounds 252m hostile bid. 'The acquisitions are likely to be under Pounds 50m each', said Mr Bain, adding that a figure as high as Pounds 100m was possible. Target businesses are likely to be in the company's biggest areas of business: thread, clothing, homewares and precision engineering outside the UK. The company also announced yesterday the Dollars 12.5m (Pounds 8.5m) purchase of a US precision plastics company, Precision Engineering of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>

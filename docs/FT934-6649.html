			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Further fall puts builders' supplier on firmer footing The half-point cut in interest rates was especially welcome to a builders' merchant with high bank borrowings. The interest rate cut 'absolutely delighted' Mr Charles Fisher, chairman and chief executive of Sharpe &amp; Fisher, the publicly quoted builders' merchants with 22 branches in southern England.

The company, based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, sells principally to small housebuilders and repair and maintenance tradesmen ravaged by the recession. 'We've had terrible experiences with customers going bankrupt,' he says. Bad debts rose from 0.5 per cent of turnover before the recession to 1.7 per cent at its worst. Last year it was down to 1 per cent and has now fallen further. Mr Fisher said: 'We've had to be very fierce, but the small trader is not helped if his debts are allowed to accumulate.'

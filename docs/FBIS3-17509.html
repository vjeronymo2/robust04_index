Thus, as told SNARK the  press-service of Karabakh Defence Army, the defenses of Armenian  forces were shelled in the direction of Berdashen village (East  Karabakh). So far there was no information of victims.    Azerbaijan's military units resumed their attacks in  Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday morning. They tried to retake the  positions they lost earlier but they failed to do so. NKR's  armed units repulsed the attacks and forced the enemy forces to  retreat to their former positions.    Azerbaijan's attack aircraft dropped three heavy bombs on  the  NKR's defensive positions in Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday  morning. We have not yet received a report on the number of  casualties. The Armenian positions in Novruzlu and Yusifdzhanly  in Agdamskiy Rayon were fired on with machine guns on the same  day. No other significant incident took place at the front  lines. The NKR defense units maintain their control of the  strategically important Omar Pass.    Azerbaijani Air Force units have taken an active part in the  operations the ground forces carried out during the past two  days. The neighboring republic's attack aircraft have bombed the  NKR positions. According to a report we received from the NKR  Defense Army press service a short time ago, two enemy aircraft  dropped cluster bombs on NKR positions close to Goradiz today.  The report said that even Azerbaijani troops were affected by  the effects of that attack. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani aircraft  also tried to bomb Stepanakert. However, the NKR air defense  forces successfully blocked the attack.    Intensive combat operations did not take place at the front  lines yesterday. The confrontation was in the form of  positional fighting. Exchanges of fire took place between the  warring sides in various parts of the front line.    According to NKR reconnaissance units, Azerbaijan's military  command has maintained its effort to deploy reinforcements and  military hardware in various parts of the confrontation areas.    An incident has not occurred on the border between Armenia  and Azerbaijan from last night until 1600 this afternoon.</p>

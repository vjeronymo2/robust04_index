			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Plan for Bosnia stirs disputes: The Moslems object to suggested boundaries but at least all sides are prepared to discuss the EC-UN proposals THE peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina has the merit of having been accepted for the first time as a basis for negotiation by all the warring parties. However, many of its detailed provisions are still hotly disputed. At the heart of the disagreements about the plan - tabled in Geneva at the weekend by the two co-chairmen of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen - lie Bosnian Moslem objections to some of the boundaries of the proposed 10 essentially autonomous provinces making up the new decentralised state, in which Serbian Moslems would control nearly 50 per cent of the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. What Mr Vance, the United Nations' special representative, and Lord Owen, representing the European Community, have proposed is a constitution which would recognise the three big ethnic groups - Moslems, Serbs and Croats - as the constituent units of the new state, as well as a group of 'others'. In spite of all their avowed efforts to eschew a purely ethnic division of the country by taking other relevant factors - such as history, geography, the economic situation and communications - fully into account, they have, in the end, had to draw the provincial boundaries largely on the basis of ethnic criteria. Thus, each of the main ethnic groups will be dominant in three provinces, with Sarajevo remaining a 'mixed' province. That will allow the Serbs to retain extensive, but by no means all, areas they have 'ethnically cleansed'. Though the Serbs have demanded a corridor linking two of their assigned provinces, they feel they can do a territorial deal with the Croats. That is very different from the attitude of the Bosnian Moslems, who not only feel they are being deprived of territory they consider their birthright, but who fear that the Serb and Croat provinces will some day organise referendums on whether to merge with their parent states, Serbia and Croatia. The central government, as well as all the new provinces, except the 'mixed' province of Sarajevo, would have separate democratically elected legislatures, democratically chosen chief executives and independent judiciaries. The nine-member presidency of the new state would be composed of three representatives each of the three main constituent ethnic groups. The three main ethnic groups would also be equally represented in the provincial government of Sarajevo, while the capital itself would become an 'open city', which should be demilitarised at the earliest possible date. The state of Bosnia-Hercegovina should also be progressively demilitarised under UN-EC supervision. In keeping with the principle of freedom of movement throughout the new state, laid down in the draft constitution, the co-chairmen have proposed 'throughways' between provinces, policed by UN or other international forces, to ensure that the free flow of traffic is not obstructed and that military forces or material do not move through these crossings. Special 'blue routes' guaranteeing safe passage to humanitarian aid and civilians to and from Sarajevo, which, after the cessation of hostilities, would be extended to cover the whole country until normal freedom of movement is established, have also been proposed. The separation of the armed forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina would have to be negotiated in the light of provincial boundaries and the co-chairmen have proposed the areas to which the various forces should withdraw. It is envisaged that there will be no military forces in Sarajevo province. Once the new constitution is agreed and there is a return to normal civil life, elections supervised by the UN and the EC would take place. But Lord Owen said this was unlikely to happen for 'a considerable number of months'.</p>

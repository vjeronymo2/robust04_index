			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg returns to black in first six months Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and metals group that is restructuring, yesterday reported a swing back to profit in the first half of the year. It posted a pre-tax surplus of SKr351m (Dollars 45m) after a loss of SKr528m in the same period last year. Sales were down to SKr9.57bn from SKr10.83bn mainly due to the effects of disposals. But each of the four main divisions  -mines and smelters, rubber products, metal processing and distribution - sharply improved operating results. Lower operating costs, lower interest costs and contributions from associated companies produced the return to the black. The company said a large rise in base metals prices - with the exception of zinc - helped the mines and smelters division, the biggest Trelleborg operation, rebound to a SKr30m operating profit from a loss last time of SKr35m. Overall operating profits jumped to SKr424m from SKr105m. A continuation of present metal prices and an expected further improvement in the other divisions promised 'significantly better' group earnings in the second half, the group forecast. Net interest costs fell to SKr216m from SKr435m thanks to a SKr1.08bn fall in net borrowings to SKr6.13bn and lower interest rates. Trelleborg's guarantee commitment on loans of SKr3.65bn held by Falconbridge, the nickel producer, was erased when Falconbridge used the proceeds of a share issue to pay off debt. The share issue reduced Trelleborg's stake in Falconbridge to less than 30 per cent from 50 per cent. But improved results at Falconbridge still helped to push up Trelleborg's contributions from associated companies to SKr150m from a loss of SKr130m last year.</p>

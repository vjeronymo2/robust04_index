In an article for BILD (Wednesday [12 January] edition) Ruehe  writes that the alliance has opened "clear prospects of  accession" for the neighbors in East Europe. The minister goes  on to say: "On the way toward this, Partnership for Peace makes  closer cooperation possible without shutting anyone out. It is  in the interest of our country that democracy and prosperity,  NATO, and the European Union should not end at Germany's eastern  borders. The eastward expansion of NATO means more stability  for the whole of Europe."    Ruehe emphasizes: "America has once again affirmed its  commitment to security in Europe in an impressive way. The  alliance has decided on the steps necessary for its reform.  America recognizes the European Union as an independent partner  within the alliance."

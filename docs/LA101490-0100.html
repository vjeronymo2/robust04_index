			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL TAKES A 31-3 LEAD, THEN HANGS ON TO WIN;  </P> <P> ARIZONA STATE: COMEBACK STALLS WHEN RESERVE QUARTERBACK BRET POWERS LOSES  FUMBLE. BEARS WIN, 31-24.  </P> <P> Russell White scored three touchdowns, Mike Pawlawski threw for 232 yards and  California survived a second-half collapse to beat Arizona State, 31-24, in a  Pacific 10 game Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Golden Bears, 4-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10, led 21-3 at halftime and  held on for their third consecutive victory. The Sun Devils fell to 2-3 and 0-2  with their third straight loss.  </P> <P> Arizona State, trailing 31-3, closed to 31-24 on Leonard Russell's 11-yard  touchdown run with 5:20 left in the third quarter, Kelvin Fisher's four-yard  touchdown run with 13:07 to play and Russell's 21-yard scoring run with 5:21  remaining.  </P> <P> The Sun Devils appeared to be driving toward the tying touchdown until reserve  quarterback Bret Powers, on a first-and-10 play from the Cal 17-yard line,  fumbled while being sacked and Golden Bear linebacker Cornell Collier recovered  the football at the 30. Cal then ran out the clock.  </P> <P> Pawlawski, who had 13 straight completions at one point and finished 22 of 33  with three second-half interceptions, passed Sean Dawkins on a 10-yard scoring  play for a 7-0 lead with 7:17 left in the second quarter.  </P> <P> White, the sophomore from Crespi High in Encino who had 88 yards in 21 carries,  scored on a 10-yard run around left end to cap a seven-play, 73-yard drive 4:26  before halftime.  </P> <P> Cal made it 21-3 when White turned a screen pass over the middle into a 17-yard  touchdown with 16 seconds left.  </P> <P> Arizona State's lone first-half points came on Mike Richey's 29-yard field goal  with 1:19 remaining. He was wide right on a 42-yard attempt 4:19 into the game,  only the second miss of his career.  </P> <P> Robbie Keen's 43-yard field goal 3:35 into the third quarter gave the Golden  Bears a 24-3 lead.  </P> <P> White's four-yard touchdown run, set up by defensive tackle Joel Dickson's  interception, made it 31-3 with 7:44 remaining in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The Golden Bears rolled up 503 yards in total offense -- 271 of it rushing as  Anthony Wallace had 136 yards in 25 carries.  </P> <P> Arizona State had 345 yards, 224 of it on the ground as Russell got 186 in 25  carries.  </P> <P> With senior Paul Justin still sidelined with a separated left shoulder, the Sun  Devils alternated quarterbacks. Sophomore starter Kurt Lasher completed three  of 10 passes for 22 yards while Powers, a redshirt freshman, played most of the  second half and was seven of 18 for 99 yards with one interception.  </P> <P> The game, which started in 87-degree late-afternoon heat, drew a crowd of  59,043 at 74,865-seat Sun Devil Stadium.  </P></p>

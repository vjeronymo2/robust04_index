			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received the following from the Defense  Ministry: Our forces have repulsed desperate and aggressive  assaults mounted by the forces of the ruling military regime in  Sanaa on various fronts. Our Armed Forces dealt crushing blows  against the enemy forces in the following areas: On the Abyan  axis they destroyed eight tanks and three (Daskas), and captured  five tanks. On the Tawr al-Bahah/Khara axis they destroyed  eight tanks and three (Daska) vehicles, and captured four tanks.  Meanwhile, our forces are continuing, with rare courage, to  repulse the forces of aggression on all fronts. God is great.  God is great.</p>

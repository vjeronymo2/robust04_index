			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Factoring commended COMPANIES which make use of factoring grow faster than non-users, according to a survey for the Association of British Factors and Discounters. It finds little difference in profitability between the two groups. Its survey, Small Business Finance and the Role of Factoring, did not show that users performed better than non-users, but the association hopes the finding that they perform as well will help dispel factoring's image as a form of finance used by compan-ies which are in difficul-ties. The survey found that users of factoring had lower net margins than non-users, partly because of the fees charged by factors, but the faster rate of growth compensated for that. The researchers compared the results of 200 companies which used factoring or invoice discounting and the same number of non-users.</p>

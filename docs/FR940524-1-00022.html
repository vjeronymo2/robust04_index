			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters pointed out, that in any event, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine the amount of ``misestimated residual value.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters also expressed a belief that the question raised is based on a false premise. Residual value is a concept based on historical cost and enters into the process of determining depreciation costs (an allocation process), whereas gains or losses based on fair values subsequent to a business combination are derived from current values (valuation process). Therefore, residual value should not be compared to disposition value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, a few commenters recognized the significant discrepancy between the original residual value and the fair value established subsequent to a business combination, may indicate a misestimation in the residual value which could be interpreted as a CAS non-compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board appreciates the input of comments who responded to this issue. It notes the comments that indicate that it may be difficult to separate the consequences of misestimates in residual values from changes in fair values when assets are transferred in the course of a business combination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Practically all the commenters recognized that subsequent to a business combination the government may have a clear-cut claim against the seller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of industry comments expressed the belief that the government has a valid claim only to the extent that there have been erroneous estimates of depreciation in the past. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A significant number of comments did recognize, however, that subsequent to a business combination the relationship between the government and the seller may dissolve. In those cases, it was suggested that appropriate notation agreements should be negotiated with the buyer. The government comments, in particular, stressed that if the claim cannot be successfully pursued against the seller, then there must be alternative ways of pursuing the claim, such as proceeding against the buyer or trying to collect from the proceeds of the acquisition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board notes the comment that the government may have difficulties in pursing to claim against the original owner of the assets if subsequent to a business combination there is no longer a business relationship between the government and the seller. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters on the whole, did not support the notion that the government should recover its share of gain or loss subsequent to asset revaluation from the buyer. Some comments pointed out that such a gain or loss recovery is a contract administration issue and not an accounting matter. It was also suggested that the matter might be best dealt with at the time when novation and advance agreements are negotiated between the government and the contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Repsonse:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has taken note of the comments received on this topic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The last issue raised in the SDP concerned the advisability of retaining the original asset base subsequent to the business combination in view of the complex and costly procedures that would have to be developed to share any gain or loss, attributable to asset revaluation, between the government and the contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was a clear divergence of views on this topic between the government commenters and other comments. All the government responses indicated that assets should be not revalued subsequent to a business combination. All the other comments expressed the views that such a revaluation should be carried out and recognized for government contract costing purposes. One industry comment did point out, however, that the assets should not be revaluated if the business combination takes the form of acquisition of shares rather than assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

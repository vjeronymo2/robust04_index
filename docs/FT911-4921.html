			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Groupe Bull increases control of US arm GROUPE BULL, the loss-making French computer maker, yesterday increased management control of its US-based overseas division, so paving the way for a full reorganisation of the group's cumbersome structure. It paid an undisclosed sum to buy the remaining 12.8 per cent stake held by Honeywell, the US electronics group, in Bull HN Information Systems, which groups the bulk of the French company's activities in North America, the Pacific Rim and Australia. This means Groupe Bull will own 85 per cent of Bull HN, with the remaining 15 per cent in the hands of NEC, the Japanese electronics company which is being discreetly courted as a possible minority partner in the group itself. Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull's chairman, is working on plans, due to be completed in the summer, to merge Bull's four fragmented operating units into a single company. This implies bringing NEC into the group ownership, though officials of neither company are prepared to go into more detail. Bull recently announced a record FFr6.8bn (Dollars 1.20bn) loss for 1990, following which the French government has had to pledge FFr4bn of fresh capital over the next two years to fund job losses and the costs of rationalising the organisation. NEC has been a partner in Bull HN since the unit was formed in 1987 by Bull, Honeywell and the Japanese company, from Honeywell's information systems division. Honeywell has gradually run down its 42.5 per cent stake in the joint company over the years, to leave its hands free to concentrate on its core controls business. Bull has at the same time been expanding in North America, culminating with last year's Dollars 511.5m takeover of Zenith Data Systems, the microcomputer maker. Apart from Zenith and Bull HN, the other two divisions embrace Bull's French and European operations.</p>

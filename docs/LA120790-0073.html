			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REAL ESTATE EXECUTIVE GETS 6 YEARS IN FRAUD  </P> <P> The former president of a Woodland Hills real estate investment company that  defrauded more than 200 investors out of an estimated $12 million was sentenced  Thursday in federal court to six years in jail.  </P> <P> In sentencing Alan R. Keranen, 42, to federal prison, U.S. District Judge  William Matthew Byrne rejected an unusual request from Keranen that he receive  a 10-year sentence during which he would be jailed one week of every month and  be free the rest of the time to work and pay back the investors.  </P> <P> Byrne would not agree to the proposal, saying that the fraud was too serious  not to merit a standard jail sentence. In sentencing Keranen to six years,  Byrne also ordered him to make $3.5 million in restitution to investors.  </P></p>

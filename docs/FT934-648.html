			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ICI to invest Pounds 9m in Bangkok paint plant Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, yesterday announced it was investing Pounds 9m on a paint plant in Bangkok, Thailand, as part of its Asian expansion policy. The company simultaneously announced that its new paint plants in Malaysia and China would be fully operational during the first half of next year. Mr Herman Scopes, chief executive of ICI Paints, said: 'The expansion of our Thai facility is part of a long-term strategy aimed at seizing the exciting opportunities for sales of surface coatings in the expanding economies of the Pacific Basin.' The new plant will add 50 per cent to the group's paint capacity in Thailand, where ICI paint sales have doubled over the last five years. The facility, designed to manufacture solvent-borne decorative paints, will be operational in three years. ICI already owns a 67 per cent stake in a plant at Bangkok. The remainder is owned by the East Asiatic Company of Denmark. The Asian-Pacific region - including Australia which is an important market for ICI Paints - represented about 22 per cent of the division's Pounds 1.58bn turnover last year. Demand for paints and varnishes in the Asia-Pacific region was about 4.56m tonnes last year, three times more than in 1970. It is is expected to reach 6m tonnes by 1997 and could approach 8m tonnes by 2002, according to the European Polymers Paint Colour Journal. Smith New Court, the broker, expects the paints division to generate sales this year of Pounds 1.71bn, largely as a result of growth in Asia and the North American market. The division, which represented about 20 per cent of group turnover last year, is expected to generate trading profits of about Pounds 107m, compared with Pounds 115m last year.</p>

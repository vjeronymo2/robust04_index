			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippines and other Southeast Asian [SEA]  countries have initiated efforts to create a powerful "think  tank" in the Asia-Pacific region, National Security adviser Jose  Almonte said last weekend .    Almonte said a "building block" composed of government and  private individuals from ASEAN and four Indo-China nations was  formed to formulate goals and guidelines which will be presented  to their respective heads of state for approval.    He made the announcement during a dinner in honor of the  Philippine National Police hosted by the host committee of the  Miss Universe beauty pageant at the Shangri-La Hotel in Makati  Saturday night.    Almonte said the group formally met 30 and 31 May in Manila  and another meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last week.    The group is composed of 21 government officials,  politicians, diplomats, college professors and technocrats from  the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia,  Myanmar [Burma], Cambodia, Thailand and Laos.    "The main goal of the group is to advise our respective  governments on how to strive to become a major force in the  Asia-Pacific region and later be worthy as a building block of a  global community, Almonte said.    He said the think tank that includes non-members of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations will tackle not only  regional security and economic development but also mutual  respect for each country's internal affairs with respect to the  dignity of every person.    "The group envisions a regional community, not patterned  after the European Economic Community, but a new model of  international cooperation based on the principles of peace,  prosperity and justice with respect to individual rights,"  Almonte said.    Almonte said the members of the think tank include people  with a common vision of a borderless Southeast Asia.    He said one of the initial proposals of the group are the  holding of a SEA Summit as soon as possible to decide formally  on the projected creation of more cohesive SEA cooperation.    Another proposed project is the creation of the SEA  Development Corporation to boost economic development and  management skills in the region.</p>

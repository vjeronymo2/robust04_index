			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKFAST;  </P> <P> STARTING YOUR DAY THE CEREAL WAY  </P> <P> Until just a few years ago, a restaurant customer's request for cereal was  answered with a bowl, a spoon, a glass of milk and a miniature box from  Kellogg's. But power breakfasting has brought the day's humblest meal into the  hands of chefs. They are helping us rediscover the satisfying flavor, texture  and nutritional integrity of a bowl of oats.  </P> <P> A survey of local restaurants reveals many favorite breakfast and brunch spots  that offer a variety of whole-grain cereals, often made in the restaurant's own  kitchen. Campanile, for example, serves a nutty granola made at the restaurant;  Kate Mantilini offers Wheatena cooked in apple juice. Angeli Mare dishes up  soft polenta with butter, brown sugar, raisins and pine nuts, and Babalu  features Irish oatmeal with Grape Nuts and fresh fruit.  </P> <P> Ever since the Neolithic Age, cooks have experimented with grain -- indeed the  greatest civilizations have been built and destroyed over the stuff. But I  started experimenting with cereal in reaction to trips to the grocery store.  </P> <P> A walk down the supermarket cereal aisle reveals an overwhelming selection of  flakes, crisps and "O"s. Just past the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cereal and  Breakfast With Barbie is a fleet of healthy-looking cereal boxes with names  such as Nutrigrain, Fruitful Bran and Kenmei Rice Bran. I am sure that many of  these cereals are good for you; however, I prefer to know exactly what is and  isn't going into my cereal bowl. That's why I make most of my breakfast  cereals.  </P> <P> We're so accustomed to brightly colored boxes of mass-produced flakes that we  forget how simple cereals are to make at home. All it takes is a big bowl for  mixing, an oven for toasting and a few storage containers. The ingredients are  inexpensive and easily obtainable. Most are available in supermarkets, and a  trip to the health food store should fill any gaps.  </P> <P> Whole grains are satisfying to eat on their own. You can develop a great  appreciation for each one by eating simple porridges made from just a single  grain and water. Multi-grain cereals add depth, complexity and texture. All  grains have a more intense, nuttier flavor when toasted. Try toasting them in a  200-degree oven until golden. The subsequent cooking procedure is easy, and  always the same: 1) Bring liquid to a boil. 2) Add grain. 3) Simmer partially  covered until done.  </P> <P> The trick to making good multi-grain mixes for hot cereals is in combining  grains with similar cooking times. Oatmeal, bulgur, rye flakes, cornmeal and  bran all take less than 20 minutes to cook, whereas 35 to 45 minutes are  required for cooking brown rice, millet and pearled barley. More than an hour  is needed for wheat berries.  </P> <P> Here are the basic ingredients you will need to make your own cereals. You  should note that the same grain may vary slightly in size and thickness from  brand to brand, so the recommended cooking times are only approximate.  </P> <P> * OATS: Always buy old-fashioned or steel-cut oats. Quick-cooking and instant  oats are cut much thinner than the coarser old-fashioned ones, so their texture  doesn't hold up well in homemade cereals. Steel-cut oats, also known as Scotch  or Irish oatmeal, are cut into fine bits. Unlike instant oats, their pronounced  oat flavor and creamy texture improves with cooking. They can be purchased in  supermarkets or health food stores. Cooking time: regular oats, approximately  10 minutes; steel-cut oats, 15 minutes or longer.  </P> <P> * WHEAT: Wheat berries, which are hulled wheat kernels, are delicious but take  several hours to cook. Wheat flakes are a quicker, more convenient alternative  to berries. These are not like "bran flakes"; they are uncooked flakes cut from  the wheat berry and are great to use in multi-grain cereals. Wheat that is  cooked and dried before grinding is called bulgur, commonly used in Middle  Eastern cuisine. Because of its wonderful nutty flavor and short cooking time,  it is an excellent grain for breakfast cereal. Bulgur is very tasty simply  simmered in water with a little butter, cinnamon and nutmeg. Wheat germ, when  toasted, is a crunchy addition to cereal, and wheat bran provides valuable  fiber. Wheat germ and wheat bran can be purchased in supermarkets; wheat  berries, wheat flakes and bulgur can be found in health food stores. Cooking  times: wheat berries, 1 to 3 hours; wheat flakes, 12 minutes; bulgur, 15  minutes.  </P> <P> * RYE: Rye is not an important commercial crop in the United States, but is  fundamental to many European cuisines. It has an earthy flavor that contributes  to a good multi-grain cereal. Available in flakes at health food stores.  Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes.  </P> <P> * BARLEY: A lot of people associate the rich flavor of barley with mushroom  barley soup, not breakfast cereal. It's available in whole kernels, pearl  barley and barley flakes at health foods stores. Cooking time: whole kernel  barley, 1 hour and 15 minutes; pearled barley, 30 minutes; barley flakes, 15  minutes.  </P> <P> * TRITICALE: Pronounced trit-i-kay-lee, this high-protein cereal grain is a  man-made cross between wheat and rye. Available in flakes at health food  stores. Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes.  </P> <P> * CORN: Yellow cornmeal is a quick-cooking, flavorful grain. Mix it with other  grains, or eat it alone with milk, a little sugar and fresh berries. When  making cornmeal mush or polenta, always pour the cornmeal into boiling water  gradually and steadily while whisking vigorously, to avoid lumping. Available  in supermarkets and in health food stores. Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes.  </P> <P> * MILLET: A staple of Asia and Africa, millet is relatively unknown in this  country. It is a delicate grain with a nutty flavor. Available in health food  stores. Cooking time: 30 minutes.  </P> <P> * RICE: We don't often think of rice as a breakfast food, but many other  countries do. The flavor of white rice pales in comparison to unpolished brown  rice, which has a texture that holds up well in hot cereals. Available in  supermarkets and health food stores.  </P> <P> * NUTS, SEEDS AND DRIED FRUITS: Unsalted nuts and seeds add a crunchy texture  to cereals, hot or cold. For more flavor, try toasting nuts in a 200-degree  oven. Walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, cashews, sunflower seeds,  pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, raisins, currants, dried apricots,  dates, apples, unsweetened coconut flakes and figs are all good to add to your  cereal mix. Available at supermarkets and health food stores.  </P> <P> * FRESH FRUIT: Just about any kind of fresh fruit blends well with cereal. Some  of the best are berries, bananas, peaches, apples and pears. Try cooking  cereals with part apple juice or stirring in apple sauce or pureed pears; add  berries just before serving.  </P> <P>  Muesli was the invention of a famous Swiss doctor who successfully treated  children with rickets by feeding them this cold cereal three times a day. It is  traditionally eaten raw after an overnight soak in water or milk. I like the  cereal's texture when mixed with milk right at the breakfast table. This is my  favorite version.  </P> <P> MUESLI  </P> <P> 7 cups old-fashioned or steel-cut rolled oats (not instant)  </P> <P> 1 cup toasted wheat germ  </P> <P> 1 cup toasted wheat bran  </P> <P> 1 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped pitted dates  </P> <P> 1 cup sliced almonds  </P> <P> Combine oats, wheat germ, wheat bran, raisins, dates and almonds in bowl. Mix  well and store in airtight container. Serve with milk. Makes about 12 cups.  </P> <P> Variations: Add fresh fruit just before serving.  </P> <P> Replace milk with yogurt.  </P> <P> Stir in honey just before serving.  </P> <P> In place of almonds, use walnuts, pecans or hazelnuts, or a combination of  these.  </P> <P> Soak cereal in orange or apple juice overnight.  </P> <P>  This isn't really a pudding, but the primary elements of this old-fashioned  dessert make a great hot breakfast cereal with less of the characteristic  richness. If you cook the rice the night before, cool it, cover with a moist  paper towel and refrigerate -- the dish is quick to put together in the  morning.  </P> <P> BROWN RICE "PUDDING"  </P> <P> 1 cup milk  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 4 cups cooked brown basmati rice or regular brown rice  </P> <P> 1/3 cup golden raisins  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest  </P> <P> Combine milk, butter, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar in medium saucepan.  Bring to boil. Add rice and raisins, breaking apart with wooden spoon. Return  to boil. Reduce heat to low. Stir in orange zest. Cover and simmer until most  of liquid is absorbed, about 5 to 7 minutes. Serve immediately. Makes 4 to 6  servings.  </P> <P> HOMEMADE MULTI-GRAIN CEREAL  </P> <P> 2 cups oats  </P> <P> 1/2 cup rye flakes  </P> <P> 1/2 cup barley flakes  </P> <P> 1 cup wheat flakes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup wheat bran  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cornmeal  </P> <P> 1/8 cup flax seeds  </P> <P> Combine oats, rye, barley and wheat flakes, wheat bran, cornmeal and flax seeds  in bowl. Mix well. Cover and store in airtight container. Makes about 4 1/2  cups, about 20 (1/2-cup) servings of cooked.  </P> <P> Note: To cook for 1 serving, use 1 cup water for every 1/4 cup uncooked cereal.  Bring water to boil, add cereal and simmer, partially covered, about 12 to 15  minutes.  </P> <P> Variations: Cook cereal in mixture of half water, half apple juice.  </P> <P> Stir 3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce or 1/2 banana, mashed, into each  portion of cooked cereal.  </P> <P> Stir 1 teaspoon each of maple syrup and butter into each cooked portion.  </P> <P>  Homemade granola is simple to make and costs about one-third the price of  store-bought. Vary the mix by changing the grains, using more or fewer nuts,  trying different dried fruits and increasing or decreasing the honey. This  recipe makes a fairly flaky granola; if you prefer a chunkier granola, increase  the quantity of oil.  </P> <P> HOMEMADE GRANOLA  </P> <P> 1 cup wheat flakes  </P> <P> 1 cup triticale flakes  </P> <P> 2 cups rolled oats  </P> <P> 1/2 cup wheat germ  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sunflower seeds  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sesame seeds  </P> <P> 1 cup cashews, coarsely chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1/2 cup safflower oil  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons water, about  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped  </P> <P> Combine wheat and triticale flakes, oats, wheat germ, sunflower seeds, sesame  seeds, cashews and coconut flakes in large bowl. Drizzle honey and water over  cereal, then toss until grains are evenly coated. Add more water if grains  aren't sticking together.  </P> <P> Spread in even layer on baking sheet or in roasting pan. Bake at 275 degrees  about 50 minutes or until golden brown, stirring every 15 minutes. Remove from  oven and stir in apricots. (Granola will be sticky, but will harden as it  cools.) Cool completely. Store in airtight container. Makes about 8 cups.  </P></p>

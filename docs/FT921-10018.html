			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Osaka derivatives blamed for Tokyo market slump / Review of the Japanese equity scene After starting the year on a bearish note, the Tokyo stock market has managed to brush off some of its pessimism with a little help from the authorities. Efforts by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the ministry of finance to reassure investors that they were concerned about the current slump have soothed their worries that the Nikkei average could plunge below 20,000. Fears mounted last month, when Japanese equities failed to react either to the Bank of Japan's cut in the discount rate in late December, or to higher bond prices and booming overseas markets. In January, the Nikkei average fell to 20,858.30, within a hair's breadth of 20,221.86 plumbed in October 1990, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Average daily volume fell to a 10-year low of 217.4m shares. Announcements by the LDP, of measures to revitalise the stock market, such as companies raising dividends and the reduction of securities trading taxes, propped up the market. 'These statements have underpinned the market,' says Mr Jason James, equity strategist at James Capel. This week's move by the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) to make futures and options trading more transparent also had a favourable effect on sentiment. The OSE will now disclose trading of futures and options by brokers and trading hours have been shortened. Option contracts, currently exercised once a week, will move to once a month with the June contract. Derivatives trading in Osaka had been blamed for recent volatility in the cash market. The bulk of Japan's stock futures trading is executed in Osaka, although the index is based on Tokyo cash prices. The surge in activity of the Osaka-based Nikkei 225 options and the plunge in cash trading activity in Tokyo created tension between the two exchanges. Last year, turnover in futures trading rose 35 per cent to Y536,729.9bn (Dollars 4,293.8bn), while activity on the cash market fell 39 per cent to a nine-year low of Y107,108bn. Trading in Nikkei 225 futures accounted for 56.2 per cent of the revenue earned by the OSE, while the TSE saw a heavy fall in its revenue. Price fluctuation in the futures markets is reflected in the cash market through arbitrage, as traders seek to make a profit from the price differences between the cash and futures markets. The surge in speculative trading on the futures markets has in turn pushed up arbitrage activity in the underlying shares. The Tokyo Stock Exchange increased margin rates for arbitrage trading three times last year to curb activity. It also wants a reform of futures trading and has recently set up a task force to review trading practices and recommend changes. Osaka has finally moved to reduce speculative activity on its own turf. Mr Nick Schoewe, head of derivatives trading at SBCI Securities, says that it is 'interesting' that derivatives have been made a scapegoat for the poor performance of the cash market. He warns that if the negative attitude towards derivatives continues, the business will be driven to offshore markets where Nikkei 225 futures and options can be traded, such as the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Others agree that while the psychological impact of the OSE's recent move was positive, the most effective way to reduce the influence of futures and options trading on the cash market is for volume in the cash market to rise. Meanwhile, an overhang of shares created by investors waiting to liquidate holdings at higher levels remains a problem. Selling by investment trusts, facing redemptions linked to trust funds set up in the late 1980s, has continued to depress the market. Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and trust fund cancellations by companies, which James Capel estimates at between Y1,000bn and 3,000bn, will be concentrated in the current quarter. Life insurers, traditionally leading buyers, are offering little comfort. 'Pension funds, which are long-term investors, will continue to buy at lower levels around 21,000, but we also want to sell short-term investments at the 24,000 to 25,000 level,' says Mr Kaoru Shimura, general manager at Sumitomo Life's securities investment department. Downward revisions of earnings forecasts ahead of the March book-closing are expected to create turmoil. Several brokerages recently reduced their profit forecasts for electrical companies such as Hitachi and Toshiba, which prompted heavy selling of their shares. Small investors are reluctant to return to the stock market. They were shaken by last year's stock market scandals and current price conditions and meagre dividends offer little return. Mr Shimura at Sumitomo Life expects daily turnover to remain around 300m shares for the first half of this year. This means that share prices will remain vulnerable to volatility in futures and options. However, some argue that current levels make long-term stock investments attractive. Mr Yoshinobu Isokawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities says that with interest rates on the decline, individuals are showing some interest in stocks again. Although they have not yet started to buy, attendance at equity investment seminars at Yamaichi's local branches has started to rise. 'We're telling clients that now is a great chance to buy,' says Mr Isokawa, 'if they give the market two years.'</p>

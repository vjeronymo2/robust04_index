			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen [DRY] held a session this morning under the chairmanship  of Mr. Anis Hasan Yahya, the chairman of the assembly. The  session began with the national anthem and a recitation from the  holy Koran and a minute's pause to mourn the martyrs. At the  beginning of the session, the members of the National Assembly  were sworn in and then the presidium of the assembly was elected  of four members as follows: Sha'fil Umar 'Ali, Ahmad Ubayd Bin  Daghr, 'Abd-al-Qawi Muhammad Rashad, and 'Abd-al-Rahim Asim.  Mr. Anis Hasan Yahya was elected as speaker of the assembly.  The members of the assembly decided to change the name of the  provisional assembly into the National Assembly in order to  facilitate dealings between it and the state institutions. The  National Assembly discussed with vitality the tasks designated  to it. It was decided that the assembly continue its sessions  in order to review the remaining topics of its agenda after the  assembly had decided that it is in a state of permanent session.  The attendances [as heard] greeted the big role played by the  sons of the DRY to repel the Sanaa rulers' forces, which  continued aggression. They praised the role of the Security  Council and the positive role played by the Arab countries to  stop bloodshed.</p>

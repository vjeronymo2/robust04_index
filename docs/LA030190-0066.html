			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: READ LABELS TO KEEP A DIET HEALTHY  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: These days many people are cutting calories, fat, salt and  cholesterol in the hope of maintaining health and diets.  </P> <P> Did you know that butter and margarine both contain the same amount of fat? But  butter is made from animal fat and contains cholesterol, while margarine, which  is made from vegetable fat, doesn't have any cholesterol.  </P> <P> One of the easiest ways to limit intake of fat, salt and cholesterol is to  carefully read all product labels before buying them. Eating fresh fruit and  vegetables is also a great help.  </P> <P> Salt substitutes are wonderful, but if you still crave the real thing, why not  place half substitute and half real salt in the salt shaker. When refilling it,  use less salt each time. Before you know it, you will be using substitute  without any real effort.  </P> <P> By following a few simple steps, nutritional needs will be met without a lot of  hard work.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I buy soda in 2- or 3-liter bottles. After I've finished about  half of the bottle, the remaining soda tastes flat to me. I hated tossing it  away, but wasn't sure what I could do with it.  </P> <P> Finally I came up with a use. I pour this last bit of soda in an ice-cube tray  and freeze it. Then I use the cubes in my soda. It doesn't get diluted as  quickly and I save a few pennies.  </P> <P>  -- DIANE, El Paso, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: For years now I have made applesauce and passed out jars of it to  friends and relatives. I was the hit of the neighborhood and my family.  </P> <P> I have found a way to make it more appealing. When I use red-skinned apples, my  favorites being Cortland or McIntosh, I leave the skins on and cook them and  then press them through a sieve. This gives the applesauce an appealing pink  shade. The applesauce looks pretty in the fancy little jars I put it in.  </P> <P>  -- GRANNY, Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Saturday is usually cookie-baking day at my house. This is a time  when my daughter and I spend time together while having fun baking.  </P> <P> After preparing the dough and cutting the cookies out, we like to sprinkle on  some colored sparkles or sugar crystals. This usually made a mess, so to make  it easier I placed the cookie cutter around the cut-out cookies and then  sprinkled on the decorations. This corralled the sprinkles and kept them from  scattering all over the counter top.  </P> <P> It made decorating and clean-up a snap.  </P> <P>  -- KELLY G., Houston  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Instead of using adhesive-backed plastic shelf liner for lining  kitchen shelves and cabinets (which never stays down and costs an arm and a  leg), I buy prepasted, vinyl-coated bolts of wallpaper.  </P> <P> It's easy to work with and you can always find an inexpensive roll for less  than $5. I've even bought them for as low as $1 on clearance. You get a lot  more square footage per roll and the wallpaper doesn't turn up at the edges.  You also have a greater variety of patterns from which to chose.  </P> <P>  -- MARCELA, Torrance  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My family loves mashed potatoes, so it seems I make gravy for  practically every meal. Gravy that is made from turkey or chicken doesn't have  an appealing color, so I add about a tablespoon of low-salt soy sauce to give a  richer color. We also get an added zing to the flavor.  </P> <P>  -- KATHY, Cibolo, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: A while back you described a unique way to use a paint can to  make a device to start the charcoal for a barbecue grill. I clipped the article  with intentions of saving it but do not remember where I put it. I would like  to try it because we use so much charcoal starter fluid.  </P> <P>  -- SUSAN, Houston  </P> <P> DEAR SUSAN: With the summer months fast approaching, I know you and many others  will benefit from this hint.  </P> <P> You will need a 1-gallon paint can with a wire handle. Wash and dry the can.  Next, take the triangular end of a can opener and make about a dozen triangular  openings around the outside bottom of the paint can. Then cut off the bottom  with a manual can opener, making both ends open. You have now made the perfect  accessory to help minimize the use of charcoal lighter when starting the  barbecue fire.  </P> <P> Place the can in the bottom of the barbecue pit and ball up about six  half-sheets of newspaper and put them at the bottom of the can. Fill the rest  of the can with charcoal. Using the holes in the bottom of the can, ignite the  newspaper in several places. Because everything is contained in the can, there  will be very little flame, just smoldering paper that will light the coals.  This will take less time because of the chimney effect of the can.  </P> <P> When the coals are good and hot, lift the can out of the grill by the wire  handle. (Be sure to protect your hand and arms with a fireproof barbecue mitt  and exercise caution when removing the hot can.) The can will cool quickly once  removed from the grill and can be used over and over again.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I save empty cereal boxes and other food or household-item  containers, such as cracker boxes and cans. I clean them and use them for  playing "grocery" in my classes (I am an elementary-school speech therapist). I  also cut out box fronts and make puzzles of them. My students love them, my  trash pile is greatly reduced and it is much less expensive than store-bought  food toys and puzzles (also more familiar).  </P> <P> I even plan to do this when I have children of my own.  </P> <P>  -- ROBIN, Wolfforth, Tex.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD  </P> <P> I agree wholeheartedly with The Times position on gun control (editorial,  "Outrage in Stockton," Jan. 19). It's time that Congress got the drop on the  NRA and voted to ban the kinds of assault weapons used in the Stockton and  McDonald's massacres.  </P> <P> Congress also ought to win one for former Reagan press secretary Jim Brady by  enacting a minimum national waiting period for handgun purchases.  </P> <P> HAROLD N.

Katyal] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 15--Just when there was hope of a  positive turn to Indo-U.S. relations--as a result of the  visiting Senator, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's talks here--the  American President, Mr. Bill Clinton's reference to human rights  violations in Jammu and Kashmir meant a fresh setback.    Mr. Clinton's remark that the United States shared  Pakistan's  concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir, caused, as was  natural, shock and dismay. Its adverse effect was not mitigated  even by his subsequent observations--that the United States was  opposed to infringements of individual human rights as a result  of extremism and fanaticism, that is, of the victims of  terrorist violence. It showed, according to an official, that  the U.S. policy was either not balanced or not well-informed. It  was considered odd that Mr. Clinton should have been taken in by  Pakistani propaganda--ignoring altogether the steps taken by the  Indian Government to check excesses, including the establishment  of the Human Rights Commission, as also the discussion to allow  the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty  International to visit Jammu and Kashmir. That such statements  would give a fillip to terrorist activities was additionally  disturbing from the Indian standpoint.    Even before Mr. Clinton's latest statement there was a  perception here that the U.S. Administration's India policy was  not anchored in an objective analysis of the situation in the  sub-continent. Mr. J.N. Dixit, who just retired as Foreign  Secretary, was asked in an interview by "Eyewitness," about the  reasons for the statements emanating from Washington on Kashmir  and Punjab. He replied: "There can be only two interpretations.  Either they are simplistic and you can say it is tactless or  there is a deliberate motivation and they may be saying this  deliberately to set the context for interference."    This, in his opinion, was the most difficult period in  Indo-U.S. relations since 1971 and it could last up to two  years, because of fundamental differences on issues such as  nuclear non-proliferation and transfer of dual-use technology.    Until the report of Mr. Clinton's statement reached here,  the  mood of those working for improved Indo-U.S. relations was  clearly upbeat. The talks of Mr. Moynihan, Chairman of the U.S.  Senate panel on South Asia and a former U.S. ambassador here,  with the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, yesterday and  with the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, today had  led to optimism about a better understanding of India's case on  Human Rights and related matters.    Mr. Moynihan who, at a recent Senate panel hearing, had  strongly defended India on this issue heard a detailed account  from the Prime Minister of the latest developments--especially  in the context of Pakistan's plans for an anti-India resolution  at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights at Geneva. He told both  the Prime Minister and Mr. Dinesh Singh that he would convey  India's views to Mr. Clinton. He even suggested a meeting  between Mr. Dinesh Singh and the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr.  Warren Christopher, obviously in the belief that exchange of  views at the personal level could help reduce misunderstandings.    Hopes recede: In view of Mr. Clinton's latest  statement, the chances of India securing U.S. support against  Pakistan's move have receded, though Mr. Moynihan's talks here  had raised hopes to the contrary. It is, however, to be seen how  the United States reconciles the two conflicting  concepts--support to Pakistan's view of human rights "abuses" in  Jammu and Kashmir, on the one hand, and faith in the  continuation of the Foreign Secretary-level talks between India  and Pakistan, on the other. The consequences of the first run  against the spirit of the second.    According to Mr. Clinton, "these talks and other forms of  dialogue between Pakistan and India should be nurtured and  protected from swings in public opinion so that they become a  positive feature in Indo- Pakistan relations." Will the United  States discourage Islamabad from going ahead with its move  because its consequences may not square up with his sentiment  about the Foreign Secretary-level talks being a forum for  defusing tensions between India and Pakistan?</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Backing for lower age of consent The prospect that the House of Commons may lower the age of consent for homosexuals has increased significantly after a decision by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to back calls for it to be reduced from 21 to 18. Mr Howard's decision to join a majority of the cabinet in supporting any amendment proposing 18 may swing a number of rightwing Tory MPs in favour of the change in next month's free Commons vote on the issue. But the home secretary has told colleagues that he will strongly oppose a reduction to 16 to align it with that for heterosexual sex. If no amendment is tabled in favour of 18 Mr Howard will back maintenance of the present age limit. Mrs Edwina Currie, the backbench Tory MP, has tabled an amendment lowering the age to 16, which has won the support of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / TV food ad rules tightened Television advertisements will be banned from showing excessive consumption of any food under rules being drawn up by the Independent Television Commission, the TV watchdog. The ITC said yesterday, however, that it had rejected calls from dentists and food campaigners to ban fatty and sugary food advertisements from all children's television. The ITC said it would review its policy after further research. The new rules on excessive consumption, designed to reinforce government advice on healthy eating, would not stop an advertisement showing someone enjoying a chocolate bar, said the ITC. The rules would, however, 'preclude someone going on to open a second or a third, or pigging a whole box of chocolates at one sitting', it said. References to supermarket multipacks would be permitted but, the ITC said, 'filling a supermarket trolley with very large quantities of confectionery would not'. It is likely that an advertisement for Dime chocolate, which featured comedian Harry Enfield loading his trolley with the bars, would fall foul of the new rules if it were shown in future. The ITC's proposals to revise its advertising code, which are subject to consultation over the coming month, also outlaw 'the disparagement of good nutritional practice'. Advertisers would be able to claim that a sweetened fruit juice tasted delicious but not to say it was preferable to fresh fruit or unsweetened fruit juice. It is also likely that, under the new code, advertising slimming products to children and adolescents will be banned. The National Food Alliance, an umbrella group of more than 50 organisations, said it was pleased the ITC had decided to address the issue of food advertising but disappointed that the proposals did not go far enough. The group said research showed children were not getting a balanced message about nutrition from advertisements.</p>

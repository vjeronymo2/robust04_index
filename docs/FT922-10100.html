			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: The barren stamp of Nazi approval THE ARTS OF THE THIRD REICH by Peter Adam Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 24.95, 322 pages 'YOU artists live in great and happy times. The Fuhrer loves artists, because he is himself one] Oh century of artists] What a joy to be part of it,' raved Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's Propaganda Minister, when the Nazis came to power in 1933. But the truth was that German culture was never so barren as during the Third Reich. Not one significant artist or writer lent continuous support to the regime, and almost every major intellectual or cultural figure, from Brecht and Beckmann to Freud and Mann, fled the Reich by 1939. This book tells the story of the art that remained. In the visual arts, the battle lines were boldly drawn in 1937 with the two Munich exhibitions, degenerate art and the great German art exhibition. The first aimed to set the German public against 'Bolshevik-Jewish' modernists like Chagall, Grosz, Kokoschka and Klee, by cramming their work together on walls daubed with graffiti slogans such as 'Insults to German Womanhood' and 'The Niggerising of the Visual Arts'. It was a sensational hit, attracting far bigger crowds than its companion exhibition, a showcase of Nazi-approved paintings of Aryan nudes, brawny peasants and Bavarian mountains. It is these latter pictures, unknown today, that are reproduced here. Adam discovered them hidden in vaults and archives, and his catalogue forms a devastating record of narrow and reactionary themes and flat, wooden execution: youths bringing in the harvest; soldiers waving farewell to their Alpine homes; chillingly perfect gods and goddesses. The iconography is rooted in Nazi ideals: from Adolf Ziegler's blond maidens in 'The Four Elements', which hung in Hitler's drawing-room (the French ambassador rechristened it 'The Four Senses - Taste is Missing') to the giant neo-classical 'Seven Deadly Sins' starring Chamberlain and Churchill as gluttony. Nationalism, nostalgia, a return to rural values, Hellenism, romanticism: the intellectual backcloth to these paintings reflects cultural ideas widespread across late 19th and 20th century Europe. But Hitler played on specifically German strands - the volk heritage, revivals like the Nibelungen myth, the racist current in Wagner, Nietszche and the German super-soul. Anti-international feeling after the First World War was crucial to Hitler's appeal and he manipulated it in his cultural policy: in a time of social despair he united the big city, with Jewish commerce and international art as the common enemy. So out went Velasquez with 'The bastard types Spain is so full of' and Gauguin's 'black girlfriends', along with modernism, cubism, Dadaism. Adam's roll call of who was in and out of favour is illuminating, but his woeful text, repetitive, banal and incoherently argued, misses the crucial implications of his research. How, he asks every few pages, could the artists have collaborated? But the point was that they did not: all artists of stature fled. Only a few older painters of rural scenes, which Hitler perverted for his own means, and hack painters of propaganda pictures, remained. The exceptions were the architects. Some of Albert Speer's models, and Sagebiel's design for Tempelhof airport, are innovative and original. Hitler lost his artists because he tried to turn them into reactionary mouthpieces, but kept his architects because his mammoth ambitions for German cities and his bottomless coffers gave them unlimited scope which, as Speer said later, led them to turn a blind eye to the atrocities making this possible. Adam acknowledges no difference between either the quality of the work or the motivation here. But even Goebbels and Goering lamented the feebleness of Nazi painters - Goering collected forbidden Gauguins and had portraits of his children painted by Otto Dix, who was condemned in the degenerate art show. Speer was by contrast honoured as one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. Finally, although Adam does not touch on the theme, his book is about the importance of art. The Nazis banned Expressionist paintings because the despair and violence and anguish they represented told disturbing truths; yet Hitler knew the power of culture and was concerned that his hoped-for renaissance of German art was not forthcoming. This is a book to buy for the illustrations, which catalogue the aesthetic results of a murderous regime, and to take along as a companion to the reconstruction of the 1937 degenerate art exhibition, now in Berlin. The juxtaposition demonstrates one of the most positive aspects of political-art history: but with a few exceptions, great art has always stood out against terror and on the side of humanity.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better to look at detailed evidence on Citizen's Charter progress Sir, I was surprised to see the letter from Elizabeth Symons (March 21) about the government's public sector reform policy. She seems to forget that the whole Competing for Quality programme, of which contracting out and market testing are elements, is about three clear aims: getting government to concentrate on the essentials; introducing more competition and choice into the provision of services; and raising standards and cutting costs. The Citizen's Charter second report published last week shows that we have scored important gains in all of these areas. The report shows we have made savings through market testing and contracting out of Pounds 135m, and there is a mass of information to show how individual departments contributed to this total. If Ms Symons is puzzled by what we mean by savings, it is really quite simple: it is the difference between what we were paying for a whole range of government activity before market testing and contracting out, and what we are paying now. If Ms Symons can think of a better way to do the arithmetic, I should love to know. There is a suggestion that we do not know the costs of the policy. One look at the charter second report will show that we have set out the costs, again in detail, breaking them down by department and also by consultancy and set-up costs and by central market testing support costs. This clearly shows an overall annual cost of Pounds 20m. Indeed, on the wider issue of consultancy work in government, we had already decided to conduct our own review long before Ms Symons made this an issue, and Sir Peter Levene is running a multi-departmental efficiency scrutiny of this whole topic. This is hardly the approach of a government trying to conceal the information. I acknowledged that the glass is filling but is not topped up yet. Even now, however, the savings we have made have repaid the cost of running the programme more than five-fold, and we will make these savings now every year, while the start-up costs of the policy are mostly behind us. This looks like a convincing balance sheet to me, and certainly represents value for money. If Ms Symons doesn't want to take my word for it, I suggest that she asks departments whether they think the policy is giving them benefits. Rather than trying to score points from answers given by departments before the charter report published the information, it would be better to look at the detailed evidence that we have now released, which shows that the policy is well on course.

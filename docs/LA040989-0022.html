			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR PROPERTY TAX BASE  </P> <P> "The family home sits on an unfair tax base" with widely varying assessments up  and down the block, the result of a taxpayer revolt against being taxed on  paper profits by tax-omnivorous public agencies.  </P> <P> The proposed solution?  </P> <P> Since the stay-putters (Stall's term) aren't willing to give up the benefits of  Proposition 13, knowing that to do so would move much of the middle-class  slowly but surely into the "homeless" category, why not sneak up on them by  letting "stay-putters' homes to grow at a slightly faster rate than the present  maximum 2%, but keep them capped at a reasonable rate. . . . The equity gap  would be closed over the years."  </P> <P> Sounds like a progressive repeal of Proposition 13.  </P> <P> JOHN CARL BROGDON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

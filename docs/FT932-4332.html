			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: US-style home shopping for Europe ROUND-the-clock TV shopping will be imported to Europe next October, according to an agreement reached yesterday between QVC, the US 'home shopping' specialist, and BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting company, which is 50 per cent owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, also has a significant stake. The two companies announced that they had agreed to form a 50:50 joint venture company to create an 'electronic retailing' programme service in London. The programmes will be produced live, and are due to be broadcast from October 1. The plan provides for the TV shopping service to be available 24 hours a day, and the service will be dis-tributed through the same satellite and cable systems as BSkyB. Neither QVC nor BSkyB would comment on the costs of setting up the venture, nor on the type of merchandise which is likely to be displayed. However, QVC said it would be broadly similar to its existing US service. Of the two biggest home shopping networks in the US, QVC - which reaches 47m homes via cable and satellite - is the more upmarket. It recently struck a deal with Saks Fifth Avenue, for example, under which the New York-based retailer agreed to sell merchandise through the QVC network. The deal also reunites Mr Barry Diller, former head of Fox Inc, with Mr Murdoch's media network. Mr Diller, who resigned as chairman of the Fox film and television studio in February 1992, became chairman of QVC in January this year, having acquired a tranche of the home shopping network's equity. Home shopping has had a mixed history in the US, and is still dogged by a downmarket image. A number of big retailers, such as J. C. Penney and Dayton Hudson, toyed with the concept, but eventually decided against it. However, partly due to Mr Diller's programming skills and partly due to technical advances, there have been suggestions that home shopping may be gaining more respectability. A number of department store chains have expressed renewed interest in TV shopping, and R. H. Macy has revealed plans to launch 'TV Macy's', a home shopping service, on Cablevision systems.</p>

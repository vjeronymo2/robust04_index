			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER MEGA-SPILL BUT STILL NO ACTION;  </P> <P> LAST WEEK'S NORWEGIAN TANKER ACCIDENT RAISES FEARS OF WHAT'LL HAPPEN NEXT TIME  </P> <P> There are no easy or cheap solutions to the frightening problem of tanker  spills, only complex and relatively expensive ones.  </P> <P> But almost all the complex and expensive ones are considerably better than the  hasty solutions that will inevitably be proposed if the public becomes even  more frightened about the specter of a supertanker spill spoiling an entire  coastline or befouling a whole bay. Irresponsible scaremongering? Consider the  mess, political as well as ecological, in Alaska.  </P> <P> It's time for serious anti-spill action. Last week more than 4 million gallons  of oil gushed out of the stricken tanker Mega Borg and invaded the waters of  the Gulf of Mexico. The accident revived memo- ries of the American Trader  spill off Huntington Beach in February, not to mention the Exxon Valdez  disaster.  </P> <P> Exxon is out of pocket about $2 billion (and counting) for that one. How much  better it would have been for that company and the industry as a whole -- not  to mention the Alaskan environment -- if new regulations and procedures had  been in place to minimize spill damage and to maximize the effectiveness of  cleanups.  </P> <P> Many experts agree that all new tankers should be fitted with crack-resistant  double hulls. It's still not required. Strong state and federal legislation to  guarantee adequate accident-contingency plans and appropriate mop-up technology  still has not been passed.  </P> <P> In California, calls to the state Legislature for a new state oil-spill office  and a special fund for spill-disaster operations have not been acted upon; the  job is still consigned to an interagency committee that's in over its head.  </P> <P> Oil is an important energy material, and the oil industry has every right to  want to be able to conduct its business operations profitably and without undue  burden. But every business operates within imposed restrictions, regulates  itself to some extent and does business within the wider framework of the  overall public interest. Another Exxon Valdez would almost certainly lead to  panicky remedial legislation that the industry might find far more odious than  anything currently being proposed.  </P> <P> TROUBLED WATERS  </P> <P> Recent major tanker incidents (estimates of oil spills in gallons)  </P> <P> Mega Borg: 4 million  </P> <P> American Trader: 394,000  </P> <P> Exxon Valdez: 11 million  </P></p>

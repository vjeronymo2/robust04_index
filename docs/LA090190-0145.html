			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT TERMINAL PASSES FINAL TESTS;  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION: COUNTY TAKES POSSESSION AFTER CONTRACTOR GETS SYSTEM OF FIRE  CONTROL TO WORK.  </P> <P> More than five months late and millions of dollars over budget, the new  $62-million Thomas F. Riley Terminal at John Wayne Airport finally passed a  series of fire control tests Friday, allowing an embattled airport contractor  to turn the cavernous structure over to the county.  </P> <P> As more than two years of problem-plagued construction ended Friday, airport  officials jubilantly prepared for next week's series of celebratory galas,  including an open house on Sept. 8 and first use by the airlines on Sept. 16.  </P> <P> "We're worn out but yes, we're very happy," said Assistant Airport Manager Jan  Mittermeier.  </P> <P> Added Airport Manager George Rebella: "We are extremely pleased. . . ."  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, for whom the terminal is named, had predicted early  Friday the building would pass muster by the end of the day, after weeks of  agonizing glitches in the building's computer-controlled fire suppression  system.  </P> <P> "I'm very excited," Riley said. "Everywhere I go, other people tell me they  think it's wonderful."  </P> <P> Mittermeier said Friday's test results mean that airport contractor Taylor  Woodrow California Construction Ltd. has met its contract requirements for  "substantial completion," even though minor cleanup work remains. She said the  county's Environmental Management Agency won't issue a much-needed certificate  of occupancy for a few days.  </P> <P> "We have been testing the complex life safety and operational systems for the  past few weeks in the terminal," said William Ostfeld, Taylor Woodrow's senior  vice president. "We've had to make some modifications and will continue to work  with the county on all final issues. But we are very proud of the work that we  have accomplished."  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors awarded the terminal contract to Taylor Woodrow in  July, 1988. The firm's low bid came in more than $17 million over the $42.5  million originally budgeted by the county. A cost-cutting frenzy ensued,  reducing steel tonnage, marble, skylights and landscaping.  </P> <P> Relations between the county and Taylor Woodrow were tense at best. Forced to  postpone the original April 1 opening day and citing missed construction  milestones, the Board of Supervisors fired Taylor Woodrow from a $25-million  contract to build a garage and elevated roadway.  </P></p>

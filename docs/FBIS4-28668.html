			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Recent economic indicators  have presented "signs for the economy to recover," Vice Finance  Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [13 June].    "Our assessment is not much different from the Bank of  Japan," Saito told reporters, agreeing to earlier comments by  central bank governor Yasushi Mieno that the economy is poised  to take the recovery path.    However, Saito, like Mieno, remained cautious, saying, "We  still can't declare with confidence that the economy will head  toward a recovery."    Mieno told the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors,  "assessing the recent economic indicators, there seems to be a  high possibility that the economy has moved one step toward a  recovery."    His comments were a step forward from his latest assessment  that the economy is "showing signs of bottoming out," after the  central bank released its quarterly "Tankan" business sentiment  survey for may on Friday showing broad-based improvement for the  month for the first time in five years.    Asked about the effects from continuing 5.5 trillion yen  worth of income tax cuts, Mieno said he expects to "support the  economy that is showing brightness."    But Mieno said he does not know if the economy has moved  "two  or three steps" forward, noting such prevailing concerns as the  yen's rise, corporate capital investment and competition with  other Asian nations.</p>

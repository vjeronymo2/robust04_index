			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Party upbeat on prospects for Euro-seats CHANGES TO the constit-uency boundaries for next June's European elections have increased the Liberal Democrats' chances of capitalising on their successes in south-west England, party strategists said yesterday. But the party appears divided about what approach to adopt in the campaign. In spite of the insistence this week that the Liberal Democrats' task is to turn the protest vote it attracts into positive support, campaign planners said the party would be inviting voters to deliver a verdict on the government's performance since the general election. The Conservatives fear the Liberal Democrats could seize a quarter of the 32 Euro-constituencies the Tories won in 1989, if the most recent local election results are replicated next summer. Seeking to temper over-optimism about their prospects, however, the Liberal Democrats point out that they have tended to do worse in Euro-elections than in local elections. In 1989, they were still reeling after the collapse of the Alliance and won only 6.5 per cent of the vote, while the Greens won 15 per cent. In an effort to maximise support and limit the damage caused to its chances by its pro-European stance, the party's manifesto will not deal exclusively with European policy but seek to show how the UK taking a lead in Europe would help on issues such as jobs and law and order. It would also stress environmental policies. As the government this morning published details of the plans for allocating the five extra European Parliament seats in England, Mr Chris Rennard, the Liberal Democrats' campaigns director, said that the new boundaries improved his party's prospects in Cornwall, West Plymouth and Somerset. On the basis of the party's share of the vote in last year's general election, it could take both Euro-constituencies with swings of less than 3.5 per cent - far below the spectacular increases in support it has achieved in recent parliamentary by-elections. Mr Tim Clement-Jones, the director of the European election campaign, said that the party would not be able to avoid using the word 'federalism', though the image of a Brussels superstate many people associated with it was not Liberal Democrat policy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Dag Norum,  international secretary of the Norwegian Communist Party, was  interviewed by KCNA in Pyongyang on March 30.    He said that to remove the danger of a nuclear war and ease  the tensions on the Korean peninsula where an acute military  confrontation continues is an important question directly linked  to peace and security of the world at present.    Charging that the United States is committing insincere act,  deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea by reversing the  agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York,  he said: "The Norwegian Communist Party strongly opposes the  shipment of new mass destruction weapons to South Korea."    He held that the United States must not resort to  "sanctions", but work for a peaceful solution of the Korean  question through dialogue and negotiation.    "If the United States think it will be able to bring the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea to its knees by strength,  it is a big mistake," he said, and added: "The United States  must abandon its anachronistic dream."</p>

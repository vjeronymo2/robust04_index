			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS OPPOSE NEW DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> More than 100 opponents of a proposed theater development overflowed City  Council chambers Monday, urging the council to overrule its Planning Commission  and amend the proposed development.  </P> <P> "The basic problem we have is that this is going to create a lot more vehicle  traffic and a lot of foot traffic as well," said David Hunt, a 10-year resident  of Mission Viejo and one of those who spoke against the proposal.  </P> <P> The project, designed and proposed by the Mission Viejo Co., would create more  than 158,000 square feet of offices, retail stores and restaurants, as well as  a service station and a six-screen movie theater. It was approved by the  Planning Commission earlier this month, but the commission attached 75  conditions.  </P> <P> Wayne Peterson, director of Environmental Planning for the Mission Viejo Co.,  said Monday that the company accepts the conditions and is prepared to go ahead  with the project. "The Mission Viejo Co. is very proud of this project,"  Peterson said. "It will be a good neighbor."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, residents remained concerned about several aspects of the  project, particularly the movie theater. Several residents complained that it  would increase traffic and place additional burdens on law enforcement.  </P></p>

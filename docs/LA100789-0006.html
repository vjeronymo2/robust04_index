			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA GABOR FOUND GUILTY  </P> <P> The many judgments of Gabor seem to be made on her fame and wealth, and not on  the evidence that she was beat and bruised by a so-called officer of the law.  Witnesses corroborated her story and other citizens testified to similar  experiences.  </P> <P> Consequently, I think a critical issue was overlooked: that police abuse is a  common occurrence and is conveniently passed off under the guise of the law.  </P> <P> The message has been made clear that most people disapprove of Gabor for many  reasons. When will the message be made clear that police abuse of generally  law-abiding citizens is intolerable? In spite of her high profile, Zsa Zsa, I  fear, is only the tip of the iceberg.  </P> <P> WOODY McBREAIRTY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

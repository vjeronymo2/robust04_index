			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Admission adds to SFO injury The admission that a substantial bureaucratic blunder was made in the handling of documents relating to the prosecution of Mr Asil Nadir could not have come at a worse time for the Serious Fraud Office. In a Commons written answer Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, admitted that the SFO had twice circulated copies of documents it was not entitled either to see or to distribute to others. The details are embarrassing to Sir Nicholas, who admitted his previous statement to the Commons in June that the documents were not circulated was 'incomplete' and 'misleading'. But the details are even more damaging to the SFO. They come just days after criticism of its legal judgment following the outcome of its prosecution of Mr Roger Levitt, the disgraced financial salesman, who was sentenced to just 180 hours of community service after a plea bargain. The latest revelations connected to Mr Nadir cast doubt over the SFO's managerial and administrative competence, and are highlighted in the exchange of correspondence between Mr George Staple, head of the SFO, and Mr Peter Knight, a partner with Vizards, the law firm which acted for Mr Nadir until his bankruptcy. In his letter to Mr Staple in July Mr Knight suggested that 'no workable system existed' in the SFO for handling privileged documents. The allegation was strongly rejected by Mr Staple in his response in a letter written on Thursday. The letters focus on at least five bags of correspondence seized in two police raids - one in October 1990 on the offices of Polly Peck International, the company controlled by Mr Nadir, and the other on Mr Nadir's Mayfair home at the time of his arrest in December that year. The exact content of the letters is unclear, but Mr Nadir's lawyers at that time claimed that they contained correspondence between him and them which was covered by privilege. The SFO initially contested the status of these documents but an independent barrister gave an opinion largely supporting Vizards' case. Yesterday's further admission was prompted by a letter in July from Mr Knight to Mr Staple that the previous statement did not fully explain the position. It says that some of these documents were passed on both to the SFO's lawyers prosecuting Mr Nadir, and to the Polly Peck administrators. It was on this point that Sir Nicholas had to admit that he had misled the Commons in his earlier statement. In June Sir Nicholas had told the Commons that the bags of correspondence had been opened but that nothing more had been done with the documents. Mr Knight protested to the SFO over the circulation of these documents. The failure of the SFO to react properly to his protests forced both the attorney general and Mr Staple to apologise yesterday. Sir Nicholas said: 'I regret that the fact that copies of privileged documents had been circulated was not acknowledged by the then case controller to Mr Nadir's solicitor, and that no attempt was made to retrieve them until December 1991, despite Vizards' frequently expressed concern about the matter and the fact that the then case controller appears to have recognised at least by January 1991 that copies of potentially privileged documents had been circulated.' The case controller in charge of the Nadir case, Ms Lorna Harris, was the only SFO officer mentioned specifically in the statements made by Mr Staple and Sir Nicholas. However, an SFO spokes-man insisted nobody was being singled out for the errors. Ms Harris, who has since left the SFO but remains a civil servant, yesterday refused to comment. Her solicitor, Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley, issued a statement saying: 'She has taken legal advice because she is very unhappy about what has been said about her by the attorney general. She is considering her position.'</p>

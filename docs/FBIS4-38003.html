			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th by Umberto De Giovannangeli; </F> place and date not given: "The PLO Can Govern, We Are No longer  Stone Throwers" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] "Now we must demonstrate that we are not just  stonethrowers." This is how our interview with Nabil Sha'th  began. He is the man who eased relations with Israel, the  untiring negotiator of the Gaza and Jericho autonomy, and now  the first PLO minister to install himself in the Gaza Strip,  with a task about which he himself has strong reservations:  laying the foundations upon which to construct "our path toward  liberty."    [De Giovannangeli] From Cairo to Gaza: What balance can be  drawn, on a human and political level, of this "return home?"    [Sha'th] I could begin by listing the thousands of problems  I  must deal with each day, the most varied requests I must deal  with. But this statement, however true it may be, does not take  account of the heart, of the most intimate of sentiments. In  fact, no difficulty may overshadow the happiness felt in  returning as a free man to Palestine, the land of my ancestors:  No exile, even the most "gilded" one, can be worth the land one  has always dreamt of living in, the land one has always fought  for. Today Gaza is beginning to breathe in an air of liberty,  and this is the starting point upon which to reconstruct.    [De Giovannangeli] Is the air of liberty that you refer to  also being "breathed" in Jericho?    [Sha'th] The issue is much more complex for the West Bank,  and in many ways worrying. We run the risk of living in  "provisional liberty" subjected to intolerable controls and  restrictions. Jericho cannot become a ghetto, surrounded by the  Israeli Army, and isolated from the rest of the West Bank. We  will discuss this situation over the coming days with the  Israeli negotiators. We must immediately face the 26 issues  that have remained unresolved: from delimiting the autonomous  region of Jericho to completing the liberation of the  Palestinian prisoners, and extending the autonomy to the rest of  the occupied territories. Not taking sides could seriously  damage the peace process. Due to the Israeli attitude, we are  two months behind on the second phase of the negotiations. On  the other hand, the date of the Israeli withdrawal from all the  Palestinian territories has nothing to do with the successful  implementation of the accord on autonomy, but forms an integral  part of the accord itself, nine months after the signing. Of  course, we cannot wait five years to see if the accord works.    [De Giovannangeli] You refer to "provisional liberty": Is  this a critical observation made only with regard to Israel?    [Sha'th] No, unfortunately it is a more general statement  that also has to do with the responsibility of the international  community. What we have been asking for, especially to the  West, ever since the day after the signing of the Washington  accords, has been real solidarity. That is, an opportunity to  be able to demonstrate to the two million Palestinians living in  the territories that peace is not just a signature but a  substantial improvement in material living conditions, new  employment opportunities, health care, education.    [De Giovannangeli] And instead?    [Sha'th] Instead we found ourselves in front of an amazing  series of conditions placed by the West and by international  organizations. Not only is the aid that was foreseen taking a  long time to materialize, but it is also tied down to requests  for guarantees that are unyielding to the point that they  disguise a mistrust in our capability and willingness to use  this aid for public needs. We are ready for any checks, but we  must first be placed in a condition to work.    [De Giovannangeli] What aid are the territories currently  most in need of?    [Sha'th] I would definitely say financial aid to make the  Palestinian police work at full capacity and to start with the  construction of basic infrastructures -- roads, the sewage  network, health centers -- in Gaza and primarily in the refugee  camps in the Gaza Strip. It may seem "unpoetical," but at this  moment peace for the Palestinians "means" livable homes, street  lights, hospitals with equipment, and factories. To put it in  one word, a "respectable" life. Because oppression does not  just mean an Israeli soldier.    [De Giovannangeli] What is the most demanding challenge  facing the Palestinian leadership today?    [Sha'th] Working in a kind of "cultural revolution"  mentality. We must transform the PLO from a liberation movement  to the embryo of a new class of leaders that are capable of  building an independent and really autonomous state and not only  of opposing military occupation. This gamble invests each one  of us.    [De Giovannangeli] In your opinion how should the  fundamental  character of the future Palestinian state be?    [Sha'th] It must be a democratic and pluralist state on a  political and economic level as well as on a cultural and  religious one. In this regard, however, we are not starting  from scratch: The history of the Palestinian people, of the PLO  itself, has been a history of cohabitation between Muslims and  Christians, Marxists and Liberals. We must view the diversities  existing within us as a precious common wealth, to be exploited  to the utmost, starting with the institutions. I know well that  this model of a state is an anomaly in the panorama of the Arab  world, and the hostility with which certain regimes have looked  at the accords with Israel also arises from an awareness that  the Palestinian experience may become an "embarrassing" example  for everyone. But this does not worry us, instead it fills us  with pride.    [De Giovannangeli] How do you judge the willingness  demonstrated by Rabin in welcoming the "pilgrim" 'Arafat in  Jerusalem?    [Sha'th] It is undoubtedly a step forward if compared to the  absurd events of former weeks. One thing is certain: 'Arafat  will go to pray in the al-Aqsa mosque, and this day is near.  Let me add that both Rabin and Peres know very well that  discussions on the final status of Jerusalem have simply been  postponed and that our objective remains that of making the  "Holy City" the capital of the two states.</p>

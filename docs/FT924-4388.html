			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Siberia's forgotten copper mine  -The battle to develop the giant Udokan deposit TUCKED AWAY in a remote Siberian mountain chain, at the end of rugged snow-covered track, is one of the world's biggest and until now most neglected, copper mines. Almost half a century since it was discovered, the Udokan deposit in Russia's eastern Chita region has become the subject of a fierce battle over who will exploit it. An international tender that closes in just two weeks is set to attract bids from major mining companies, including Britain's RTZ, BHP of Australia, Canada's Placer Dome, US companies Phelps Dodge and Cyprus Mining and Japan's Marubeni Corporation and Mitsubishi. It is not just 20m tonnes of copper that are at stake in the Dollars 1bn project, which will only start production towards the end of the century. Udokan has become a crucible for a debate over how the government should reconcile its quest for foreign investment with its newly-advertised desire to help Russian industry switch to a market system and civilian products after decades of catering primarily to the military. Having turned to Russian enterprise managers for political support at the Congress of People's Deputies (the full parliament), which opened yesterday, the government will be under pressure to promote their interests when it takes the final decision over the Udokan contract. This will mean either giving the contract to a Russian bidder, or securing as much sub-contracting work as possible for Russian enterprises. Apparently keeping its options open, an industrial consortium grouping state-owned enterprises such as heavy engineering giant Uralmash, has teamed up with the only Russian competitor in the tender. But its members have also made presentations to foreign companies registered as tender participants by the tender committee. Involving as much Russian technology and manpower as possible is just one of several criteria set by the tender committee for companies to consider as they put together proposals that are formally for a feasibility study but involve spelling out basic plans for developing the mine. This will include proposals for the construction of a copper mill near the mine to turn ore into concentrate, for a power station to provide the project with electricity and heating, and amenities for at least 2,000 mine workers. Participants must also undertake to observe the strictest standards of environmental protection and contribute to the welfare of local inhabitants, including a minority nomad people which fears its reindeer-breeding and hunting will be harmed by the mining development. Mr Alexander Rubtsov, a consultant to the regional government in Chita as well as a member of President Boris Yeltsin's industrial advisory committee, maintains that 'the contract won't be given to Russian companies just because they are Russian'. But he says the Udokan Mining Company, presented as the only 'Russian' competitor in the race even though it is half-owned by two little-known western companies, SFW and Somerset Holdings, has the necessary finance and know-how to qualify it for the project. By way of argument, he points to the fact that it is being advised by Fluor Daniel, a San Francisco-based company with years of experience putting together international mining projects. (In a possible conflict of interest, the Chita regional government was until recently one of the 'Russian' shareholders). Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank hired to help the Russian government attract foreign capital, has worked hard to make the tender correspond to international standards in the belief that the project will be most efficiently handled by a foreign company. Participants of this view argue anyway that any foreign company will have to use Russian labour and some Russian suppliers. Whichever view prevails, both will involve combining Russian labour and suppliers with foreign expertise and capital: the differences relate to whether foreigners or Russians will control the project, and whether economic efficiency will be the main criterion for determining the winner. For local officials and inhabitants of Chita's northernmost Kalarsky district, which is home to the mine, the project is a chance to attract wealth and jobs to an area bursting with minerals ranging from strategic metals to coal. Far from the politics of Moscow, the local administration also believes the district's needs will best by met by a foreign company with the latest mining technology and lots of dollars to spend on improving local living conditions. 'We want the most advanced technology with the least damage to the environment. We don't want our district to be turned into a test-site for Russian industry,' says Ms Alla Scherbak, the official responsible for the district's economic affairs. Mr Yevgeny Ivashchenko, head of the district administration, is also confident that foreign companies will secure building work for thousands of workers who helped him build the BAM railway link in his previous job as construction engineer. The Baikal-Amursky railway itself also hopes for a new lease of life. It is still operating at just 50 per cent capacity because the old Soviet state ran out of funds to develop the Udokan-style mining projects it was designed to serve. For the Russian government, the Udokan project has so far been free of the fierce wrangling between local and central government (over which foreign company should win), which made a shambles of an earlier tender for oil and gas off Sakhalin island. It remains to be seen whether it will be able to keep the tender free of infighting of a different kind, and reconcile conflicting national interests.</p>

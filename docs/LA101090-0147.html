			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RELATIONSHIPS: UNDERSTANDING DEMENTIA  </P> <P> Although Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, there are more than  70 others. Dementia may be triggered by strokes, high blood pressure,  alcoholism, medications, brain tumors and infections, depression and rare  diseases that cause brain damage, including Pick's, Huntington's and  Parkinson's.  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE  </P> <P> The disease most closely associated with aging, Alzheimer's causes the  progressive deterioration of the brain to such an extent as to render victims  unable to recognize their spouses and immediate family. The patient may become  confused, unable to concentrate and have trouble finishing sentences. More than  70% of the patients had behavioral disorders, such as unprovoked  aggressiveness. Over time, Alzheimer's leaves victims as helpless (and just as  needing) as children.  </P> <P> No treatment is available to stop or reverse its degenerative effects.  </P> <P> MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA  </P> <P> Multi-infarct dementia, or vascular dementia, is caused by multiple strokes  (infarcts) in the brain. Because the strokes usually occur before the symptoms  of dementia appear, the onset of the dementia seems sudden. The strokes affect  the part of the brain responsible for specific functions, such as calculations,  and create the more generalized symptoms of disorientation and behavioral  changes. Because of multi-infarct dementia's similarity to Alzheimer's, the two  coexist in 15% to 20% of dementia patients.  </P> <P> No cure or reversing process exists, but early assessment of cause can halt the  progression of the disease.  </P> <P> PARKINSON'S DISEASE  </P> <P> Those with Parkinson's lack dopamine in their systems. This neurotransmitter  helps control the tremor, stiffness and slowness characteristic of the disease.  In late stages, some patients develop dementia. Parkinson's patients often  develop Alzheimer's and, at times, Alzheimer's patients develop Parkinson's  symptoms.  </P> <P> Drugs can treat the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's but do not  improve any mental deterioration. Parkinson's is considered a model for drug  research on Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollars and Financial Impact  </P> <P> Fewer research dollars go toward studying Alzheimer's disease, and other  dementing illnesses, than heart disease, cancer or AIDS. Yet, Alzheimer's, the  fourth-leading cause of death among adults in the country, claims more than  100,000 lives annually.  </P> <P> An estimated 4 million seniors suffer from the disease nationally, while Orange  County has 40,000 Alzheimer's victims who struggle to cope with the  mysteriously debilitating brain disorder.  </P> <P> There is no known reason why the disease strikes people over the age of 60, and  there is no known cure for this ultimately fatal disease. Further, total costs,  which include diagnosis, treatment, long-term care and lost wages, is estimated  to be more than $88 billion each year.  </P> <P> The federal government covers $4.4 billion of these costs and state coffers are  dipped into for another $4.1 billion. But the remaining $79 billion is borne by  Alzheimer's patients and their families.  </P> <P> RESEARCH DOLLARS AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF DEMENTIAS ON SOCIETY  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:2.88IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Federal Research  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Estimated  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Funding  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Societal  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Disease  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Requests, 1991  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Costs, 1991  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alzheimer's disease  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (and related disorders)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $153  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $88,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Heart disease  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $704  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $94,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cancer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,580  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $72,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> AIDS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1,695  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $66,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Differences Between AAMI and Alzheimer's Disease  </P> <P> The term age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) refers to the minor memory  difficulties that come with age, or are often brought on by stress.

A steady loss of brain cells intensifies the symptoms of  deteriorating memory, impaired judgment, depression, a lack of concentration  and restlessness.  </P> <P> In 1989, people 75 years and older ran the greatest risk of falling victim to  the debilitating and often incurable symptoms of senile dementia. And, within  the next 50 years, as the nation's senior population grows, the number of  dementia patients is expected to triple.  </P> <P> At what age are you most likely to fall victim to dementia?  </P> <P> Age Range: Percentage  </P> <P> 55-64: 5 %  </P> <P> 65-74: 16 %  </P> <P> 75-84: 42 %  </P> <P> 85 and older: 37 %  </P> <P> Source: Source: National Institute on Aging  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Is Dementia?  </P> <P> Dementia is a term applied to a group of progressively debilitating symptoms,  including the inability to learn or remember information, repetitive behavior,  inarticulateness and personality and behavioral changes.  </P> <P> Even at advanced ages, memory loss that interferes with everyday life is not  normal. Any person exhibiting an increased inability to think or reason should  contact one of the local assessment centers in Orange County or consult a  neurologist to determine the cause of the dementia.  </P> <P> Progression rates of dementia vary, and depending on the condition causing the  brain cells to deteriorate, often the symptoms can be minimized to slow  progress of the disease.  </P> <P> FACTS ABOUT DEMENTIA YOU SHOULD KNOW:  </P> <P> * Nearly 20% of the causes of dementia can be corrected. Thyroid imbalances,  brain tumors, drug intoxication, alcoholism and infections are just a few of  the many treatable, and reversible, causes of dementia.  </P> <P> * Alzheimer's disease is not a generic term for forgetfulness. Rather,  Alzheimer's is the most common form of the progressive, degenerative and,  ultimately, fatal diseases that produce dementia. Parkinson's disease,  multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and multiple  sclerosis are other well-known diseases whose link to dementia are  irreversible.  </P> <P> * Early signs of dementia include memory problems, depression, anxiety and an  inability to concentrate long enough to read or follow the plot of television  shows.  </P> <P> * In Orange County, there are more than 40,000 victims of Alzheimer's disease.  Nationally, an estimated 4 million seniors are affected by the disease. By the  year 2040, the total number of Alzheimer's disease victims is expected to  triple.  </P> <P> * Over 50% of all nursing home patients suffer from dementia-related disorders.  The annual cost of nursing facility care ranges from $24,000 to $36,000.  </P> <P> * An estimated 70% of all Alzheimer's victims are cared for at home, by their  families. Annual costs of home care are approximately $18,000.  </P> <P> * Congress is considering increasing the amount in federal spending allotted  for Alzheimer's disease research to $132 million in fiscal year 1990, an  increase that would average out to a little more than $50 per patient. By  comparison, the National Institutes of Health invests 10 times that amount for  research on cancer, heart disease and AIDS.  </P> <P> * In the case of Alzheimer's, there is no cure and the cause of the disease is  not known.  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY ASSESSMENT FACILITIES  </P> <P> For more information regarding the symptoms of dementia, or to schedule an  assessment, contact one of the medical facilities listed below:  </P> <P> UC Irvine  </P> <P> Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Center  </P> <P> (714) 725-2382  </P> <P> UCI Medical Center-HAPS Clinic  </P> <P> (714) 634-6094  </P> <P> Los Alamitos Medical Center  </P> <P> 714) 826-6400 Ext. 3279  </P> <P> St. Jude Alzheimer's Assessment Center  </P> <P> (714) 871-3280 Ext. 3059  </P> <P> or call the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Assn. at (714) 631-0245.  </P> <P> Source: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Assn.

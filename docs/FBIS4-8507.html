			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(km)": "Ground-Air Missiles To Be Put To Rest"] </F>   [Text] The Army Command has proposed to the government to  abolish the ground-based air defense of Prague, Brno, and  Ostrava by 1995, when the transformation of the armed forces is  expected to be completed.    "The Army believes that it is inefficient to constantly keep  the so-called positional defense of objects in a state of  alert," Vladimir Novak, commander of the Air Defense Department  said. "This is why the Army wants to replace this defense  system with a concept that would include the defense of  important regions. Important regions would be designated as  such depending on where the threat would be coming from."    The air defense missiles deployed in the vicinity of Prague,  Brno, and Ostrava, which can be immediately launched at any  time, would not be in a state of combat alert in the future.  The Defense Ministry proposes that the air defense emergency  system should be secured only by communication troops and  fighter aircraft troops.    Air defense missiles would be put in a state of alert only  in  case of a military conflict.    Air defense is being secured by the Air Defense Brigade and  the Air Defense Regiment--the exact deployment of which the Army  declined to reveal--communication troops, and other units. An  elite fighter aircraft regiment is in Ceske Budejovice, an  independent fighter aircraft troop in Prerov, and a  communication brigade in Klecany. The Air Defense Command is  based in Stara Boleslav.    The first stage of air defense transformation began this  year  and will continue in the next year. Another two stages are  planned for 1996 to 2000, and 2001 to 2005.</p>

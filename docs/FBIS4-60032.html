			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  said today that Egypt and the EU countries have agreed to hold  exploratory preliminary talks to enter a partnership agreement.    He added that the talks will involve studying a framework  for  new relations, especially as such frameworks have been defined  between the EU and Israel and between the EU and Morocco and  Tunisia. He noted that the political form of these frameworks  is the same but their details differ according to each country  and its interests and circumstances.    Musa said the framework will consider developments in Europe  and the new concept of relations between the Mediterranean  countries and Europe, between the Middle Eastern countries and  Europe, and between Egypt and Europe.</p>

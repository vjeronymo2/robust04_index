Some  time ago, Hashemi-Rafsanjani's opponents in the clerical Majles  had started to strongly criticize Mohammad Hashemi and were  accusing him of not paying attention to Islamic values in radio  and television programs. Thus, they had placed  Hashemi-Rafsanjani under severe pressures and were questioning  some of his policies.    The removal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position as the  director of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran  [VVIRI] once again revealed the fact that in the existing  differences among the leadership factions, a large part of the  Majles deputies oppose Hashemi-Rafsanjani--a Majles that  Hashemi-Rafsanjani hoped would coordinate with his government,  his policies, and his programs. However, it is now clear that a  considerable number of the Majles deputies not only are not in  coordination with Hashemi-Rafsanjani but are also creating  problems for him and are thwarting his efforts.    Even though the Majles is only an institution and organ of  the regime, in these differences there is no institution or  or?on which Hashemi-Rafsanjani can rely and gain their support.  The Majles, the Council of Guardians, the bazaaris, and RESALAT  clique, and the supporters of the religious seminaries are  expressing their opposition to Hashemi-Rafsanjani in one way or  another. The army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps too  are under Khamene'i's orders. The Hezbollah, which manifests  itself mostly in the form of the Basij, is under Khamene'i's  orders.    Meanwhile, if Hashemi-Rafsanjani had some popular support in  the past and was able to distract public opinion both at home  and abroad with his promises, recently with the defeat of his  economic policy and as a result of the baselessness of his  promises he has lost this support too. Thus, we can say that  Hashemi-Rafsanjani has failed in his duties; and this failure  can be seen both in the economic and social fields and in the  confrontation with his opponents.    Political experts list two major reasons for  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's weakening position. The first is the  composition of the Majles and the other is the recent  considerable increase in the people's dissatisfaction. The  composition of the Majles is not what Hashemi-Rafsanjani wanted.  The withdrawal of the extremist faction during the elections of  the fourth session of the Majles not only did not strengthen  Hashemi-Rafsanjani but worked to the benefit of the  conservatives inside the leadership.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani had assumed that if the extremists inside  the leadership were set aside and especially did not participate  in the Majles, the rest of the opponents could be tamed by  giving them some benefits and that he could then do as he  pleased. However, obviously Hashemi-Rafsanjani was wrong in his  calculations. Meanwhile, the intensification of the people's  dissatisfaction during the past couple of years and the  explosive nature of these feelings in several cities in the  country made the clerical regime shudder with fear, and during  the people's uprising and demonstrations, the clergymen heard  the bases of their rule cracking and disintegrating.    Thus, Khamene'i used the pretext of the West's cultural  onslaught and once again called on the Hezbollah ummah to return  to the scene, to revive the Basij Organization, and to return  the regime's suppressive forces to the political scene. Thus,  the political atmosphere that was created by Khamene'i was not  to the benefit of Hashemi-Rafsanjani and his situation, and once  again it became obvious that the regime's main problem is the  continuation of the Islamic Republic and how to preserve it.  Long-lasting differences inside the regime increased and new  differences emerged.    It seems that the long-lasting differences between Khamene'i  and Hashemi-Rafsanjani which emerged after Khomeyni's death have  become more acute. In this conflict, a large number of  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's opponents consider the main problems that  the Islamic Republic faces to stem from Hashemi-Rafsanjani's  policies and actions. In the middle of all this, a large part  of the power centers has been placed under Khamene'i's authority  and the balance of power has shifted to Hashemi-Rafsanjani's  detriment.    These differences have continued and the dismissal of  Mohammad Hashemi from his position as VVIRI director is yet  another sign of the process that is weakening  Hashemi-Rafsanjani. The question is: What will  Hashemi-Rafsanjani do to free himself from this situation?  Clearly, if he places himself under Khamene'i's cloak, he will  join the ranks of other clergymen who work under Khamene'i's  shadow without having any special authority or programs; and if  he does not do so, then he will have no support of any size to  confront his opponents, some of whom are standing behind  Khamene'i and are trying to thwart his efforts in one way or  another.    Under the current situation, Hashemi-Rafsanjani thinks that  it is better to come to terms with his opponents and rivals to a  certain extent and the clearest example of this is his  acceptance of the removal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position  as VVIRI director, which is considered to be a positive answer  to the opponents of Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    One can say that under the current situation, neither the  alliance of Khamene'i and his supporters nor Hashemi-Rafsanjani  and his clique are able to throw the other out of the scene.  But the situation will not stay the same and it is improbable  that either of the two sides will agree with the continuation of  this situation.    It can now be said that the intensification of this process  and the deepening of the differences and rivalry among the  various groups of the regime will, first and foremost, further  paralyze the regime and will also render the regime helpless  vis-a-vis the crisis which it is now facing. Undoubtedly this  too will pave the way for the intensification of the regime's  struggle against the ruling regime.</p>

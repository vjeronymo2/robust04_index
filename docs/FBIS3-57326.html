			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Serafin Bykhun] </F>   [Text] Orel, 25 Jan -- Nobody "can suspect the government  of rejecting reforms," Viktor Chernomyrdin, said in Orel today  at a regional conference dedicated to questions of drawing up a  state program for reviving Central Russia. The head of cabinet  stressed that "we shall not deviate from the course we have  chosen."    Viktor Chernomyrdin assessed positively the "serious and  substantial talks" which took place in Orel today both on the  region's problems and the economic and political state of  affairs in Russia as a whole.    Summing up the results of 1993, the head of government  annnounced that Gross Domestic Product last year fell by 12  percent as against 19 percent in 1992 and industrial output by  16 percent in comparision with 22 percent in 1992. Viktor  Chernomyrdin stated that "the overall volume of trade grew  considerably." The population's money income in real terms,  according to him, grew by 10 percent in comparison with 1992.  The average monthly rate of inflation fell from 26 percent in  January 1993 to 12 percent in December. However, there was a  considerable growth in the rate of inflation at the beginning of  this year.    Chernomyrdin said also that "everything the government does  is toward implementation of its program, which is tightly linked  to maximum restraint of inflation."    The head of the Cabinet announced that budget expenditure  for  the first quarter of 1994 has been held at the level of the  fourth quarter of last year. Spending items will be financed as  and when revenues are received by the federal budget. He also  announced that four trillion rubles have been earmarked in the  first quarter of 1994 to pay off the state's most outstanding  debts to the agro-industrial, defense and some other sectors.  "We must not allow this money to go solely on wages or on  financing dubious measures or organizations", he stressed.    Chernomyrdin set out the government's primary economic goal  in 1994: "Not to accept any impossible commitments." The  premier hinted that if the required finance is not available  then the state will have to refuse to carry out some decisions  reached earlier at federal level.    Chernomyrdin then spoke of the need for a thorough reform of  the social sphere by way of rational use of state resources. He  stressed in particular the need to strengthen financial  stability in the country with a sensible and effective  investment policy. "In this, I see one of the principal ways of  achieving a sounder budget," Chernomyrdin remarked.    Speaking at the gathering, one of the main aims of which was  to resolve problems of food supplies and development of  agriculture in Russia's central oblasts, the premier said that  he had adopted a decision yesterday to issue 2.3 trillion rubles  to the agro-industrial complex in the first quarter of 1994.  "The government has supported and will continue to support  agriculture in the country".</p>

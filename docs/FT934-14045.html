			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Silent launch of the lifeboat: Robert Peston unravels a Bank of England operation to avert a possible threat to the UK financial system The life or death of City institutions is from time to time decided in the 18th century elegance of the Bank of England's Parlours, where the governor and his court of directors have their offices. One of these rare occasions, until very recently a closely guarded secret, was the weekend of July 13-14 1991, when the then deputy governor, Mr Eddie George - the current governor - launched a Pounds 240m financial lifeboat to rescue two small banks, the National Mortgage Bank (NMB), a subsidiary of the mortgage provider National Home Loans, and the City Merchants Bank, part of the Invesco MIM investment group. The Bank remains reluctant to discuss the episode in detail. However, it has been learnt that in the following seven months the Bank intervened to support two other institutions, Union Discount, a leading discount house or trader in debt securities, and East Trust, a tiny East Anglian bank. Large sums of public money were at risk. The Bank expects to make losses of Pounds 115m on the loans it made to these institutions, mainly because of the problems of National Mortgage Bank. As a result, the Bank last year cut the dividend it pays the Treasury by almost Pounds 30m to Pounds 38m. The Bank argues that the money was well spent because it prevented a domino effect of failures among small banks. It says it followed its often repeated policy of only intervening to save an ailing bank when there is a grave danger to other banks or the financial system. It is acutely conscious, it maintains, of the so-called 'moral hazard' that if no bank were allowed to fail, depositors would not have to take into account the soundness of a bank before deciding where to place funds, and bank executives would feel under less pressure to manage their businesses prudently. So the question to be answered in analysing the 1991 lifeboat is how serious was the threat to the banking system. The central character in the rescue was Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank director responsible for banking supervision. He became concerned that there was a risk of a crisis about October 1990. The recession was causing an unprecedented number of companies to go bankrupt, leading to problems for the banks that had financed them. Those banks with above average exposure to the property sector were facing the biggest losses. Mr Quinn instructed the Bank's supervisory department to identify the weakest banks and monitor them particularly closely. At this stage, he was prepared to allow troubled banks to close. Between mid-1990 and the spring of 1991, British and Commonwealth Merchant Bank, Authority Bank, Chancery Bank and Edington all ran into financial difficulties and went into administration. However, the closure of these banks caused serious losses for one group of wholesale depositors - local authorities, which had been attracted by the higher interest rates available at smaller banks. They therefore started to transfer their savings out of other small banks and into the big clearing banks. Overseas banks and then big companies followed the local authorities' lead. This 'flight to quality', in Mr Quinn's words, accelerated after the closure of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International, on July 5. In the following eight days, wholesale depositors - and even some retail depositors  -pulled their funds out of small banks at an alarming rate. NMB's accounts show that institutions other than banks - mostly local authorities - withdrew deposits totalling Pounds 292m in 1991, equivalent to more than half its total deposit base. City Merchants Bank suffered in the same way. These were the worst cases, but the Bank feared similar problems could be faced by 40 others. In the early stages of planning on how to deal with what the Bank regarded as an emerging crisis, it hoped to persuade the clearers to contribute to a lifeboat, since they had participated on the two previous occasions when the Bank had organised a rescue: in 1973 the Bank and clearers launched a Pounds 1bn lifeboat to save a raft of small banks known as the secondary banks; and in 1984, they provided financial support to Johnson Matthey Bankers, which had run into difficulties because of bad loans. However, on the most recent occasion when the clearers were sounded out, in March 1991, they indicated that their days of risking their capital for the good of the City were over. 'The clearing banks had become much more profit-oriented, more hardnosed than in 1974,' says Mr Quinn. A clearing bank chairman adds: 'We could not see why we should risk our capital to prop up a competitor.' In any rescue the Bank would be on its own. By the end of the second week of July, the rate of cash outflow at NMB and the City Merchants Bank meant that without help from the Bank they would have to shut their doors and cease operations within a matter of days. That weekend, Mr Eddie George, Mr Quinn and senior managers from the supervisory department were at the Bank deciding whether and how any such rescue should be made. The decision was difficult. NMB and City Merchants Bank were vulnerable because they had imprudently relied too much on wholesale depositors, rather than attracting a greater number of retail depositors, who tend to be more loyal. Though the Bank believed that in other respects NMB and City Merchants Bank were sound - a false belief in the case of NMB whose financial position continued to deteriorate and is currently being wound up - there was a case for letting them collapse as a warning to other banks. Mr Quinn has always maintained that a central bank should only intervene to rescue a bank in order 'to prevent systemic failure'. The Bank would always intervene if a clearing bank ran into difficulties and put at risk the nationwide system for making payments. Similarly, it would take action to prevent a general collapse of confidence in banks and building societies as a safe haven for funds. But the closures of NMB and City Merchants Bank were unlikely to have led to such apocalyptic outcomes. They were not well known and were small. City Merchants had loans on its balance sheet of Pounds 130m and NMB had made loans of Pounds 431m. Indeed Mr Quinn says that he did not feel the clearing banks were in 'any danger'. There might have been a knock-on effect on confidence in building societies from a closure of NMB, since it was owned by a high profile mortgage provider, National Home Loans. At the time, investors' confidence in building societies was at a low ebb and four weeks later there was a run on a small society, the Southdown, which was subsequently merged with the Leeds. However, the precise nature of the risk to the financial system perceived by the Bank was limited, says a government official, who took a close interest in the episode. He says: 'The Bank feared there would be a loss of confidence which would lead to a withdrawal of funds from a group of medium-size banks. If a great number of those closed, that could have done damage to the economy, by eliminating an important source of credit.' The alarm at the Bank was great. One banker who visited it at about this time says: 'I have never seen it in such a turmoil. It was like Waterloo station, with doors slamming, people running about.' Commercial bankers, however, dispute that many small banks would have had to close. The better-known smaller banks were protected either by strong parent companies or by balance sheets containing substantial cash reserves. 'The idea that this was a repeat of the secondary banking crisis is a joke,' says a senior clearing banker. Nonetheless, Mr George decided to attempt a rescue. He sought the agreement of the governor, the then Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown, who informed Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor. The Treasury's permission would have been required if the Bank wanted access to public funds in addition to its own resources. But the Bank had sufficient capital on its own balance sheet. Despite this an official said that the government viewed the Bank's arguments for intervening as 'plausible' and supported it. Having decided to go ahead, the Bank then implemented the rescue in a way designed to keep it a secret. The Bank feared that if it were seen to be intervening - if its analysis of the weakness of the banking sector became widely known - this would precipitate an even more serious run on deposits. The clearers were to provide the rescue loans and pretend that they were normal credit lines. However, these loans would be fully guaranteed by the Bank. The clearers received a small payment for managing the loans. Substantial fees and interest accrued to the Bank but it was also forced to bear any losses on the loans. They were ,in effect, loans from the Bank. Thus Barclays arranged a Pounds 200m loan from a syndicate of banks for NMB and NatWest arranged a Pounds 40m facility for City Merchants Bank. Though NMB and City Merchants Bank were secure for the time being, the Bank continued to monitor small banks with exceptional thoroughness for many more months. The next bank it rescued was the Norwich-based East Trust, which has since closed. By the weekend of July 20-21, East Trust was planning to go into administration because it had run out of cash. The Bank put pressure on two of East Trust's bankers, Hambros and Royal Bank of Scotland, to unfreeze credit lines and persuaded East Trust to continue trading. On the following Tuesday, it told East to visit Barclays, which unexpectedly offered it a Pounds 7m loan facility. It is not known whether this facility was guaranteed by the Bank. The Bank's final intervention to help an institution was in February 1992, when a loan facility was arranged for Union Discount. This was a special case, as Union was not a lending bank. It was, however, making big losses due to a diversification into leasing. As a discount house, Union enjoyed the privilege of dealing directly with the Bank in the market for commercial and treasury bills. It was therefore an important prop in the Bank's system for controlling monetary conditions. The Bank wanted to ensure there was no possibility of Union running into difficulties and it therefore arranged the loan for it. However, Union today regards this facility as a mixed blessing, because of the Bank's insistence that the loan be secret. Union wanted to raise capital through a rights issue earlier this year, but was prevented from doing so because under stock exchange rules it would have had to disclose the loan in its rights issue document. Instead, it was forced to sell one of its best businesses, Winterflood Securities. After Union, there were no further rescues. But the Bank's anxiety about the banking system was not dissipated till September 16 when sterling withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism. The subsequent drop in interest rates and signs of economic recovery made wholesale depositors less worried about the impact of bankruptcies on the prospects of smaller UK banks. A severe recession had been weathered without serious disruption to financial markets. But the price paid for this stability was significant and not merely in terms of the Bank's predicted losses from its rescue loans. Another cost was the moral hazard of perpetuating the widespread belief that the Bank prefers to rescue troubled banks rather than allowing the market to sort the weak from the strong. Bankers are always likely to question the Bank's motives when it launches rescues because it combines the roles of lender of last resort and a supervisor with responsibility for protecting depositors. Many believe that the Bank is too concerned about the likely outcry from depositors in the event of a bank failure and that it is therefore too quick to use its lending powers. The most effective way to minimise the moral hazard may be to demerge into a new City watchdog the Bank's supervisory role as protector of deposits. If the Bank retained only its lender of last resort function, its interventions to rescue banks would be seen to be motivated by a concern for the health of the financial system and not the wealth of depositors.</p>

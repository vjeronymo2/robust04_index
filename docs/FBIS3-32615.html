			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Colombian Council of State in </F> Santa Fe de Bogota on 8 February; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900"  newscast]    [Text] The Council of State, meeting in full chamber while  evaluating the report sent by the president of the Republic on  the presence of foreign troops, military vessels, and aircraft  in national territory, unanimously states:    1. The government has at no point asked for an opinion to  permit the transit and permanence of foreign troops as well as  foreign military vessels and aircraft in the national territory  in accordance with the provisions of Articles 189, No. 7, and  237, No. 3, of the Constitution.    2. In light of the Constitution, the council does not find  convincing the government's explanations on the decisions it has  made concerning this matter, because the interpretation of the  text of the same and the treaties and agreements signed by  Colombia goes against the letter and spirit of the Constitution  and violates national sovereignty.    3. From the same explanations, it can be deduced the Senate  did not grant the permission established by Article 173, No. 4,  of the Constitution.    4. Given the de facto situation that was created, it  believes U.S. military troops, vessels, and aircraft are in  Colombian territory without fulfilling the requisites  established in the Constitution.    5. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the president  of the Republic is responsible for the Colombian state's foreign  relations with absolute respect for national sovereignty;  consequently, it is unusual for the president to state the  defense minister gave the authorization without his previous  knowledge even though the memorandum of understanding signed by  that minister with the U.S. ambassador on 29 October 1993  establishes that they are acting with due authorization from  their respective governments.    A copy of this statement shall be sent, along with the  letters exchanged between the Council of State and the president  of the Republic, to the Honorable Chamber of Representatives  Commission To Investigate Charges and to the nation's attorney  general so (?they can do their job).    Copy to the president of the Republic.    [Issued] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 February.</p>

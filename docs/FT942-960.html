			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel (Update): Lufthansa and Orly rights Lufthansa supervisory board chairman Juergen Weber said Lufthansa is set to make a request for landing rights at Orly airport, Paris, for the Frankfurt or Munich routes. 'It would be astonishing if the French refused the Germans what they had agreed with their English friends,' he said. In an interview with Le Monde he said that Lufthansa wants to focus on its core air operations and may dispose of its building and software activities, setting up subsidiaries for cargo transport, electronics and ground services.</p>

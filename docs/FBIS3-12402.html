			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member Dr. </F> Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by radio correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi,  in the studio; from the "With the Events" program--live]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive  Committee member, good evening.    [Ghawshah] Good evening.    [Mu'addi] The PLO Executive Committee is holding intensive  consultations and contacts. Has the Palestinian leadership  reached a firm decision on the future of Israel-Palestinian  negotiations?    [Ghawshah] The Palestinian leadership held a meeting  yesterday to deal with various developments. The meeting was  also attended by the heads of the delegations to the  negotiations in Taba, Paris, and Washington. The Executive  Committee studied the positions that it received. In fact, the  position we received from the Israeli Government and Rabin was  disappointing.    The Israeli Government's decisions were not up to the level  of the incident and did not remove the obstacles to the peace  process. The Executive Committee and the Palestinian leadership  studied this issue, and they will follow up these various  developments tonight.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah: Will the Palestinian side  respond to the U.S. call to hold bilateral meetings in  Washington?    [Ghawshah] This depends on what the negotiations will deal  with. It also depends on whether there are new issues, and  whether it is only a change in the venues of meetings and in the  external appearance rather than the substance. There are many  issues that must be discussed with the U.S. Administration in  order to learn about the objective, level, and timing of such  meetings.    The PLO is thus ready, in principle, to participate in the  negotiations. However, we believe that the issue is not whether  to participate in negotiations and accept the U.S. invitation.  The issue is at what level such negotiations will be held and  what topics will be discussed. The Palestinian leadership will  also discuss this issue in tonight's meeting.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir: Your colleague, PLO Executive  Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, today said the PLO will not  resume negotiations unless the settlers are disarmed. Is this  an official decision by the PLO leadership?    [Ghawshah] This issue was also discussed. Several requests  were proposed. We are of the view that disarming the settlers  is a basic and necessary issue. The forces that maintain  internal security and public order are regular forces, whether  the Israeli Army troops or, when the withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho is completed, the Palestinian security and police forces.    Hence, we believe that keeping the settlers under arms is in  violation of both the law and all agreements. This is a basic  issue. We also believe that the real threats to security are in  fact threats to Palestinian security. This is contrary to Prime  Minister Rabin's allegations that Israel wants to guarantee its  own security. Evidence has shown that the Palestinian people  are the ones who need protection and security guarantees.    It is not the first time that the Palestinians have been  attacked by settlers, whether in the form of stopping traffic on  roads or attacking defenseless citizens in their houses and  cars. We see no logical explanation for the Israeli  Government's position that permits extremist organizations to  carry arms. These issues should be discussed, whether with the  United States or other parties before finally deciding on  whether to participate in the Washington negotiations.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir: What are the PLO leadership's  irreversible terms to resume the Israeli-Palestinian  negotiations?    [Ghawshah] The PLO leadership has proven its good  intentions, demonstrated great flexibility, and made many  concessions. It still demands that there should be a commitment  to implementing the agreement and to the dates set. The only  issue in the Declaration of Principles that needs no  negotiations is the dates to begin and end the withdrawal from  Gaza and Jericho. Rabin made this a negotiable issue because it  is not a sacred issue. What terms and issues are we talking  about?    We believe that the continuation of these policies by Rabin  and his government will deprive the negotiations of their role  and feasibility. The basic issue is that a real and serious  change should be made in the Israeli Government's position on  the peace process and on implementing the agreements. We also  believe that foremost among these issues must be a clear Israeli  position on the settlers and disarming them. Protection for the  Palestinians must be secured and UN observers should be put in  place in order to maintain Palestinian security and prevent  encroachments on it, whether on the part of the settlers or  through the methods used by the Israeli Army, which has killed  or wounded dozens of our people's sons.    At a time when the Palestinians are prevented from  expressing  their feelings or burying their martyrs, we see on television  pictures of settlers wandering freely with their weapons. Thus,  what negotiations are we talking about?    We pose a basic question: What peace does Rabin want? Does  he want peace that will guarantee security, stability, and  prosperity for Israel, or does he wish to continue his policies  that appease the Likud, the settlers, and others. This  appeasement cannot be part of a peace that takes into account  party, internal, and electoral considerations.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, the last question is: Do you think  that a meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and PLO chief Yasir  'Arafat could facilitate the resumption of the  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations?    [Ghawshah] We believe that the first step should be serious  and practical decisions by Rabin on the massacre and the savage  crime perpetrated against our people's sons in the Ibrahimi  Mosque, as well as on the acts of violence carried out by the  Israeli military circles, which killed and wounded dozens of our  people's sons.    We believe that what will really facilitate the negotiations  and any future meetings are effective measures taken by both the  Israeli Government and Rabin in order to show real readiness for  negotiations to achieve peace. Foremost among these measures is  the disarming of the settlers and a clear announcement of  commitment to implementing the agreement and its set dates.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee  member, thank you very much.    [Ghawshah] You are welcome.</p>

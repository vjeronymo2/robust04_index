			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: FROM OUT OF THE WILD COMES LASSEN, A SALE-PRICED,  POTBELLIED MUSTANG WHO'S A SWEETHEART OF THE STABLES  </P> <P> Debbie L. Rhodes was thinking to herself, "Well, here we are and I'm stuck with  him," as she tethered the potbellied wild horse at the Mission Trails Stables  in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The 1 1/2-year-old-mustang she bought for $125 from the Bureau of Land  Management was a good buy even though it was a beggarly looking maverick. "I  just felt sorry for him," she remembers. "He looked so bad."  </P> <P> The buy was made at a government sale at the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base  near Oceanside.  </P> <P> From the time she was a child, Rhodes, 33, had wanted a horse of her own, but  she bought the mustang on a whim. "I went with a friend who wanted to adopt a  burro and this horse just kept staring at me," she said. "What could I do?"  </P> <P> She said just about everyone suggested she forget the $125 and put the horse  out to pasture.  </P> <P> "Those same people today now have offered to buy him," said Rhodes, who works  as a printer in San Juan Capistrano. "He's really sweet, likes people a lot, is  easy to ride and he can learn anything."  </P> <P> Even though it was the first horse she owned, Rhodes wanted to break it  herself, but smartly decided to get help from a real cowboy. "I don't think I  really could have done it myself," she admits.  </P> <P> At first, "I was afraid of the horse, but he finally let me get close and I  found out he liked to get brushed. I would sit there for hours, talking and  brushing him. Then he let me put a halter on him."  </P> <P> When Rhodes finally saddled and mounted him, "He got scared and started bucking  like a rodeo horse and threw me off. I think I frightened him when I slapped  him on the butt, but that kind of settled him down and he never bucked me off  again.  </P> <P> "Now he's my buddy."  </P> <P> In fact, "he follows me around, almost like a dog. The first time I put him in  an arena he jumped the fence and came after me," she continued. "I guess he  figured he was supposed to stay with me."  </P> <P> That was three years ago, but Rhodes says despite the effort to break and train  the mustang she would buy another.  </P> <P> She named it Lassen after Lassen County in Northern California where the horse  was taken in a roundup. "I like the name," she said.  </P> <P> "If I had a ranch I would probably have 10 of them," said the one-time Cerritos  College art and graphics student who lives in Laguna Niguel. "The mustangs make  great horses and are smart and really strong. They have great personalities."  </P> <P> Rhodes, who sometimes goes hang gliding and rides a dirt bike, has become  somewhat the talk of the stables because she owns the only mustang there. "I'm  not famous," she scoffed. "I just happen to have a different kind of a horse."  </P> <P> But she is like a doting parent and sometimes treats Lassen with chocolate chip  cookies. "He would follow me forever to get them," she said, "but I think he  loves me without them."  </P> <P> Buying the horse changed her life. Said Rhodes, who is single: "I guess it's  kind of like having a child."  </P> <P> Evelyn Ellerman, 72, was cutting back some jasmine and an ivy plant in her  patio garden area at Leisure World in Laguna Hills when she came across a  bird's nest with two tiny white eggs.  </P> <P> Instead of removing the ivy and jasmine, Ellerman cut a small window into the  birds' world.  </P> <P> "She had the pleasure of keeping an eye on them while they were snug and  sheltered by the ivy leaves, between the roses, jasmine and hanging snapdragon  blossoms," wrote granddaughter Franciska Ellerman, 25, of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Evelyn watched the doves grow and named them "Bill" and "Coo" after a  children's story album she used to play for her two children.  </P> <P> And like her children, the birds grew up and left home.  </P> <P> "They flew away but I had a good time watching after them," said Evelyn, who  notes that she has now cut back the ivy and jasmine.  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- The Girls and Boys Club of the Harbor Area raised $12,000  from its 16th Annual Gold Classic Tournament at the Newport Beach Country Club.  Low gross winners were John Pitchess, Ron Moceri, Andy Pitchess and Ron  Weatherholt. Lenny Galasso won the longest-drive prize.  </P></p>

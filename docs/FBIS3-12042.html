Paz told Voz de Honduras radio station in a telephone  interview from Washington that the nomination of Gaviria "we  believe was the result of a democratic election in which the law  of the majority prevailed, which is the fundamental law of  democracy." "Gaviria won as a result, and we believe he is a  hemispheric leader who will give proper leadership to the OAS,"  he said. The minister added that among the majority of the OAS  member countries there is "satisfaction," but he also said "the  feeling of bitterness, especially that of Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus," is logical.    Niehaus made an intense but unfortunate effort because in  democracy there is always a winner and a loser, according to  Paz, who pointed out that Gaviria defeated the Costa Rican  foreign minister in the first round 20 votes to 14.    Honduras' position on the election of the OAS secretary  general was to support the Costa Rican candidate, Bernd Niehaus,  in the first round and Gaviria in the second round. Paz Aguilar  said that Honduras promised to support a Central American  candidacy because it "respects the promises that were made;"  however, he refused to comment on the change of heart of those  who had pledged their support for Niehaus.</p>

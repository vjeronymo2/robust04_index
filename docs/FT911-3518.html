			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Shares bought after legal advice, executive believed THE FORMER chief executive of County NatWest believed the bank's buying of Blue Arrow shares in the company's 1987 rights issue was done on the basis of proper legal advice, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday. Mr Peter Dale, the former managing director of County NatWest Securities, agreed with Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC, that until early 1988 his client, Mr Jonathan Cohen, the former chief executive and one of the defendants, had believed that proper legal advice had been taken. Mr Dale told Mr Roberts that in February 1988, Mr Cohen had first announced that it had become apparent that proper advice had not in fact been taken and that that seemed to come as a surprise to him. Mr Cohen was contradicted by Miss Elizabeth Brimelow, then County's compliance director, who said proper advice had been taken, Mr Dale said. Mr Dale also disputed the account given to the court by Mr Philip Rimell, the former chairman of CNWS, of how CNWS bought 31m shares from County. He agreed with Mr Roberts that Mr Rimell had willingly bought the shares while he, Mr Dale, was abroad. He could not remember Mr Rimell having telephoned him to object to the transaction and denied having instructed him to take the shares. The trial continues today.</p>

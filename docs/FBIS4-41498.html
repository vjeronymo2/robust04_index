			<p>BFN     [Text] The administration of the Chechen president  [Dzhokhar Dudayev] is now sorting out the security services.    [Ramzan Khadzhiyev] The forces of law and order in the  Chechen republic are not having the best of times. After  another presidential purge, many heads of the power structures  have lost their jobs, including the procurator general, the  heads of certain power departments and heads of militia area  divisions. Dudayev is not attacking the Internal Affairs  Ministry and procuracy so much for the assassination attempt on  him, as for the paralysis in the power forces when faced with  criminal groups.    [Begin Dudayev recording] The heads of all power forces are  to carry out a thorough investigation into officials in the  bodies of law and order and security who are directly  responsible for ensuring the safety of top officials, law and  order, and observance of legislative discipline. The toughest  measures are to be taken against them, up to and including  instigating criminal charges. [end recording]    [Khadzhiyev] The decree has been published, and the passions  around it have still not died down. Those fired are looking for  high-ranking intermediaries in order to return to their  comfortable offices. Criminal elements are on their guard and  biding their time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirella Kalostipi from Brussels] </F>   [Excerpt] The morning session of the NATO summit has ended  and the heads of government and state are heading for lunch with  Prince Albert. This morning, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  discussed NATO's new role and the Yugoslav issue. Referring to  the Yugoslav issue, Papandreou said the dispute can only be  settled through negotiations between the interested parties and  that Greece, which presides over the European Union [EU], will  spare no effort for a peaceful settlement of a dispute so near  its border.    Papandreou discussed NATO's new role and stressed that its  new duties include preventing clashes and safeguarding peace.  He said the U.S. suggestion on cooperating for peace is the  first step toward the alliance's expansion.    A declaration on Yugoslavia, the basic topic, will be issued  tomorrow. Papandreou referred to the continuing clashes in the  former Yugoslavia, which concern Greece deeply because they are  a factor of instability. He said: We have condemned aggressive  Bosnian Muslim military attacks against Croat positions in  central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the bombing of Sarajevo by Bosnian  Serbs, and the threat of military involvement by the Croatian  Government in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papandreou said: We have  condemned the obstruction of humanitarian aid to suffering  civilians. I am convinced that this dispute can only be settled  through negotiations among the interested parties. He said that  much has been achieved and that the co-chairmen contributed  decisively to this. The prime minister stressed that it is very  important that the parties involved immediately stop fighting  and respect their signatures. Greece, which presides over the  EU, will spare no effort for a peaceful settlement of a dispute  so near its border.    Papandreou met twice with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who  wished Greece a good Presidency. Clinton said he knows  Papandreou from the United States, and added they will have many  opportunities to meet and talk. In a pleasant atmosphere,  Clinton told Papandreou that he watched him on television at the  inauguration of the Greek Presidency, adding that he never  watches himself but always watches all the other state leaders.  Papandreou said he is certain there will be good bilateral  cooperation.    In their second short meeting, Papandreou and Clinton  referred to mutual university acquaintances in the United States  and discussed their meeting scheduled for tomorrow and their  upcoming meeting in the United States.    Papandreou met briefly with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller. Tilemakhos Khitiris, the deputy minister to the prime  minister, said the meeting was friendly. Ciller said she saw  lectures by the Greek prime minister in the United States.  Papandreou congratulated her and wished her all the best during  her term as prime minister.    Papandreou also met briefly with Norwegian Prime Minister  Gro  Harlem Brundtland. His country is a candidate for EU  membership. The Greek prime minister said he wants to meet his  French counterpart Edouard Balladur, a meeting that could be  held this afternoon. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / People: Miller Knight Alan Cleary and Jim Magee are to join the board of Miller Knight, the chartered loss adjusters, following the shake-up of the Merrett Group in the past few weeks. Cleary becomes executive chairman and Magee chief executive with effect from October 11. Barry Whyte continues as managing director. The appointments come after pressure for changes within the group of insurance companies headed by Stephen Merrett, who recently resigned as deputy chairman of Lloyd's, the insurance market. Merrett agreed to a number of changes over the summer including appointing new directors and resigning as chairman of Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, another part of Merrett Holdings. Miller Knight has been involved in part of the restructuring, which has included the introduction of computer systems and improving the overall management of the company. Both Cleary and Magee were group managing directors of Thomas Howell, where Cleary was deputy chairman. When they left the company two years ago they signed an agreement to remain out of the industry. That agreement has now expired. Cleary is a past president of the Chartered Insurance Institute and of the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters.</p>

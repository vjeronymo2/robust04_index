			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): The challenge now is winning the peace - With the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, serious thoughts are being given to the economic implications Sir John Davies, the attorney general for Ireland under the first Queen Elizabeth, described Ulster in 1606 as 'the most rude and unreformed part of Ireland, and the seat and nest of the last great rebellion.' Catholic Irish lords had constantly 'champed at the bit' of British rule, but it was 315 years after the attorney general wrote those words before the problem of seemingly perpetual Irish revolt was partially resolved by partitioning the island in 1921. A better-known former UK attorney general, and currently the Northern Ireland secretary of state, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has had the delicate task of presiding over the ending of another rebellion, that of the Provisional IRA, which for the past 25 years has created havoc in Ulster and on the British mainland in its efforts to force a total British withdrawal from the province. The IRA's cessation of hostilities, announced two weeks ago, has so far held, and a growing number of political leaders both domestically and abroad are coming to believe that this may really be the permanent cessation of violence demanded by the two governments in last December's Downing Street declaration, and which will pave the way for the inclusion of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into round-table talks. Sir Patrick stresses that it is the 'intention' that the ceasefire be permanent which is important and that this must be matched by deeds and words before the British government can finally accept the IRA's bona fides  -'the reason is that this government cannot be seen to sit and down and talk to people who may be reserving an option of going back to their former violence if they don't get what they want at the table . . . I have to maintain the confidence of people in Northern Ireland.' That confidence is showing signs of growing. In Dublin, the Irish prime minister met Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president last week, to prepare the ground for Sinn Fein's inclusion in a Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which will bring together the political parties in the Republic with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) and the moderate Alliance party from Northern Ireland. The North's other unionist parties have so far refused to join the Forum, but some leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) have indicated that they believe the ceasefire to be permanent and, once convinced of that, have said that they will eventually sit at the table with Sinn Fein. At the international level, the US government has thrown its weight behind the peace process and held out a promise of economic assistance to Northern Ireland, as has the European Commission. Whether the Loyalist paramilitaries will also lay down their weapons - a key factor in the peace equation - remains to be resolved, and a small bomb planted at a Dublin railway station last Monday does not look encouraging. But community workers in Protestant working class areas of Belfast are convinced that a Loyalist ceasefire will be declared within the next few weeks. If so, the momentum towards peace would become increasingly unstoppable. The next hurdle in the peace process, once a ceasefire is established on both sides of the community, will be to convince all the political parties to sit down and negotiate new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. A focus for these talks is being drafted by the British and Irish governments in the form of a 'framework document,' which will address such issues as reform of the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland; a new elected assembly for the province; and cross-border administrative structures which will encourage greater economic and political co-operation between the Republic and Northern Ireland. No-one is under the illusion that these talks will be anything other than difficult. The UUP and the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) see in the cross-border structures a potential trap which will lead to eventual joint sovereignty, and a back-door approach to a united Ireland. Mr Jim Gibney, who sits on the national executive of Sinn Fein, said his party would welcome new cross-party structures - 'if they are free-standing and can freely develop and there is no ceiling built into their development, we would see them as a process towards national reconciliation.' Unionist fears can, it is hoped, be dealt with, by having the executive powers of the new bodies jointly delegated to them by parliaments in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, rather than by the two governments, according to Sir Patrick. Whether nationalists will accept this, remains to be seen. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week that the next battle to come 'will be over the framework document.' But both governments are convinced that with a willingness to compromise by both nationalists and unionists, facilitated by a climate of peace, then agreement is achievable. Sir Patrick says 'there has got to be an outcome in which nobody can seek to have achieved everything at the end.' So, with the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, if not yet firmly in place, serious thoughts are now being given to the economic implications of peace. Economists are divided on the issue. There are those who say that Northern Ireland's development agencies such as the Industrial Development Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, will be able to aggressively market the province to foreign investors, no longer having to fight against the negative image created by the troubles. The announcement last week by Hilton International, that it is to build a 187-bedroom hotel as a centrepiece to the new Laganside development in Belfast will be an encouragement to others thinking of capitalising on what is expected to be a tourist boom in the province in the years ahead. Seagate, the US electronics manufacturer, last year established a high-tech manufacturing facility in Londonderry, without waiting for a peace settlement, attracted by the large pool of skilled labour in the province. The textile industry continues to grow and now provides around a quarter of all manufacturing employment. First-class infrastructure in road, rail, telecoms, ports and airports adds to the attraction of the province. The optimists therefore say that peace will bring foreign investment on a similar scale to that achieved by Scotland, Wales and the Irish Republic. Whilst the economic benefit of peace is not in dispute, more cautious analysts point to the downside. As many as 20,000 people are estimated to be employed in the security forces and related occupations such as the security guards seen at the entrance of almost every large store and office block across the province. Many of these could be expected to lose their jobs. The short-term effect could be a rise in the unemployment level of 98,000 or 13.1 per cent of the workforce, already the highest in the UK. Sir Patrick acknowledges the problem - 'there is going to be a need for gradual adjustments and it is true that a lot of jobs are linked to the emergency.' He says that up to 80 per cent of the annual Pounds 1bn government spending on security is related to the emergency. The potential loss to the economy in security-related spending by both the public and private sectors could therefore exceed Pounds 1bn in the event of a lasting peace, equivalent to around 10 per cent of the province's GDP. Business leaders can thus be expected to exert intense pressure upon both governments to provide extra resources for Northern Ireland, whether from their own exchequers, or by enlisting support from Washington and Brussels. As Michael Smyth, an economist at the University of Ulster, says: 'The danger is that the government could pull the rug out from under the private sector, just as they have a chance of taking off.' After decades, indeed centuries, of conflict and rebellion in Northern Ireland, the real challenge thus facing Ulster's politicians as the 21st century approaches is no longer that of winning the war, but rather winning the peace.</p>

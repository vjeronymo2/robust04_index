			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Argentine mid-term poll shows lead for Peronists THE RULING Peronist party in Argentina took an estimated 40 per cent of the votes yesterday in mid-term Congressional elections. Early indications showed the voters having given the Peronists a lead of about 10 percentage points over the opposition Radical party. This points to a new Chamber of Deputies little different to that shaped by the polls of 1991 and so the government's 45 per cent share of the 257 seats in the chamber is likely to be much as before. Therefore, President Carlos Menem's bid to change the constitution - so as to allow himself to stand for a second successive term, in a presidential election late next year - has not been greatly aided. The government needs a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to begin the complex process of amendment. Mr Menem says he will call a plebiscite of Argentina's 21.5m voters next month on the issue, hoping the result of such a sounding, albeit not binding on Congress, will increase pressure on legislators to amend the constitution. An attempt last month to pass a motion, calling for constitutional reform, failed in the Peronist-controlled senate when two Peronist senators abstained. More detailed data on the voting yesterday will only be available today or tomorrow. The government was expected to sweep the Peronist heartland in the province of Buenos Aires, the country's most populous and most productive, but the vote was too close to call in the Radical bastions of Cordoba, in the centre of the country, and the city of Buenos Aires. If the Peronists were to carry these two cities, that would represent a weighty victory over the Radicals.</p>

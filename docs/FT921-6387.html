			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (15): Simple and safe with a good return - National Savings THE MERITS of National Savings are often ignored by the salesmen and financial advisers who recommend investments. NS products are completely safe, and they offer some very attractive returns - but they do not pay commission to those who sell them. Application forms of certificates and other products are available over the post office counter. Broadly speaking, there are two types of National Savings investment: accounts, which offer variable interest, paid gross but which are subject to tax; and certificates or bonds, which pay fixed returns if held for five years. Savings Certificates offer returns which are either fixed or index-linked, and are sold in units of Pounds 25. The present 36th fixed issue pays 8.5 per cent tax free per annum, equivalent to 14.17 per cent gross for a higher-rate taxpayer. The maximum holding per person is Pounds 10,000, so a married couple can hold Pounds 20,000. You can hold a further Pounds 10,000 in trust for your spouse, but you should consult a solicitor about the best way to do so. The index-linked certificates pay 4.5 per cent per annum above the rate of inflation, measured by the Retail Prices Index. You can hold a maximum of Pounds 10,000, and returns are tax-free (see also letter I). How should you decide between the fixed interest and index-linked certificates? This depends on how high you think inflation will rise during the next five years. If you feel it will be above 4 per cent per annum, then index-linked certificates are going to be the more attractive. If you should die before your certificates mature, they can be transferred to your heir, regardless of the number of NS certificates they may hold. Yearly Plan: This is a scheme for saving once a month for a year, in order to buy a Savings Certificate at the end of that year. Savers pay a fixed amount (between Pounds 20 and Pounds 200) by monthly standing order. This means that the maximum value Savings Certificate that you can obtain through the Yearly Plan is Pounds 2,400. The certificate must be held for a further four years to earn the average current return of 8.5 per cent tax-free per annum. This means a total return of Pounds 3,479.55 if the maximum amounts are paid in. Since payments in the first year are staggered, the total return will be lower than if the investor had placed Pounds 2,400 in the 36th issue certificates at the outset, in which case the return would be Pounds 3,608.78. Savers can hold Pounds 10,000 in the 36th issue and have the Yearly Plan as well. Capital Bonds: These also offer a guaranteed return if held for five years, but are subject to tax. Non-taxpayers will have the benefit of receiving interest gross, because the tax is not deducted on the interest payment. The bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 100, to a maximum of Pounds 100,000. After five years, the original investment is repaid with interest of 11.5 per cent gross per annum on the current issue. You will get a lower rate of return if you cash in early, and no interest at all if you cash the bond in during the first year. Three months' notice is needed for a withdrawal. Basic-rate taxpayers should be better off buying the bonds than the 36th issue certificates, because even after deducting 25 per cent tax, the return will still be 8.625 per cent per annum. Disadvantages: There are two main problems with National Savings certificates and bonds. The first is that they do not pay an income: all of the return comes from the increase in value on maturity. The second is that the best returns are only achieved if you hold them for exactly five years. If you sell them beforehand, the returns are reduced; if you forget to redeem them on maturity, the certificates start to earn the general extension rate, a miserly 5.01 per cent. Children's Bonus Bond: NS's newest product went on sale in July 1991, as a way of encouraging savings for children. Issue A offers a guaranteed tax-exempt return equivalent to 11.84 per cent compound per annum over the first five years. This includes a large bonus earned on the fifth anniversary. The return is in two parts: a flat 5 per cent annual compound interest rate for five years, and a bonus after five years of 47.36 per cent of the purchase price. The bond can only be bought for children under the age of 16. NS will announce new rates of interest for each five-year period, but the bond does not have to be encashed until the holder's 21st birthday. Some National Savings products do pay a regular income. Income Bonds: Interest is taxable but, because it is paid gross, these bonds have some appeal to non-taxpayers - although less so now that building societies can also pay interest gross. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000, and subsequent income bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 1,000. The maximum holding an investor can have is Pounds 25,000. Interest is variable, and was 10.25 per cent in January. It is is earned on a daily basis and is paid monthly, though you will have to wait six weeks for the initial payment when you first invest. You also need to give three months notice when you want to cash in one of the bonds. However, if you try to cash it within the first year of purchase, you will only get half the rate of interest. Investment Account: A minimum of Pounds 25 opens the account, to a limit of Pounds 25,000. Subsequent deposits must be of at least Pounds 5. Interest is added to the account on December 31, and is taxable. However, the interest is paid gross. The rate of interest on the account is variable, but was 9.5 per cent in January. And of course those with a gambling streak can opt for: Premium Bonds, sold in multiples of Pounds 10, after an initial purchase of Pounds 100. Instead of interest, you have the chance to win prizes, ranging from the jackpot of Pounds 250,000 (monthly) down to Pounds 50. The money for the prizes currently represents a return on the fund of 6.5 per cent. You must hold the bond for three months to be eligible for the prizes. You can cash in your premium bonds by giving eight working days' notice.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Canadian banks cut prime rate CANADIAN banks have lowered their prime lending rate by a quarter point to 6.25 per cent, in response to big capital inflows and an accommodating monetary policy. The new level, which matches the lowest of the past 20 years, takes effect today and has been accompanied by a sharp rise in the Canadian dollar. The currency climbed above 80 US cents this week for the first time since November, and advanced yesterday morning to 80.35 US cents, despite the prime cut. The Bank of Canada said yesterday that intervention to contain the rise of the currency resulted in a net increase of USDollars 636m (Pounds 447.8m) in its foreign currency reserves in February. Nervousness in the financial markets about Canada's economic and political prospects was evident during the referendum last autumn on a new constitution. Then, banks pushed their prime rate as high as 9.75 per cent. However, investors have since been drawn by attractive yields on Canadian securities.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Sport: Spinning a magic web - Cricket WARM WEATHER, sunshine and the beginning of a new cricket season. It was too good to be true. To make the most of it before April wind and hailstorms closed in, I travelled south, to Kent. There I talked to Derek Underwood, England's most subtle and devastating Test bowler of the late 1960s and 70s, now a salesman of artificial grass surfaces for cricket pitches. He gave me his views on England's forthcoming series with the West Indies, the team arrives early next month thirsty for battle and blood. He gave me an expert's views. A bowler's views. Underwood is the same reticent figure now that he was in his playing days, with the air of one who is constantly thinking, never divulging. No wonder batsmen found him hard to play - he looks hard to play. That was one of his most effective weapons, as he believes it should be of every bowler. 'Always be planning something new. Cricket is only about 40 per cent ability; it's 60 per cent mental approach.' No-one who saw any of Underwood's most ingenious spells of bowling, such as the classic masterpiece on the last day of the 1968 Oval Test against the Australians, when he took 7-50 to win the match and save the series, could dare doubt him. Underwood was a slow medium-pace left-arm, round-the-wicket merchant of menace. As England's bowling at the moment is short of fast, medium, slow and spin bowling, he has no doubt that it must make menace it strength. 'If I was about to start a series against the West Indies, I would be discussing and thinking about their batting, analysing it, getting some strategies worked out.' I asked if there were any weak links who might merit extra careful study? As cautious as he is shrewd, Underwood gave a guarded reply. 'Gordon Greenidge, I suppose. A wonderful batsman, but by now he must be a bit slower than he was.' Greenidge's recent form has looked a little on the weak side. If he and Desmond Haynes maintain their tradition of opening the West Indian batting this summer, England must concentrate on dislodging him early, before the partnership develops into a match-winning one, like the 298 he and Haynes rattled up in their last Test against England, at Antigua a year ago. Sometimes, if the West Indian batsmen fall into a downward slide, they lose patience and are almost as liable to collapse as England - witness their first Test against Pakistan last November. If England can get an early breakthrough, they need to keep the tactical initiative, bowling with great thought and aggression to Viv Richards, the West Indies captain and Underwood's second (and more surprising) choice as a vulnerable West Indian batsman. Underwood thinks Richards has so much natural talent that 'he may have become just a little bit arrogant now,' resentful of setbacks, perhaps better at staging a brilliant individual stand of defiance than leading a team fightback. This is brave thinking, and Underwood admitted with a wry smile that 'Richards is always a danger and likely to score at least one, probably two hundreds in five Tests.' But he has his weaknesses: 'The old game is a great leveller.' England would be glad if fate chose to level out Test match fortune for them this summer, but if psychologically powered bowling is to be their main means of helping this happen, they need to arrange its use clearly. English fast bowling at the moment is limited to Devon Malcolm, a strike bowler of occasionally demonic form, who needs a partner in pace at the other end. Angus Fraser is not a pace bowler and it is misguided to try and use him as one. England would do better to give Martin Bicknell credit for taking more wickets last season than any other English bowler of fair pace except Neil Foster of Essex (ineligible since going on the unofficial 1989-90 tour of South Africa), Tim Munton of Warwickshire and Steve Watkin of Glamorganshire. If Bicknell does open the English bowling with Malcolm, he should do so not for one game but for the whole series, come what may - a vote of confidence such as few English players receive nowadays. Fraser should be used in the vital, difficult, fast-medium slot where he belongs, to take over from opening spells of speed. If he survives the intensive training and practice demanded by modern English cricket's fitness regime, he and Munton can generate enough refinements of length and movement to make them an effective fast-medium pair. Such a pair would be a great boost to English resources this summer - containing, frustrating and trapping West Indian batsmen keen to cut loose. It is not an easy task. West Indian batsmen have not looked seriously uncertain in English Test matches for over 20 years. The last time the West Indies lost a series in England was in 1969, when Gary Sobers' great side of the 1960s had broken up, morale had sunk and the corpus of 70s and 80s West Indian skill, which is now in its twilight years, had not yet been established. Presumably the main body of this summer's West Indian batting line-up, after the opening pair, will be drawn from Gus Logie, Brian Lara, Ritchie Richardson, Carlyle Best, Carl Hooper, Jeff Dujon and Viv Richards, who comes in anything from No 5 to No 7. Not an encouraging batting target for bowlers. Underwood says all England need do is convince themselves that they will win and, if that proves too much, give the impression that they believe they will win. After all, England won the first Test in the West Indies early in 1990, having lost 14 of their previous 15 Test matches in the West Indies. Nothing is impossible. Richardson has never yet managed to do his sparkling best in England; Dujon is said to be less nifty than of old behind the stumps, and, if only England's captain and selectors will take up their most exciting chance, few of the West Indian batsmen are used to playing high-class spin bowling in English conditions. Naturally, Underwood has clear ideas about this subject and they are ideas with appeal to anyone who finds the remorseles monopoly of speed in West Indies bowling claustrophobic. 'We need a specialist spinner, a canny one prepared to really use the ball, bowl it up and give it air. We should play Richard Illingworth. And a slow bowler who uses flight, if only there was one - Phil Tufnell, I suppose.' Now that would be real attack. Surprise is such an asset in attack and a battery of slow, guileful bowlers, undaunted by lifeless pitches or blistering batsmen, would be a surprise response to the one-track Caribbean bowling assault. England have nothing to lose. They can't do worse than they did in the last two blackwashes at home. They might as well set to work on building an attack against the odds. The first Test is the one that matters most. England should go out to bowl in it armed with some unusual weapons, aiming to unsettle the batsmen. I had to end by asking Underwood if England would beat the West Indies. He was careful, if not grim. 'They've got their work cut out,' he said.</p>

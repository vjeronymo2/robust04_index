			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PYLON SPELLS RELIEF TO POST-MODERNISTS  </P> <P> They used to call it post-punk. Now they call it post-modern. Call it post  office for all that matters. It's a sound both minimal and danceable, often  with surfy, scratchy guitar lines, funkified dance rhythms and personalized  vocal approaches.  </P> <P> These cerebral garage bands, like Britain's Gang of Four and New York's Bush  Tetras, seem to have had their day -- but save the last dance for Pylon. The  Athens, Ga., band, which re-formed last year after a few years off, played Club  Lingerie on Sunday, bringing the clean, clear sound of relief to ears clouded  with today's overblown murk and thud.  </P> <P> Singer Vanessa Hay's guttural screams, soothing coos and Road Runner sound  effects bring back the genuinely human, uncalculated eccentricity missing in  today's pop women -- the wan folk singers, the blow-dried rock vixens, the  aerobicized, lobotomized disco dollies. This larger-than-life Southern belle is  as original as the band's musical geometry.  </P> <P> With its steely guitars traveling at oblique angles through scenarios like  "Crazy" and "M-Train," Pylon proved itself not another retro-art college cult  group, but simply an unpretentious combo hooked into a primal thrill-ride pulse  that makes this one of America's great past, present and future rock bands.  Let's not lose them again. CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

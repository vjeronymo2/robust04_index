			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: US hopes tension in G7 will ease US OFFICIALS yesterday welcomed the German interest rate cut and the devaluation of the lira, which immediately took pressure off the dollar in foreign exchange markets, hailing the twin actions as 'a pretty good example of successful policy co-ordination.' 'They set a new direction, they send an extremely important message to the markets, which the markets have clearly received,' a senior US Treasury official said. The reduction in German rates is expected to ease the atmosphere of next Saturday's meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in Washington. 'A lot of the tension not only in the EMS but also within the G7 over a matter of great importance to the world economy has effectively been defused,' the official said. The US has for some time complained that German interest rates were too high and imperilled the prospects for world growth, but officials argued, nevertheless, that the Bundesbank was reacting more to signals from the slowing German economy than to international pressure. The dollar's recovery yesterday follows a period in which it slipped to historic lows against the D-Mark, and Treasury officials have had to counter the effect of remarks from President George Bush suggesting that he welcomed the US currency's weakness as a stimulus to exports. 'The movement of the dollar in this case was a residual effect of the tensions in Europe and not a judgment of any kind on the fundamentals of the US economy. We are not seeking a depreciation of the dollar,' the official said.</p>

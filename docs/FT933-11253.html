			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / People: TDG finds fourth finance director Alan Cole, chief executive of Transport Development Group, has found another finance director to replace Paul Kilduff who left in February after only seven months in the job. He is Stephen Bentley who moves from chemicals distributor Ellis &amp; Everard where he had been in the finance function for the past five and a half years. This is Cole's fourth finance director since he arrived at TDG three years ago. The first took early retirement and the second was promoted to look after TDG's troubled French operations. Bentley says he is 'aware of the changes' but that he also understands the reasons for them. Meanwhile Cole is cagey as to how he has attempted to avoid making another mistake: 'Both men (Kilduff and Bentley) are graduates, accountants and have been finance directors. You make the best choice you can at the time. Bentley comes with a good track record from a medium-sized company. What can I say?' The new man will not be short of a challenge when he arrives in early autumn. TDG recently announced it was closing its long distance French transport subsidiary at a cost of Pounds 11.7m. It is also trying to recover Dollars 15.8m of the monies due when it sold its US operation Willig Freight Lines to a consortium of senior management. Cole says the consortium has been trying to raise the money through 'a complicated bond issue', and has negotiated a new deadline for payment of September 31. A chartered accountant by training, 40-year-old Bentley spent nine years at Tricentrol, latterly as corporate finance and marketing executive. He moved to Ellis &amp; Everard when the oil company was taken over by Arco.</p>

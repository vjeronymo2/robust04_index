			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Personal View: How market testing is being undermined The market testing programme, which puts work done by civil servants out to tender, has now been running in the UK for almost one year. With the announcement today of the government's achievements in the first round, it is time to reflect on the progress of the programme to date, which many have found disappointing. The latest figures for departmental savings offer some limited encouragement from the purchaser's perspective. There has been a tendency, however, to focus on cost reduction without full consideration of the options available to improve the added value of service delivery. With few exceptions, policymakers and civil servants have demonstrated an inadequate understanding of the extent of the benefits that the private sector is able to offer and how these may be achieved. One of the central problems has been the use of public procurement techniques, borne of public sector item purchasing, which are wholly inappropriate to a programme that seeks to simulate the mechanism of market enterprise. Tenders are often framed in such a way that they severely restrict the scope for using entrepreneurial and forward-looking approaches to deliver greater savings. It is therefore almost impossible for suppliers to minimise reductions in staff numbers while still making an adequate return. The most typical approach has been for departments to draft detailed service specifications, based upon the current provision. Little regard is paid to the longer-term and higher objectives to be supported, to the alternative methods available to achieve them, or to the flexibility required for outsourcing - where specialist services are bought in from private companies  -to work in practice. By suppressing the scope for innovation and by limiting the benefit that industry is able to offer, these restrictive requirements undermine the central purpose of market testing. It is no coincidence that trade unions have explicitly advised their members involved in market testing to base their specifications on the existing set-up. Moreover, once translated into a binding contract, such stringent requirements can result in an increasingly inefficient and irrelevant service, without the flexibility to adapt to changing needs and advancing technologies. Indeed, a number of large outsourcing contracts in the US have failed precisely because of this problem. Potentially this is a political time bomb for the government. If problems do occur, they are likely to be in the mid-term of contracts let under this year's market testing round - that is, about the time of the next general election. The success of market testing for highly skilled professional services will also depend to a significant extent on the ability of government and private sector to secure the co-operation and commitment of existing personnel. At this early stage, no company will have replacement staff of equivalent capability ready to take over the running of the service. This begs the question of how to mitigate the inevitable frictions of the 'hostile takeover bid' scenario created when a defeated in-house team is expected to transfer to a winning company. Government could minimise the adversarial nature of the process between civil servants and the private sector by introducing a preliminary phase in the market testing process based upon benchmarking a proposal from the in-house team, perhaps in collaboration with a private sector partner, against industry best practice. Only where it is clear that outsourcing to the private sector will yield additional benefits should a competition for an external supplier be held - without an internal bid, leaving civil servants free to become actively involved in the market testing process and to form a co-operative, rather than adversarial, relationship with the private sector. Of course, for civil servants themselves the primary concern has been the effect of market testing on long-term employment prospects. Certainly in information technology, most civil service divisions realise that they are over-staffed. This is compounded by a progressive reduction in staffing needs throughout the IT sector as a result of technological change, and it is clear that redundancies are inevitable, irrespective of whether the services are outsourced or remain in-house. The government should not overestimate the ability of private companies to absorb public sector staff into their workforce, particularly in the current economic climate. Nor can departments expect to be shielded from the costs and responsibilities of reskilling and redundancies. Host companies will not want to act as the government's abattoir, taking on staff merely for the opportunity to fire them, even if subsidised to do so. It is critical that these problems are addressed before the momentum of market testing begins to fade. Otherwise there is a danger that the interest of private sector suppliers will diminish rapidly and the mechanism of competition will become correspondingly less effective. Market testing is an important initiative which could provide substantial improvements in the value for money of public services. To achieve its full potential, however, private sector involvement should not be based merely on participation in individual tenders, but on the formation of long-term, strategic partnerships with the civil service.

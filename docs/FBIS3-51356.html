Menem, who described the environment as the key issue facing  humanity, said global action was crucial to turn the current  tide of depletion of natural resources.    "Little by little, the era of wars is being overcome, we owe  it to ourselves now to leave behind the wars against nature,  which are also wars against us," Menem told delegates to the  19th general assembly of the World Conservation Union (IUCN).    Among its immediate plans for environmental action,  Argentina  will upgrade its federal Environment Secretariat to ministerial  rank and create a new 70,000-hectare natural reserve in San Juan  province, Menem announced.    The "El Leoncito" reserve will provide protection to several  ecosystem and will be run by the National Parks Administration.  Menem noted the reserve's creation would mark the 90th  anniversary of the country's first national park, Nahuel Huapi.    Describing the environment as a priority on his agenda,  Menem  said plans to create a ministry in charge of the environment  would be crystallized after the much-vaunted reform of the  National Constitution.    The IUCN assembly -- an event held every three years --  brings together delegates from over 800 governments, state  agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from some 125  countries for a 10-day marathon of special seminars, plenary  debates and workshops.    Menem described the current assembly in Buenos Aires, the  largest gathering of world environmental leaders since the  United Nations Earth Summit in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, as "a  unique opportunity to start generating a model for civilization  that will maintain the harmony of the planet."    "Ecology is not only one of the issues attracting the  interest of the world, it is the main issue that humanity should  be taking care of," said Menem.    Delivering the keynote address at the assembly's  inauguration, outgoing IUCN President Sir Shridath Ramphal  placed the stress of today's environmental problems on the  issues of consumption and population, undergoing the weaknesses  of the Earth Summit.    The Rio summit produced two international conventions and a  detailed plan for action, known as Agenda 21.    "The silence guilt, a forlorn hope that if decisions can be  deferred long enough and solutions sought in other directions,  changing the lifestyles of the rich may not after all be  necessary. But silence does not change reality," Sir Shridath  declared. [passage omitted]</p>

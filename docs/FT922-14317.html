			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Health authority breakaway on pay WEST Cumbria Health Authority has broken away from nationally agreed pay rates for healthcare assistants, a new grade of National Health Service workers drawn from nursing auxiliaries. It has agreed contracts that give 218 healthcare assistants on skills-based contracts a 7.3 per cent pay increase. The nationally agreed increase for nursing auxiliaries this year is 5.4 per cent. The authority wants to get away from the national Whitley Council terms and conditions as quickly as possible.</p>

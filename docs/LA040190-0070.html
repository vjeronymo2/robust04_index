			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS DIAMOND BAR;  </P> <P> YEAR-OLD CITY FACES ITS 2ND COUNCIL VOTE  </P> <P> Just one year after voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood and elected their  first City Council, candidates are at it again, canvassing neighborhoods and  shopping centers.  </P> <P> This year, with the cityhood debate settled, nine candidates running for three  council seats are promising everything from traffic signals to narcotics  patrols to limits on apartment and condominium construction in Los Angeles  County's newest city.  </P> <P> The candidates include two incumbents, John Forbing and Gary Werner, and  challengers Gregory Gaffney, Cleve Holifield, Jay Kim, Thomas Ortiz, Jim Paul,  Garry Stitt and Bryan Thomas.  </P> <P> Forbing, 47, said the council has done a "good job in the first year. I feel  I'm more qualified now than when voters first elected me to the council."  </P> <P> Forbing, an agent for the State Farm Insurance Cos. in Pomona and a former  board member for the Walnut Valley Unified School District, pointed to Diamond  Bar's budget, which has a $750,000 surplus for the 1989-90 fiscal year, as one  indication that the council has exercised good local government while keeping  costs at a minimum.  </P> <P> That was accomplished, he emphasized, even though the city has been operating  without $1.2 million in property taxes. Because of a technicality related to  the date of its incorporation, the city is barred from receiving property tax  revenues during fiscal year 1989-90. The Legislature is considering a bill that  would give Diamond Bar the money.  </P> <P> Forbing is going after votes from people who don't normally turn out for City  Council races. Last year, 38.8% of 24,500 registered voters participated in  Diamond Bar's election. This year, telephoning residents at random, Forbing's  campaign committee learned that "many didn't even know there was an election  coming up," he said. Forbing said he is sending those people absentee ballots.  </P> <P> Werner, 39, former head of the city's Incorporation Committee, said: "The  cityhood issue is now behind us. Now it's a matter of forming a strong local  government."  </P> <P> Werner, owner of Community Development Consulting Services, said the City  Council must expedite street and freeway improvements that will bring sound  commercial development to Diamond Bar. In addition, he said, the city should  increase its efforts to crack down on drug traffic and gangs.  </P> <P> Werner, who finished third in the 1989 election, is planning to quadruple his  campaign war chest this year. His goal is to spend $17,000, compared with  $4,000 for his first council bid. Forbing is budgeting $12,000, compared with  the $10,700 he spent last year.  </P> <P> "I've got more to protect this time," Werner said.  </P> <P> Gaffney, 27, a data-base administrator at AST Research Inc. in Irvine, said his  main concern is crime, especially car thefts.  </P> <P> "The rate is going up tremendously," he said. Gaffney, who is vice president of  the Diamond Bar Improvement Assn., said he would also encourage the formation  of additional neighborhood watch programs. Gaffney finished 19th in the council  election last March.  </P> <P> Gaffney criticized Councilmen Paul Horcher and Gary Miller, who have sought  higher office, saying: "We need some individuals who are going to be here for  the long haul."  </P> <P> Miller, who lost a special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by  the resignation of William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), is not running for  reelection. Horcher, whose council term expires in 1992, is running for the  Assembly seat of Frank Hill (R-Whittier), the Republican nominee for Campbell's  seat.  </P> <P> While other candidates have been hesitant to openly criticize city government,  Holifield, 56, strongly objects to the council's ousting of Horcher from his  post as mayor pro tem. Horcher was removed after a falling-out with Miller  during the state Senate race. Horcher, who was supporting Hill in the race, had  accused Miller of conflict-of-interest violations.  </P> <P> Holifield, a project engineer for General Dynamics Corp. in Pomona, also is  running for the second time. He said a good track record of community service  has won him the support of his colleagues.  </P> <P> He was on Diamond Bar's Municipal Advisory Council from 1984 to 1989 and was  chairman four years. In 1989, he ran unsuccessfully for the school board in the  Pomona Unified School District.  </P> <P> Last year, Holifield received the seventh-highest number of votes and spent  only $400 -- "the most votes for the dollar," he said. This time, he has set a  ceiling of $3,000 for campaign expenditures.  </P> <P> Kim, 50, is on the other end of the spectrum when it comes to campaign  spending. He said he has budgeted $25,000, including $10,000 of his own money.  </P> <P> Kim, owner of Diamond Bar-based Jaykim Engineers Inc., said his extensive  background in city planning and traffic issues, including serving as city  engineer and traffic engineer in several cities, would benefit Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> If elected, Kim said, his top priority would be construction of the Tonner  Canyon Parkway, proposed to run north-south through Orange and San Bernardino  counties. The road, part of the settlement of a suit between San Bernardino and  Diamond Bar, is expected to siphon off traffic from Grand Avenue.  </P> <P> Kim said he would support the establishment of joint benefit assessment  districts to pay for the road, though some residents are against that  financing. Such districts pay for public works projects by assessing developers  or homeowners. "That's what people are upset about," he said, "but I don't  think the city has any choice."  </P> <P> Ortiz, 55, a retired Santa Ana police officer and chairman of Diamond Bar's  Traffic and Transportation Committee, said each council member "should have a  different personality, so you have five different ways of thinking."  </P> <P> Ortiz, who ran for the council last year, said he wants to limit the apartments  and condominiums in Diamond Bar and to increase the number of sheriff's  patrols.  </P> <P> "I don't want to see graffiti, gangs and prostitution," he said. "I want safety  for everyone who lives in Diamond Bar."  </P> <P> Ortiz's largest donation comes from his daughter's and son-in-law's employer,  Carl N. Karcher, chairman of Carl Karcher Enterprises, which owns Carl's Jr.  restaurants. Karcher contributed $1,000 to the campaign. Ortiz said he plans to  spend $5,000.  </P> <P> Paul, 49, is campaigning on a platform of "no special interests." The retired  Los Angeles County paramedic said he is not soliciting contributions and has  even turned down offers by two local businesses to give money to his campaign.  </P> <P> Paul also said he strongly supports a bill submitted by Rep. David Dreier (R-La  Verne) that would redraw U.S. postal boundaries so that cities wouldn't have to  share ZIP codes. Currently, residents and businesses in northwest Diamond Bar,  including Paul, share the 91789 ZIP code with Walnut and must use a Walnut  mailing address.  </P> <P> City officials, learning that sales tax revenue from those businesses was  accidentally diverted to Walnut, lobbied Dreier to submit legislation to  rectify the situation.  </P> <P> Stitt, 39, a sales specialist for RJR Nabisco Group and a member of Diamond  Bar's Parks and Recreation Commission, said he wants to control the spread of  commercial projects in the city.  </P> <P> "I'm not really anti-development," he said. "It's just that we have so many  Italian places, so many pizza places. We need to take time and maybe just slow  the development down. We need a chance to breathe."  </P> <P> Stitt, a 20-year resident of Diamond Bar, considers himself "a dark-horse  candidate" because he isn't one of the five who ran last year and because he  has fewer contacts in the business community than other contenders. "But I'm  giving it my best shot."  </P> <P> Thomas, 21, a senior at Cal Poly Pomona, is probably the least visible  candidate.  </P> <P> He said he "started out with a lot of enthusiasm" but was distracted by the  demands of a full class schedule and round-the-clock business commitments. He  said the only campaigning he's had time to do is among fellow students, and he  won't be able to make it to any of the five candidate forums.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, I've had to let the campaign slide," Thomas said in a telephone  interview. "I'm kind of bummed about that. It's been kind of a halfhearted  effort."  </P></p>

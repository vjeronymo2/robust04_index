			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Mixed response to rice subsidies The unexpected return of the Liberal Democratic party to power in Japan and the rise of the Social Democratic party has been welcomed by many in the country's farming lobby wanting to reinstate previous cosy ties with the government. Last week the ruling coalition decided to raise rice subsidies by 70 per cent from the previous year to Y28.5bn (Pounds 187m) and to maintain the state purchase price of rice at some Y273 per kilogram, several times the world average. The move has widely been regarded as a step backward in the push for a more efficient farming sector and has triggered criticism from business leaders and bureaucrats urging farming reform. 'That the reform effort seems to be turning back is worrying,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of Nikkeiren, a leading business group. For more than 40 years, Japanese farmers have been sheltered from market forces and protected by government subsidies. The powerful rural vote, and the cultural and emotional links among Japanese to agriculture, have helped maintain the structure. The smaller population of rural constituencies gave farmers a bigger voting power, meaning they received subsidies as long as they pushed politicians hard enough. The LDP and SDP have more rural seats than members of the reforming multi-party coalition which they ousted in the past month. The new government yesterday said the release of a report on farm policy originally planned for this month would be delayed until mid-August because of administrative reasons. Mr Taichiro Okawara, agriculture minister, called for support of Japan's agriculture by ensuring that enough finances are allocated to helping farmers cope with the impact of cheaper imports. Such government policies in turn have helped maintain postage-stamp paddies on the hillsides while forcing consumers to pay exorbitant prices for the rice. However, younger politicians representing urban constituencies and industrial leaders have criticised such policies. The Keidanren, the business leaders' federation, has been calling for deregulating rice distribution and cutting food prices by lowering direct subsidies and the state purchase price. Agriculture ministry officials are also trying to push farm reform before the full-fledged liberalisation of the Japanese rice market due in 2000 under the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Partial opening of the market to foreign imports under the trade agreement is scheduled to start next year. The ministry released a policy report in 1992 calling for consolidation of rice paddies to create bigger and more efficient rice farms. It has also been looking to increase the competitiveness of domestic rice by deflating the artificially high rice prices.</p>

Proper maintenance includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.1008  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> In-use compliance provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Effective with respect to nonroad vehicles, equipment, and engines manufactured during model years 1996 and after:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the Administrator determines that a substantial number of any class or category of engines, although properly maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout their recall period (as defined under &sect;89.104&hyph;96(b)), the Administrator shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the engines with respect to which such notification is given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such engines which are properly used and maintained will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the manufacturer disagrees with such determination of nonconformity and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of engines shall be given to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and subsequent purchasers (if known) in such manner and containing such information as required in subparts H and I of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)(i) The manufacturer shall furnish with each new nonroad engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under &sect;89.109&hyph;96.

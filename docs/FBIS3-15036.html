This is set out in the  statement from the information and public relations center of  Russia's General Procuracy. It is noted in the report that the  investigation has not yet been completed of the circumstances  regarding the infliction of material damage, which, according to  the legislation, is subject to compensation by those who are  guilty of it. The investigation also needs to be completed  regarding individuals who took advantage of the situation that  had taken shape in Moscow from 21 September to 4 October 1933  and committed thefts, acts of violence, deliberate hooliganism,  and other breaches of the law.    The general procuracy stressed that if those amnestied take  the path of unlawful action again, it will use all the powers  granted to it by the law that has come into force where there  are conditions of unavoidable liability.</p>

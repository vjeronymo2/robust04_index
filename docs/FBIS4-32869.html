			<p>BFN     [Text] Military Police [PM] Major Ronaldo Silva of the 9th  BPM [Military Police Battalion] (Rocha Miranda District), whose  name had been included on the list of bribes paid by numbers  game kingpin Castor de Andrade, was killed the morning of 24  May. He was murdered by more than 15 machine-gun bullets in  Colegio District, in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. The PM  major was in his car and was attacked when he stopped at a  traffic light.    According to Lieutenant Colonel Paulo Cunha, commander of  the  9th BPM, the major had found a witness who could prove he was  not guilty of the charges being pressed against him and also had  discovered that his name had been unduly included on the list.    The courts on 24 May ordered that six of the eight numbers  game kingpins serving their sentences in the Vieira Ferreira  Neto Institute Penitentiary be transferred to another jail. The  decision resulted from irregularities that had occurred at the  institute, where the criminals continued to control the  irregular game via the phone. The six criminals will be sent to  three different penitentiaries.</p>

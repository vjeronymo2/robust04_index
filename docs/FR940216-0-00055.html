			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received comments from two industry groups representing the refining industry on this issue. Both commenters stated that EPA should require that ``early-use'' complex model gasolines subject to different baselines be segregated through the gasoline distribution system. EPA is adopting this suggested approach as the best (and perhaps only) means of accommodating both the restricted early-use option and downstream enforcement of per-gallon minimums and gasoline quality surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this approach, gasoline sampled at any point in the distribution system would have known values for VOC, toxics, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance that meet the per-gallon and minimum standards. Today's rule requires that these values must be included in the product transfer documents for ``early-use'' complex model gasoline, to inform downstream parties and EPA of the relevant per-gallon and minimum values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule prohibits the commingling throughout the distribution system, including at retail outlets, of ``early-use'' complex model gasoline that is subject to different baselines. One commenter stated that the segregation of this gasoline should be through the terminal level only. EPA disagrees with this comment because segregation through the retail level also is necessary in order for gasoline quality surveys to function. Survey samples are taken at retail outlets, and the survey requires that the relevant per-gallon values for VOC, toxics, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance must be known for each sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA realizes that restrictions on commingling of ``early-use'' complex model gasolines constitutes a significant constraint on the use of this option, because most gasoline used in the United States is transported as a fungible commodity. As a result, EPA anticipates that before 1998 the complex model will be used only in limited situations. This might occur where a refiner has a gasoline transportation system that is dedicated from the refinery through the retail level, or where the cost advantages of using the complex model are sufficiently large to offset the difficulties of segregation. In spite of these constraints, EPA sees no alternative to requiring segregation controls over ``early-use'' complex model gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV. Complex Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complex model described in this section has undergone significant changes since it was first proposed in the February 1993 NPRM. These changes have been made in response to three key factors: EPA's improved understanding of the relationship between fuel characteristics and emissions, EPA's use of more appropriate data analysis methods, and comments received in response to the February NPRM, a public workshop held on May 25, 1993, and EPA's July 14, 1993 docket submission that described a number of alternative complex models. The key elements in the complex model being promulgated today are discussed in this section. This discussion also addresses the major substantive comments received by EPA regarding the complex model. A more detailed description of the model and its derivation, including a detailed summary and analysis of comments, can be found in Section IV of the RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

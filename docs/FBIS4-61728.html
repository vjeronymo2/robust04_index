			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Time for Reforms in KGB"] </F>   [Text] The State Committee for State Security [KGB] has  held a meeting with the KGB top managing and field leadership to  discuss the enactment of the new KGB structure and staff.    As KGB Chief Henadz Lavitski stated, the aim of the reforms  is to bring the KGB in line with its goals, its time demands,  and to break decisively with its atypical functions.    Currently, KGB activities include conducting intelligence  and  counterintelligence, and providing power and management bodies  with information necessary for making state decisions. The KGB  will directly participate in the implementation of a state  anticrime program by coordinating its activities with other  Belarusian law enforcement agencies, strictly keeping within the  framework of their competence and the acting legislation.</p>

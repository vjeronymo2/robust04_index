			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed P.H.D.: "Air Force -- Operation White Paper"] </F>   [Text] The defense white paper published one month ago is  already starting to spark reform. The Air Force, in line with  the document's guidelines, has just started to reorganize its  command structure. The goal is to draw a clearer distinction  between the responsibilities for conducting operations and the  so-called organic responsibilities of preparation and troop  support. From now on there will be two operational commands and  five organic commands.    The operational commands will be:    -- The Strategic Air Force (FAS), directed by Air Corps  General Roger Mathieu;    -- The Air Defense and Air Operations Command (CDAOA), still  directed by Air Corps General Francois Vallat, which will lead  defensive and offensive air operations.    The five organic commands will be:    -- The Combat Air Force (FAC), replacing the Tactical Air  Force (FATAC) but with the same mission responsibilities,  commanded by Air Corps General Bernard Nortain;    -- The Projection Air Force (FAP), which will take over from  the Military Air Transport Command (COTAM), directed by Air  Division General Alain Bernier;    -- The Academy Command, directed by Air Corps General Pierre  Warme;    -- The Air Commandos Command (no longer just a group)  directed by Colonel Michel Chabot;    -- The Air Command for Surveillance, Information, and  Communication (CASSIC), which will bring together at  Villacoublay the former Transmission Command and the organic  section of the former Air Defense Command.</p>

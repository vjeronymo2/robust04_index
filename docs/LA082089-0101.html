			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REST OF WEST RALLIES, THEN LOSES, 12-8, TO VANCOUVER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills West went into Saturday night's American Legion Northwest  regional tournament game with a singular purpose -- to survive the game and  take its chances in the championship round today.  </P> <P> With six West players in the grandstands because of a suspension for curfew  violation early Saturday morning, what was left of West lost to Vancouver,  Wash., 12-8, Saturday night at Lewis-Clark State College.  </P> <P> Most of it was attributable to an exhibition of single-mindedness by Vancouver.  </P> <P> Vancouver used six singles in the third inning to score six runs and appeared  poised to hand West its first defeat of the tournament.  </P> <P> West will play the winner of today's 4:05 p.m. game between Vancouver and  Lewis-Clark for the championship at 7:35 tonight. The six suspended players  will be reinstated for tonight's game.  </P> <P> Lewis-Clark defeated Meridian, Ida., 10-9, Saturday. Vancouver (45-19),  Lewis-Clark and West all enter today's games with 3-1 records in the  double-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be very hard to regroup," West Coach Gary Gibson said.  "Everybody will be back and believe me, these guys want it pretty bad."  </P> <P> Despite the absence of the suspended players, West nearly pulled off an upset.  After trailing, 7-1, West rallied to within 7-6, spurred by the play of  reserves such as outfielder Gregg Sheren, who was three for four with four runs  batted in.  </P> <P> "I think all of us played our hardest," said Sheren, whose chin was cut open  and whose mouth was ringed with dirt after a headfirst slide into second base.  </P> <P> West (33-6) scored four runs in the top of the seventh to cut the Vancouver  lead to 7-6.  </P> <P> Paul Geller and Ryan McGuire singled to open the inning, but McGuire was gunned  down at second trying to stretch his hit into a double. Jason Cohen drove in  Geller with a single to left to make it 7-3.  </P> <P> Bobby Kim followed with a single to right, Cohen moving to third. Greg Lederman  walked to load the bases for Sheren, who then drilled a single into left-center  to score Cohen and Kim, cutting the Vancouver lead to two runs and driving Pat  Lamonica from the game.  </P> <P> Lederman made it 7-6 when he scored on an RBI ground out by Jeff Marks.  </P> <P> Vancouver answered with a run in the bottom of the seventh on a single by  Shaniko Ristau, a sacrifice bunt and a single by Travis Moore. The Cardinals  added four runs in the eighth.  </P> <P> The West starting battery also included left-handed catcher McGuire, who spent  Saturday afternoon trying to locate a mitt to wear. It was his first appearance  behind the plate since he was 12 years old. McGuire was unaffected in the  batter's box, throwing in three hits over the first seven innings to give him  seven in the tournament.  </P> <P> West had only one reserve on the bench, right-handed pitcher Lance Gibson, who  is expected to start today. The six players who were suspended were not allowed  to dress for the game and watched from the stands.  </P> <P> West, which had 15 hits, took a 1-0 lead in the second, taking advantage of two  Vancouver errors. Kim led off with a bunt to third, but Vancouver first baseman  Troy Flynn missed a throw from Lamonica, Kim taking second. Lederman then  reached first on third baseman Don Slattery's throwing error, Kim moving to  third on the overthrow.  </P> <P> Sheren gave West a run with a liner off the wall in left, scoring Kim. Marks  and Chris Teich struck out and Lamonica retired Ricky Banuelos on a looper to  short to end the threat.  </P> <P> But the lead evaporated in the third when Vancouver rattled West right-hander  Geller (0-2) by sending 11 batters to the plate, seven of whom singled.  </P> <P> Vancouver leadoff man Scott Rabitoy opened the inning with a single to left and  Steve Ramos followed with a single to center. Rabitoy was forced at third by  Flynn, who reached base when West third baseman Lederman threw the ball away at  first.  </P> <P> The hit parade then began in earnest.  </P> <P> Derek Schafte, Slattery, Ristau, Brian Knight and Jeff Stephenson all had  consecutive singles to give Vancouver a 5-1 lead. The sixth run scored when  Lamonica grounded to Teich at first, who bobbled the feed to Geller covering  the bag.  </P> <P> Geller, who moved back to his more customary position at second base to open  the fourth inning, allowed six runs on nine hits, walked none and struck out  one. Five runs were earned.  </P> <P> West added an unearned run in the fifth to cut the deficit to 7-2.  </P></p>

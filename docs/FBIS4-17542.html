			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- The State Duma today requested  that Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin reconsider the  expediency of holding joint Russian-American command and staff  exercises in July 1994 on the Totskoye training ground in  Orenburg Oblast, "given the social and political situation in  the country and the crucial stage we are at in the process of  working out an all-Russian concept of civil accord." This  address was made in a resolution by the lower house of the  Federal Assembly.    The same document recommends that the foreign and defense  ministries of the Russian Federation reconsider the expediency  of having talks on joint maneuvers, with Russia's participation,  on the territory of one of the NATO countries.</p>

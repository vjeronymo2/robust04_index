			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Subchev commentary: "Show for Naive People"] </F>   [Text] Already for the fifth time, the Bulgarian  parliament served up to the voters its favorite show -- a  no-confidence vote in Professor Berov's cabinet. This is a show  because hardly anyone would seriously consider the possibility  of toppling the cabinet against the background of the existing  political situation.    The result again showed that except for the parliamentary  faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] which proposed  the no-confidence vote, and several independent deputies, all  other parliamentary forces firmly support the cabinet. This  means of course, that they do not want early elections.    There are two reasons causing this attitude.    First, no one, including those who proposed the vote, is  prepared for new elections. The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  is not yet ready with its political program, which is expected  to determine how leftist the party is. For its part the SDS has  not shaken the hangover caused by the fall of Filip Dimitrov's  cabinet, and is not sure whether the process of expelling  various members has ended. Hence, the SDS boldly attacks the  cabinet with no-confidence proposals, standing absolutely no  risk whatsoever that the proposals will be adopted. For its  part, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] is not even  sure that it can contend with the existing 4 percent minimum.    The second reason is of a purely personal nature. Many of  the current 240 deputies are not sure about their place in the  next election lists, or even whether they will figure in those  lists. Therefore, every additional month in the life of this  cabinet and parliament literally represents net profit for them.    Thus, the no-confidence votes are a pure show for naive  voters. However, it appears that they are fed up with this show.</p>

Drawing the initial configuation takes several  minutes when designing products using CAD. This program will  reduce that time to several seconds, thereby lessening the  burden of design.    Consumer electronics products, such as vacuum cleaners and  rice cookers, get their basic shape on a screen when CAD brings  together the parts necessary for the product to function and  then adds design on top of that. This program automatically  draws the initial configuration that is the basis for design.  The program shows a solid representation using virtual reality.  This makes it easier to see the product's image.    This program uses a three-dimensional (3D) mouse to arrange  the parts of the product shown using virtual reality. First it  draws in space the right-angled parallelipeds that cover all the  parts, then it divides those into tetrahedrons. The initial  configuration is drawn through a process of successively erasing  from right-angle parallelipeds to tetrahedrons.    For example, for a camera the lens, body, and other parts  necessary for functioning are arranged in space. Restrictions  are set so that kirikomi won't be dull, rectangular  parallelipeds won't be cut into two, etc. When the program is  used under these conditions it is possible to display the  initial configuration necessary for the camera to function.    Usually a designer uses CAD to impose design on this initial  configuration. Currently initial configurations are drawn using  CAD. This is a problem because it takes several minutes and  forces designers to do work outside their specialty. However,  this program displays the initial configuration in about two  seconds. It increases efficiency and allows designers to focus  on creative activities.    The group plans to disseminate this program because it is a  very practical program which even allows for changing parts in  the initial configuration. However, the group intends to revise  the program so it can draw curved lines so the initial  configuration needn't be made up mainly of straight lines.</p>

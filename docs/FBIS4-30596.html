			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The government will  continue to make efforts to open Japan's markets following the  release Tuesday [28 June] of a package of deregulatory measures  aiming at expanding domestic demand and boosting imports,  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said.    Kakizawa told a press conference the Foreign Ministry will  explain the package to the United States, the European Union and  other nations.    The package, a detailed version of portions of a  market-opening program released in March, contains 279  deregulatory steps prepared by the government's administrative  reform promotion headquarters.    Kakizawa said the latest package meets some of the demands  made by other countries.    Japan pledged to come up with deregulatory measures before  the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations  in July.</p>

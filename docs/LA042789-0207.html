			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BONN TO RESCIND INVESTMENT TAX  </P> <P> West Germany will halt an unpopular tax on investment earnings July 1, just  four months after its introduction, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today.  </P> <P> In a major speech to Parliament on domestic and foreign policy, Kohl said West  Germany must tackle increased global competition to maintain its position as a  leading exporter.  </P> <P> "It is right that the experience of the last months makes some corrections  necessary," said Kohl. "The withholding tax will be abolished from July 1,  1989."  </P> <P> The 10% levy, imposed in January and deducted at the earnings source, has  prompted many West German investors to shift funds to countries such as  Luxembourg, weakening the usually strong mark.  </P> <P> The tax would have earned the state $2.3 billion this year.  </P></p>

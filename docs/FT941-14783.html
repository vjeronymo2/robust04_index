			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Iran gas deal eludes Italian consortium A L2,000bn (Pounds 791m) plan by an Italo-Japanese-Russian consortium to develop Iran's South Pars gas field has fallen through because Sace, the Italian export credit guarantee organisation, has refused to cover the deal. Roughly half the contract was to be carried out by Italian companies led by Saipem, the engineering and pipeline subsidiary of Eni, the state oil concern. The Japanese and Russian partners included Mitsubishi and Machinoimport. Together they have failed to come up with the required 85 per cent of the financing, and the National Iranian Oil Company, responsible for the remainder of the funds, has dropped the project - at least temporarily. Sace declined to extend further cover to Iran, where its current exposure is over L6,000bn. The collapse of the deal underlines the changing role of Sace in providing cover for large overseas projects in countries with political risk. In the past Sace has been a passive arm of Italian foreign and industrial policy. The organisation was especially used to backing big engineering/public works contracts in countries from which Italy imported oil and gas. Particular beneficiaries were state-owned groups in the Iri holding company and subsidiaries of Eni. Within the past year, Sace's management has been shaken up following the involvement of senior executives in corruption scandals. In tandem the organisation has moved to impose tougher risk criteria and expand its three categories of country risk to five in line with other EU members. Effective control has moved to the treasury. The politically-controlled committee supervising its activity, Cipes, has been abolished as part of the Ciampi government's reform of public administration.</p>

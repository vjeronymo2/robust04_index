			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Big Improvement in Italian Balance </F> of Payments"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- Italy's balance of payments  showed a surplus of 4.056 trillion lire (2.55 billion dollars)  for the first four months of the year compared to the figure of  2.635 trillion (1.66 billion dollars) in the red at the end of  the same period last year.    The Italian Exchange Office, UIC, reported today that for  April alone, there was a deficit of 202 billion lire (127  million dollars) and then compared this figure with the deficit  of 3.478 trillion (2.19 billion dollars) run up in the same  month in 1993.    According to data provided by the UIC, overall reserves held  by the Bank of Italy came to the value of 91.488 trillion lire  (57.54 billion dollars) at the end of April.    The surplus for the January-April period was produced by a  deficit of 2.351 trillion in capital movements and a surplus of  6.407 trillion under the headings of current accounts and  commercial credits. These items for April alone were minus  4.777 trillion lire and plus 4.575 trillion lire.    Following is a table of comparisons between April 1993 and  April this year and the two four-month periods, in trillions of  lire (one trillion equal to 628.93 million dollars):    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |April '93     |April         |'94 Jan-Apr   |'93 Jan-Apr '9|  |              |              |              |              |4             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |capital movem-|- 1.662       |- 4.777       |+ 14.165      |- 2.351       |  |ents          |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |current accou-|- 1.816       |+ 4.575       |- 16.800      |+ 6.407       |  |nts/commercia-|              |              |              |              |  |l credits     |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |total         |- 3.478       |- 202         |- 2.635       |+ 4.056.      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      On the capital movements front, there was a strong outflow  of  capital in April of 5.895 trillion lire net which included  foreign disinvestment valued at 4.231 trillion and loan  reimbursements which came to 1.756 trillion.    Over the first four months of the year, however, foreign  investments rose to the value of 59.413 trillion lire (37.37  billion dollars) to put this item in surplus. Outbound Italian  capital in April roughly equalled foreign capital disinvestment  at 2.460 trillion lire with new loan outlays at 2.368 trillion.    The movements of bank capital in April came only to 1.118  trillion lire because special credit institutes cut their  foreign indebtedness by 2.064 trillion. At the end of April,  the net foreign indebtedness of the Italian banking system came  to 136.780 trillion lire (83.03 billion dollars).</p>

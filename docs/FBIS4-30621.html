			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bandung, KOMPAS -- A total of 90 containers of  imported plastic waste are still lying idle at Tanjungpriok  Port, Jakarta. The government is currently making continuous  efforts to ship the containers back to the Netherlands -- their  country of origin.    Minister of State for Environment, Ir. [academic title]  Sarwono Kusumaatmaja stated this to the press in Bandung on  Wednesday 15 June. According to the minister, the government is  facing difficulties in trying to ship back the plastic waste  because the containers were smuggled into the country. The  Netherlands Government considered that it was not responsible  for the existence of the plastic waste in Indonesia.    Continuing, Minister Sarwono said the Netherlands Government  will accept the waste only if an official decision was endorsed  by the Netherlands Supreme Court. The court is currently  attending to the case in question. He said,"We hope that the  Netherlands Supreme Court makes an endorsement to take back the  plastic waste to the country."    The minister went on to say that should the Netherlands  Supreme Court refuse to accept the plastic waste, then Indonesia  will take alternative measures for the waste to be returned to  the country. Minister Sarwono said,"We will make our move  through political, diplomatic, and legal channels in the  International Court."    The minister also stated that the imported plastic waste had  probably entered the country through certain Dutch exporters who  had exploited the facilities afforded to them by the  authorities. However, the plastic waste could not have entered  Indonesia without the involvement of some local importers.    Sarwono said, "As a result of this, the North Jakarta High  Court is pursuing the case against two local industries that  imported the plastic waste."    He said, moreover, the continuing presence of the 90  containers of plastic waste at Tanjungpriok Port effected a loss  in income by the port because the area could not be leased out  to other companies. Apart from this, the whole location and  environment is subjected to the danger of being exposed to the  poisonous toxic substance.    Minister Sarwono explained, "Therefore, the loss in income  suffered by the port authorities will be included in the claim  when it is served on the Dutch and Indonesian industries."

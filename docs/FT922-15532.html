			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Pledge by Gould on County Hall use LABOUR said yesterday it was determined to use County Hall, the former home of the Greater London Council, as the headquarters of its proposed replacement for the GLC. That means a Labour government would exercise an opt-out clause in the contract selling the complex to the Osaka-based Shirayama Corporation. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said: 'We want to put the whole site to proper use in the public sector.' He indicated that the party expected to 'work closely' with the London School of Economics, which had hoped before the Shirayama deal to move from its present cramped accomodation to County Hall. The party intends to use the building to house its planned 'slimline' Greater London Authority, members of which are to be elected by proportional representation. Labour believes, however, that enough room would be left to put the building to additional public-sector use. Mr Gould said yesterday that Labour would exercise the clause permitting the Shirayama deal to be terminated up to the end of this year. He said the party had 'yet to see the detail of the agreement'. Shirayama, a family-owned property company, signed a contract last week to buy the complex on the south bank of the Thames from the London Residuary Body, the organisation responsible for winding up the affairs of the GLC. Shirayama intends to convert part of the complex into a hotel, with the rest being used for luxury flats and conference facilities. Mr Gould said the cost of establishing the GLA would be 'very slight' and might even yield a 'small saving to the taxpayer' from rationalising the budgets of the various bodies whose activities it would take over.</p>

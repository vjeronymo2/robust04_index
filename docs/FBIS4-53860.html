			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Japan Communist Party (JCP) Chairman Tetsuzo </F> Fuwa by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and  date not given]    [Excerpt] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition government. What do  you think of this?    [Fuwa] It did not split from the framework of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] politics. Last year, it was sucked into  the Hosokawa Cabinet, which took over LDP politics. Thereby,  the SDPJ introduced the single-seat constituency system and  liberated the rice market. The SDPJ never did soul-searching  for the things it did during the Hosokawa administration.  Moreover, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama signed the Hata  administration's policy agreement. Some of its members are  getting angry about the party's approach toward the LDP.  However, the SDPJ became an LDP-like opposition party. Birds  of a feather flock together. That is all.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What to you think of the Hata  administration?    [Fuwa] The administration, which became an overwhelming  minority in both houses, has no right to do something new. It  is common sense under the democratic system that it should  immediately hold a general election by dissolving the House of  Representatives.    Moreover, it became a minority as a result of its own  mistakes. The Hata administration forcefully tried to increase  the consumption tax and to enact a law to deal with an emergency  on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, it formed a new  parliamentary group to realize its intentions but contradictions  burst out. We will have some troubles unless we destroy their  dangerous intentions by holding a general election after  dissolving the House of Representatives. We will not allow them  to deal with the important issues without the people's consent.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the political style  of the "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa?    [Fuwa] It is impossible under the democratic system to have  a puppet government. Nobody has had such a political style  since the time of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. In this  sense, the Hata administration is worse than the Tanaka  administration because Hata himself knows that he is being  controlled.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano  resigned.    [Fuwa] He made remarks that are exactly the same as the  claims of the wartime government and military. Hata's  responsibilities for assigning such a person to the ministerial  post will not go away even after his resignation. The prime  minister himself should explain his views of the war.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the tax  and Korean peninsula issues, including North Korea's suspected  nuclear arms development?    [Fuwa] Since we are in a depression, we need to improve the  people's purchasing power. It is outrageous to talk about  increasing the consumption tax rate. They are talking about  finding a source of revenue to cover a shortfall from the tax  reduction. But, they increased the public utilities charges  before we could feel the effect of the tax reduction. Now they  are talking tax increase. It is not reasonable. They have to  give up the idea that "the consumption tax rate needs to be  increased because there is no other revenue source."    You mentioned the Korean peninsula issue. First of all, our  stand is to say that we need to wipe out all nuclear weapons in  this world. The Korean peninsula situation is always linked to  the issue of enacting laws to deal with emergencies. This is an  excuse to send the Self-Defense Forces abroad. It is very  dangerous to go along with U.S. sanctions against North Korea.  We are against it.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How about the prospect of dissolving the  House of Representative and holding a general election?    [Fuwa] It is difficult to predict because each party's  intentions are involved. However, I think we should do it  immediately. The public supports it, too. Some people are  saying that "we should redraw the single-seat electoral  districts in a hurry because we managed to change the election  system after all the troubles we went through." I think that  they are trying to do something unreasonable again. They should  not do that. It is reasonable to have an election under the  current system (medium-sized electoral district system)    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Japan Communist Party [JCP] changed  its stand and is now saying that a general election should be  held under the medium-sized electoral district system. Isn't  that correct?    [Fuwa] It is. The JCP is the party that was most opposed to  introducing a single-seat electoral district system. We are the  first to prepare ourselves for an introduction of the system.  However, the coalition became a minority government and  demolished this line by itself. They should aim at holding an  election under the medium-sized electoral district system if  they want to find out the people's intentions by dissolving the  House of Representatives. It is a matter of course. [passage  omitted]</p>

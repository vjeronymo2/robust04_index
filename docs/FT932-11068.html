			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Sharp rise in subscribers to Vodafone VODAFONE, the Newbury-based mobile telephone company, yesterday reported April as its best month for three years, further evidence from business that the recovery is under way. Vodafone added a net 18,766 subscribers to its network in April, its best month for new subscribers since May 1990. The total number of subscribers is now 856,000. A year ago the monthly tally for new subscribers was running at about 5,000 net. The number of customers cancelling their subscriptions has also continued to decline and is down to about one for every five new customers. For the first time since Vodafone introduced its low-user tariff - called LowCall - last October, the number of new subscribers opting for the full business tariff exceeded the number of new LowCall connections. Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, attributed the growth to 'the combination of support from the independent service providers, our marketing initiatives and the undisputed quality of the Vodafone network'. Figures for new connections by cable TV companies offering phone services also show strong growth in recent months. According to the Independent Television Commission, the first three months of the year saw an increase of a third in the number of residential and business lines, taking the total number of exchange lines installed to 143,660. The UK's electronics industry is seeing signs of recovery after two years of stagnant sales, Mr Cyril Teed, president of EEA, the electronics industry trade association, said last night. Speaking at the association's annual dinner he said new orders rose by 7 per cent last year and were now back at 1989 levels.</p>

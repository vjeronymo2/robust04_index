			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TROUPE PUTS LIGHTER SPIN ON 'RUMPELSTILTSKIN' YARN;  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S THEATER: THE LILLIPUT PLAYERS SLIGHTLY SOFTEN THE BROTHERS GRIMM  TALE IN A PRESENTATION BY ANAHEIM'S 'JUST FOR KIDS' PROGRAM.  </P> <P> What some dads won't do for their little girls. . . .  </P> <P> Here's the deal. It seems that dear old pop, eager to catch a royal husband for  his daughter, spins a wild yarn that could cost him his head. Things are  starting to look pretty, well, grim, when a mysterious dwarf appears to save  the day. Or does he?  </P> <P> Families can find out the answer to these and other mysteries tonight when the  Lilliput Players bring their touring production of the Brothers Grimm fairy  tale, "Rumpelstiltskin" to Anaheim's Pearson Park Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> "Our version is a little different from the classic story," explained Bill  Durkin, managing director of the 13-year-old children's theater troupe. "In the  original, the miller foolishly boasts that his daughter can spin straw into  gold, and the greedy king says she must do it or she will die. In ours, the  king isn't such a bad guy. He falls in love with the girl, and in order to  marry her off, the miller comes up with this story about the gold.  Unfortunately, the penalty for lying in the kingdom is death.  </P> <P> "So Rumpelstiltskin comes along, and for two nights, he helps the girl by  magically turning the straw into gold. But on the third night, he tricks her."  </P> <P> Founded in 1977, the Lilliput Players has presented its version of classic  children's stories to an estimated 1.5 million children and adults in more than  4,500 performances across Orange, San Diego, Los Angeles and Riverside  counties. This season, the troupe staged three children's works,  "Rumpelstiltskin," "The Pied Piper" and "Merlin" in about 350 schools, parks  and community centers.  </P> <P> The Lilliput Players' parent company is L.P. Repertory, which produced eight  seasons of family dinner theater at Fullerton's Muckenthaler Cultural Center  before opening its own permanent facility in Tustin in 1988. Financial  difficulties forced the site to close last month, but because the two  organizations operated independently, the demise of L.P. Repertory had no  impact on the Lilliput Players.  </P> <P> Tonight's performance of "Rumpelstiltskin" is part of the Anaheim Parks and  Recreation Department's "Just for Kids" program, an 11-week series of  children's theater, music and dance sponsored by Target Stores and the Anaheim  Arts Council. Admission to all Just for Kids events is $2 for adults and $1 for  children under 12 and seniors. Children under 3 are admitted free. Just for  Kids performances are at Pearson Park, 400 N. Harbor Blvd. (at Sycamore Street)  in Anaheim. All shows are at 7:30 p.m., except July 26.

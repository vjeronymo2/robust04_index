			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW: IGLESIAS SHEDS CASANOVA IMAGE  </P> <P> Julio Iglesias has a popular image as a sort of Latin George Hamilton, thanks  in part to pop hits of a few years ago such as the regrettable "To All the  Girls I've Loved Before," which is no longer part of his concert repertoire. To  see him live these days is to see something different altogether: In the best  moments of his show Thursday at the Pantages, Iglesias came off more in the  Sinatra mold circa "Only the Lonely," more Mr. Solitude than Mr. Casanova, a  quiet, intensely serious figure of studied isolation. Which only makes women  love him more, of course.  </P> <P> For an international romantic idol, his moves aren't all that smooth; they're  so subtle you almost need a motion detector to pick them out. As he sings of  broken love in relatively unbroken English as well as French and his native  Spanish, his hand balls into a fist, then arches, and his arm goes out to his  side, barely controlled, like Joe Cocker cast as a suave, jilted gigolo in  black tie. The lyrics may have been unintelligible to English-only attendees,  but the body language said: "Ouch."  </P> <P> If his performing style is nicely understated these days, so is his backing  band, which provides plenty of subtle Latin rhythms, dominated by synthesizer  washes. This is in sharp contrast to the unsubtle Disco Julio of a few years  back, whose unfortunate attempts at self-Americanization sold millions of  records to new Anglo fans but turned off a lot of old Latin ones. Happily,  there were few signs that this stop on his international tour was specifically  tailored for the American audience he once seemed desperate to court.  </P> <P> "Thank you for paying so much money tonight for the kids," Iglesias told the  ethnically diverse, sold-out house, referring not to baby-sitters, but to the  fact that half the proceeds from the show were earmarked to go through UNICEF  to primary health care projects throughout Latin America.

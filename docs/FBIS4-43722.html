			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Karl-Ludwig Guensche: "FDP Is a Danger for Kohl"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- According to the latest analyses of the  Dortmund opinion research institute Forsa, the FDP [Free  Democratic Party] is in danger of running afoul of the 5-percent  threshold in the Bundestag elections. Even though the liberals  are currently still getting 5 percent of the votes, the party is  in acute danger.    This assessment was given by Forsa chief Manfred Guellner to  DIE WELT. In his view, the FDP is developing into the sole  source of danger for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, since the Christian  Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] is constantly  rising in the voters' favor.    In Guellner's view, Chairman Klaus Kinkel is to be blamed  for  the problems. Before his election as party chairman, the FDP  had a stable nationwide reservoir of voters of about 9 percent.  Afterward, the party slid down to 5 to 6 percent. It has not  been able to make good this "negative Kinkel effect" again.    In particular, its attitude at the presidential elections  has  caused great damage to the FDP, according to Guellner. In the  week after Herzog's election, it fell to 3 percent all over the  country for the first time, because the voters no longer saw the  FDP's election behavior as an independent decision.    Forsa also gives bad marks to Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping. "Today, he is already  as weak as Oskar Lafontaine was in 1990 during the final stage  of the election campaign." In this respect, Chancellor Kohl  need not fear his challenger anymore.    According to the Forsa analysis, the decline of the SPD has  been caused by the bad presentation of Scharping's tax plans.  Guellner: "This was perhaps the decisive turning point from  which the SPD and Scharping have never recovered."    In contrast to his internal party rival, Gerhard Schroeder,  Scharping did not symbolize the competent SPD for the voters  that they wanted. This means: "Because Scharping is so weak,  Kohl is so strong again," the election researcher explains.    While the Greens get a stable 9 percent, according to  Guellner's polls, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] could  become the second surprise of the Bundestag elections, apart  from the FDP. After the European election, there are signs that  the successor of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] is  also gaining followers in the west. The PDS has "good prospects  to get three or more direct mandates." If the SPD grows even  weaker, the PDS could jump over the 5-percent threshold at the  national level, Guellner predicts.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLE COMMUTERS  </P> <P> In response to "White-Knuckle Commuting" (Part A, Jan. 28), I commend you for  printing the article to make the public more aware of how vulnerable  motorcycles actually are on roads. It was also informative on the various  statistics from several studies concerning helmet use and the need for rider  education.  </P> <P> The problem I have with the majority of Los Angeles publications is that they  rarely look at the benefits of motorcycles:  </P> <P> * They reduce traffic congestion.  </P> <P> * Following the San Francisco earthquake, motorcycles were the only motorized  vehicles that could move about freely, thus offering the only quick mode of  ground transport.  </P> <P> * They conserve a tremendous amount of fuel, thus saving resources for future  generations.  </P> <P> * They pollute far less of our air than any other form of motorized transport.  </P> <P> * They provide tremendous time savings to the motorcycle commuter.  </P> <P> The reasons I commute on a motorcycle are I save time and I enjoy riding.  </P> <P> DAVID FLIEHR  </P> <P> Santa Clarita  </P></p>

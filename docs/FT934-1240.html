			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Soldier killed during Guinea poll: Opposition has vowed to disrupt multi-party election Opposition militants protesting against Guinea's presidential election stabbed a soldier to death in the capital Conakry yesterday, the Interior Ministry said, Reuter reports from Conakry. Journalists said at least three civilians had been killed in clashes between supporters of the ruling party and the opposition, but ministry officials were not immediately able to confirm the reports. The opposition urged President Lansana Conte to postpone Guinea's first multi-party election, but when its plea fell on deaf ears it vowed to do all in its power to disrupt the poll, in which Gen Conte faces seven opponents. Witnesses said polling stations in Conakry's Hafiya district were burned down on Saturday night and those in Sangoya and Cig-Madina were attacked yesterday morning. State radio said voting was normal in the interior in the towns of Kindia, Koya and Boke, but there was no immediate word from the mining town of Kankan, a bastion of the Guinean People's Assembly (RPG), the oldest opposition movement. The centre of Conakry, a centre of support for Gen Conte's Party of Unity and Progress (PUP), was calm. Guinea has never had a real election since independence from France in 1958. Until he died in 1984, Guinea was run as a one-party police state by President Sekou Toure. The Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists said last Wednesday it had cancelled plans to monitor the election because it was not satisfied with arrangements. Vehicle traffic apart from essential services was barred in Conakry from midnight but residents said troops were out in force at 6pm. Gen Conte took over in a 1984 coup and only agreed to multi-party politics under foreign and domestic pressure. Scores of people have died in violence since May.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, 30 Jan (INA)--Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the  Iranian National Resistance Council, has strongly condemned the  statements made by the so-called Hasan Ruhani, secretary of the  so-called Iranian Supreme Council for National Security,  regarding the Iranian regime's plan to destroy rebel positions  abroad.    In a cable addressed to the UN secretary general as well as  the chairman and members of the UN Security Council, Rajavi said  that these impudent statements clearly show the regime's  intentions to launch military attacks on the bases of the  Iranian National Liberation Army, and to carry out terrorist  operations against resistance elements outside Iran--something  that reflects the exacerbation of domestic crises, as well as  increasing popular discontent with the regime's henchmen.    Rajavi urged the international community to enforce a  sweeping arms and oil embargo against the Iranian regime. He  indicated that a regime that advocates terrorism outside its own  borders should have no place among the international community  of nations.</p>

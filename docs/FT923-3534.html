			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology: Now that's fast - Fujitsu's new supercomputer is capable of 350bn calculations a second Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer company, is set to take a spectacular lead in the race to build the world's most powerful computers. Yesterday it announced a new supercomputer which it claims is more than 20 times faster than its nearest competitor, a staggering margin in a business where millions of dollars are spent to yield only a few percentage points' improvement in performance. The new machine makes extensive use of superfast chips fabricated in gallium arsenide, a substantial technical first for the Japanese manufacturer. Gallium arsenide chips are faster than silicon but are expensive and difficult to make. If the machine is as fast and as easy to operate as Fujitsu says, it will mean that for the first time the Japanese have a significant technological advantage over the American companies which have dominated the supercomputer market for the past 20 years. It will confirm the fears of US experts who three years ago predicted that Japan would have caught up with the best US companies by 1994 and lead the market by the turn of the century. The power of supercomputers is measured in terms of their ability to carry out arithmetical calculations - 'gigaflops' or billions of floating point operations a second. Fujitsu says its new machine, the VPP500, runs at a maximum of 355 gigaflops. By comparison, the fastest US-built commercial supercomputer, the Cray C90, runs at only 16 gigaflops. The Japanese company believes its new technology will enable it to build a computer capable of more than a thousand billion calculations a second (teraflops). Tadashi Sekisawa, Fujitsu president, said this week: 'We expect to offer 10 teraflops' performance before the end of the decade.' Computing power of this magnitude is hard to appreciate. The VPP500 is aimed at the so-called computational 'grand challenges' including global warming, drug development, seismic data processing, vehicle crash simulation and weather forecasting, problems which mean hours of processing time on the largest machines available today. Sekisawa says the new machine 'will permit scientists and engineers to tackle and solve hitherto unapproachable computational problems'. The company will begin shipping the new machines early next year; it believes it can sell 50 units over the next three years at between Dollars 10m and Dollars 50m a unit. But can the VPP500 fulfil the ambitious performance claims Fujitsu is making for it? Until the first systems are installed and running it is impossible to say, but experts warn that Japanese supercomputers have a reputation for running faster on paper than in the data centre. They point out that while peak speed may be impressive, overall performance when tackling real-life problems is often at a much lower level. Some supercomputers manage an average of only 5 per cent of their maximum speed on some problems. Cray Research has managed to hold its 63 per cent share of the world supercomputer market as much because of the quality of its software as the speed of its hardware. Fujitsu argues the novel design of the VPP500 guarantees sustained high-level performance. Supercomputers today typically get their speed from either vector processing, where the same mathematical operation is applied to strings of numbers, or parallel processing, where many processing units carry out calculations simultaneously. The new Fujitsu machine, however, combines the two approaches in a technology called 'vector parallel processing'. The VPP500 comprises from seven to 222 vector processors arranged in parallel. Each processor, which is about the size of a small suitcase, can deliver 1.6 gigaflops. The processors are linked together by a network through which data can be squirted at 800 Mbytes a second. The future of supercomputing is thought to lie in 'massively' parallel systems where hundreds or thousands of small, simple processors work together. They are powerful but difficult to program. The VPP500 uses a relatively small number of processors, each roughly equivalent to a conventional supercomputer. Programming is, therefore, fairly straightforward. The operating system is Fujitsu's version of Unix, UXP/VPP and the system supports Fortran 77, the standard scientific programming language. Fujitsu is introducing its new machine to a supercomputing world in turmoil. Cray Research of the US, a vector processing specialist, is still the market leader, but it no longer sets the agenda. It has been forced to introduce a less powerful, entry-level, model to compete with 'minisupercomputer' manufacturers, companies making machines which deliver much of the power of a supercomputer at a fraction of the cost. At the other end of the scale it has been forced to answer the challenge of massively parallel computer makers, among them companies as different as International Business Machines and the semiconductor manufacturer Intel. Cray is planning to launch next year its own design of massively parallel machine based on Digital Equipment's Alpha chip. The Alpha chip is the fastest available, but Digital has yet to demonstrate its ability to make the chip in quantity. Meanwhile Seymour Cray, designer of the world's first supercomputer, has run into trouble. As the driving force behind Cray Research until he established Cray Computer Corporation in 1989, he has had to scale back plans for the construction of the Cray-3, an innovative machine based on gallium arsenide chips and novel cooling techniques. His first  - and only - customer for the new computer, a US government laboratory, cancelled the order at the beginning of the year because of uncertainties over progress. Gallium arsenide chips run at about three times the speed of their silicon equivalents but they are tricky to manufacture. Fujitsu, one of the world's most skilled semiconductor makers, has managed to fabricate gallium arsenide chips for the VPP500 with 25,000 logic elements on each chip. It cools the system with nothing more complicated than air and water. The Japanese company has been in the supercomputer business since 1977, and today has 50 per cent of the Japanese market and 23 per cent of the world market.</p>

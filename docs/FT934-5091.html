			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Sick pay move worries companies - Employment benefits Employers' organisations and large companies expressed unease over changes to statutory sick pay, but gave a cautious welcome to the reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions. But, even though the government has increased the sick pay burden for large companies, industry warmly welcomed the implications of the package for small companies, which will benefit both from the sick pay changes and the NI reductions. The Institute of Directors said it was 'concerned' over the sick pay and NI arrangements which it believed would leave employers with a substantial administrative load. It said the cost of providing statutory sick pay might be met by the reduction in National Insurance costs, but added: 'This will do nothing to tackle the burden of complying with these changes.' It said it would have preferred incentives for employers to have used private health cover, offsetting the premiums against corporation tax. It did not believe the reduction in NI costs would be an incentive for companies to employ unskilled or semi-skilled workers: 'This is not a deregulatory Budget,' it said. The Engineering Employers Federation was also worried about the sick pay changes. 'I don't think our members will be happy as the burden is being passed to the private sector,' said Mrs Anne Minto, director of policy and practice. 'It also looks a bit inconsistent with the argument about maintaining competitiveness against European countries by reducing non-wage costs to employers,' she added. IBM (UK), the British subsidiary of the world's largest computer manufacturer, said it thought it would suffer more from the decision to stop reimbursing statutory sick pay than it would benefit from the reduction in NI contributions. British Steel said it was unable immediately to calculate what effects the sickness payment changes would have, but said they would encourage companies to act responsibly. 'We have already moved by becoming much tougher on sick payments,' it added. Mr Jim Yuill, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said the sick pay changes might stiffen the resolve of companies to monitor sickness more closely. 'Some companies have not been doing this as the government has picked up part of the tab.' However, even though the sick pay burden is shifted to large employers - which in this case means companies with more than about 12 employees - industry is unlikely to be too unhappy, he said. This is because the upper limit for employees' contributions has not been changed, so employers will not have to compensate employees for any extra payment. The CBI welcomed the fact that the chancellor has recognised that any increase in the sick pay burden for industry should be recompensed by changes in National Insurance contributions. It also pointed out that smaller companies would benefit doubly, first because they will receive full reimbursement of National Insurance bills after only four weeks of each statutory sick pay claim, compared with six weeks previously. Secondly, small companies proportionately employ more lower paid workers - earning less than Pounds 200 a week - than larger companies, it said. So they will benefit more from the reduction in the lower rates of National Insurance contributions by 1 percentage point.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sales surge at Indian carmaker over year Maruti Udyog, India's biggest carmaker and a flagship industrial enterprise, yesterday reported a 31.5 per cent increase in sales to Rs22.22bn (Dollars 708m) for the past 12 months, due to a sharp recovery in demand after two years of recession. Maruti, a joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki Motor of Japan, estimated pre-tax profits to have trebled to Rs1.36bn as the sales increase brought down unit production costs. The company has produced 158,000 vehicles in the year, mainly 800cc compacts based on a Suzuki model of the early 1980s. Maruti's performance highlights a steady recovery in Indian industry since last summer, particularly among makers of consumer goods. Carmakers have benefited from cuts in excise taxes and other government measures to boost industrial growth taken in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 budgets. Mr RC Bhargava, Maruti's chairman, said he was convinced that the company wasset for sustained growth in sales 'in view of what we have seen in the last two budgets'. Maruti expects to produce at least 181,000 cars in the next 12 months, including 13,900 vehicles of a new model called Zen, a modern compact, which will also be exported to western Europe. The company says it will complete by September a Rs7bn expansion of its assembly plant near Delhi to increase capacity by 70,000 cars a year. Maruti exported 17,200 cars in the year just ending, mainly to western Europe, up from 14,600, and plans to export 23,000 in 1994-95, including Zen vehicles.</p>

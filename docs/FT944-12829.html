			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Satisfaction guaranteed Design to Distribution (D2D), the ICL subsidiary which won this year's European Quality Award, attributes a fundamental improvement in its performance to total quality management. 'Quality management satisfies customers, reduces costs and motivates people,' says Alastair Kelly, managing director. TQM has helped D2D, a contract electronics manufacturer, achieve a 300 per cent increase in staff productivity since 1980 and save Pounds 2m a year from 'getting things right first time,' he says. But after 10 years of working on TQM, he emphasises that the technique is 'no quick fix'. D2D has gone through several stages of using TQM, in which it experimented with different techniques and addressed a succession of issues. The company had to reappraise its approach at one point. After many years of applying TQM and winning various awards, D2D had disappointing results in 1990 when it polled customers for their views. It found that many of their requirements had not been included in the company's evaluation model. As a result, it adopted the business model constructed by the European Foundation for Quality Management which encouraged it to take a more comprehensive approach to quality issues. As part of this, it tried to improve customer service by training staff and introducing a score-card system to allow customers to specify exactly what they needed. The EFQM model requires a company to assess itself on nine issues, namely leadership, policy and strategy, people management, resources, processes, customer satisfaction, people satisfaction, impact on society and business results. Many companies use this model for their own assessment purposes without putting themselves forward for the European Quality Award. Those companies which do go forward for the award prepare a report which is scrutinised by a six-member team of assessors; companies that are short-listed receive a site visit. The companies deemed to have demonstrated the highest standards of TQM are given a quality prize; the best is given the European Quality Award. This year's other prize winners were IBM SEMEA, which manages IBM operations in southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, headquartered in Italy, and Ericsson of Spain, a Spanish subsidiary of the telecommunications company. All applicants for the award receive a feedback report, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. For D2D, its assessment showed that it needed to improve its performance concerning its 'impact on society' and 'business results'. Winning the EFQM's award does not mean D2D can relax in its efforts to improve the quality of its business, says Kelly. 'It is a milestone but not the end of the journey,' he says. 'The moment we stop changing we start to die.' Brochures for self assessment and applications for the 1995 award are available from EFQM, Avenue des Pleiades 19, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kone close to finalising sale of cranes unit Kone, the Finnish elevators group, is close to finalising the sale of its cranes unit as part of its strategy of focusing on core business. The company is not identifying the buyer until discussions are complete. Kone Cranes is a world leader in industrial cranes and ship-to-shore cranes. Since it was formed in 1930, the operation has grown to span 40 companies in 20 countries. Analysts believe the unit could fetch up to FM1bn (Dollars 181m), although it is hard to value because the group does not specify profit figures for individual operations. Kone Cranes had sales of FM1.9bn in 1993, up 26 per cent.</p>

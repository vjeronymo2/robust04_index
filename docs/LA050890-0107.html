			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANDARD OF INSURANCE ROLLBACKS SUGGESTED;  </P> <P> PROP. 103: JUDGE'S RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD MEAN COMPANIES MIGHT NOT BE LIABLE TO  REBATE ANY OF THE 20% REDUCTION FROM 1987 RATE LEVELS.  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie on Monday released an administrative  hearing judge's official recommendations for a rate-of-return standard for  insurance companies that apparently would mean very few premium rollbacks for  California ratepayers under Proposition 103.  </P> <P> But even before consumer leaders began blasting the recommendations of Judge  William J. Fernandez, whose removal from the matter they already had demanded,  Gillespie tersely noted in a statement that she has up to 100 days to review  Fernandez's opinion and render her own decision on the standards involved.  </P> <P> Some department sources have indicated that Gillespie might make her decision  in as little as 30 days. The commissioner is under pressure because her  rollback decisions already have been delayed six months beyond the Nov. 8, 1989  deadline she had originally set for making them.  </P> <P> Fernandez, who presided over months of Insurance Department hearings called by  Gillespie, said in a 27-page opinion that, as far as Proposition 103 rollbacks  are concerned, the annual rate of return standard ought to be 13.2%.  </P> <P> If adopted by Gillespie, that would mean the state's insurance companies would  not be liable to rebate to their customers any of the 20% rollback from 1987  rate levels prescribed by Proposition 103, if they were determined to have  received less than a 13.2% return in 1988-89 on all their applicable lines of  insurance combined.  </P> <P> For the Insurance Department's future approval of new rates, Fernandez  recommended a variable scale for rate of return, depending on each company's  circumstances, ranging from 11.2% to 19%.  </P> <P> Originally, last summer, Gillespie had said she would set an overall fair rate  of return standard of 11.2%. However, since then, she has indicated that she  might accept a higher figure.  </P> <P> First reaction from insurance company lawyers to Fernandez's recommendations  Monday was mildly favorable, although the companies had called for an annual  rate of return ranging from 16% to 21%.  </P> <P> Kent Keller, a lawyer for Travelers and other companies, said the companies had  not received what they wanted on the rollback standards, but he said that on  two readings of Fernandez's opinion, he believed the judge had been reasonable,  with some ambiguities.  </P> <P> But consumer leaders and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp reacted with outrage.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said Fernandez's opinion "could just as well have been written by  the insurance companies" and "would be a disaster for the consumers of  California and a betrayal of the voters who enacted Proposition 103." He said  that profit margins, under some accounting stratagems, could actually exceed  35% under the standards Fernandez recommended.  </P> <P> Robert Gnaizda, counsel for a coalition of 15 minority and low-income groups,  said he hoped the recommendations would be ignored by Gillespie.  </P> <P> "Overall, this pro-insurance decision is a repudiation of the laudable spirit  of Proposition 103 and encourages insurance industry greed," he said.  </P> <P> Gnaizda and Van de Kamp were among those who a few weeks ago demanded  Fernandez's removal as hearing judge on grounds of a conflict of interest  involving the judge's wife, who works for a law firm that defends insurer  interests.  </P> <P> Both Gillespie and Fernandez contended there was no conflict and Gillespie went  along with Fernandez's decision not to remove himself. Fernandez's wife, Judith  Fielding, said that her income and that of her husband are not commingled, and  pointed out that he had presided over trials in which judgments were delivered  against companies her firm had represented.  </P> <P> In other parts of his recommendations Monday, Fernandez:  </P> <P> Declared that insurance company political contributions, lobbying expenses and  charitable contributions ought to be excluded and disallowed from expense  claims the company made as part of the calculations going into gauging fair  rate of return.  </P> <P> Indicated, however, that executive salaries, no matter how high, should not be  disallowed in the calculations.  </P> <P> Contended that each company is different and no one standard would suffice by  which the Insurance Department should approve future rates, thus justifying the  variable 11.2% to 19% standard for the future.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHEVALIER IGNITES CSUN, 83-73  </P> <P> It looked like another game was about to unravel for Cal State Northridge on  Friday night. Freshman point guard Andre Chevalier was tripped and stripped of  the ball and San Diego scored on the break at the other end to take its biggest  lead of the game.  </P> <P> But Chevalier went coast-to-coast on the next CSUN possession, igniting a  second-half run that gave the Matadors their second victory this season, an  83-73 win over the Toreros.  </P> <P> Northridge (2-6) is undefeated at Matador Gymnasium. San Diego, of the West  Coast Conference, lost its third in a row to fall to 5-3.  </P> <P> "As you know, I get knocked down all the time so I don't know if that gave me  incentive as much as the turnover," Chevalier said.  </P> <P> "Whenever I make a turnover I try to get the ball back and make up for my  mistake instead of putting my head down like I used to do. I used to get mad  instead of keeping on playing. That's one thing coach (Pete Cassidy) taught  me."  </P> <P> After his driving layup, Chevalier twice attacked the same place on the court,  taking Kyle Kerlegan's man with him each time before wheeling to feed Kerlegan,  who sank consecutive three-point shots. From there, CSUN outscored San Diego,  21-6, to take a 15-point lead.  </P> <P> "It is all due to Andre's quickness," said Kerlegan, who finished with a  team-high 18 points -- 14 in the second half -- on 50% shooting. "My man had to  leave me. All I had to do was hit an open shot. The first three I hit I was  really, really open. That gave me my confidence back because I didn't shoot  well in the first half."  </P> <P> San Diego gave the Matadors a scare when it cut the lead to five on Michael  Brown's three-point basket with 3 minutes 45 seconds left, but on the ensuing  possession, CSUN ended a three-minute scoring drought with a basket by Todd  Bowser after a no-look pass from Keith Gibbs.  </P> <P> Then Chevalier came up with a steal on the Toreros' ensuing possession to stem  San Diego's momentum. Gibbs was fouled and hit one of the shots, and the  Toreros missed on their next four possessions, including a jump hook shot by  6-9 center Dondi Bell that was blocked from the side by CSUN's David Swanson, a  7-foot high jumper.  </P> <P> With 1:33 left, Chevalier escaped the San Diego press and lofted a lob to  Gibbs, who put it down for a 77-67 advantage. In the final 1:16, CSUN hit all  four of its foul shots.  </P> <P> The Matadors shot a season-high 50% from the field, including seven of 14 from  three-point range.  </P> <P> Chevalier scored a season-high 16 points and had five assists. Gibbs scored 12  and Kirk Scott scored a season-high 11.  </P> <P> Todd Bowser grabbed a season-high 12 rebounds and Shelton Boykin had nine.  </P> <P> "That's the best effort we've had all year," Cassidy said. "It is an excellent  Christmas present for the Northridge players. We've been humiliated on the  road. . . . I've lost 10 pounds and I can't sleep at night."  </P> <P> Toreros Coach Hank Egan probably won't catch any Zs either after watching his  team shoot a season-low 39%, including a two-of-23 effort from three-point  range.  </P> <P> Egan criticized the San Diego media for putting undue pressure on his players  by saying that they would win easily.  </P> <P> "I've had a hole in my gut all week," Egan said, "and that's as disappointed as  I've ever been."  </P> <P> Northridge played horrendously at the outset, but for once it didn't matter --  San Diego was just as awful. The Matadors missed 11 of their first 15 shots  while the Toreros missed on 10 of their first 15 attempts.  </P> <P> Both teams finally found the mark with 11 minutes left in the first half. Scott  sank three consecutive shots for CSUN, including one for three points, only his  third on 12 attempts this season, and the 6-foot-9, 240-pound Bell started to  heat up.  </P> <P> MATADOR NOTES: Cassidy and his players paid homage to the home-court advantage:  "Our guys are so excited not to sleep in a Holiday Inn tonight," Cassidy said,  "Nothing against Holiday Inn.". . . David Keeter, who is averaging 10 points a  game, missed his second consecutive game because of a sprained ankle. . . .  CSUN center Percy Fisher, who is academically ineligible this semester, calmed  the Matamaniacs (a group of football and basketball players who paint their  faces and chests) after a referee gave one of them a warning. . . .  </P></p>

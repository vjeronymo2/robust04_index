			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: AN ENJOYABLE PICNIC WITH BEETLES, LIZARDS  </P> <P> The picnic remains at the top of my list of favorite social gatherings, far  surpassing the formal dinner party or anything at which champagne is served.  There is something about eating marvelous food in good company under a tree or  in an open meadow that delights me.  </P> <P> The other day, Jean Erck and I went on a picnic to Indian Canyons, outside of  Palm Springs. She had guests from Aspen, Colo., and she wanted to show them the  beauty of the shady canyons.  </P> <P> We had all the requisites for a picnic. Some things are indigenous to picnics  and must be served. One of these is deviled eggs. We also had sandwiches on  croissants and on French baguettes -- ham, turkey, Swiss cheese. We had potato  salad, black olives and bread and butter pickles. Dessert was praline cookies  and fruit, and we had a tall cooler of iced tea.  </P> <P> We were in Palm Canyon where there are picnic tables and benches under the tall  clusters of palm trees. A lot of the trees had scorched and blackened trunks  where vandals had set fires under them and the trunks were carved with  initials. I suspect that man has done this since he first found a sharp rock  and a tree and turned to his friend and said, "Let's gouge these trees," but  the antiquity of the damage doesn't make it any more acceptable.  </P> <P> A pickup truck and van were parked close to where we left Jean's car. The four  men and one woman gathered around the vehicles were wearing floppy waders, and  there was a thing that looked like a butterfly net with a long handle leaning  against the van. They told us they were biologists from the University of  Nevada at Las Vegas and Sacramento State University. They were on a week's  exploration looking for a aquatic beetles.  </P> <P> They were camping each night along their way. The young woman, Cheryl Barr,  from Sacramento State, showed me a desert spring lizard. It was about seven  inches long and iridescent green and purple, looking as if it might have been  crafted by Faberge. The body seemed made of hundreds of tiny jewels. Cheryl  looked at the lizard and said, "It's a female," with total assurance. Cheryl  explained that the male has a brilliant blue stomach. Of course. How  ostentatious.  </P> <P> Dr. Bill Shepard, also from Sacramento State, said they had had a productive  trip, gathering several kinds of aquatic beetles. Dr. Chad Murvosh from the  University of Nevada wore a floppy hat Teddy Roosevelt would have loved. The  third man was Pete Balfour from Sacramento State and the fourth was a graduate  student named Lorne Seidman from University of Nevada.  </P> <P> They were having a fine time gathering beetles in a stream that hurried down  the canyon. Dr. Shepard discovered a new beetle in the area where we had our  picnic when they were on their field trip last year. "At least, it was a new  population for this area."  </P> <P> They were merry about their bugs and lizards and seemed to be having fun, as  any sensible person would, wading around in cool water on a hot day with a blue  sky and the palm trees making their rustling sounds overhead.  </P> <P> Palm Canyon is 15 miles long and was one of the canyons that was home to the  Cahuilla Indians, who still own 32,000 acres of the desert. They were hunters  and gatherers, eating the plants and animals the desert offered in profusion.  Andreas and Murray are the names of the other two canyons. Palm and Andreas  canyons have the most and the second-most, respectively, fan palm trees in the  world, and Murray Canyon has the fourth largest number.  </P> <P> Visitors to the desert hike in the canyons or ride horseback into the dark  groves of palm trees.  </P> <P> We went to the top of Palm Canyon and stopped at the trading post where the  beautiful grass baskets made by the Cahuillas are for sale. Turquoise and  silver jewelry and blankets woven in the soft desert colors are offered too.  </P> <P> It was a lovely picnic day and the beetle people seemed to enjoy it, too.  </P></p>

Palladin at  the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC  616.831-008.934.663-092.9-074]    [Abstract] The consequences of disruptions in the  functioning of the brain's GABA-ergic system, such as epilepsy,  Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, etc., reports confirming the  so-called _g_-aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypothesis of epilepsy  and convulsive paroxysms, and the findings indicating that some  NAD-dependent dehydrogenases can lower the nicotinamide  coenzymes in the blood prompted an examination of the  anticonvulsant mechanism of nicotinamide and to investigate the  response of the principal inhibitory mediating system to the  effect of NAD. To this end, an experiment was carried out on 150  g male albino rats, and corazol was injected intraperitoneally  based on a ratio of 30 mg per 1 kg of body weight 50 s, 2 and 10  min, and 3 h before decapitation. The experimental procedure is  outlined. The effect of MAD on the specific [.sup]3[/]  H-muscimol binding is summarized, and the dynamics  of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA capture by the rat brain synaptosomes  are plotted. Allowing for known data on the nicotinamide  interaction with the GABA-benzodiazepin receptor complex and the  findings of this study, the conclusion is drawn that the  pharmacological effect of nicotinamide used for clinical  treatment of epileptic seizures may be realized through NAD  which activates the GABA receptors, thus facilitating the  GABA-ergic transmission. In affecting the terminal stage of  postsynaptic action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, NAD is  capable of inhibiting the synaptosomal capture of [.sup]14[/]  C-GABA just like the capture inhibitors which are  efficient anticonvulsant drugs.

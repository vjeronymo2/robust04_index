			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bibby dives to Pounds 7m and omits final dividend J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the conglom-erate which is planning to spin off a substantial part of its business to pay off borrowings of Pounds 123m, yesterday passed its final dividend as annual pre-tax profits plunged by 78 per cent. The dive in profits from Pounds 32.2m to Pounds 7.1m for the year to September 24 wiped 11p from the company's shares to 68p. The share price has fallen from a high of 127p in the last six months. Sales were 27 per cent higher at Pounds 791.5m. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, had little comfort to offer shareholders as he warned that any recovery was not likely to occur in the current year. However, he was confident of an improvement in Bibby's prospects in the medium term after demerging its science, paper and agricultural products businesses next year. He said existing shareholders could expect a post-demerger dividend of 2p. Mr Mansell-Jones admitted that the acquisition of Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar distributor bought for Pounds 82m last year, had gone seriously wrong. 'No one ever envisaged it (the Spanish construction market) would go down this far,' he said. The market had 'completely disappeared' in Spain. Bibby's capital equipment division, which distributes Caterpillar in Spain and Portugal, returned sharply higher losses of Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 1.8m) as a result. Some Pounds 7.8m of the increase was due to interest charges following the acquisition of Finanzauto. Mr Mansell-Jones said the group had cut its Spanish workforce by 25 per cent to 1,500, resulting in on-going cost savings of about Pounds 5m. Materials handling enjoyed brighter fortunes, however, returning a 14 per cent pre-tax increase to Pounds 15.5m. These two divisions will be renamed Stratford after the demerger. The agriculture, science and paper products businesses will retain the Bibby name. The group aims to raise some Pounds 75m from the flotation, which will be used to reduce its gearing of about 70 per cent. Debt fell from Pounds 135.5m to Pounds 122.8m during the year. The group's earnings per share fell from 20.09p to 2.26p. Barlow Rand, the South African group which owns 79 per cent of J Bibby, will retain 79 per cent of Stratford and 20 per cent of the new Bibby.</p>

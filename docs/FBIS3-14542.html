			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 27 Mar (INA)--An Iraqi newspaper has stated  that the case for perpetuating the unfair embargo clamped on  Iraq has been immensely weakened, and that no one can any longer  justify the perpetuation of this embargo.    In an article today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH, which speaks  for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that Iraq's  international image is shining, and that its brightness will  extinguish the light in the eyes of evildoers, defeatists, and  dollar worshipers.    The paper goes on to say: The reason the embargo, along with  Ekeus, have been pushed into a corner is manifested in the fact  that Ekeus has continued to evade the issue of setting a date  for the start of "long-term monitoring" per Resolution 715,  although this monitoring actually started before the beginning  of this year.    The paper says that for some time, there have been  increasing  Arab and international calls for lifting the unfair embargo  clamped on Iraq. In this regard, the paper notes the statements  made by former French Defense Minister Jean-Bernard Chevenement,  who has described the anti-Iraq embargo as an objectionable  scandal for humanity, adding that he is indignant over the  suffering the embargo is causing to Iraqi children.    Commenting on those who have been blinded by malice, those  who placed their destiny in the hands of Zionists and  colonialists and spent the Arab nation's wealth buying  consciences to ensure the perpetuation of the embargo against  the Iraqi children, women, and elderly, the paper urges them to  correct their positions and come to their senses.</p>

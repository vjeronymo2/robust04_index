			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Artem Kudinov: "American Military Electronics in </F> the Service of Siberians; a Satellite Communications Joint  Venture Has Been Formed in Siberia"]    [Text] The work on the massive SibNet  telecommunications project has begun in Siberia. Specialists  believe that SibNet will institute superior computerized  communications within the Russia-U.S.-China triangle through the  American Intelsat communications satellite. Yesterday the chief  executors of the project--Datron Systems, Inc., an American  company; Gorizont, a scientific and technical firm in  Shushenskoye (Krasnoyarsk Kray); and several Siberian  communications enterprises--announced the formation of a joint  venture to establish the satellite communications system in  Siberia. The articles of incorporation had been signed the day  before. The cost of the first phase of the project has been  estimated at 2.5 million dollars.    The involvement of American firms--Pentagon contractors--in  the work on technological projects in Russia apparently has  already become a standard of performance. In any case, in a  conversation with the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Chairman  Sergey Yemelyanov of the Telecommunications Coordinating Council  of the Sibirskoye Soglasheniye Interregional Association did not  neglect to underscore the prestige of the Datron Company (the  supplier of the electronic equipment which proved to be so  dependable in Operation "Desert Storm" in the Persian Gulf) and  the firm's 25 years of experience working for the U.S. military  establishment.    The participation of local investors and producers is also  becoming an essential condition of large communications projects  in Russia. According to this plan, for example, the station  transmitting the coded data through the Russian Gorizont  satellite will be equipped with antennae made in Russia with  Russian technology. The only American components will be the  electronic equipment of the five stations that are to be located  in the Siberian mountains and one station in the Far East,  capable of transmitting data to Datron in the United States  through Intelsat.    Mr. Yemelyanov promised that the installation and user fees  of the SibNet communications system would be much lower than the  Moscow rates for comparable systems. In the near future the new  joint venture also plans to enter the world market, offering  similar stations to consumers with a need for high-caliber  communications. China's interest in participating in the SibNet  project is a result, according to the council director, of the  activities of Chinese firms in Siberia and the Far East, where  telephone communications still leave much to be desired. That is  why the possibility of opening a teleport in Singapore is now  being discussed in earnest.</p>

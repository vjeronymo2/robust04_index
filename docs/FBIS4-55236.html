			<p>BFN     [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Charles Redman, the U.S.  President's special envoy, arrived in Sarajevo this evening.  With Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, he discussed the results of the agreement signed in  Vienna today. Senada Cumurovic has the report.    [Cumurovic] Charles Redman, who briefed President  Izetbegovic  on the course of the talks, which ended in Vienna today, and on  the results [words indistinct], made the following statement:    [Begin Redman recording] I believe that the progress made  during the talks in Vienna with regard to the federation is a  major positive step. I think that the form on which the  agreement is founded is a solid basis for good relations between  Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks. However, the federation is only  one part of the agreement. Bosnian Serbs are the other part. I  have to say that I will have a very important meeting on Friday  in Geneva where the most important representatives of the UN  Security Council member countries and the EU will be present.  The meeting is important from the point of view of future  progress. The work of the contact group over the past few weeks  is the basis of our talks. President Izetbegovic and I agreed  that the most important part is the protection of  Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial integrity and the preservation  of a way toward coexistence between Bosnian Serbs and the  federation in some form of relationship. [end recording]    [Announcer] In his statement for the press, President  Izetbegovic assessed the agreement reached in Vienna today as  significant, partly because of its influence on the course of  the talks scheduled for 13 May in Geneva.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] This is a very important thing  and it will strengthen our future negotiating position. Of  course, we are awaiting with keen interest [words indistinct].  It is a big chance for peace and we will do everything in our  power not to spoil this chance. We will, of course, try to  ensure that this is not done at the expense of our people. With  the maximum of good will we will examine the proposals. It is  with great curiosity that we are expecting the proposals of the  international community. We hope it will not be a reward for  aggression and for ethnic cleansing. We are expecting just  peace proposals. [words indistinct] It is now up to the  international community to voice its opinion [words indistinct]  and that it is far better for us to wait and see what proposals  will be put before us. It is a well- known fact that the  withdrawal of Serb troops from the occupied territory is one of  our conditions, the other and most important one being the  preservation of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We will see to what extent the international community will be  prepared to [word indistinct] our demands.    [Announcer] Although at this stage the Bosnia-Herzegovina  delegation is not party to the talks, as President Izetbegovic  said, Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicackic will nonetheless be present  in Geneva. Let us say in the end that the journalists were most  keen to find out about how cadre issues in the federation will  be resolved. Neither President Izetbegovic nor Charles Redman  could say anything specific about this, i.e., they did not speak  about any concrete problems regarding the federation.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Glass ceiling has no sign of cracks, survey claims ONLY 8 per cent of top executives in Britain are women, and the higher up the corporate hierarchy, the fewer women there are, a survey of 29,000 executives in 533 companies shows. Mr Paul Gregg and Mr Stephen Machin from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London School of Economics take issue with the claim that women are increasing their share of the top executive jobs - defined as ranging from chief executive level to senior middle management. They also find that women are paid less than men even if working in the same job. 'There does appear to be a glass ceiling blocking the promotion of women to the highest jobs and it does not appear to be cracking,' they conclude. The BBC Television network has reached its equality target for women in senior positions, three years ahead of schedule, it announced yesterday, Richard Donkin writes. Ms Joanne Serpliss, deputy head of the BBC Television equal opportunities department, told delegates at the Institute of Personnel Management conference in Harrogate yesterday that the target had been reached earlier in the year.

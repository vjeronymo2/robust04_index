			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove falls to Pounds 7.2m but confident Bromsgrove Industries, the specialist engineering group, yesterday sought to reassure both the market and its shareholders, as it announced lower pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 of Pounds 7.19m. This compared with Pounds 7.6m previously and a record Pounds 8.85m in 1990-91. 'Strategically and financially, we are making very good progress. Bromsgrove is now a focused engineering group with a strong balance sheet, three core divisions and a clear strategy,' said Mr Bijan Sedghi, the chairman. The results were well in line with market expectations. The shares, which have been languishing at the bottom of this year's trading range, on a modest p/e of 11.3 and a yield of 6.3 per cent, gained 3 1/2 p to 91p. This is less than half the price touched before the market collapse of October 1987, but there are now 72.6m shares in issue. When Mr Sedghi took over as executive chairman in January 1987 there were 10.2m. At the end of the 1986-87 financial year, shareholders' funds were Pounds 5.7m; now they are Pounds 36.06m. The numbers cloak the expansion of what was an aluminium founder, unhealthily dependent on the then Austin Rover for its motor component sales. However, interest in the automotive market is no more. Bromsgrove is far more interested in products like orthopaedic implants, pumps and valves, golf shoe studs and forged steel. For the shareholders this expansion has never been a dull ride. Recently there have been rumours of a revolt in the making, following Bromsgrove's appointment of Smith New Court as its broker, and the resignation of Albert E Sharp. However nothing has happened and Mr Steven Mills, the managing director, said yesterday: 'All institutions have held or increased their holdings in the last three months.' But he acknowledged that 'there may have been a little bit of shareholders' frustration'. The cause is uncertainty. Bromsgrove has always seemed to be bobbing and weaving. Companies have moved in and out of the group with bewildering speed. Financial services were a good thing to be in at one stage. Then they were not. Environmental services offered the promise of a revenue stream but not, as it turned out, the reality. There have been two distinct phases in Bromsgrove's development under Mr Sedghi, both of which mirror business fashion. The first was the conglomerate, or, as the 1990 annual report had it, 'an industrial holding company which operates within the parameters of carefully formulated policies'. The second, which reflected the contemporary canon of retreating to core activities, began in 1992 when Bromsgrove marshalled its subsidiaries into six divisions and more closely defined the sectors in which it wanted to operate. Further reorganisation and the sale of the group's automotive and environmental companies have reduced the divisions to three and further tightened the definition. The financial effect of this has been to cut gearing to 7 per cent at the year-end and 17.5 per cent now, putting the group in a comfortable financial position, from which it should not be necessary for it to issue any more paper. For that, the stock market will offer thanks. The abundance of Bromsgrove paper has been a factor in keeping the share price down. The market will also be cheered by accelerating group sales in the second half of the year under review. Group turnover for 1993-94 came to Pounds 123.7m (Pounds 110.9m). Earnings per share were 7p (7.7p) and the proposed final dividend is 2.85p, making a total of 4.5p (4.4p).</p>

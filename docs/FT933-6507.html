			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Return to speculative property deals seen THE commercial property industry is planning a return to speculative property development, a survey has found. The study, carried out by Gallup, found that 36 per cent of large property companies and institutional investors are planning to spend up to Pounds 2bn on speculative developments over the next two years. Industrial property is the most popular sector, with London and the south-east the most popular regions for developers, followed by the Midlands. Insurance companies appeared to be the most enthusiastic about the prospects for speculative development, while pension funds were more cautious. The findings reflect an upturn in confidence over the past six months. However, many in the industry doubt there will be a large-scale return to speculative development until there is greater evidence of renewed demand from tenants. The survey of large pension funds, insurance companies and property companies was commissioned by CSW, a property magazine. The survey found that the property industry's overall confidence was little changed over the last quarter, following a sharp rise from last October. Just 1 per cent of respondents expect the UK property market to get worse over the next year. Six per cent expect it to stay the same, while 82 per cent expect it to 'get a little better'.</p>

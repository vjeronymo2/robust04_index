			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Graphs as the new corporate sleight of hand  -Andrew Jack examines how companies are using a variety of means to enhance their performances A PICTURE may be worth a thousand words, but a graph can severely distort a company's true financial performance, according to an academic study released yesterday. Nearly four fifths of leading quoted British companies use graphs to illustrate their annual reports, but almost one third portray the performance more favourably than the underlying numbers should permit. Companies with good performance are more likely to use graphs than those with poor or worsening performance, said Vivien Beattie from the University of Southampton and Michael John Jones from the University of Wales. Their analysis - sponsored and published by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants - is based on an analysis of the 1989 annual reports of 240 companies. 'Many graphs were not presented in a neutral, unbiased way,' say the two authors. 'In particular, there was evidence of selectivity, measurement distortion and presentational enhancement.' They warn that an unfaithful, biased presentation of graphs may undermine the reliability of financial statements. Among the 21 detailed examples, the authors cite YJ Lovell Holdings. The company's graphs have columns of inconsistent width and variable spaces between them, which distort the figures. The graphs slope to the right, drawing the eye upwards to suggest continual growth. Lovell uses a different colour and puts in bold the figure above the graph line for the most recent year. There is no clear indication of where the baseline sits. Scottish Metropolitan Property creates an eye-catching graphic, but has no axes, and displays inconsistencies in the width of the lines and the spaces between them. The position of the baseline is also unclear. The use of darker colours draws the eye upwards and to the right. Graphs were used by 79 per cent of the companies sampled - an even higher proportion for those employing graphic designers to help produce their reports. Two thirds of these companies used graphs to highlight at least one of four key financial variables: turnover, pre-tax profits, earnings and dividend per share. Some 30 per cent of the graphs showed 'material measurement distortion'  - where the physical measurements on the graph are not proportional to the numeric values being represented - which was greater than 5 per cent. The main devices the authors say the companies used to manipulate figures to create the impression of strong performance include: distortion: variations in the width, volume and space between graph lines; use of symbols (such as a company product) in place of a line which distorts as it grows in size. scale: non-zero or broken axes; truncation of a negative axis; use of a non-arithmetic scale; the absence of any scale at all. typeface: non-horizontal. cross-hatching: giving the impression of movement and the illusion of tilt. colour: different colours including more powerful ones for different years. shadows/shade behind graph lines: to draw the eye upwards, sometimes darkening higher up the graph. sloping: upwards and to the right of words, graphs and arrows to draw the eye upwards. emphasising top of the graph: drawing the eye. combinations of graphs: not aligning graphs, making comparisons difficult; encouraging comparisons where they are false because scales are different. Thorn EMI uses the performance over four years of three financial variables, combined with a graph for a single year showing the contribution to turnover from four divisions. Vivien Beattie said: 'A lot is left in the hands of graphic designers who while trying to do a good job for their client perhaps end up doing the wrong thing. 'Graphs are a good thing, but if designers are left unchecked, their tendency is to over-design. This can either obscure or even distort information.'

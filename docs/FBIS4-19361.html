			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Promises To Resurrect the </F> Conservative Party"]    [Excerpt] Bergen -- "The Conservative Party will be  restored to its old heights," new party leader Jan Petersen  promised. Optimism is growing.    Spring sunshine finally flooded over the rain-drenched  mountains after a national conference that was the very lift  that experienced party officials had been hoping for. A brand  new leadership had been elected with Borge Brende and Elisabeth  Aspaker as new deputy chairmen. The new party leader had  successfully negotiated his closing speech and the tricky  questions at the news conference, and many people felt that they  had been given "brass band music in their hearts," as former  party leader Jan P. Syse put it earlier in the conference.    Petersen also gave clear marching orders on the EU [European  Union] question: "There will be no membership unless the  Conservative Party is involved and does its share of the job!  If there are people in the Labor Party who believe that the EU  race is theirs alone, they are wrong," he said. His feeling is  that opposition within the party to the EU -- with only 2  percent no against 98 percent yes -- is not too large or so  forcibly expressed that the party cannot live with it.    Jan Petersen, who was elected with acclamation and without  any rival candidate yesterday morning, said that one of his main  tasks -- alongside the EU question -- will be to bring the  Conservative Party back to the position of the dominant  challenger to the Labor Party.    "The situation of being the Storting's third largest party  is  a situation with which we feel most uncomfortable," he said.  The new Conservative leader wants to bring out the differences  between the Labor Party and the Conservative Party more clearly  and thinks that he has a stockpile of enough issues that can  show that the two parties are still as different as they were  perceived to be in the past. Both he and others in the party  have a great deal of patience when it comes to the length of  time it will take to resurrect the party from support of around  17 percent. "Now we must forget the opinion poll figures for a  couple of years."    Petersen also tried to look at the everyday lives of people  from a viewpoint outside the Storting.    "Let us never forget that there is another Norway beyond the  political Norway. A Norway where the main question is whether  it will be possible to keep one's job into next year. Where the  worry is not the budget deficit, but whether it is safe to walk  home from the bus stop."    The question of who actually is the leader of the new  Conservative Party has been raised by many, given that Anders  Talleraas will continue to be parliamentary leader and Kaci  Kullmann Five is still expected to be a frontline figure on the  EU question. The same questions surfaced at the closing news  conference yesterday, and Petersen's replies chiefly had the  thrust that this will not be a problem:    "Come back in six months and you will see that this has not  been a problem," Petersen said. He said that in the final  analysis he will be the one who has to be in the frontline on  all important questions, but that he needs all the good forces  that can assist him in his job. He was unwilling to say whether  or not Anders Talleraas should be reelected parliamentary leader  and added that this was something for the Storting group to  decide. [passage omitted]</p>

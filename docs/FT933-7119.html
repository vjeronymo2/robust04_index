			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / People: Brown to take on Rechem's problems Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, has hired Colin Brown from Exxon Chemical as the new operations director of the environmental services division. Since he lives in the New Forest, Brown will be not too far distant from the incineration plant at Fawley, one of five sites around the country for which he will be responsible and which was last year fined for discharging arsenic into Southampton Water. He also has the advantage of having worked in what Shanks &amp; McEwan calls 'a very closely allied industry'. 'They (Exxon) make the stuff and we destroy it,' a company spokesman explains. Both companies are also favourite targets of the green lobby - Exxon will long be associated with the Valdez disaster, while Rechem, acquired by Shanks &amp; McEwan in 1991, has been under fire particularly at Pontypool, where it destroys toxic waste such as PCBs and dioxins. Brown's appointment is not directly related to the Pollution Inspectorate's recent warning, in the course of its licence renewal, that Pontypool should improve the monitoring of its toxic emissions, according to Shanks. Instead, David Wheeler, the previous managing director of Shanks &amp; McEwan (Environmental Services), which incorporates Rechem and the technical services division of Shanks, had felt he himself had enough operational experience, but his recently appointed successor, Mike Averill, wished to reintroduce the post. Brown, 38, a chemical engineering graduate from Bath, who joined Exxon 16 years ago, will be in charge of Fawley and Pontypool, the high temperature incineration plants that are part of Rechem, as well as Stewartby, Teesside and Tullos, all three part of the chemical treatment operation that comprise Shanks &amp; McEwan technical services.</p>

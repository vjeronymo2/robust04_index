The participants, who have  come from the United States, have numerous questions on the  possibility of the gradual expansion of ties between Cuba and  the Cuban community abroad. The increasing number of people  wanting to travel to Cuba was discussed, as well as the growth  in the number of people abroad who are against the economic  blockade.    Jorge Gomez Barata, an official of the Central Committee of  the Communist Party of Cuba, spoke at the meeting about the  willingness of Cuban authorities to show greater flexibility on  emigration issues and stressed that one of the duties of the  state is to ensure the security and tranquility of the  population; hence, the existence of controls and requirements.    This is the second meeting of its kind with members of this  group. The meeting was chaired by Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member  of the Politburo, and Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban  Institute of Friendship with Peoples.</p>

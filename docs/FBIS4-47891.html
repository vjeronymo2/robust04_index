			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, has  received 12 notifications of alleged cease-fire violations.  Eight of those came from the government and the other four from  the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo. A total of (?10) of  those reports have already been investigated. Only two must  still be investigated.    In his report to the UN Security Council, UN Secretary  General said that neither the government nor Renamo have allowed  the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, access to certain  military bases. His report also noted that neither side has  supplied full military equipment lists yet. Butrus Butrus-Ghali  also noted in his report that some government assembly areas are  too full while others are virtually empty. [passage omitted]    In his report, the UN secretary general also said that by 18  April Renamo had demobilized 3 percent of all its listed forces  in the assembly areas, while the government had released 28  percent of its men.</p>

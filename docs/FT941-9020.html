			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Poland clears way for IMF debt deal Poland's parliamentary budget committee yesterday approved the 1994 draft budget, paving the way for an IMF-negotiated debt reduction programme with the Paris Club of western creditors, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The Z83,000bn budget, already approved by the IMF, represents a public deficit of 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product. It is central to the IMF-negotiated agreement to reduce Poland's Dollars 33bn debt by 20 per cent. The budget still has to go to the full chamber for approval but yesterday's decision is likely to undermine a campaign on the left of the governing coalition for higher spending.</p>

The two sides agreed this would be the best way to ensure  prosperity of the Balkan peoples and guarantee them that their  rights and interests would be implemented in peace and in  conditions of goodneighbourliness and mutual respect, said a  statement released by the Serbian president's office.    Stressing the importance of friendship and close ties  between  the Serb and Greek peoples, Milosevic said that "for Serbia and  its citizens, the support and solidarity of Greece mean moral  support and encouragement to put up with the pressure to which  they are exposed."    A Greek parliamentary delegation headed by Florakis said on  Tuesday in a meeting with Yugoslav Parliamentarian Borisav Jovic  that a settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia should be  sought only in talks between the warring sides without any  external interference, and warned of the danger of the conflict  spreading to the entire Balkan region.    The Greek delegation also said that the Greek people had  nothing but praise for the Serb people's resistance to attempts  by imperalist powers, such as the United States and Germany, to  establish a new world order in the Balkans and zones of their  economic and political influence in the region.    Jovic, who is chairman of the parliamentary foreign policy  committee, said Yugoslavia was vitally interested in an end to  all fighting, lifting of unjust sanctions and return to the  international community.    In late May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough  sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in civil war  in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina although no Yugoslav soldier  has been fighting there.    Jovic also hailed Greece's support and aid it had been  wholeheartedly rendering to the Serb people in this difficult  stage in its history.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA  </P> <P> Hazelwood's piece is nothing less than a blueprint for United States escalation  of the civil war in El Salvador.  </P> <P> It has most of the ingredients of another Vietnam-style American commitment to  that ongoing struggle, from the use of "more (U.S.) Special Forces-qualified  personnel in contested rural areas" (i.e., in combat zones) to the employment  of the Agency for International Development (read CIA) in Salvadoran "community  defense."  </P> <P> The only good thing that can be said for this former marine's plan is its open  espousal. Confronted with four more years of a Republican Administration, I  guess we have to console ourselves with an attitude of "better Hazelwood than  North!"  </P> <P> ANTHONY GARAVENTE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

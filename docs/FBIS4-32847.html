			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 May (NA) -- Raul Alfonsin,  president of the Radical [Civic Radical Union] bloc of  Constituent Assembly members, reiterated that his party  "definitely" does not want the assembly to include a clause that  will allow governors to run for reelection, and he reiterated  that "ballotage is a Radical project that comes from 1988 and  has been accepted by Carlos Menem."    Regarding the reelection of governors, he said: "The  Constituent Assembly can in no way dedicate itself to this type  of topic, and as of now we are not accepting any type of clause  on this matter."    "This is the responsibility of provincial constitutions, and  it cannot be discussed or debated in a constitutional reform,  and we are maintaining this position," he added.    He also gave an advance warning about his "flat" refusal to  the possibility of the existence a Lemas Law in Buenos Aires  Province.    "In truth," he said, "the province's constitution makes its  implementation very difficult, and there is no way in which the  official sector can structure it."    Asked about the changes that occurred during the past 20  years that could justify a new constitution, Alfonsin said that  "there have been various events," and he highlighted "the role  of the Armed Forces, which today is blended with the  institutions."    He also maintained that after 10 years of exercising  democracy "it is evident that it is not a good thing for the  president to name judges," and therefore with the constitutional  reform "this activity will be carried out by the Magistrates  Council in order to serve the Republic's interests in a much  better way."</p>

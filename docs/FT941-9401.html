			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Elf Aquitaine The gushing demand for Elf Aquitaine's FFr35bn share offer confirms that France's privatisation programme is still well on course. Following last year's sales, the perception has grown that the government is offering shares at attractive prices. The Paris bourse still appears tempting at this stage in France's economic cycle. Given Elf's size and importance, few fund managers could resist. Income-hungry funds have been attracted by Elf's yield of 4.8 per cent, which represents a fair premium to the French market. US investors, in particular, have warmed to Elf for the same reason they bought BP after its shares slumped. Elf boasts an enormous asset base which has been poorly exploited in the past. More market-minded management could generate good returns simply by cutting costs and shedding peripheral assets. That said, the rewards will not come quickly and much is taken on trust. There has been little critical analysis of Elf's prospects since so many stockbrokers were scrambling for the right to distribute shares. Though ravaged by writedowns, Elf's net profits fell from FFr6.2bn to FFr1.1bn last year. With the oil price below Dollars 14, earnings will not recover as fast as they fell. Moreover, the share claw-back will ensure few investors receive a worthwhile allocation of shares. Fragmentation of ownership will make it all the harder to counteract any incestuous tendencies among Elf's web of French corporate shareholders. As the row over Canal Plus has highlighted, outside shareholders are invariably left on the sidelines when insiders change their priorities.</p>

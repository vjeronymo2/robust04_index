			<p>BFN     [Text] Before he met Radovan Karadzic in Pale, Yasushi  Akashi met Alija Izetbegovic, leader of the Bosnian Muslims, in  Sarajevo. Through Eurovision exchange, we received brief  statements by Akashi and the leader of the Bosnian Muslims after  their meeting in Sarajevo in the morning.    [Begin recording] [Akashi in English with superimposed  translation in Serbo-Croatian] The attack stopped as of 1800  yesterday. However, we have to work first on a greater UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] presence. A larger number of armored  vehicles should be sent and General Rose will go there very soon  -- tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. At the same time, we are  determined to work on a general, global cease-fire, not only the  one between Muslim and Croatian sides, but also including the  Serbian side, so as to establish basis for a real, lasting, and  global peace.    [Izetbegovic] As regards a general cease-fire, we are of the  opinion that one should place the surrender of heavy weaponry in  the center of the question. In our opinion, there will be no  peace without that. [end recording]</p>

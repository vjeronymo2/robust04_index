			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 6 Jun (EFE) -- On 6 June,  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, constitutional president of Haiti,  suggested to the members of the OAS the need for armed action  against the coupists who took power in 1991.    Although in his address to the OAS foreign ministers, who  are  holding an extraordinary meeting to discuss the Haitian problem,  Aristide said the Constitution did not allow him to request a  military occupation. During a news conference afterward, he  suggested the idea of armed action against the military coupists.    "We are talking about a minuscule group of military coupists  who are deeply involved in the narcotics business," the  overthrown Haitian president said, also referring to an  agreement to fight drug trafficking which he had signed with the  United States in 1991, when he was still the president of Haiti.    Before this, Aristide had stressed in his address to the OAS  foreign ministers that he believed that "military action could  be carried out to free the nation from the bandits who have  taken it hostage and reestablish democracy in Haiti."    "Quick and decisive action must therefore be taken to oust  the military leaders within the framework of the Governor's  Island (New York) agreements," the president said, adding that  "the international community knows how to proceed."    This agreement, which was signed by coupist General Raoul  Cedras in July 1993 at the behest of the United Nations and the  OAS, indicated that a military unit should be sent to Haiti to  help with the transition, and that power be returned to him.    The unit that was sent, however, which consisted of U.S. and  Canadian troops, was not able to disembark, as when it arrived  off the coast of Haiti in October 1993 it encountered the  opposition of the Haitian coupist forces.    During his news conference, Aristide stated that the "rapid  and decisive action" to which he had referred would have as its  goal "the liberation of the (Haitian) Army from its high  command, and at the same time giving the nation, as a whole, its  freedom," but always without directly asking for international  military intervention in his country.    Aristide stressed that the current period, when Haiti's  borders are completely closed to international trade in  accordance with the total embargo that the Security Council  implemented in May, must be taken advantage of, because "if  there is no action the embargo will create a very detrimental  process."    According to Aristide, the coupist military leadership  annually obtains $1.2 billion from drug trafficking, and during  the 7 months that he governed in 1991 before becoming the victim  of the military coup, he had signed an agreement to fight drug  trafficking with then U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.    The constitutional president of Haiti, who has been living  in  exile, indicated that the fight against narcotics in his country  had been strengthened through this agreement, and that it was  decisive in the reasons for the coup.    The contents of his news conference differs with the spirit  of optimism and hope contained in his address to the OAS foreign  ministers participating in the "ad hoc" meeting. Aristide also  asked for the immediate deployment of the technical cooperation  mission that was established in the Governor's Island agreements.    In his address, the deposed president proposed a program, to  be implemented after recovering the presidency, that would allow  his country "to go from a state of misery to a state of poverty  with dignity."    Concluding his address with another show of optimism  regarding a quick solution to his country's crisis, Aristide  even invited the OAS foreign ministers to hold next year's OAS  General Assembly in Haiti.</p>

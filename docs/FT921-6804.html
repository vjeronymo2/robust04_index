			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Equity Issues: Malaysian offering for overseas investors INTERNATIONAL investors have the first opportunity to participate in a primary offering of shares in a Malaysian company next month with the privatisation of Tenaga Nasional, the country's electric power utility. The Malaysian government is offering 23 per cent of the company for sale, raising USDollars 1.3bn from the sale of 685m shares. Around 10 per cent of the shares will be offered to international investors through an open tender managed by Baring Brothers, Daiwa and Salomon Brothers which starts on March 2. The deal will be priced this weekend, and bankers are expecting a minimum tender price of around MDollars 4.50, with shares offered to domestic investors at a similar price. However, higher bids are expected as international investors move to secure a stake in an important part of the country's economy. At the minimum tender price the company will be valued at around MDollars 13.5bn, against a total equity market capitalisation of MDollars 150bn. In 1990, Malaysia Telecom was privatised on the domestic equity market, although last year the government made a Dollars 190m offering of bonds exchangeable into shares. Elsewhere, Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the Italian banking group, today starts presentations to international investors in preparation for its L1,250bn (Dollars 1.04bn) equity offering. The deal will increase San Paolo's share capital to L6,250bn, making it Italy's largest banking group. A consortium of banks led by Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, are handling the transaction with separate banks heading regional syndicates. The deal will be priced on March 9 and the shares are expected to be offered at around L12,000 to L14,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Guizhou Province has completed construction of a "drinking water  project" for 1.06 million farmers and 500,000 cattle in 17  counties.    The project consists of 358 drinking water works funded with  the Japanese Government loans.    In the past, half of the farmers of Guizhou, a province  situated on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, faced difficulties in  drawing potable water from underground water sources.    In April 1991, the Chinese and Japanese Governments signed  an  agreement on using 1.5 billion yen to open up underground water  reserves in Guizhou Province.    Zhang Yuqin, deputy governor of Guizhou Province, said that  by the end of March this year, the projects were all completed.    She said that the Japanese-funded drinking water project has  also prompted Guizhou to improve the quality of drinking water  supplies and now more than 12.3 million farmers have access to  clean water.    She said that this year, about 1.1 million additional  farmers  will have piped-in tap water.</p>

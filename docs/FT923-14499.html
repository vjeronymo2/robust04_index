			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reliance Security at Pounds 3.42m AN INCREASED awareness of the need for security helped Reliance Security Group raise its pre-tax profits by 5.5 per cent, from Pounds 3.25m to Pounds 3.42m, in the year to May 1. Turnover advanced 13 per cent, from Pounds 56.1m to Pounds 63.4m. Mr Brian Kingham, chairman of this USM-traded group, said there was also a continuing trend of large companies contracting out non-core activities and Reliance was expanding its geographic coverage with the number of offices rising from 17 to 27. The profit increase was partly offset by the costs incurred in expanding into electronic security. The bulk of these, amounting to Pounds 906,000, came in the first half and Mr Kingham said there were signs that its market was showing signs of recovery. The result was achieved despite net interest costs rising to Pounds 291,000 (Pounds 197,000). Earnings per share were 20.5p (19.4p) and a final dividend of 6.8p (6.2p) is proposed for a total payment of 9p (8.4p). A 1-for-1 scrip is also planned.</p>

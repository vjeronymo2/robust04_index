			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Business failures drop by 25% THE NUMBER of business failures fell by 25 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer, said yesterday. There were 1,433 business failures and bad debtors reported to the company during April to June this year, down from 1,767 in the first quarter and 1,911 in the second quarter of last year. All regions experienced a lower number of failures than the same period last year except the north of England and Northern Ireland. Trade Indemnity said the figures were proof that recovery was now established. But it warned that low inflation might simply be delaying some banks from calling in receivers against other companies because the realisable value of their assets was still so low.</p>

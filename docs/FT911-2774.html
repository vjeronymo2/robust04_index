			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / PM faces growing pressure over NHS funding MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, will meet leaders of the medical profession at Chequers today amid a new and mounting storm about the adequacy of National Health Service funding. The prime minister came under pressure from the British Medical Association yesterday to change the agenda of the meeting - called to examine means of improving health standards - and concentrate instead on ways of increasing NHS finance. This followed an announcement on Thursday that Guy's hospital in London, one of the first to become a self-governing trust under this month's health reforms, is preparing to shed hundreds of jobs. In Bradford, Dr Mark Baker, chief executive of another self-governing trust, said 300 jobs could be lost over the next three years in a programme to save Pounds 7m. 'The severe cuts at Guy's hospital expose alarmingly the worsening financial state of the NHS,' said Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the BMA council. He said it had taken only 26 days for the NHS reforms, launched on April 1 with what the government described as a smooth take-off, to hit turbulence. Earlier this week Mr Major rejected a request from the BMA for a meeting to discuss finance, saying the difficulty of the NHS was not one of insufficient resources. The BMA council will consider its response to the refusal on Wednesday. Managers at Guy's want to shed at least 600 jobs to clear a Pounds 6.8m deficit and release a further Pounds 6m for service developments. Opposition MPs and union leaders reacted angrily to the news yesterday. The issue was raised in the Commons with Ms Harriet Harriet Harman, shadow health minister, demanding a government statement. 'The government has said that if Guy's opted out it would solve its financial problems but they have only got worse. Now it's time for the government to step in and solve a problem of their own creation,' she said. Renewed controversy over funding so early in the life of the reformed NHS will be unwelcome for the government - particularly as the most senior managers at Guy's were until recently working in the Department of Health on the introduction of the reforms. But Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, said in an independent radio interview that decisions like those at Guy's were for managers to make. Unless hospitals made savings in some areas they would not have money to invest in new things. The BMA said the need for cutbacks at Guy's showed that the hospital had been unable to negotiate the funding contracts on which its application for self-governing status - under which it manages its own day-to-day affairs - was based, leaving it with a serious shortfall in income. Mr Peter Griffiths, the hospital's chief executive, said his ambition was for Guy's to have the best-paid staff in the NHS. But this could be achieved only by having fewer employees and improved efficiency. He was hopeful that the health service unions would negotiate on the proposals. Health service reform, Page 6</p>

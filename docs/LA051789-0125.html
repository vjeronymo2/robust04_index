			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAST-LANE ENVIRONMENTS;  </P> <P> SUDDENLY THE SIZZLE IS WITH CAR INTERIORS; WATCH FOR TVS, FAXES AND SCULPTURED  SEATS  </P> <P> Like many freeway travelers today, David Rees is noticing more and more drivers  who are doing business on the move, cellular phones cradled under their chins,  one hand on the steering wheel, while awkwardly trying to scribble notes with  the other.  </P> <P> This sight not only makes Rees uncomfortable, he takes it as a mandate. "I see  two messages there," says Rees, who is director of interior design for the Ford  Motor Co.  </P> <P> "The first is that (automobile) customers want and need a phone in these days  of business. And second is that we as designers have to provide that phone for  them."  </P> <P> For an industry that has seemed vaguely surprised by the car phone's hit  performance since it was introduced five years ago, Rees' preoccupation with  cellular technology -- in fact with car interiors in general -- may come as  something of a shock.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Communications Accesories  </P> <P> But it is grounded in the purest of motives. Not only have car phone sales  zoomed past all projections (the Los Angeles area is the nation's largest  market with 200,000 cellular car phone users at last count and climbing), but  portable fax machines, laptop computers, and printers also are climbing into  the front seat, courtesy of the innovative auto accessory market.  </P> <P> How many of the nation's 110 million commuters might want to outfit their  automobile as an office? How are they going to do all this work while driving?  </P> <P> And, advancing the scenario to Year 2000 projections of time that will be spent  on traffic-clogged freeways, what is the potential for  the-automobile-as-comfortable-retreat? Specifically, will sculptured seats, TV  screens, multimedia 10-speaker sound systems, remote-mounted compact disc  changers, storage center armrests, power-adjustable lumbar supports, coffee-cup  holders, swivel seats, flip-up tables, refrigerators and microwave ovens make  gridlock more bearable?  </P> <P> In fact, those are only some of the creature comforts either already available  somewhere in the marketplace or on the drawing boards in Southern California's  influential auto design studios.  </P> <P> "I think the mobile telephone is just the tip of the iceberg in what is  happening to commuters," says Ron Hill. He is chairman of the industrial design  department at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design where auto  industry-sponsored projects regularly preview the shape and styling of cars to  come.  </P> <P> "It's the entire auto interior that is being scrutinized," continued Hill,  whose students recently designed car interiors for a Nissan project based on  the premise that future drivers will be spending increasing amounts of time in  their cars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Improve Driving  </P> <P> "Most interiors are relatively poorly done; the seating is not ergonomically  correct and . . . the actual driving of the vehicle in terms of control can be  improved.  </P> <P> "And now," Hill added, "the first challenge is to dial the cellular telephone  without taking your eyes off the task at hand -- which is to avoid hitting  people and things."  </P> <P> Los Angeles design consultant Charles Pelly, whose international  Designworks/USA turns out leading edge work for automotive clients from General  Motors, Volvo and BMW to companies in developing countries, agrees.  </P> <P> In Pelly's opinion, "We've about reached the limits for what we can do with the  exteriors (of cars) and now the manufacturers are really turning their  attention to the insides. . . . There's a lot of attention being paid to  comfort, and words like visual openness are coming into play."  </P> <P> This year, Pelly's Designworks staff completed its own vision of the  car-as-environment future: a show car project called the Torrero, which Pelly  took this March to the International Automobile Exposition in Geneva, the  "forum of futuristic cars." The car was such a hit, he said, that at one point  the fire department threatened to close the overcrowded exhibit booth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Command Position'  </P> <P> The attraction? In part, a state-of-the-future interior with its "command  position" for the driver, from which he or she can view a center-console CRT  (cathode ray tube) -- a small TV screen that can display the output of a  satellite navigation system showing the vehicle's location on an electronic map  and providing trip guidance. Other features are controls for an on-board  computer, advanced audio system and remote-mounted compact disc changer  controls, as well as a fax machine and communications console armrest with  telephone and note pad.  </P> <P> "This is a $225,000 version and you might say it's overdone," Pelly allowed,  "but these are details the ordinary car owner might expect to see down the  road.  </P> <P> "There are good designers and bad designers," he added, "and the new freedom of  the interiors will be abused, with people selling everything from window shades  to compasses, but I have faith in the consumer to sort it out."  </P> <P> Pelly's immediate concern is the impending "electronic collision" -- as  telephones are added to cars already loaded with switches and buttons. "There  are safety implications to all this that have to be solved," he said. "It will  take cooperation between multiple manufacturers, such as the telephone and auto  designers.  </P> <P> "When you consider what the phone can do when integrated with the fax machine,  with communication of road conditions and mapping and other functions, it is  revolutionary. My premise is that the telephone will become the communication  with the entire vehicle and between the vehicle and the outside world. I think  by '92 you will see a lot of integration."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Car or Office?  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether the average commuter wants a car that doubles as  an office. Or whether Americans are willing to give up on the more romantic  idea of the auto as last refuge from the telephone. But as the car -- sprouting  cellular phones, computers and command-post-type furniture -- rolls into the  Age of Communication, its role and what it's going to look like have become a  major focus for trend-watchers.  </P> <P> Bob Johnson, a consumer market analyst with Pacific Bell, pondering the  implications of a computerized car, sees two emerging schools of thought: high  tech and high touch.  </P> <P> "Some drivers are going to want a lot of sizzle," he said. "There's a whole  group of TAFfies (Technologically Advanced Families) who are an important  market segment. These are the first to embrace and adopt new technology: They  were the first to buy the VCR 10 years ago, and the compact disc five years  ago. They are the leading-edge consumers, and they sort of pull the rest of the  market along."  </P> <P> A second market segment, according to Johnson, are the drivers who, faced with  longer and longer commutes, seek a home environment in their car, a  "high-touch" car, filled with creature comforts.  </P> <P> Johnson calls it "car-cooning." He sees "the explosion of expensive  high-fidelity equipment which converts the auto to a miniature concert hall" as  one indication of that impulse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emphasis on Comfort  </P> <P> Like cocooning at home, it's "building a protective wall to lock out the  stresses of everyday life, equipping it with large-scale entertainment devices  and comfortable furniture," Johnson said. "People are saying, 'If I'm going to  be stuck on the freeway, I want to be comfortable.' "  </P> <P> Conversations with Detroit industry shapers confirm Southern California  predictions that the car interior is indeed considered the "next frontier" --  although the major manufacturers have set somewhat different road maps to reach  it.  </P> <P> "By the year 2000, we really will have a whole new era of car," predicted Mark  Cocroft, technical spokesman for General Motors Technical Center. "It will  still have four wheels and an internal combustion engine, but that's about the  only similarity it will share with a Model T."  </P> <P> General Motors traditionally has leaned toward electronic sizzle, said Cocroft,  designing cars to reflect the "urbane and sophisticated world in which we  live."  </P> <P> In cutting-edge tradition, GM already has integrated cellular telephone  functions into the CRT controls of its 1989 Buick Riviera. (The pioneering  Riviera introduced the CRT in 1986.) The touch-sensitive screen, located on the  dashboard and replacing rows of control buttons, calls up a menu of functions  including radio controls, heating and air conditioning. The system also  monitors such under-the-hood functions as temperature, oil and fuel levels, and  has the potential to diagnose engine problems.  </P> <P> For 1990, GM's computer technology will put a computerized Visual Information  Center -- a color screen with command-touch areas for its 51 functions -- in  the Oldsmobile Trofeo.  </P> <P> Said Cocroft: "The little screens in the Buick and in the Oldsmobile are the  real signs of the future."  </P> <P> In addition, he continued, GM has a whole team of specialists looking at ways  the car, when parked, may function as an office. "Say you are in real estate,  and calling on clients all the time. We are looking at designs where you flip  down the back of the passenger seat. It becomes like the top of the desk for  writing; you can put a fax machine there. The possibilities are almost endless  in that regard."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Driving  </P> <P> These functions are not to interfere with the driving, he emphasized. "We  figure as you drive, the most you should be doing is talking on the phone. So  that's why we now have a hands-off phone, a remote microphone. You can just  talk as you drive."  </P> <P> And he reeled off a few more futuristic bells and whistles being previewed in  GM concept cars, the company's laboratory models for new ideas:  </P> <P> * "In a continued march toward that cockpit feel," he said, "you'll see  individual controls for each passenger for heating, air conditioning and sound  systems."  </P> <P> * "We will be using solar cells to keep the temperature constant while the car  is parked, so that it will stay cool in the summer, and warm in the winter.  </P> <P> * "You'll be able to tint your windows with electronically activated crystals,  making it all dark but still allowing complete visibility from inside out.  </P> <P> * "Also coming are active suspension systems: You'll be able to punch up what  kind of a ride you want -- a smooth, boulevard ride, like sitting on the living  room sofa, or a more firm (stiffer suspension) European ride."  </P> <P> "These will be big changes," he concluded, "but electronics make it possible."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Phone  </P> <P> At Chrysler Corp., the sizzle is softer, with less emphasis on high-tech  details, but a phone is in the future, says Trevor Creed, Chrysler's director  of design for all interiors.  </P> <P> "It will be integrated into the back of the sun visor. You flip the visor down  and forward, without obscuring your view; the phone pad is right in front of  you. It looks like a calculator with finger-sized buttons and a built-in  speaker."  </P> <P> The Chrysler system, which Creed said is being readied for 1990 models, "has a  very, very slim phone with speaker built in and a very large memory bank.  </P> <P> "You program in all the numbers you are likely to use," he explained. "You  don't have to hold anything; it comes through the radio speakers."  </P> <P> Customer acceptance of the car telephone has been "absolutely amazing," he  said. "Our merchandising people thought people would be reluctant to buy a car  with a built-in phone, that they would prefer to buy a phone that they could  move from car to car. But there was great reception to the factory-installed  phone."  </P> <P> Chrysler researchers also have found, he said, that after the priorities of  reliability and safety, little things mean a lot. Drivers want details such as  more storage capability. "Women want somewhere to put their purse, people ask  for tissue bins and trash bins, and parents want pockets in the back seat for  kids' stuff," said Creed, who added that Chrysler first introduced a coffee cup  holder in the 1984 Le Baron "and it's amazing how popular it is. It has become  a staple for our cars.  </P> <P> "Some of the high-tech stuff is interesting, but I think the telephone is the  nearest we would get. I don't see us adding a PC and a fax right away."  </P> <P> Ford, too, is taking a hard look at the cellular phenomenon, interior designer  Rees said. "As a company we have never offered a telephone that you can order  with the vehicle, but now there is so much interest that we are examining the  possibility. But we're not ready to commit on anything like that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking Inside  </P> <P> What his designers are ready to commit on, he continued, is the interior of the  car. "The focus has been traditionally on the exterior designs, and in the '70s  and '80s we got into a bland, boring life style with ho-hum interiors," said  Rees, who's coined a phrase for interiors of the '90s: "I call it the 'Wow!'  factor."  </P> <P> It's not just the look of the interior, he said, it's also the function. "The  comfort level is important, the location and shape of switches, the shape of  the seats, but on top of that, we want what we call surprise and delight  features: Little things that please you."  </P> <P> Like the rest of the industry, Ford is looking at domestic cars in Japan (where  new technology is traditionally tested at home before being exported) with  extras such as on-board TV, satellite navigation systems, and a head-up display  system. In the latter, an image of dashboard information, such as speed, is  projected on the windshield in the driver's sightline, so he or she doesn't  have to look down.  </P> <P> The global advent of highly computerized cars with luxurious interiors is not  welcomed universally. (Grumbled one engineer: "Science and technology have  advanced to the point where you can turn the car into the bridge of the  Starship Enterprise, but what's the point?")  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Human Factors  </P> <P> And even as industry spokesmen wax enthusiastic, emphasizing the safety and  utility of the new technology, some human factors specialists share designer  Pelly's concerns about technological "collision."  </P> <P> Tom Rockwell, a consulting engineer in Columbus, Ohio, works with auto  companies to determine how test drivers handle new technology such as cellular  phones and navigational systems.  </P> <P> "My concern is how much time a driver has available for all this electronic  stuff," he explained.  </P> <P> His feelings are mixed: "There are some wonderful things coming out on  dashboards, and commuters who spend a lot of time parked on freeways would have  time for a lot of this equipment. But if you're driving, you only have 1 1/4  seconds to attend to a display before looking back at the road.  </P> <P> "I see an increased visual workload. You have to be sure when you introduce  something like this."  </P> <P> In other quarters, environmentalists and mass transit advocates are dismayed by  the emphasis on the personal car at a time when air pollution is becoming an  international problem.  </P> <P> Still, the marketplace beckons. "As much as people have talked about other  means of transportation," Rees noted, "American people want cars. We love  cars."  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Digital Equipment founder to hand over presidency MR KENNETH Olsen, the founder of Digital Equipment, the US computer maker, is to retire at the end of October. He is to be replaced as president and chief executive at Digital by Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's vice-president of manufacturing and logistics. A pioneer of the computer industry, Mr Olsen, aged 66, played a large role in the emergence of the minicomputer revolution of the 1970s. 'I've had a long and satisfying career at Digital and it's time for the next generation of management to assume leadership,' he said. Mr Olsen's departure marks the end of an era in the computer industry. He is the last of a generation of founders of minicomputer companies, which had an impact in the computer industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Over the past few years, however, Digital and other minicomputer companies, have taken the full brunt of wide-scale changes in the computer industry brought on by the introduction of low-cost personal computers and workstations. Industry analysts have viewed Mr Olsen's departure as overdue. There has also been broad discontent among senior executives at Digital who believe the company missed its chances in workstations and open systems. Many felt that this was in large measure because of Mr Olsen's reluctance to accept fundamental changes in the industry. However, Mr Olsen's achievements have won him great respect and a key place in the history of the computer industry. He was one of the first in the industry to recognise the potential of semiconductor integrated circuits which could carry out many of the functions of a mainframe computer at a fraction of the cost. Mr Olsen founded Digital in 1957 and has been its only chief executive officer. His successor, Mr Palmer, said yesterday that Mr Olsen was a computer industry pioneer and an architect of innovation. 'His vision of interactive and distributed computing has been revolutionary.' Mr Palmer joined Digital in 1985. Previously he was one of the founders of Mostek, a semiconductor maker acquired by United Technologies in 1980.</p>

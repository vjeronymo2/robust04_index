			<p>BFN     [Text] Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs declared that  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's order on creation of military  bases on the territory of CIS states and Latvia makes conclusion  of the Russian-Latvian agreement on troop withdrawal impossible.  Birkavs declared this at a briefing staged after a special  sitting of the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday in Riga  which considered this order issued by Yeltsin.    As it was reported earlier a package of interstate  agreements  determining the date for troop withdrawal from Latvia, namely  August 31, 1994 and several additional provisions, including the  one concerning Russia holding on to the early-warning radar in  Skrunda for 5.5 years, is being prepared now to be signed by  Latvian and Russian presidents. At the briefing, Birkavs  pointed out that the initialled agreements do not stipulate that  this site would have the status of a military base.    The official statement of the Latvian Cabinet says that "the  Latvian government has never agreed and will never agree to  create Russian military bases on Latvian territory and to test  new armaments and military equipment on its territory, it also  rules out the possibility of any negotiations on these issues."    Birkavs added that the order of the Russian president  appeared "under the influence of Russia's conservative circles  whose goals coincide with the interests of Latvia's national  radical circles -- to prevent conclusion of the Russian-Latvian  treaty."</p>

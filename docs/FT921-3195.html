			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Irish SE insider probe at Greencore THE IRISH Stock Exchange has taken the unusual step of revealing that it had carried out an insider trading investigation into the recent sale of part of the Irish government's holding in Greencore, the sugar and foods group. It said 'the Exchange has found nothing that would lead it to believe there were instances of insider dealing involved. The Exchange points out that its normal policy is to neither confirm or deny that it conducts insider dealing investigations in particular cases. However, it feels that in this case the level of public concern involved justified making an exception'. Last month the government sold a third of its 45 per cent stake in Greencore to an institutional fund manager. This breached an undertaking made at the time of its flotation in April 1991, that the government would not dispose of any further shares in the company for at least two years. The move angered institutional investors, who were not offered the 12m shares on a pro-rata basis, and shook confidence in the government's commitment to the company.</p>

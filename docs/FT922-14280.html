			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Convenience stores behind advance to Pounds 13.4m at T&amp;S T&amp;S STORES yesterday announced a 10.7 per cent increase to Pounds 13.4m in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 as depressed profits from Supercigs, the tobacco retailing subsidiary, were more than offset by growth from its expanding convenience store network. Profits from property disposals amounted to Pounds 550,000. Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, said he was 'delighted' with the results since, he estimated, 'footfall' or throughput on Britain's high streets fell by some 8 per cent from the previous year. T&amp;S, which operates 583 tobacco, newsagent and convenience stores in the UK, said the slump in consumer spending forced the company to cut cigarette prices at Supercigs, where operating profits fell 1.9 per cent to Pounds 3.85m. But convenience stores, which became a priority after the 1989 purchase of Dillons and Preedy from Next, increased sales by 63 per cent to Pounds 52.1m and lifted operating profits 95 per cent to Pounds 3.15m. The number of stores almost doubled to 86 and margins were lifted by central distribution and expanded purchasing power. The group's 285 confectionery, tobacco and newsagent stores (or CTNs) lifted operating profits nearly 20 per cent even though sales were ahead only 2.6 per cent. During the year the company's Fantasia 'pick 'n mix' confectionery line was introduced to roughly one in five CTNs. Group turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 314.2m (Pounds 283.1m). Earnings improved 14.9 per cent to 15.71p (13.67p), helped by a lower tax charge. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 3.25p to make a total dividend of 5.5p, a 10 per cent increase. COMMENT T&amp;S's shares have suffered of late, falling from 220p two weeks ago to 193p yesterday, a 6p fall on the day in spite of results slightly ahead of expectations. The gloom probably stems from fears about the company's minimum wage, which at Pounds 3.08 is well below Labour's pledge of Pounds 3.40. Any forced upwards revision would be damaging to T&amp;S's low margin businesses, and could only be mitigated by sharply improved productivity, a question the company is already trying to address. Longer term, growth will have to come from convenience stores and Mr Threlfall is sticking to his plan to increase the number of these outlets to 250 in the next couple of years. While the strategy appears sound, achieving that level of growth will probably require another sizeable acquisition. Forecast profits of Pounds 14m give about 12 times earnings. After rising 52 per cent last year, the shares may need to consolidate further.</p>

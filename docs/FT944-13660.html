			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie - Theatre '. . . And she is mine for life.' We do not need to be 'of an impressionable age' - we do not even need to be female - to recognise that, in Miss Jean Brodie, Muriel Spark created a mythic heroine, absurd and disturbing, who embodies all the inspiring yet misguided teachers whose attention at school we once tried to win. On the one hand, this Edinburgh schoolteacher enjoying her prime in the 1930s, is an icon as camp and transparent and quoteworthy as EF Benson's Lucia - whom she so closely resembles, with her linguistic and cultural pretensions. On the other, she is a pathetic martyr - sacrificing adult love for the sake of her teaching and 'her girls', intoxicating them with misplaced Romanticism, and wilfully making false predictions of the glorious futures ahead of them. What are those futures but projections of the lives she herself might have led? Between these two extremes, Miss Brodie is 'loveable' - a word that acquires crucial importance at the very end of the play. Her girls love her, and two of her male colleagues are in love with her. She herself talks repeatedly of the importance of love. Yet love is what she has placed on the altar of teaching. And it is in her prediction that Jenny will be a great lover, a DH Lawrence heroine, that she most obviously tries to make her students live her life by proxy. She errs more criminally, however, in stuffing fascistic propaganda into the girls' heads: which leads to the death of poor, silly Mary MacGregor. Indeed, her only true prediction is that Sandy will be a spy. Sandy, the cleverest girl in the class, becomes the Judas among the Brodie girls, because she sees that Miss Brodie has really been betraying them. This is one of the ironies in which Spark's tale abounds. The play which Jay Presson Allen made of the book catches many of them, though it goes overboard at first on the Brodie cliches and campery. The role of the heroine was a famous vehicle in the 1960s for Vanessa Redgrave (onstage) and Maggie Smith (on film); and in the 1970s Geraldine McEwan starred in an excellent TV version in which young Lynsey Baxter was a hauntingly acute Sandy. It was high time for a new Miss Jean Brodie, and it was possible that Patricia Hodge might be good in the role. She has the bite, the elegance, the element of frigidity. She is, however, neither loveable nor intoxicating. And, thanks surely to Alan Strachan's direction, her performance stays entirely on the surface. I do not mean that she makes overmuch of the role's camp bravado, but simply that she never really reveals the woman's nervous system. There are psychosexual connections between Miss Brodie's repressed love and everything most characteristic about her teaching, but here no one helps us see them until the words spell them out late in the proceedings. Hodge has her moments, especially when speaking or behaving quietly; but moments do not make a role. The most persuasive performance is given by David Yelland as Teddy Lloyd, the married art master whom she loved and who loves her, though Strachan has let Yelland be too dour. Edith Macarthur, as the headmistress Miss Mackay, lacks gravitas, and Simon Scott, as the music teacher Mr Lowther, gives the most superficial performance of all. The brief 30-years-later scenes, which add such resonance to the story, are tepidly played here. Jackie Morrison as Sandy (somewhat reminiscent of Baxter's TV performance) gives a very fair account of a tricky role. But Strachan's direction fails most obviously in his handling of schoolgirl life. He makes it a kind of Mallory Towers; whereas the life of the Brodie girls, however funny, should be psychologically sharp and alarmingly real. Miss Brodie needed to be revived, but here she and her world are too safe, too light, too neat. At the Strand Theatre, WC2</p>

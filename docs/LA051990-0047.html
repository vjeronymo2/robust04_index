			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO BLINDING WOMAN WITH ACID  </P> <P> A Hacienda Heights man pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of throwing  corrosive acid in the face of a Glendale woman last July, blinding and  disfiguring her.  </P> <P> Emad Fawzi Kalta, 20, was arraigned in Glendale Municipal Court on charges of  aggravated mayhem, mayhem resulting in great bodily injury and assault with a  caustic chemical. He is being held without bail in Los Angeles County Jail.  </P> <P> If convicted, Kalta could be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of  parole, said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Dahle. A preliminary hearing was  scheduled for May 31.  </P> <P> Kalta was arrested by Glendale police Thursday in Hacienda Heights. Authorities  declined to say how long they have considered Kalta a suspect or why it took so  long to make an arrest.  </P> <P> Dahle said he is not sure of the motive in the attack but said it may have been  an act of vengeance triggered by a dispute between members of the victim's  family.  </P> <P> According to a police report, Kalta approached Shushan Eloyan, 23, from behind  as she walked down a sidewalk in the 100 block of Adams Street in Glendale and  asked her for the time. In front of other pedestrians on the sidewalk, he threw  a jar of acid in her face as she turned toward him, the police report said. Her  eyes remain closed.  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, Eloyan said she recognized her assailant as a friend of  her stepbrother. However, she said she did not know his name. She said family  relations have been strained since her mother and stepfather were divorced in  1988. A restraining order prohibiting the stepfather from contacting or  visiting Eloyan or her mother was issued in Burbank Superior Court last May.  </P> <P> Dahle, who filed the charges Wednesday, said police were investigating whether  others, including Eloyan's family members, may have been involved in the  attack.  </P> <P> "We suspect there's a link," Dahle said. "There's got to be a reason for this  kind of attack. It's usually an act of vengeance." Eloyan, a refugee from  Soviet Armenia who was attending Glendale Community College at the time of the  attack, has since undergone several skin-graft operations and will have eye  surgery in June in the hope of regaining some sight, she said.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Two French food groups show first-half increases TWO of the leading players in the French food industry, Eridiana Beghin-Say and Saint-Louis, yesterday lightened the gloom in the French corporate sector by announcing healthy increases in net profits for the first half of the year. Saint-Louis, with extensive interests in sugar and paper, saw net profits rise by 30 per cent from FFr356m (Dollars 69.8m) in the first half of 1991 to FFr462m in the same period this year. This increase includes the benefit of Saint-Louis' investment in Perrier, the mineral water company which was the butt of a recent bid battle between Nestle of Switzerland and the Agnelli family of Italy. Saint-Louis, which sided with the Agnellis during the bid, took a stake in Perrier only to sell it at a profit to Nestle. Saint-Louis' sales rose from FFr5.32bn to FFr18.16bn and operating profits from FFr365m to FFr719m because of the decision to consolidate its 39 per cent stake in the Arjo Wiggins Appleton paper group. Eridiana, also a significant player in sugar representing the restructured food interests of Ferruzzi of Italy, saw net profits rise from FFr464m to FFr572m in the first six months of 1992. It sees a 'similar rate of growth' for the full year. Operating profits rose 24 per cent to FFr1.67bn and sales by 22 per cent to FFr24.1bn, reflecting the contribution of recent acquisitions such as Ducros, the spice company.</p>

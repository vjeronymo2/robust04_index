			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Motor trade and BT to create data 'highway' British Telecommunications and two retail motor-trade associations have joined forces to create what they hope will become an electronic data interchange 'highway' for the motor industry. The project, which links BT with the Retail Motor Industry Federation and the Automotive Distribution Federation, is designed to allow low-cost communications and the undertaking of a wide range of transactions between all parties involved in selling, financing and maintaining vehicles. To start with transmissions will relate to vehicle servicing and invoicing between dealers and customers. However, 'it will develop to encompass product and parts ordering, service information and advice, finance, insurance and much more', said Mr Trevor Parkerson, business development manager of the RMI, which represents most sections of the retail motor trade including about 7,000 franchised car dealers. None of the main carmakers and importers however, has been directly involved in creating the network. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the main trade voice of the manufacturers and component producers, has been developing a separate data highway - although this is concerned more with manufacturer-supplier relationships than with retailing. But both the RMI and SMMT agreed yesterday that the systems could be 'very compatible'. As for manufacturers of cars and commercial vehicles, each has developed its own data interchange systems with dealers. Mr Alan Pulham, head of the RMI's National Franchised Dealers Association, agreed its members would need persuading to adopt the planned highway's protocols for their own transactions. Called the Automotive Transactions Highway, the RMI-initiated venture can use existing dealer-management systems hardware. The first 'Fleetlink' enables motor retailers to exchange purchase and service orders with fleet customers with a start-up cost of Pounds 300 and running costs of about Pounds 50 a month.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIRECTOR OF TIME RESIGNS; DOESN'T CARE FOR SHOW BIZ  </P> <P> Time Inc.'s decision to expand in Hollywood by merging with the entertainment  giant Warner Communications Inc. apparently does not sit well with the Texas  lumberman on Time's board.  </P> <P> Arthur Temple, former chairman of Time's divested Temple-Inland lumber and  forestry subsidiary, is resigning from the board because the entertainment  business is "not a type business I can be proud of," according to a Warner  proxy statement released Tuesday.  </P> <P> "This is not to say I feel it will not prove profitable," added Temple, who  controls 3% of Time Inc. stock. His stake is the second largest; only Henry  Luce III, heir of the Time founder, holds more shares.  </P> <P> Temple, 69, who voted for the merger despite his reservations, could not be  reached late Tuesday at his home in Diboll, Tex.  </P> <P> He is one of three members of the current Time and Warner boards who have not  been nominated to the 24-member board that will oversee Time Warner when the  merger is completed. The others not nominated are Clifford J. Grum, president  of Temple-Inland, and Henry C. Goodrich, former chairman of Sonat Inc.  </P> <P> Separately, the proxy statement disclosed that Time may have to dispose of some  cable systems to comply with government rules against owning a cable system and  a television station in the same market. A Time spokesman said five Southern  California systems could be affected because a major Warner shareholder,  Chris-Craft Industries, owns KCOP-Channel 13.  </P> <P> He identified those cable systems as American Cablevision of Orange, ATC  Cablevision of San Marino Inc., ATC Cablevision of South Pasadena Inc., Canyon  County, ATC Cablevision and Time's 50%-owned Paragon Cable system, which serves  Hawthorne and Torrance.  </P> <P> Fewer than 100,000 subscribers are served by those five systems, the spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Kathryn Harris in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

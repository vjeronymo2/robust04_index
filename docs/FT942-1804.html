			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: News Corp ratings seen as 'positive' Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday described as 'positive' the outlook for the debt ratings of News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australian-based media group. Moody's said that this assessment was based on an 'expectation that the company's debt protection measurements will continue to improve as cashflow increases'. However, the agency warned that 'further rating improvements could be tempered by aggressive investment strategies'. The agency has the group's senior debt on a Ba1 rating, and last upgraded this ranking in October 1993.</p>

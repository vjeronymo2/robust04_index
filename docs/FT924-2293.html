			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Military force sought over Serb flights INTERNATIONAL pressure for the use of force to implement the 'no-fly' zone over Bosnia, imposed by the United Nations last October, was stepped up over the weekend, with both the US and France calling for military measures against Serbian aircraft violating the ban on flights. Following the adoption of an unusually tough declaration condemning the leadership of Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs by European Community leaders, Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said France would formally ask the UN Security Council to authorise the enforcement of the zone. The original Security Council prohibiting military flights over Bosnia did not specify how the ban on flights would be enforced. Mr Mitterrand's announcement followed a statement earlier on Saturday by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the Secretary of State in the outgoing US administration, that the US was now also ready to back the use of force against Serbian aircraft. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, joined Mr Eagleburger in expressing over the weekend a hardening on the US position. The decision has the backing of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president-elect, who had spoken in favour of enforcement the previous day. President Mitterrand went a step further than the declaration of the European Council, which merely stated that the 12 leaders reaffirmed their support for Security Council resolution 787, 'which provides for the necessary measures, including military, to be taken to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance.' But there can be little doubt that opinion among other members of the Security Council, including Britain, which has so far been very hesitant about the adoption of measures that could endanger the lives of British troops of the UN contingent in Bosnia, is swinging in favour of some kind of military action to prevent Serbian aircraft from violating the UN ban. In its declaration on the former Yugoslavia, the European Council accused both the Serbian and Bosnian leadership of bearing 'the primary responsibility' for the conflict 'and its brutality' in the region. 'In defiance of UN Security Council Resolutions, the Serb forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina have undertaken a savage campaign of military aggression, ethnic cleansing and the persecution and torture of civilians,' the EC leaders said in their concluding document. 'Those responsible for all these crimes against humanitarian law by the different sides will be held personally accountable and brought to justice.' The Council said that it would not accept the partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina and strongly supported the efforts of the co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to achieve a constitutional settlement which would recognise the multi-ethnic character of Bosnia-Hercegovina. It also called for more action to provide protection to the civilian population. The leaders stated firmly that the autonomy of the province of Kosovo within Serbia must be restored and said that it was in favour of 'a UN presence' in Kosovo. In a separate declaration on the treatment of Moslem women in the former Yugoslavia, the European leaders said they were 'appalled' by the systematic detention and rape of Moslem women.</p>

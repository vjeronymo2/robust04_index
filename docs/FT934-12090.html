			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Anyone who has ever doubted that war is seriously bad for your health should watch Critical Eye: The Dirty War (C4, 9.00) which looks at mystery illnesses experienced by survivors and the authorities' attitudes to them. Some cases have been attributed to the effects of allied bombing of chemical works, others to burning oil wells. Inoculation with drugs - some experimental - to protect troops against chemical and biological warfare has also been targeted as a possible cause. One way or another at the moment, half one's conversation seems to be about law and order. Question Time (BBC1, 10.30) concentrates on the subject with a special edition and a panel which includes George Carmen, QC, perhaps still pink with triumph from Virgin Atlantic's libel victory over British Airways. Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes (C4, 10.00) does a lot for brother-sister incest and even serves the London's Docklands landscape rather well. This is a memorable film with superb acting by Alan Rickman, as smooth and sinister as a melting waxwork.</p>

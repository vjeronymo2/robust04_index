			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Treatment of futures fund advisers under review THE UK's Securities &amp; Futures Authority is reviewing the treatment of trading advisers to futures funds, following representations from futures fund managers. The issue will be discussed by the SFA's capital committee, which is made up of market practitioners, on February 1, an official said. However, the SFA is not expected to meet demands for a separate membership category for trading advisers. According to an SFA official, this would not be viable due to the small number of trading advisers supervised by the SFA. Currently, they are treated in the same way as arranging brokers who have some discretion over funds but do no handle clients' assets. Consequently, they face more onerous requirements than advisory firms. However, a reduction in the capital requirement for trading advisers is being considered, based on the fact that they are not paid according to transaction volume and do not have control over clients' funds.</p>

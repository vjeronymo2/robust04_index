			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Upbeat Blair hails Labour as 'party of the people' Mr Tony Blair yesterday hailed Labour's return to the mainstream of British politics and claimed the government had 'run out of ideas'. The Labour leader used an exceptionally upbeat new year message to launch a blistering attack on the Conservative party's 'feeble' leadership and to seek to capitalise on the cool response of Tory Eurosceptics to Mr John Major's latest appeal for unity. As Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Tory chairman, attempted to hit back, claiming Labour was still 'rooted in the past', Mr Blair said the Conservatives were 'so obsessed with their own internal divisions' that they were incapable of governing. Labour was back as 'the people's party, back in the mainstream, speaking up for the majority'. The Conservatives, meanwhile, were devoting their energies to 'attacking us, misrepresenting our policies and attacking each other'. Meanwhile, despite the prime minister's call on Wednesday for an end to the party's infighting over Europe, the battle with rebel MPs raged on. Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, who was among those suspended from the parliamentary party for failing to support the government in a confidence vote on Europe last month, said: 'The real tragedy is that the parliamentary party appears to be out of touch with its supporters in the constituencies and also with the majority of the general public. 'Mr Major could not only unite the party, but also have a much better chance of winning if he would identify the real issues in Europe and take a strongly Euro-sceptic line on them.' Another Eurosceptic MP, Mr Tony Marlow, said it was up to Mr Major as leader to prevent the party tearing itself apart. 'He knows the feelings of the people, he knows the feelings of the Conservative party. It is up to him to harness those feelings to the necessary policies,' Mr Marlow said. But Mr Hanley dismissed the rebels, saying: 'There are nine MPs saying that they're the only ones in step and that the 321 others are out of step. That's a very small tail trying to wag a very big dog.' Launching a Conservative document dismissing Mr Blair's so-called 'new' Labour party as a 'cynical if elaborate exercise in public relations', Mr Hanley said Labour was 'reactionary' in its opposition to privatisation and industrial relations reform. 'Dogma still rules in the Labour party,' he said. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, in his new year message, warned that the European Union was 'in danger of dying'. In contrast to his attack on the Conservatives, Mr Blair spoke warmly of the prime minister's efforts to secure a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland. He said the government deserved 'great credit' for its role in the peace process in the province. Mr Blair said Labour would aim to use the year ahead to draw up a new constitution, stating in terms which 'cannot be misrepresented what we stand for and how we intend to govern'. The party would also accelerate its work on policy development in important areas such as the economy, law and order and education. It would seek to build on what he described as the 'stunning' growth in its membership. The party claims to have recruited an extra 56,000 party members since July, taking its total membership to more than 300,000. Mr Ashdown echoed Mr Blair's concern about the consequences of Tory divisions, saying Britain was governed by a party 'so riven by civil war and aflame with factionalism that it is incapable of governing effectively'.

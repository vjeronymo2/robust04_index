			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 9 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Algeria has  requested Malaysia's help to present its proposal for the  establishment of ties between the Maghreb Union and ASEAN.    Algeria, this year's chairman of the Maghreb Union, made the  request at a meeting between its foreign minister, Mohamed Salah  Dembri and his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi  during the latter's four-day visit from June 5 to the country.    Senior officials of both countries were also present during  the meeting.    A statement issued by the Malaysian Foreign Ministry  Thursday  [9 June], said Abdullah had promised to present Algeria's  proposal at the annual meeting of ASEAN's foreign ministers in  Bangkok next month.    He believed that there would be no objection to the proposal  since ASEAN had established ties with several regional groupings  such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, Rio Group and European  Union.    Hopefully a meeting between ASEAN and the Maghreb Union  could  be held during this year's session of the United Nations (UN)  General Assembly, the statement said.    During the visit, Abdullah also called on Algerian President  General Lamine Zeroual, and held discussions with Prime Minister  Mokdad Sifi.    During the bilateral discussions, both foreign ministers  also  felt that closer ties between Algeria and Malaysia could further  strengthen the South-South cooperation particularly within the  framework of Group-15.    Both countries also agreed on exchange of experience in  economic development, training, technical cooperation, trade,  investment, education and culture.    Being Islamic countries emphasising on development for the  people, Malaysia and Algeria agree on exchange of ideas between  their Islamic intellectuals on Islam and development, the  statement said.    On enhancing economic cooperation, Malaysia and Algeria had  agreed to look into and sign several agreements including those  on economic, scientific and technical cooperation, investment  protection and assurance, and waving of visa's requirement.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARCHING THROUGH THE CANYON TO PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN  </P> <P> Re the picture on the front page of The Times on Nov. 12:  </P> <P> You did an injustice to the thousands of people who marched to save Laguna  Canyon. The sign you chose to depict (Nov. 12) was the only one there referring  to a "class war."  </P> <P> The thousands marching and attending the rally were indeed "a well-mannered  cross-section of Orange County's middle class . . . to protest plans for more  than 3,000 homes and a golf course in pristine Laguna Canyon."  </P> <P> This is not a class war. This is a war between the people of Orange County,  wanting to preserve some nature and the beauty spots of our environment, and  the developers and elected officials, supporting insensitive development.  </P> <P> Our tolerance limit has now been reached, and it is time for all Orange County  residents to take a stand to save their remaining environment.  </P> <P> ROBERT STRICH  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

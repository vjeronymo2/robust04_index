			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Urdinola: "Prospects for 1994"] </F>   [Text] In 1993 Colombia's economy continued to behave much  as it did in 1992. Growth was based on sectors not affected by  international trade: construction, transportation, commerce,  finance, and other public and private services. Sectors involved  in international trade, essentially manufacturing and  agriculture, are becoming less profitable as a result of the  trade liberalization and revaluation of the last two years, plus  the low international prices of basic commodities.    The economy is actually operating on two different tracks.  Sectors not involved in international trade are growing at over  five percent a year, with prices increasing at about 28 percent,  and with high profits. Sectors involved in international trade,  on the contrary, are growing much more slowly; prices are rising  at less than 15 percent a year, while their average costs,  especially wages, are rising more rapidly, driving profits down.    It seems rather unlikely that in 1994 the world economy will  experience an expansion strong enough to significantly improve  international prices of the basic commodities we export or that  compete with our domestic production. So the only hope of  slowing down the gradual deterioration of businesses affected by  international trade lies in modifying the devaluation policy of  the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic, and  achieving more effective control of contraband and dumping.    Without such changes, the growth of the economy and jobs  will  remain dependent, as they are now, on a boom in construction and  services, especially public services because of the surge in  government spending. Personally, I do not believe in the  long-term solidity of an economy where the vitality of its  industry and agriculture is gradually decreasing. Construction,  financed partly by foreign capital drawn by attractive dollar  profits generated by revaluation, has demonstrated over and over  its cyclical character, and it continues to do. Nor is it  possible to indefinitely continue increasing public spending or  the tax burden to finance this spending.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Analysts fear fresh bout of turbulence - New York Wall Street has been very quiet over the past month, perhaps a little too quiet. The even tempo of trading may have come as a relief after this spring's impassioned sell-off. But with the period of relative restraint and stability now extending into its fourth week, some analysts fear the market is poised for a fresh bout of turbulence. 'The longer volume stays low, and the longer the market just inches along, the better the odds of an exaggerated move,' says Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. Since the immediate reaction to the Federal Reserve's fourth move to higher interest rates in mid-May petered out, the bear market has seemed more like a snail market. Excluding last week's closing session, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20 points, the blue-chip index has shifted 10 points higher or lower only four times since May 23. In most sessions, the Dow has stalled within a point or two of its opening level. For the most part, activity has remained sluggish. Even last Friday, trading was restricted to 222m shares. However, investors may look back on the session as a turning point of sorts. This week, the potential for faster-paced activity and sharp price movements looms larger. First, political instability is a wild card which could come into play, with the US attempting to formulate a response to North Korea's intransigence over nuclear inspections. US trade talks with Japan, and their impact on the dollar's value against the yen, also represent a threat to confidence. The issue of market timing will also re-emerge this week. On Friday, Wall Street faces the 'triple-witching' expiration of futures and options on stock indices, and options on individual issues. The consequent unwinding of investment positions is sure to exaggerate any underlying trend, especially in view of the thin level of trading recently. 'The risks for speculators is going to go up a notch,' says Mr Nie. This week also marks the beginning of the quarterly 'window-dressing' period, when activity traditionally accelerates. As the month draws to an end, portfolio managers will either add to their winning positions, or unload their losers, in the hope of casting their second-quarter performances in the most favourable light. Mr Nie is one of several analysts who believe most windows will be undressed in the final days of June, setting the stage for a big downturn. A brief spurt higher is certainly possible this week. The Kemper analyst points out that cash reserves remain low, even though stocks have now moved into a 'oversold' position. As a result, the market 'feels like it wants to move up'. 'But somewhere in here we are going to get a selling wave,' Mr Nie argues, pointing out that a hefty decline would help build up cash reserves. 'Until that issue is addressed, I have a hard time believing that we are going to get a sustained rally.'</p>

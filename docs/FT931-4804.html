			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Clinton agrees extra cut in spending proposals PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday agreed to cut an additional Dollars 55bn (Pounds 38.7bn) from his spending proposals after meeting budget experts from the House of Representatives, the White House said, Reuter reports from Washington. During the meeting with members of the House budget committee at the White House, Mr Clinton 'agreed to accept Dollars 55bn in additional cuts over five years', said White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers. She said the exact programmes that would be reduced were not yet determined. The deeper reductions were necessary because of revised figures by the Congressional Budget Office which showed that under Mr Clinton's proposals his plan to reduce the deficit by Dollars 140bn would fall short of the goal.</p>

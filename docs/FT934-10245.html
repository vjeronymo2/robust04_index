			<p>931106 FT  06 NOV 93 / Tories support tenancy change THE TORY party yesterday backed proposals by a Conservative MP to give greater rights to council house buyers. Mr Peter Thurnham, MP for Bolton North East, proposed in a pamphlet that it should be possible for council tenants to be given 40 per cent of the freehold of their houses, with first refusal to buy the remainder. He called for housing benefit to be capped and replaced by a fixed element in family credit, and for mortgage tax relief to be phased out. The pamphlet was welcomed by Sir George Young, housing minister.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Ofgas to act over power plant supply OFGAS, the gas industry regulator, will take action next week to force British Gas to change the destination of gas sold to National Power. The gas supply, sold three years ago for Pounds 1.5bn over 15 years, is earmarked for a gas-fired power station at Didcot in Oxfordshire. But National Power asked British Gas last year if it could transfer the supply to Little Barford in Bedfordshire. The electricity generator has started construction of the Little Barford 680MW power station, which should be operational in 1995. But it has put plans for its Didcot station on hold amid uncertainty surrounding gas-fired power while the government conducts its energy review. British Gas was reluctant to make the supply change because it did not want to be seen to encourage gas-fired generation while the subject is politically sensitive. Ofgas started legal proceedings against the company in December and is due to serve an enforcement order on British Gas next week. An enforcement order is Ofgas's highest legal power - it gives British Gas 28 days to comment on the matter, after which it becomes effective. 'We can't see why the issue is so controversial, but we've been discussing it with British Gas for nine months and each time we get near a resolution, they back away from it,' said Mr Greg McGregor at Ofgas. The enforcement order could allow other power generators to change the delivery site for their gas, but so far National Power is the only company to apply to do so. Ofgas's enforcement order will state that British Gas must come forward with new contractual arrangements for customers buying gas for power generation under the same terms as National Power. This will enable the company to change the site at which the gas should be delivered. British Gas is wary of making any changes to its gas contracts because it does not want to pre-empt the government's white paper on energy, due to be published in the next two weeks. National Power said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with Ofgas's action, and it had little sympathy with British Gas's view that the issue was politically sensitive.</p>

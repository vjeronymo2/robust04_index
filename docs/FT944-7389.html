			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T confirms interest in Bull AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, has denied it would only take a stake in French computer group Groupe Bull if the French government made more concessions in opening up its markets, Reuter reports from Paris. 'Those are separate issues,' AT&amp;T said yesterday. 'We are willing to take a stake in Bull and we are whole-heartedly in favour of the opening up of telecommunications markets in France and other countries where we cannot operate. 'The European Union decided on Friday to end the telecoms monopolies by 1998, and that's fine with us. Of course, we would like to see it happen earlier.' However, AT&amp;T has indicated it would like to see France make concessions before the US Federal Communications Commission approves a proposed link-up between state-owned operators France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom and Sprint, the US long-distance operator. 'We made a filing to the FCC on Friday saying we would welcome such a link up - provided we were allowed to do similar business in France and Germany,' AT&amp;T said. France Telecom, a 17 per cent shareholder in Groupe Bull, said it would inject FFr561m (Dollars 105.2m) into the computer maker before the end of the year, ahead of its privatisation.</p>

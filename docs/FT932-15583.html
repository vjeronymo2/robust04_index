			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Spain set for early poll as Socialists lose ground SPAIN'S EMBATTLED prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez yesterday called an early general election for June 6 in an attempt to staunch the losses his Spanish Socialist Workers party is suffering in opinion polls. The Spanish socialists are unlikely to suffer quite the same humiliation as their French counterparts did recently, but the conservative opposition Partido Popular has drawn level with the Socialist Workers party (PSOE) at around 33 per cent of the vote. It is also understood that a private poll carried out for the socialists in the past few weeks has, for the first time, shown the PP ahead. The most likely outcome of the election is that no party will win a majority in the 350-seat Cortes and that either the socialists or the PP will form a coalition with one or more regional parties. The likelihood that the socialists will lose their parliamentary majority means that a stream of important legislation due to have been passed this year may now be lost. This includes: statutes to give the Bank of Spain its independence; radical changes in pension fund administration; the separation of generation and distribution functions in the electricity industry; a law to govern the behaviour of strikers; reform of rent controls; the stripping of power of professional colleges in order to allow prices to fall. All are contentious and would need to be renegotiated under a government of a different complexion. Mr Gonzalez's move may also unsettle bond and foreign currency markets, with some market analysts predicting that Spain will soon come under fresh pressure to devalue the peseta. Mr Gonzalez has cut short his third term of office after failing, in a critical PSOE executive committee meeting on Saturday, to make good a promise made a week earlier that the party would assume political responsibility for a scandal over the illegal financing of its 1989 general election campaign. He had led the country to believe that senior party officials would resign because of the scandal. Instead, he was outmanoeuvred by PSOE officials and was forced to make a compromise in which no-one resigned, but which allowed him to appear to be taking sole control of the party. The financing scandal had deepened already serious divisions in the PSOE - largely between cabinet moderates and leftwing party managers - and the prime minister had to choose on Saturday between making an ethical point or keeping some semblance of party unity ahead of an election he would have had to call before the end of November anyway. Even supporters in the Spanish press were critical of the outcome of Saturday's meeting, but Mr Gonzalez's announcement to some extent mitigates charges that he was turning a blind eye to allegations of corruption. He had hoped to wait until the end of November in the expectation that the economy might, by then, have begun to show signs of recovery. Now, in his view, going to the polls in June will put the party to the ultimate test of political responsibility. Mr Gonzalez will run for a fourth term in office, but it is not certain that he will stay through a full legislature if the party wins. Poll results until now have reflected the government's difficulties with an economy in recession and a spreading slick of corruption charges, but Mr Gonzalez remains the country's most popular politician and the socialists appear the best organised of all Spain's political parties.

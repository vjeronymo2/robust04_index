			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Treuhand to sell strife-torn shipyards THE Treuhand privatisation agency, under pressure from striking east German shipyard workers, yesterday said it would sell off the core of the ailing Baltic ship-building industry this month, probably to Vulkan of west Germany. Mr Wolf Schode, spokesman for the east German agency, said the Treuhand would have to write off more than DM1bn (Pounds 340m) in debts and provide large state investments prior to any sale. Despite the likely sale nearly 10,000 employees of the three main shipyards and a diesel engine plant continued an occupation strike which began last week. The strike had been designed to prevent the state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Treuhand from selling off parts of the industry while letting the core collapse. Mr Schode said a rival bid by Kvaerner of Norway for east Germany's largest shipyard, Warnowwerft, would create Europe's largest shipbuilders, but 'leave the brains in Oslo'.</p>

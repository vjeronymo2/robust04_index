			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / People: Beckwith brothers stand down John Beckwith (left) and Peter Beckwith, two of the best-known property developers in the UK, yesterday resigned from the board of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the property company they created and sold at the peak of the market in 1990. SPP, part of Trygg-Hansa, Scandinavia's largest insurance company, which bought LET for Pounds 491m, says the management changes have been made 'to integrate the international property activities more closely with other investment and property operations of Trygg-Hansa SPP and to confirm the continuing commitment of SPP to its international property interests'. 'It was natural that one day the existing management of LET and SPP would go their different ways,' explains Anders Ek, the chairman of SPP's international property operations who has been appointed the new chairman of LET, as well as of its holding company and subsidiaries. The sale of LET to SPP was seen as a personal coup for the Old Harrovian Beckwith brothers, whose personal holdings were valued at about Pounds 40m each. Conversely, SPP has not yet benefited from its acquisition of LET, which made a loss of Pounds 150.9m for 1991. Peter Beckwith, chairman of LET, will leave the group, while John Beckwith will remain full-time with the group in Continental Europe. Stuart McDonald, joint chief executive of LET, will also leave the group. Nicholas Sheehan, a former partner of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley who is currently joint chief executive of LET, will become managing director of LET. Ek says the changes would lead to a lesser emphasis on development. 'As an institutional investor we feel that it is more within our corporate nature to focus towards property investment rather than development,' says Ek. The Beckwith brothers were associated with some of the most prominent developments in the UK, including the proposed Spitalfields development in the City of London and Birmingham's Bull Ring Centre.</p>

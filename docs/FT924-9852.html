			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ansbacher agrees S African offer HENRY ANSBACHER, the UK merchant bank, has agreed terms for a takeover by the First National Bank of South Africa which includes a higher payment to minority shareholders. The offer, which will be sent to shareholders shortly, values Ansbacher at a slight premium to its current market value of Pounds 52m. It is the first time a South African bank has acquired a British bank. First National plans to expand Ansbacher, which specialises in South African debt, to service its South Africa-based multinational clients. Pargesa, the Swiss investment group controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais, the Canadian financier, and Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian financier, has been keen to sell its 62 per cent stake for more than two years. Along with Kuwaiti-controlled Wafra Intervest, which has another 11 per cent, Pargesa has accepted an offer believed to be in the region of yesterday's closing price of 28p. However, Mr Richard Fenhalls, chairman, could not recommend that price to minority shareholders, which are now to be offered at least 10 per cent more at a price above 30p a share. Mr Fenhalls, who was brought in to rescue the bank from near collapse in 1985, is expected to relinquish the chair within six months but continue his connection with the bank as a non-executive director. First National has made it clear that it intends to replace Mr Fenhalls and most of the directors with its own appointees. The only senior board members to stay on will be Mr Gordon Adam, a director of the bank, and Mr William Guinness and Mr David Sebire, directors of the holding company. First National has told Ansbacher that it intends to keep most of the 97 staff. The South Africans approached Ansbacher in May when it learnt that Mr Fenhalls was resisting a takeover by Singer &amp; Friedlander. Ansbacher's return to profit - it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.1m) in the six months to end-June following losses of Pounds 8.2m for 1991 - will be underlined in the offer document containing details of increased profits for the nine months to the end of September. Shareholders' funds exceed Pounds 80m with only a small amount of corporate lending.</p>

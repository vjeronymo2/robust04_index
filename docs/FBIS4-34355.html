			<p>BFN     [Text] "I give the orders here. I have the authority, and  it is my duty to do so; it is unnecessary to look for other  reasons because these are routine changes," said General Luis  Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, in  angry reply to a question concerning the latest changes within  the Armed Forces.    He added, quite simply, that he imparts orders because he is  the leader of an institution that must be maintained to fulfill  any mission that emanates from the Constitution of the Republic.    Gen. Discua Elvir denied that the changes in question are  indicative of a purge or a generational struggle. He said that  comments to this effect are made for the sole purpose of  distracting the general public.    When asked why Colonel Lazaro Avila Soleno was not removed  from his post while others were, Gen. Discua Elvir emphatically  replied "because I am the one who imparts orders in the Armed  Forces."    Meanwhile, he gave assurances that there will be no further  changes because the changes that had to be made have been made.  He added that there is no unrest within the Armed Forces  because everyone knows that those who were removed had held  their posts for over three years, and these changes are  established in the Armed Forces Law.</p>

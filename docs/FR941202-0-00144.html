			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Should the Department, contrary to the drug testing rules, permit or require the employer to stand an employee down in this situation? If the employer stands an employee down in this situation, should DOT rules mandate that the employer pay the employee for the ``stand down'' period? In any case? Only if the confirmation test is negative? These are difficult and troubling questions, to which the best answers are far from self-evident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is not to say that the issues of invasiveness, added procedural complexity, and stand-down are incapable of resolution. But is it worthwhile, from the point of view of employers, employees, and the Department, to create a new component of the alcohol testing program carrying these problems with it? The basic rationale for adding blood testing to the program is that, in its absence, employers will ``miss'' post-accident and reasonable suspicion tests. That is, there will be situations in which, because breath testing cannot be made available within eight hours, a post-accident or reasonable suspicion test that the regulations call for will not take place at all. In some number of these cases, blood testing might be available where breath testing is not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How often will there be reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests that are ``missed'' because of the unavailability of breath testing that would be ``caught'' by blood testing? Our expectation is that there would be a small number of such situations. First, occasions for post-accident and reasonable suspicion tests are likely to be far fewer in number than occasions for pre-employment and random tests. The motor carrier industry accounts for 7.0 million of the approximately 7.8 million transportation employees who will be subject to alcohol testing. FHWA's very stringent criteria for post-accident testing (only a (1) fatal accident or (2) an accident in which the driver is issued a citation for a moving violation plus either (a) there is disabling damage to a vehicle or (b) an injury requiring immediate medical treatment away from the scene results in a post-accident test) mean that only a small percentage of all motor carrier accidents are likely to result in post-accident tests. The nature of drivers' jobs, which do not involve frequent or long-term observation by supervisors, suggests that there will be relatively few occasions for reasonable suspicion tests. The pipeline industry, in which most accidents happen because of non-pipeline employees damaging pipelines (e.g., construction crews digging into a pipeline), and in which employees may often operate in remote locations with little supervision, appears to share this relatively low probability of reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing. We also anticipate few ``shy lung'' situations, and Part 40 has a provision to deal with them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other industries, which involve closer supervision of employees and/or broader definitions of triggering accidents may produce somewhat greater rates of post-accident or reasonable suspicion test situations. (In one of these, the railroad industry, post-accident blood testing is done by FRA under a long-standing rule using an FRA contract lab. Nothing in this today's action in any way changes FRA's existing requirements involving blood testing.) However, since the absolute numbers of employees in these industries are much smaller, they will have less of an effect on the total number of such occasions. Even in these industries, the numbers may not be very high. Data from the aviation industry, for example, suggests that there have been relatively few post-accident or reasonable cause drug tests (e.g., 720 out of 268,809 total tests conducted in 1993 under the FAA rule).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This brings us to the next factor. What data we have from situations where reasonable suspicion/cause tests have been administered for both drugs and alcohol suggests that there may be substantially fewer such tests for alcohol than for drugs. For example, recent railroad industry data suggest that of the total of such tests, alcohol tests made up only about 17 percent of the total.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we expect that a substantial percentage of the reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing situations can be ``caught'' by breath testing. This is particularly true in those industries (e.g., the railroad, transit, and aviation industries) where employees perform most safety-sensitive duties on known routes or in known locations, and where supervision is more readily available. Even in the motor carrier industry, the provision in the FHWA rule that allows use for purposes of the DOT testing program of results of tests conducted by law enforcement can help to reduce the incidence of ``missed'' tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, there are likely to be some situations in which no testing method <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _including blood_can be brought to bear in time to conduct a post-accident or reasonable suspicion test. The oft-mentioned example of a truck accident at 2 a.m. on a remote highway in the middle of the desert may well be an example of a situation in which blood, as well as breath, testing will not be available in a timely manner. Certainly it would be a doubtful assumption that all, or perhaps even a majority, of tests that would be ``missed'' with breath would be ``caught'' with blood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, if we added blood testing to the alcohol testing program as proposed in the NPRM, we would be incurring the disadvantages of such a step in order to catch a subset of a subset of the universe of all reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol tests required under the Department's rules. This universe itself will probably not be a large one. Many of the tests can be caught by breath testing. Of those that cannot, many could not be caught by blood testing either. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

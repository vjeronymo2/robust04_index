He  pointed out that railway operation must also be adapted to the  market economy, and the change must be made resolutely.    Han Shubin reminded railway personnel throughout the country  to clearly notice the current difficulties: Railway  transportation is in serious short supply, and is far from  meeting the needs of rapid development of the national economy.  The railway system is operating in a difficult condition, and  the whole trade is running in the red. The shortage of  construction funds is increasing, and this seriously constrains  railway development. The foundation for industrial safety is  not solid enough, and there remain a lot of hidden perils.    He said: The basic industrial attributes of the railway  system and the short transportation capacity also make it harder  to change the management and operation structure. However, if  the railway system does not carry out in-depth reform and does  not move into the market economy, it will encounter even greater  difficulties. In 1994, the Ministry of Railways will focus the  reform on the measures of adopting the corporate system on a  trial basis, transforming the government institution functions,  promoting railway construction joint ventures, and expanding the  scope of opening up.    Han Shubin pointed out: The adoption of the corporate system  should proceed according to the characteristics of this trade.  The main forms should be sole corporations and  limited-liability corporations. This year, the Fuzhou Railway  Subbureau will start the pilot scheme for reorganizing itself  into a corporation; the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Corporation  will carry out the pilot scheme for adopting the joint-stock  system, and arrangements will be made to list its shares on  stock exchanges; the pilot scheme for adopting the joint-stock  system will also be carried out intensively in the Nanning  Railway Corporation, and will be extended to the whole of the  Liuzhou Railway Bureau if conditions are ripe.    Han Shubin stressed the need to grasp the opportunity as  international capital is interested in investing in China's  railway construction, and called for further opening up this  aspect. When expanding the use of government-arranged foreign  loans, the railway system should also make efforts to attract  more direct foreign investments and to set up more cooperative  production projects.    Han Shubin mentioned, for the first time, the need to make  full use of Hong Kong's role as an international financial and  entrepot trade center and to develop the railway system's  operation in Hong Kong. At the same time, it is necessary to  increase economic exchanges with neighboring countries and  regions, greatly develop international coordinated transport,  especially transport across the continental bridge and by  container transport, and encourage the exportation of railway  products, labor services, and technologies.    It is learned that in 1994, China's investment in railway  construction will be 29 billion yuan. There will be seven key  construction projects, namely, the Beijing-Kowloon railway, the  Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway, the Baoji-Zhongwei railway, the Houma-  Yueshan railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway, the  Nanning-Kunming railway, and the West Beijing Station. In the  whole year, 2,100 kilometers of new railway lines will be laid;  and 1,335 kilometers of railway lines will be turned into  double-track lines.    In 1994, the railway transportation plan will arrange the  transport of 1.56 billion tonnes of freight and the transport of  640 million tonnes of coal. When formulating these targets, the  authorities gave consideration to the fact that the additional  capacity of railway transport will not be large, the  reconstruction projects along some existing railway lines may  affect the railway operation to a larger extent, the size of  capital construction in the whole country will be cut down  appropriately, the market demand for coal transport will change,  and passenger transport demand will increase.    Reportedly, railway development will be facing a serious  shortage of funds in 1994. The railway system will operate in  the red and the business deficit will amount to 7 billion yuan.</p>

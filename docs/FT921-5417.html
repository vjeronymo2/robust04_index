			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Appointments: Fuelling the flames As part of the fall-out created by the departure of Malcolm Edwards, who last week resigned as British Coal's commercial director, a long-standing colleague, Michael Butler, steps into his shoes as the new chairman of British Fuels (BFL). British Coal owns 50 per cent of BFL, the UK's leading coal and oil distributor, and appoints two of the six directors. Butler, who is finance director of British Coal, had, with Edwards, been instrumental in the buyout of BFL in 1988 and had been on the board since. Martin Garrett, British Coal treasurer, joins the BFL board as the second British Coal appointee. David Port, chief executive of BFL, which preserves an arm's length relationship with its largest shareholder, says that Malcolm Edwards had made 'a tremendous contribution in terms of his personal enthusiasm and drive, and the atmosphere he helped to create'. His replacement, a chartered accountant by training, is 'the archetypal finance director, who will bring control and a more structured management style', according to Port. An outspoken and highly experienced defender of the industry, Edwards, 57, had clashed repeatedly with British Coal chairman Neil Clarke. Both Edwards and Butler are veterans of British Coal, with 65 years' service between them. ***** Colin Drummond is moving to SOUTH WEST WATER from Coats Viyella Yarns Division, and not from Courtaulds Yarns as reported earlier. ***** Richard Green has been appointed financial director of VINTEN Group; he moves from Morgan Crucible. ***** Brian Morris, chief executive of MAGNETIC MATERIALS GROUP, also assumes the role of chairman. His predecessor, George Doust, is stepping down to become a non-executive director and will retire at the end of June. ***** Wayne Pearce has been promoted to regional director, UK and Ireland, for QANTAS. ***** Gregg Butler, group director of BNFL's UK Group, and Ken Jackson, group director, international, are appointed directors of BRITISH NUCLEAR FUELS.</p>

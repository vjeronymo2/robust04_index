			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Italy Come on Italy] may be the name of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new political movement but it also sums up sentiment towards the country's stock market. Italian equities have shot ahead by more than 40 per cent over the past year, outstripping gains in the UK, France and Germany. The market has been particularly strong since the start of 1994 with investors exhibiting steady nerves ahead of next month's unpredictable general election. Yesterday's 0.5 percentage point cut in the discount rate confirms some favourable trends. The lower lira has stimulated export gains. Economic growth has resumed. Emerging Italian mutual funds and overseas investors have pumped liquidity into the market in anticipation of earnings recovery. On Kleinwort Benson's estimates, the market has moved to a rating of 27 times 1994 earnings. The restricted choice of stocks may have led to some over-enthusiastic buying of big industrial groups, such as Fiat, Olivetti and Montedison, but the telecommunications and banking sectors are now gaining favour. The multiples on many second-tier Italian companies do not look so highly stretched. The worst case scenario for Italian politics - and the market - is that no clear government emerges and confusion reigns for several weeks. But, at least, the privatisation momentum is unlikely to stall. The right favours privatisation for ideological reasons, the left because it breaks the mould of economic power. Both recognise its financial imperative, given the size of Italy's deficit.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Joint production by CD and TV COMMODORE, the US computer maker, has combined compact disc technology with home computer techniques to develop a home entertainment system which can be used to play games, watch programmes or find out information using an ordinary television set. Plugged into a TV and hi-fi system, the CDTV player - which resembles a traditional VCR player - can display a combination of colour pictures, text and graphs and can play stereo music or speech. A series of windows incorporated into the picture on the screen enables viewers to choose various routes or sources of information by scrolling up and down with a remote control device. There are about 30 titles already available for use with the CDTV player in the UK, and Commodore says that up to 250 developers are working on new software in the US, UK and Germany. The company predicts sales of up to 80,000 CDTV units in the UK alone in the first year. That is in spite of a price tag of Pounds 599.99 for the player and three discs and around Pounds 25 for each extra disc. Commodore: UK, 0628 770088.</p>

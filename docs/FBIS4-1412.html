			<p>BFN     [Text] East London April 27 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] on Wednesday [27 April] ordered the  urgent printing of four million extra ballot papers for the  Eastern Cape region, said regional monitoring director Mark  Anstey. Earlier, several polling stations in the region were  shut down because of a lack of ballot papers and boxes and an  Independent Electoral Commission official described the position  as "extremely serious".    Speaking to representatives of political parties and  international observer missions in a long and often angry  meeting at IEC headquarters in East London, Mr Anstey promised a  full investigation into the reasons for the shortages.    "It appears the national plan simply underestimated the  volume of equipment and resources for the (voting) exercise," he  said.    There was simply no national reserve of ballot papers, he  said.    Appealing for parties' co-operation, he said some areas had  become "fairly volatile" and warned tensions could rise when  voters found themselves temporarily unable to cast their votes.    There had already been an incident in Mdantsane on Wednesday  when an impatient crowd became angry and troops had to be called  in to secure the polling station.    IEC Eastern Cape spokesman Mr Mike Chandler said South  African Defence Force helicopters had been seconded to take  voting materials to the transkei.    Voting boxes from previous elections were being taken out of  home affairs storerooms and pressed into service.    Mr Anstey said the four million extra ballot papers,  including the Inkatha Freedom Party's listing, would be ready by  Thursday morning. They were being produced by Port Elizabeth  firms which would not be identified for security reasons.    All IEC sub-regions had been told to gear themselves to  collect the ballot papers early on Thursday morning.    The under-supply of papers was so general that a  redistribution of papers from less-heavily used polling stations  was "simply not feasible".    Mr Anstey said it was the IEC's intention that everyone  would  vote and he asked party representatives to spread the word that  steps were being taken to ensure this. "By tomorrow (Thursday)  we believe we will be back on track," he said.    Provincial electoral officer Mr Dirk van Schalkwyk told the  meeting it was clear the regional population figures used by the  IEC were "completely under-estimated". He had pointed this out a  long time ago, he said.    Party representatives at the meeting gave their approval to  the printing and distribution of the extra ballot papers but  said they were concerned about the security of the printing  process.    IEC representatives said they would try to ensure that  international monitors, rather than party representatives,  oversaw the printing.    ANC representative Mr Hintsa Siwisa said the lack of ballot  papers was not the only problem causing concern to his party.    The ANC had discussed its problems, including irregularities  committed by electoral officers, with the IEC on Tuesday night,  but they were still occurring on Wednesday.    The ANC was becoming ever more convinced there was a  "conscious effort at undermining the process", he said.    Mr Chandler said earlier on Wednesday a decision by some  district electoral officers in the Transkei to unilaterally  increase the number of polling stations had added to the  organisational problems.    The IEC had 1797 stations on its books for the territory and  had supplied voting materials for this number.    "Today it appears there are more than 2,000. That's bloody  ludicrous," he said. "We can't supply them."    People who had turned up to vote and been unable to do so  were understandably angry, he said.</p>

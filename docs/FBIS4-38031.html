			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 27 Jun (MENA) -- The self-declared  presidential council in south Yemen has called for other  countries to intervene to stop the constant northern Yemeni  shelling of civilians and vital institutions in Aden and what it  termed "the brutal acts of repression by the Sanaa regime in the  occupied areas."    A statement issued by the council and faxed to MENA tonight  says: "The Sanaa regime has no respect for the resolutions and  pleas made by the international community. It has consistently  declared cease-fires, breached them, and blamed the southerners."    The statement accuses Sanaa's authorities of depriving  Aden's  inhabitants of water, saying that wells are the only source of  water following the destruction of water pipes and reservoirs  and the purification station.    The statement vows continuing "national resistance in the  occupied areas" and says that the southerners refuse to  surrender.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia has readmitted former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin after he slipped  back into Africa for three weeks, Arab diplomats in Jidda said. The burly,  61-year-old Amin returned to Jidda, the diplomatic and financial capital of  Saudi Arabia, about a week ago, the diplomats said. Amin fled to Libya after he  was ousted from power in Uganda in April, 1979. When Libyan leader Moammar  Kadafi rejected him eight months later, he was granted political asylum by  Saudi Arabia. Amin recently left his home in suburban Jidda on a false  passport, surfacing Jan. 3 in Zaire, where the government quickly expelled him.  </P></p>

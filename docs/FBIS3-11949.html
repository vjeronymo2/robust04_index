As part of the development of the Turquino plan, the whole  province is covered by the family doctor plan and education and  health centers for the population have already been guaranteed.  The mountainous areas make up 25 percent of Granma's provincial  territory, of which an area of approximately 900 km has been  electrified.</p>

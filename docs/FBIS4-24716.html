			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Makung Airlines will start  servicing a Kaohsiung-Laoag-Xiamen flight in June, offering  Taiwan travelers a cheaper and shorter route to Mainland China  than via Hong Kong.    Laoag is a city in the northern Philippines. Xiamen is in  coastal southern Mainland China.    "It will take about two hours and NT [new Taiwan] $11,000  (US$407) to travel from Kaohsiung to Xiamen via the  Philippines," said Makung's Chairman, Chen Wen-wu. It costs at  least NT$15,08, (US$555) and three to four hours to travel from  Taiwan to the nearest spot in the mainland via Hong Kong.    "The new route will significantly benefit residents in  southern Taiwan who previously have had to travel to Chiang  Kai-Shek International Airport in northern Taiwan because of the  shortage of seats for Kaohsiung-Hong Kong flights," Chen added.    Makung Airlines made the announcement that it would start  servicing the route Tuesday [31 May] after the company was given  permission by the government to conduct direct charter flights  between Kaohsiung and Laoag.    After arriving in Laoag, Taiwan travelers will be flown on  the same flight to Manila, there they will then board South  China Airline planes to Xiamen.    Makung will service the Kaohsiung-Laoag route with a Boeing  757 recently leased from the United States, while South China  Airlines is planning to offer a Boeing 737 service for the  Manila-Xiamen flight, Chen explained.</p>

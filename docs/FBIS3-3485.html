As some deputies attending the Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] put it, "Public  funds are cheap."    The major cases involving economic crimes recently reported  in the press had something in common -- it is too easy to  embezzle public funds. A bank accountant a little more than 30  years old was able to embezzle more than 30 million yuan in the  light of day; Shen Taifu of the Great Wall Machinery and  Electrical Engineering Company was able to embezzle 3 million  yuan from funds raised from the public. The NPC deputies said  these incidents show that China's legal system is still not well  established and the established laws, regulations, and systems  still have loopholes. They said in the process of building a  socialist market economic system, we must place great importance  on this problem. They also said: People committing corruption  or accepting bribes may be punished by law; but we can do  nothing about many things taking place everyday even we know  they are wrong -- such as using public funds to wine and dine,  to do sightseeing, for home decorations, and to buy expensive  sedans. The public money spent on such purposes usually amounts  to tens of thousands of yuan, hundreds of thousands of yuan, or  even millions of yuan. But, all these malpractices do not  constitute a crime, and so we can only complain about them.  But, if there are no effective measures to deal with this kind  of problem, simply complaining about them does not yield any  results.    The deputies hoped for enactment of more laws and  regulations  and for the refining of established laws and regulations; they  hoped that, in appointing and promoting leaders, greater  attention will be paid to their personal integrity, and  education in honestly performing one's official duty will be  regularly conducted among cadres. They also hoped that reform  will more closely link personal interests to those of the state  so that people will feel that spending public funds is like  spending one's own money. They said, if such comprehensive  measures can be taken to deal with the problem, there will be  hope that "public funds may appreciate."</p>

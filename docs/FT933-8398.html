			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Economics in the new Japan AFTER 40 years of Liberal Democratic party domination, Japan's economy, as well as its politics, is unlikely ever to look quite the same again. The seven-party coalition government, gratefully grasping the reins of power and with the possibility of a second election not too far ahead, has every incentive to change the rules of the economic as well as the political game. For years, US governments have been demanding a shift in Japanese government and household behaviour from saving towards consumption, in order to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Now, independent of US pressure, the change in underlying economic and political circumstances may be about to deliver the fall in Japanese national saving and the trade surplus that the US has long desired. What will drive a reduction in the trade deficit is the strong rally in the value of the Japanese exchange rate which has occurred over the past month. The yen has appreciated by 22 per cent against the US dollar since the beginning of the year, and by 15 per cent since the election in mid-July. For the moment, the combination of the yen appreciation and depressed demand for imports means that the dollar value of the trade surplus is still rising. But the yen rally will inevitably bite into the competitiveness of Japanese exporters. Export volume growth is already slowing. Still, the pace at which the trade deficit falls will depend on how fast imports rise and thus on the strength of domestic demand over the coming year. The economy's recent hiccups, the political outlook and the changing power balance between the politicians and the bureaucracy all point to the possibility of a faster recovery than would otherwise have been the case. A cut in interest rates by the Bank of Japan would be the most effective way to revive Japan's still sluggish economy. If the government is really worried, an easier monetary policy would also be the most effective way to stem the rise in the yen. But the stimulus is more likely to come from another fiscal package in the second half of this year. The Ministry of Finance will fight hard to resist the income tax cuts that the new government appears to favour. The risk is that, despite the opposition of the bureaucrats, a weak coalition will rush to buy the support of voters through profligate fiscal policy. But even if it is still sufficiently powerful to prevail on tax cuts, the ministry will have to sanction some form of fiscal loosening. Yet the most significant fiscal policy changes are likely to be those which encourage a fall in private, rather than government, saving. Japan's households have traditionally been big savers only partly because they wanted to save. The web of taxes and regulations that the LDP spun to attract its rural constituencies also made consumption difficult and expensive for urban dwellers. In the new world of Japanese politics, the re-drawing of constituency boundaries, the re-balancing of representation towards urban areas and the apparent decline in political support for the Socialist party all make the interests and concerns of urban voters much more important than before. The government thus has an opportunity to remove many of the distortions - particularly concerning the ownership, use and transfer of land - which have traditionally impeded consumption and contributed to the emergence of trade and financial imbalances over the past decade. By removing the disincentive to private consumption, while keeping a tight grip on fiscal policy in the medium term, the new government could also reduce the trade deficit and achieve a permanent improvement in US economic relations. US administration officials, however impatient for signs of short-term fiscal policy activism, would be wise to sit on their hands and see what develops.</p>

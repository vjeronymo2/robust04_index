			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> 20TH-CENTURY WORKS FEATURED AT LA JOLLA CHAMBER FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Chamber music may be rarefied and elitist in its mystique, but audiences for  the genre respond in the same ways other crowds do: Virtuosity is applauded,  musicality appreciated, charisma admired and glamour rewarded. Not necessarily  in that order.  </P> <P> All these virtues popped up, at one time or another, in the two weekend  concerts of SummerFest '90, the annual August celebration of the La Jolla  Chamber Music Society. But in combination with negative elements: oddball  programming, some low-energy performances, as well as unfocused playing and  singing.  </P> <P> There were some novel aspects in both the Friday and Saturday night concerts in  Sherwood Auditorium at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art.  </P> <P> Heiichiro Ohyama, artistic director of the fest through its five-year history,  sprinkled music by 20th-Century composers into these two programs: Bruce  Adolphe's Quartet for oboe and strings (1978), Edgard Varese's "Density 21.5"  and two works by Andre Previn, his "Peaches" for flute and piano (1974) and  Five Songs on Poems of Philip Larkin (1978).  </P> <P> Saturday night, in his spoken program notes, Previn himself, disparaging the  title composer-in-residence Ohyama bestowed upon him this summer, promised a  receptive audience some more recent works of his composition if he is invited  back. Nevertheless, the two pieces from the 1970s heard Saturday proved highly  effective.  </P> <P> As played by Carol Wincenc, "Peaches" turned out to be an affecting, languorous  and savory lullaby -- in D, with pungent chromatic accents -- a five-minute  reverie that sings but never cloys. At the piano, the composer became an ideal  partner for flutist Wincenc.  </P> <P> As downbeat as "Peaches" is upbeat, the five Larkin songs reach the listener  through pointed word-setting and a musical subtext of considerable potency.  </P> <P> Christine Cairns, familiar in Southern California through regular visits with  the Los Angeles Philharmonic, seemed less than well-cast in this assignment:  Her characteristically handsome, even mezzo-soprano appeared effortful, her  control of vocal detail unsteady. Still, with pianist Previn guiding the way,  the singer made much of the quiet dramatic points in this touching suite.  </P> <P> The rest of the Saturday performance emerged a splendid exhibit of virtuosity.  At the end, pianist David Golub displayed his chops in an irrepressible  run-through of Mendelssohn's early Sextet for piano and strings, Opus 110. Even  the most jaded chamber-music aficionado might have dropped his jaws at Golub's  flying 32nd-notes and octave runs -- all of his technical feats accomplished  with a clairvoyant musicality.  </P> <P> Wincenc, another deservedly acclaimed wizard of technique and tone, opened the  program with Debussy's "Syrinx" and the Varese piece, giving in both an object  lesson in resourceful, pertinent music-making.  </P> <P> Despite clever programming -- two novel eight-minute pieces before  intermission, and Brahms' big Sextet, Opus 36, after -- the Friday-night  concert failed to rouse the listener above a pleasantly somnolent state.  </P> <P> The problem in the G-major Sextet was a failure of leadership. All six players  -- violinists Franco Gulli and Robert Chen, violists Cynthia Phelps and  Francesca Martin, cellists Carter Brey and Gary Hoffman -- played  conscientiously and in careful balance. But no strong musical thread held this  performance together; it merely moved along.  </P> <P> Adolphe's brief Oboe Quartet, played by Gerard Reuter, with violinist Deborah  Redding, violist Martin and cellist Diane Chaplin, is a charmer, a wistful,  melancholy piece in the contemporary style of Geoffrey Burgon's deservedly  admired score to "Brideshead Revisited."  </P> <P> At mid-program, mezzo Cairns was joined by pianist Golub and a string quartet  in Chausson's ironic "Chanson Perpetuelle" in a performance of generalized  emotions, questionable intonation and missing textual point. Those listeners  who had not encountered the work before ought to be told: It's better than this  reading would lead you to believe.  </P></p>

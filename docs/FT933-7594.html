The cabin, which was shared by six strangers, displayed a sign explaining that smoking was allowed 'by consensus'. In the middle of the night five sleepers were awoken by the sixth occupant, a burly soldier going home on leave, who asked if it was all right for him to smoke. Yes, it was agreed after some eye-rubbing, he could smoke. 'Oh good,' he said, 'anyone got a cig?'</p>

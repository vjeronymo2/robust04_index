			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vote move boost for GUS THE NEWS from Great Universal Stores that it is to enfranchise its non-voting stock sent the 'A' and the ordinary shares shooting forward, exciting other stocks with dual voting structures on the way. It also prompted a welter of speculation over the future of one of the most secretive retailing empires, with analysts divided as to whether the move could make GUS ripe for break-up - or whether it might prompt it to become more acquisitive. Spice was added to the rumours by the appointment of Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, the chairman of Next, to the GUS board yesterday, with some speculation that the two groups could be planning closer ties. The share-change announcement was made with the group's results, which came in line with market forecasts but with a higher than expected dividend. The shares jumped on news of the enfranchisement. The ordinary finished 100 ahead at 3438p, after touching 3600p, while the 'A' added 110 at 1875p, after 1920p. Turnover was 3.3m, the heaviest ever recorded for the stock. Other dual voting stocks were put in the spotlight. However, analysts were mostly sceptical that other companies would follow suit in the near term, although they conceded that the investor enthusiasm that had greeted the GUS move could have a longer term effect. In the case of Whitbread, drinks analysts pointed out that the cost of dilution to compensate the current voting shareholders might far outweigh any other benefits. Such consideration took the shine off the non-voting 'A' shares, which ended just 2 up at 481p, while the 'B' shares fell back to finish level at 998p. Other stocks were seen as more likely candidates. Hammerson ordinary climbed 16 to 353p and the 'A' 15 to 322p as takeover rumours also circulated. WH Smith 'A' gained 9 at 447p and the 'B' 2 1/2 at 88p.</p>

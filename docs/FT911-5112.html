			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There was good general demand except for the plainest teas, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Bright liquoring descriptions and better mediums sold well at dearer rates. The balance of the offerings were barely steady with plainer sorts a weak feature. Coloury Central Africans remained fully firm but others showed an easier tendency. Ceylons attracted less competition at mostly lower rates with some withdrawals. In the offshore auction Kenyas met limited and selective support but other origins came to a good enquiry at marginally lower levels. Quotations: quality 275p, medium 112p, low medium 72p.</p>

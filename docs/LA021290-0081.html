			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN AIRLINES SHOWING LESS INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA MARKET;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THE CARRIER HAS CUT ITS CAPACITY IN THE STATE BY 40%. RIVALS  SAY THE MOVE HELPS SUPPORT HIGHER FARES IN THE STATE.  </P> <P> American Airlines, the nation's biggest airline, is an also-ran in California.  </P> <P> It moved into the state in a big way when it bought AirCal three years ago, but  now, it appears, American has lost some interest in California -- the nation's  biggest travel market. Consider:  </P> <P> * It leased four former AirCal Boeing 737s to Braniff Inc., taking the aircraft  out of the California market.  </P> <P> * It dropped all intrastate flights from Oakland.  </P> <P> * It reduced by half the number of its daily flights to the Los Angeles basin  from San Francisco.  </P> <P> These actions were part of American's plan to cut its capacity in the busy  California corridor by a whopping 40% during the past 18 months.  </P> <P> And, according to an executive at a competing airline, these cutbacks have  helped support higher air fares that have recently come under fire in the state  Legislature.  </P> <P> "When you reduce the number of seats, you can increase the fare," said Richard  Sweet, a marketing executive with Southwest Airlines in Los Angeles. Normally,  that would chase passengers away, he said, "but American has very, very loyal  frequent fliers, so the strategy works for them."  </P> <P> According to industry information obtained by The Times, American isn't the  only airline cutting back in California. USAir -- the state's largest carrier  since its 1987 purchase of Pacific Southwest Airlines -- has trimmed its  capacity in California by 25% during the past 18 months. USAir said there  wasn't enough demand to support so many flights on some of its north-south  routes.  </P> <P> But American's cutbacks are clearly the most drastic, and they come at a time  when other airlines, such as United Airlines and Southwest, are putting more  planes into California. Many in the industry expect that American, as a result  of its cutbacks, will soon drop to No. 3 in the state, behind USAir and United  Airlines.  </P> <P> American acknowledges that -- as its actions suggest -- California is not a top  priority.  </P> <P> "There are things we need to do everywhere, and there simply aren't enough  airplanes to do it," American spokesman Alton W. Becker Jr. said. "We had to  make judgments about which markets were most important to us. We could not  sustain the level of service in California and do other things in our system."  </P> <P> Becker said American doesn't plan to restore any California flights. "We're  satisfied with our service levels in California."  </P> <P> American's cutbacks are starting to attract attention from state legislators,  who complain that Californians are not getting good air service.  </P> <P> David A. Roberti, a Democratic state senator from Los Angeles, has proposed  legislation that would set up a state office "to protect consumers from these  kinds of actions," he said.  </P> <P> Roberti's legislation, approved by the Senate about two weeks ago, would create  an Office of Airline Consumer Protection to monitor complaints about airlines.  Though the office would not have the power to regulate airlines, Roberti  contends that informed consumers can force change on an airline, even if  government can't.  </P> <P> The legislators are particularly concerned about air fares, which have climbed  dramatically in the last decade or so. The state Public Utilities Commission  found that fares between the Los Angeles basin and the San Francisco Bay Area  rose 40% in that time, while average air fares elsewhere in the nation  declined.  </P> <P> The PUC said it did not have enough information to determine why fares rose so  sharply here between 1978 and 1988, and no one has linked the 10-year climb in  fares to American's actions.  </P> <P> However, American's reductions raise questions about its decision to pay $225  million for AirCal, which was a major carrier between the Los Angeles basin and  the Bay Area. The corridor linking the five Los Angeles basin airports with the  three in the Bay Area accounts for 80% of air travel within the state.  </P> <P> In 1986, AirCal alone had 252 daily flights within the state. Today, after  taking an ax to AirCal's schedule, American has only 92 flights in the  California corridor.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, industry analysts and others familiar with American say the AirCal  acquisition benefited American because it gave the Dallas-based airline  hard-to-get gates at Orange County's John Wayne Airport and greater exposure in  California.  </P> <P> "I've always maintained that it was a good deal for AirCal and for American,"  said David A. Banmiller, a former president of AirCal who joined American after  the merger as a vice president involved with its international operations. Now  an airline consultant in Orange County, Banmiller said the AirCal deal gave  American "greater consumer exposure in the Western marketplace, . . . a chance  to put more product on the shelf."  </P> <P> The fact that American is reducing its presence in California doesn't mean that  the AirCal purchase was a bad deal, Banmiller said. "Airline schedules are  continually adjusted to fit changing situations."  </P> <P> In the past year, American has focused its attention primarily in the East. It  has pulled aircraft out of California to develop a hub in Miami. American  targeted Miami to take advantage of difficulties at rival Eastern Airlines,  which was weakened last year by a machinists union strike and bankruptcy court  proceedings.  </P> <P> This year, American plans to pour resources into Dallas-Ft. Worth, its  headquarters. The airline recently announced a $276-million expansion there  that would add 100 daily flights and 55 airport gates, although it faces  opposition in Dallas from some who think that the move will increase airport  congestion.  </P> <P> On the West Coast, American has concentrated on creating a route network within  California to feed its hub in San Jose, where, according to a recent state PUC  study, it controls 50% of the traffic. For example, flights headed to the Bay  Area from Burbank and Long Beach go only to San Jose.  </P> <P> San Jose serves as the West Coast link in American's route system, connecting  with other major points, such as Dallas and Chicago. "Our strategy is to focus  on hubs, and links to the hubs," said Becker, the American spokesman.  </P> <P> Typical of this strategy is American's plan to begin service to Honolulu from  San Jose next month, or its longer range goal of providing service between San  Jose and Tokyo.  </P> <P> "American is an east-west airline," said Paul Turk, an analyst with Avmark, a  Washington aviation consulting firm. "They look to California to feed their  other routes."  </P></p>

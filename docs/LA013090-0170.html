			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PLAYER REPORTEDLY CLAIMS ILLINI OFFERED HIM MONEY  </P> <P> The NCAA investigation of the University of Illinois basketball program, which  centers on the recruitment of freshman Deon Thomas, apparently blew open with  testimony from a current Notre Dame player, according to a published report.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an assistant coach at the University of Iowa has denied that his  school was the one that turned Illinois in for the Thomas recruitment.  </P> <P> Citing unidentified NCAA and University of Illinois sources, the Chicago  Tribune reported in today's editions that LaPhonso Ellis, a widely recruited  high school standout from East St. Louis, Ill., told investigators he was  offered money to play at Illinois.  </P> <P> Ellis, a 6-foot-9 center, chose to attend Notre Dame after his 1988 graduation  from East St. Louis Lincoln High School.  </P> <P> Neither Ellis nor Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps would comment on the  allegations, the Tribune reported.  </P> <P> According to the newspaper, Ellis was questioned about the allegations by both  NCAA investigators and attorney Mike Slive, who has been conducting the  University of Illinois investigation.  </P> <P> Assistant Coach Jimmy Collins, the chief recruiter for the Illini, has become  the focus of the investigation, and the school has barred him from recruiting  on the road until the matter is settled.  </P> <P> The probe has centered on a taped telephone conversation between Thomas and  Iowa Assistant Coach Bruce Pearl in which Thomas reportedly said he would  receive $80,000 and an automobile if he attended Illinois.  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Driveway dispute THE driveway of my mother's home is adjacent to the pathway of her neighbour's at the boundary line, though it is higher by some 18 inches. The neighbours have allowed the concrete surface of their pathway to crack. Rain has caused movement of the underlying soil, lowering the surface of the pathway and exposing and moving the soil beneath my mother's driveway, which has cracked. A large portion of the otherwise well-constructed driveway will have to be and replaced. Has my mother any claim for negligence? Are there legal safeguards she can adopt to prevent a further costly occurrence? If the damage is caused by natural seepage of rainwater which has not been artificially collected by the concrete your mother would have no claim in law against her neighbour. The position might be different if the pathway itself supported your mother's driveway and had been in place, with that effect, for more than 20 years. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

Types of activities could include grand rounds, short courses, workshops, or curriculum development. Topics, for example, could include materials or programs on: improving the knowledge and skills of health care providers in determining potential hazardous substance exposure as an integral part of their patient workup (i.e., taking exposure histories); environmental toxicology; environmental epidemiology; and health risk communication. General environmental education activities must also be evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B.

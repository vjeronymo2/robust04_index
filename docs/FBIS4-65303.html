			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F> Left secretary: "Left Wing, Come Out of the Corral"]    [Text] The first thing that we can say is that Italy is  deeply humiliated by this administration: humiliated by its  quality, which does not reflect the country's cultural and civic  level, humiliated by the way, which cannot fail to offend us, in  which the negotiations on the government have been conducted,  humiliated by the mountain of lies and subterfuges deployed in  an attempt to conceal the fact that the old system is back with  us. It is not a matter of acknowledging that if the Right has  won it is entitled to govern. We have fully acknowledged this  right.    The country's humiliation emerges from something quite  different: from the lies, from the mockery of the "promises"  that the Right had made before the voters. We cannot forget  that the electorate has been tricked into believing in a new  force opposed to party rule and jockeying for position. A fine  way of opposing party rule! What we have in the field is a  party-cum-corporation that dominates the political news and  electoral propaganda markets, whose Big Brother face stares out  from the walls of every Italian city, while the free  associations of men and women known as parties lack the material  resources to compete in this monstrous, unattainable financial  challenge. This in itself shows that we are not embarking on  the second phase of the republic, a reconfigured, pluralistic,  democratic European country with a majority voting system, but  that we run the risk of finding ourselves in a sort of republic  run as a family firm and kept under the thumb of financial and  media power.    An arrogant, cynical power: Indeed, Berlusconi heads the  list of candidates for the European elections in all five  constituencies, knowing full well that, as he is prime minister,  he will have to resign five minutes after he has been elected.  This is a fraud committed against the voters, who would thus be  cheated of their vote and called upon to sanction a caricature  of a plebiscite.    Is this supposed to be the advance of change? What really  confronts us is a government crammed with men linked with the  old power system, as numerous media commentators have pointed  out. Of all the many hoaxes, this is the greatest. Can Italy,  which has been massed for two years in the stands of the great  multimedia stadium of courtroom politics, shouting its  indignation at the kickback city scandal, admittedly in an, at  times, excessively judgmental and vindictive spirit, now fail to  notice that, when all is said and done, Bossi, despite his many  feigned protestations, and Fini as well, have brought back to  power that "second estate" of intrigue that dominated the last  years of the republic? Everything has been changed to give more  power to those who already influenced, and at times dominated,  the transversal politics that had been attempting for some time  to destroy not party rule -- which was sacrosanct -- but the  parties of the poor, the chance for the humiliated and oppressed  to band together to defend themselves.    We have heard ministers in this government state shamelessly  that promises are only made during election campaigns to catch  votes. Indeed, the dream has already faded: The million jobs  have faded away; the promise to form a government avoiding long  drawn-out interparty negotiations has faded away; the promise of  substantial tax reductions all round has faded away; the  principle whereby the prime minister-designate would choose the  ablest men best suited to the jobs, leaving aside considerations  of party expediency, has faded away. The result staring us in  the face is not a competent right-wing administration of the  type that we have seen in France and Britain, with men and women  of quality. No, this administration is enough to make one shed  tears of national shame.    For us, the opposition, it could well turn out to our  advantage. But we love our country, and we do not want to see it  humiliated. We tremble at the mere idea that the forthcoming  European elections could take this "new" ruling class beyond the  frontiers of Italy and reveal it for what it is: the worst in  Italian cunning, opportunism, and demagoguery placed at the  service of those who have always held power. Indeed, we go into  Europe with a government to which the president of the republic  has felt the need to address an anxious admonition, warning it  against the risk that failure to take a clear stance on issues  crucial to government policy and to democratic life itself may  damage the republic both without and within its frontiers, and  even calling on it not to adopt political positions contrary to  the principles of freedom and legality fundamental to our  constitutional charter -- an event of enormous, extraordinary,  disquieting import! Yet it all ended in a thumbing of noses.  This is what is so worrying: If the conscience of a nation has  been mithridatized to this extent, the obscure evil can attack  and defeat it at any time.    But we are convinced that a better Italy has great resources  and that the match is by no means over. We shall be a definite,  clear- cut opposition, a democratic opposition, firmly anchored  to the principles and values of our constitutional charter.  However, we have not yet reached an alternative-platform stage.  As has been perspicaciously pointed out, the disquieting  malaise revealed by the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and  Berlusconi no longer allows us merely to put ourselves forward  as the spearhead of a vigorous opposition in a normal  alternative-platform situation; it has turned us into the  champions of a democracy that appears to be heading in a  dangerous direction. Weighty words, but born of the somber,  unprecedented events leading up to the formation of the  government. Either Scalfaro was joking, and I rule that out, or  his words are stones. We regard them as stones to be removed.    This is why I feel the need to reply to the boy whose faint  voice cried, "Wake up, left wing!" on yesterday evening's  "Milano-Italia" [television current affairs talk show with  audience participation], because it is not true that we have  been laid low, there are a lot of us. The Left must wake up,  drop the false issues, fight off those who increasingly want to  herd us into a corral and keep us there. A wide-awake Left is  also a Left that finds the right language to talk to the 60  percent of Italians on the left and in the center who did not  vote for the Right. There is already a potential new majority.  Let us bring it to life, without imposing hegemonies, with due  respect for individuality, but let us bring it to life, if we  want Italy to have its hope, self-confidence, and prestige  restored.</p>

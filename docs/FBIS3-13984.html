			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Prakash Singh, former director general of Border </F> Security Force: "To Win the Kashmir War"]    [Text] Kashmir represents the greatest threat to national  security today. The separatist movement constitutes the biggest  challenge the country has faced to its unity and integrity since  the dawn of Independence. Is the problem intractable? Is there  no way out? Are we sinking into a quagmire? I don't think so. I  believe that if some hard decisions are taken, the situation  will definitely change, and from the long term point of view,  for the better.    There is no getting away from the grim reality that  infiltrations will have to be stopped or at least very  substantially reduced if we are to contain militancy in the  valley. The security forces, despite the fact that they operate  in an unfriendly and inhospitable environment, are doing a  commendable job. Militants are being apprehended and liquidated  every day. Seizures of arms, ammunition and explosives is a  continuing process. Their figures make an impressive tally.    The fact remains that Pakistan has been replenishing the  militants' losses. It is a running battle between losses  suffered by militants on one hand and fresh induction of trained  personnel, Kashmiri and other nationalities on the other. Our  objective must be to see that losses are more than the  accretions. It is difficult to say if we have arrived at that  balance yet. We have to remember that Pakistan has been pumping  in enormous resources to keep the Kashmir pot boiling.    That being the situation, it is essential that the movement  of men and material across the line of control is reduced to a  trickle. This was achieved in Punjab. Today, when people talk  with a sense of euphoria over terrorism having been contained in  that state, they forget that it happened only after the border  was virtually sealed by barriers, human and artificial ones,  ensuring that the supply of oxygen in the form of weaponry and  infiltration was choked. Once that happened, the flame of  terrorism naturally withered.    How do we translate that in the situation obtaining in  Kashmir? The border is being patrolled as effectively as it  could be by the Indian Army and the BSF. Yet the configuration  of hills being what it is infiltration continues. Fencing the  undulating snow-covered peaks is impossible. My suggestion is  that the valley should be fenced along the slopes of the hills.  It would amount to raising a barrier along the points where the  hills descend into the valley. The idea is that we should  insulate the valley from the surrounding hills, particularly in  the Pir Panjal Range. Once that is achieved, the security forces  will be able to decimate the terrorists in the bowl. I am not  saying that the hills should be cut off or left unguarded.  Movement from the valley to the hills or vice versa should only  be through gates which would be manned by the security forces  and where any person going either way could be thoroughly  frisked. The existing deployment of forces in the hill ranges  should continue and operations not only sustained but also  stepped up to the extent possible within the existing resources.    The strategy should be to stop infiltrations, deal with  those  who manage to enter the hills and, finally, prevent their entry  into the valley at any cost. Fencing paid dividends in Punjab.  There is no reason why it should not give results in Kashmir  where the militants' losses are being made up all the time.  Borders have to be secured and infiltration reduced to the  minimum if we are to break the backbone of militancy. Beyond a  point pumping in more battalions on internal security cannot  lead us anywhere.    The Jamaat-e-Islami is the soul of militancy in the valley.  We allowed this organisation to proliferate during the last  several decades. "Madarsas" were opened by the Jamaat in every  nook and corner of the state. The ideological indoctrination of  the young minds caused havoc. The youth today frequently seen  throwing stones or brandishing weapons are products of the  "madarsas". It is unfortunate that when the seeds of poison were  being sown, no action was taken and the State Government  preferred to look the other way.    Jamaat-e-Islami provides the ideological motivation,  sustains  and supports the separatists. Unless we strike at this  institution, it will be futile to expect militancy to be  liquidated or even controlled. Jamaat-e-Islami is a banned  organisation and yet no action has been taken against its  members in J&amp;K.    It is unfortunate that the loyalties of a section of the  government employees are open to question. They are like Trojan  horses in our camp. The security forces feel particularly bitter  about the attitude of these functionaries on sensitive issues.  They feel hamstrung in their operational efforts in the absence  of cooperation from the local administration. These government  employees are an unashamed lot and their brazenness is shocking.  Some even contribute a certain percentage of their salary every  month to the militants' coffers. It is a perverse kind of  peaceful co-existence. Their conduct is a great damper to the  moderate and sensible Kashmiris who are puzzled that the  Government does not take action against its own employees having  a nexus with militant organisations. It is an open secret that  several senior officers of the State Government signed a  petition to the UNO against the Government of India a few years  back. What loyalty or commitment could be expected of them is  anybody's guess.    Why can't we take action against them under Article 311(2)  and have these employees sacked? It is not necessary to sack all  and sundry. Exemplary action against even fifty employees  conveys the message.    If there is one lesson to be learnt from Punjab, it is that  the State Police holds the key to tackling terrorism or  insurgency. There is no doubt that the army and the paramilitary  forces made tremendous contribution to controlling terrorism in  Punjab. However, only after the Punjab Police was revived by  Rebeiro and given the required punch by K. P. S. Gill did the  tide turn.    Such a transformation is yet to take place in J&amp;K. The  State  Police has to demonstrate the will to fight the militants. It  needs a strong injection of strength, perhaps from outside. We  should be able to send hand-picked IPS officers for a minimum of  one year tenure to serve in J&amp;K. Accelerated promotions  could be  the incentive. The modalities can be worked out, but the  important thing is to give officers of appropriate calibre to  the state at all levels. It is not that J&amp;K Police is  incapable  of taking on the militants. It is, however, thirsting for  dynamic leadership. Once that is given, it would certainly show  better results.    Time is running out fast in Kashmir. Pakistan is getting  desperate. It is high time that a well-coordinated plan of  action is worked out and pursued with vigour.    *</p>

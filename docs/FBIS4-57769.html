			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Beatriz Abreu] </F>   [Text] Porto Alegre, 20 May (AE) -- Today, Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero responded to allegations that he is campaigning  for the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] by defending the  economic program formulated by Senator Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, the former finance minister and current PSDB  presidential candidate. Ricupero said: "I am not campaigning for  the PSDB. I am not linked to any party. Rather, I am a critic  of the PSDB." He added that the "PSDB is like a gay who has not  dared come out of the closet, as the Americans say. The PSDB  has sometimes failed to assume its role."    Ricupero even compared the PSDB to the old UDN [National  Democratic Union]. He said: "Although the PSDB has good  members, it is, like the UDN, a center party despite their  thinking it is a leftist party." He made these remarks with a  broad smile while mingling with approximately 100 businessmen at  the Rio Grande do Sul State Federation of Industries (FIERGS).    Under the watchful eye of FIERGS President Dagoberto Godoy,  Ricupero said he had "nothing against gays," and even confessed  to having a "gay friend." He drew the above comparison in  simple terms, and went on. He added: "No one can charge me with  campaigning for the PSDB. My son, who is with the Workers  Party, likes Antonio Gramsci," the Italian leftist ideologist.  In his opinion, the electoral campaign is focusing on the  personality of the candidates instead of on their government  programs.    Ricupero, who also questioned the manner in which the  electoral campaign is being conducted, said: "All we are hearing  is that Cardoso is this way, while Lula is that way, but no one  is talking about their programs." He added: "It is a mistake to  believe we will be electing a president who will have powers  similar to those of Juscelino Kubitschek or Janio Quadros. At  that time, presidents had full powers." Ricupero said the  situation "has changed radically, as we have a parliamentarist  constitution for a presidentialist system."    Ricupero defended the parliamentary system. Without  mentioning Cardoso's name, he said "the ideal thing" would be to  elect a candidate capable of promoting alliances. "If the  winner does not have a majority in Congress and cannot promote  alliances, he will not be able to rule," he said. He cited the  case of former President Fernando Collor, noting that "Collor  did not manage to stay in power, let alone rule."</p>

"We don't have any confirmation at the moment either with  AWACS (radar planes) or visually by Deny Flight pilots. Right  now we have nothing to substantiate or to confirm that such  attacks took place," a spokesman at the Supreme Headquarters  Allied Powers in Europe said.    According to military sources here, the UN spokesman in  Sarajevo who implicated Croat planes in the attacks on Vitez and  Novni Travnik based his statements on reports from the Bosnian  Government military.    NATO officials had been trying to confirm the bombings with  UN observers on the ground or from NATO planes monitoring the  situation, but had only been able to trace the source of the  story back to the Moslem-majority government, the military  sources said.    UN Protection Force spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman  said Friday that planes and helicopters launched rocket attacks  Thursday on areas controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian  Army in central Bosnia.    Aikman implicitly pointed the finger at the Bosnian Croat  HVO  forces who are fighting Moslem forces in the area.    Some 160 NATO planes are stationed in Italy and on aircraft  carriers in the Adriatic as part of "Operation Deny Flight" over  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

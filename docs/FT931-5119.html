			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Sterling's slide 'has boosted steel' MAKERS OF steelwork for construction have seen international invitations to bid for work rise at least 15-fold since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last autumn. Most of the invitations have come from continental Europe, a survey of order inquiries received by the 12 largest UK constructional steel producers shows. Prices of UK steel quoted in US dollars and other foreign currencies have fallen by up to a fifth since September. Manufacturers say that in some cases British steel is being re-exported to third countries. Mr Robin Booth, managing director of Booth Industries, said some Continental companies working on overseas contracts had been trying to make jobs more profitable by purchasing cheaper UK steel. The study, by the British Constructional Steelwork Association, shows that international invitations to tender and requests for price quotations received by the 12 largest companies involved more than 76,000 tonnes of steel in January and February. Until last autumn international inquiries had been averaging only about 3,000 tonnes every two months, said the association, which measures inquiries for jobs involving 750 tonnes or more. Construction of a medium-sized supermarket would normally in-volve about 200 tonnes. Mr Derek Tordoff, the association's director, said that since September companies had received inquiries involving 155,000 tonnes of steel compared with just 39,000 tonnes in the previous six months. More than two-thirds of these inquiries had come from continental Europe. British Steel said: 'It is too early to have an effect on our sales, given that it normally takes several months to translate inquiries into orders, but the trend is very welcome.' Some orders have already been placed. Mr Joe Locke, managing director of Watson Steel, said since devaluation his company had won four contracts worth 'a couple of million pounds' in Germany. Tetbury Structures in Gloucestershire said it had won a Pounds 750,000 job in Gibraltar because it had been able to undercut the labour costs of competing Dutch fabricators. A rise in export orders would provide a welcome respite for British fabricators, whose domestic output has fallen almost 40 per cent since 1989. Mr Tordoff said that since then more than 100 UK steel contractors had ceased trading or gone into receivership.</p>

He has already forced France to endorse the effort, after gathering  more than 1 million signatures in protest the Antarctic Mineral Convention,  which would allow commercial prospecting and exploitation of resources in the  Antarctic. Australia and New Zealand are among other nations opposing that  convention.  </P></p>

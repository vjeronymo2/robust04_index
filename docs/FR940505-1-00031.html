			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These reductions are made even more difficult_and costly_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they must come on top of years of significant efforts and reductions. For example, the South Coast area has managed a reduction in peak ozone levels of nearly 75% since its worst days of the mid-1950's. Yet it remains the center of the worst air pollution in the country. Sacramento and Ventura, though not facing the same extreme levels of air pollution as the South Coast, have also made significant strides in reducing ozone levels; but they, too, remain close to the bottom of any urban area ranking of air quality levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taken together, the cost associated with the proposed pollution control strategies necessary to reach attainment in these three areas ranges from $4 billion to $6 billion per year over the next 16 years. While these are not new, additional costs (they were included in the analysis done prior to the passage of the CAAA of 1990), clearly part of developing these plans is coming to terms with the fact_regardless of which governmental body assumes responsibility for the effort_that most of the emission reductions that were easy or inexpensive were achieved in these areas some time ago.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The obvious questions at this point are, ``What are the benefits of clean air for these areas? Is it really worth the cost?'' Ultimately, the second question will be answered by the citizens, and future citizens, who live in these communities. In order to make this judgement, citizens will need to know the answer to the first question. While we have a firm understanding of the many health, economic, and aesthetic benefits of clean air, quantifying these benefits has proved difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What we do know is that the reactivity of ozone causes health problems because it damages lung tissue and sensitizes the lungs to other irritants. Scientific evidence indicates that ambient levels of ozone not only affect people with impaired respiratory systems, such as asthmatics, but healthy adults and children as well. Regular exposure to ozone for 6&hyph;7 hours at concentrations  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> below <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the levels in the South Coast, Ventura or Sacramento has been found to significantly reduce lung function in normal, healthy people during periods of moderate exercise. Animal studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure to ozone for months or years can produce permanent structural damage in the lungs and accelerate the rate of lung function loss and aging of the lungs. It is also well accepted that ozone can cause significant crop yield losses, extensive damage to forests, and deterioration of buildings as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also know that exposure to elevated carbon monoxide levels is associated with impairment of visual perception, work capacity, manual dexterity, and learning ability, and with illness and death for those who already suffer from cardiovascular disease, particularly angina or peripheral vascular disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What we don't know enough about yet is how to assign a direct monetary value to protection from these air pollutants. Benefits such as reduced health care costs, increased employee attendance and productivity, increased crop yields, reduced materials damage, and a healthier ecosystem clearly have value. The quality of life values associated with more than 15 million people finally being able to breathe air free of unhealthful levels of smog and carbon monoxide must be added to the total as well. On balance, these values_when compared against the costs_were strong enough to compel the U. S. Congress to mandate that all Americans be provided with this public health protection. That is what the Clean Air Act is all about. Ultimately, these federal implementation plans, and the state and local efforts which will coincide with them, are about finally bringing that protection to the citizens of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

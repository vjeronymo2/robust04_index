			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL AND ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  </P> <P> Regarding Gorenberg's great article, it was written on such a high moral track  that it was uplifting to me personally as it would be to any offspring of  survivors of the Armenian massacres of 1915-1921 by the Ottoman Turks.  </P> <P> Turkish interference in the affairs of sovereign nations such as Israel is not  a new phenomenon, however. Open Turkish involvement in the internal affairs of  our country has long surpassed even intolerable levels.  </P> <P> My husband, former Rep. George E. Danielson, fought the Turkish lobby in  Washington all through the 1970s and early '80s as the Turks successfully  importuned the Nixon and succeeding administrations to join in its bankrupt  denial of the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Turks. Here's just one example  of Turkish interference: When Rep. Danielson was granted prior approval for a  contingent of the U.S. Marine Corps band to participate in ground-breaking  ceremonies of the Armenian Martyrs Monument in Montebello, Calif., the Turkish  embassy got wind of it and successfully persuaded the Nixon Administration to  cancel the Marine Corps appearance. Reason given by the Administration: "The  band needed to practice."  </P> <P> So, if "keeping good ties with Turkey is a shameful excuse for Israel's  lobbying against a memorial -- an American one, at that -- to the Turks'  massacre of 1 million Armenians," then the Bush Administration's lobbying  against that same memorial for the same reason is not only no less shameful but  morally corrupt and indefensible on any grounds, because it relegates the lives  and revered memories of 1 1/2 million Armenian martyrs to mere pawns.  </P> <P> And maybe Times readers are not aware that Turkey is also butting in on our  internal affairs by lobbying hard for the omission of the Armenian genocide in  the Holocaust memorial being built in Washington, D.C., even though the  original Monument Commission committed itself to include it.  </P> <P> Who listens, then, when the Bush Administration sounds off on lives lost at  Tian An Men Square in China? Selective morality is immorality!  </P> <P> CANDY DANIELSON, Monterey Park  </P></p>

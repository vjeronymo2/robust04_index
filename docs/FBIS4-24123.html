			<p>BFN     [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader  Afonso Dhlakama has returned a happy man from his visit to the  United States where he projected a positive image of his  movement.    On his return to Maputo, smiling broadly to journalists, the  Renamo president said he now had an aversion to war and weapons.    Amid doubts and distrust, journalists insistently asked him  whether Renamo has been handing over good quality weapons and  whether he is truly demilitarizing his forces. Dhlakama firmly  answered that he is no longer interested in taking up arms and  living in the bush as a guerrilla.    "I am a politician," he said, "and I am only concerned with  organizing my party."    He added: "We do not need to hide weapons. If you could  enter my heart, you would know." Amid journalists' doubts he  said: "I am speaking from the bottom of my heart."    The leader of the former rebel movement said he does not  want  war any more. He said in Rome on 4 October 1992 that he avowed  in his speech during the signing of the General Peace Accord  that he would never again resume war in Mozambique. Now, he  said, his major weapon "is the Mozambican people who will defeat  the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] if it resorts to war."    "I would like to see the problem of soldiers resolved as  soon  as possible. I would like to see them confined and demobilized  as soon as possible," Dhlakama said, recalling that he is now  the president of a party that has placed aside the military  option.    In a meeting with journalists at his residence in Maputo,  the Renamo leader said his party will not demand money as a  precondition for taking part in the election. "We need money  for the election but that is not the most important thing," he  said. Dhlakama said Renamo only needs money to buy fuel for its  vehicles, to buy typewriters and paper, to pay telephone bills  and so on.    Regarding areas previously under the control of his  movement,  Dhlakama said their nonintegration in state administration so  far is an act of sabotage by the government. "The government no  longer needs those areas because it thinks the people living  there may not be ready to vote for Frelimo."    Afonso Dhlakama worked with his cadres in Inhambane and Gaza  this week, preparing for the electoral campaign.</p>

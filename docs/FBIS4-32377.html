			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 21 (CTK) -- Trade is the most  important question of relations between Slovakia and the Czech  Republic, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus tells today's independent  SME.    "The development in this sphere has made us rather sad. You  know that the whole problem of the bureaucratic troubles, the  whole problem of certificates (on May 1, Slovakia introduced  quality certificates on imported foods, thus making Czech  exports more difficult) is quite unpleasant, unwelcome for the  Czech Republic," he adds.    Klaus says the Czech Republic was rather disillusioned when  it found that during a visit by Rene Steichen, the commissioner  for agriculture and rural development in the European  Commission, "Slovakia agreed it would not demand certain  certificates from European Union countries, while it would still  demand them from the Czech Republic," Klaus says.    The abolishment of the old clearing bloc in Czech-Slovak  accounting is not a fundamental question, Klaus states.    "I am not opposed at all to its abolition," says Klaus,  noting that the Czech Republic did not invent the old bloc.    "It is a technical matter which will be settled by finance  ministers and governors of the national banks. It is not a task  for premiers. This simply demands an instruction 'yes or not'  from the top," he says.    The solution to the property relations (regarding the  division of the former Czechoslovak property) is the most  painful problem of the two countries' relations, Klaus says. "I  fully respect that the Slovak Government does not have necessary  mandate to resolve it before the elections," he adds.    In addition to this, there are some "extremely complicated  border issues," which require "certain generosity, a detached  view and a positive approach; the question is whether the  government has it or not in view of its mandate," Klaus  concludes.

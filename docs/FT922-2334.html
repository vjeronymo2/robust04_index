			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Management: Setting standards for the working classes - A look at the Investors in People scheme / Training on Trial In 1868, a Royal Commission noted that Britain was suffering from 'not merely a deficiency in technical education but . . . in general intelligence'. In the intervening 124 years, governments have made numerous efforts to do something about it. The latest attempt is Investors in People, launched two years ago, but still surrounded in confusion. Conceived by the National Training Task Force, which advises the government on training, and gestated by the Department of Employment, it is now passing to harassed Training and Enterprise Councils. IiP - as we must now learn to call it - is a standard which represents, as a Birmingham Tec guide has it, 'a benchmark against which employers can measure their progress in developing effective employee training and development policies.' The underlying appeal to business of IiP is the effect on the bottom line. 'The real pay-back . . . will come if you look at training in the same way as any other investment. You target it to meet specific business needs,' says the official literature. Cynics might claim this is just another injunction to business, longer on rhetoric than on reason. Certainly the Tecs have no illusion about the size of the task. Underlying IiP are targets agreed by government, educators and business that by the year 2000, half of the employed workforce should be qualified to level three of the National Vocation Qualification or its academic equivalent. By 1996, half of the medium-sized and larger organisations in the UK should have attained the IiP standard. To reach it, companies have to follow four principles. They must make a public commitment to develop all employees to reach specified corporate objectives. They must regularly review all training and development needs and identify the resources for this in their business plan. They must act to train employees when they are recruited and subsequently. They should continually evaluate their training and development, revising targets and commitments. 'If we don't do it, we will not be in business in a few years time,' suggested one Tec chief executive at a recent IiP brainstorming conference in Windsor called by Full Employment UK, a training consultancy. But, as it emerged at this conference, the immediate auguries are not promising. IiP may be the umbrella under which everything else sits, but it does not yet offer shelter to many companies. The IiP standard, unveiled in November 1990, had by May been reached by just 54 companies. In Birmingham, only eight organisations are working towards it. In Manchester, 82 companies out of a possible 36,000 are going through the IiP system. IiP has not yet found a place in the training and investment market place. Bill Nicholls, a training specialist at the Engineering Employers Federation says companies display one of three attitudes towards IiP. About 90 per cent greet the mention of IiP with the question: 'I-I What?' Of the remaining 10 per cent, some look at the standard with enthusiasm because they want a kitemark. Others say they already have a training policy, and they prefer to press on as they are. Companies which have grasped the training nettle have a variety of ways to win public acclaim. They can work for the British Standards Institution's BS5750, which contains a training element. They can seek to win a National Training Award, applications for which have recently been widely advertised by the Department of Employment. They can be seen to be taking part in local programmes - Birmingham Tec's Investment for Skills, for example. However, there is confusion among companies over which route to take and most Tecs are in no position to offer clarification. This springs partly from the structure of their budgets. IiP is just an add-on to the training budget and one Tec chief executive described it as a product 'worked up on the hoof as we have had the job of trying to deliver it'. The scale of effort and funding directed at the sale of IiP to recession-hit companies has been highly variable from one Tec to another. The variations imply uncertain priorities. If, it was suggested at Windsor, nearly 90 per cent of the national workforce at the end of the century is already working, there is a case for putting more of a Tec budget behind IiP for the employed, rather than seeking to train the unemployed. The retort from Tecs in areas of high unemployment, is that care for the jobless come first; if there is to be stress on IiP, there should be separate money for it. Even if this dilemma is resolved, the Tecs are still confused about how, and to whom, IiP should be marketed. The conference indicated concern about internal Tec staff development: in 1992, few Tecs would be able to reach the IiP standard they are concerned to see others adopt.</p>

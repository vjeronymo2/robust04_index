			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard to invest Dollars 16.5m in Netherlands laser printer plant HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer group, is to invest Fl 30m (Dollars 16.5m) in building production lines for laser printers at its European distribution centre in Amersfoort, in the Netherlands. When completed in March, the expanded Dutch facility will have two production lines with a combined capacity of 80,000 printers per month. The Dutch site, which is set to double in size to 20,000 square metres, may eventually house up to five production lines, depending on market demand. HP, which claims world market leadership in laser printers, has two other European printer production plants in Spain and Italy. The printers assembled in the Netherlands are destined for customers and resellers in Europe, where the market for laser printing is less mature than in the US, opening up prospects of healthy growth in demand, HP said. The Dutch investment is part of HP's attempts to reduce the time it takes to get printers and other products to customers. By combining production and distribution in one location, the company also aims to cut costs and enhance flexibility, enabling it to produce tailor-made printers for customers requiring specific configurations. The Amersfoort production site will create up to 200 jobs over the next few years. The production lines will be operated by a subsidiary of Van Ommeren, the Dutch shipping and storage group, which also runs HP's distribution centre.</p>

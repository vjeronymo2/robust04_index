			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hans-Friedrich Meyer, spokesman of </F> the International Atomic Energy Agency, by Wolf Renschke; place  not given -- live]    [Text] [Renschke] Two accidents occurred at Chernobyl at  the beginning of this week. All through last year there  reportedly were 36 such accidents. To put it quite simply, what  prevents the final closing down of this reactor?    [Meyer] Certainly the energy situation in Ukraine. In 1991  the Ukrainian Parliament decided to close down the two reactors  that are still in operation in Chernobyl by the end of 1993,  that is, by the end of last year. Because of the bad energy  situation, the bad situation regarding electricity supply, it  was then decided not to do that. Since 1991 nothing has been  done in connection with the reactors, they have not been  improved, even though this is being done for all other reactors,  including those in the former East Bloc. These reactors have  been left as they were and are still in operation. Of course,  they are in a dismal state.    [Renschke] More than one-third of the power in Ukraine  reportedly comes from this nuclear power plant. On the other  hand, there is the opinion of the environmental organization  Greenpeace, for instance, which reportedly has proven in a study  that Chernobyl can be closed down immediately without hurting  the country's power supply -- is this an argument that you do  not want to agree with?    [Meyer] First of all, I must correct two things.    [Renschke] Please, do.    [Meyer] First, it is not one-third of the power that comes  from Chernobyl, but power from the 14 nuclear power plants that  are in operation in Ukraine -- only two of which are of the  Chernobyl type, which is RBMK reactors -- amounted to 32.9  percent of the power, which is one-third, produced last year.    Second, the 8,000 dead because of the Chernobyl disaster did  not die directly in the disaster but were the so-called  liquidators, who built the sarcophagus. The number of deaths  resulting directly from the disaster was 32.    [Renschke] Back to the problem of energy supply and safety  defects. You have mentioned the decision of the Ukrainian  Parliament. During a recent visit your organization also found  safety defects. May the decision of a parliament be the last  word in such a case?    [Meyer] Look, the parliament is the representative of the  people, and internationally the situation is such -- and this is  the problem of the United Nations everywhere, and we are a  special organization of the United Nations -- that each people  is responsible for its own policy. Of course, there are many  interconnections at the international level, and one cannot see  Chernobyl purely from the Ukrainian point of view. This is the  reason why we have invited this delegation to Vienna so that  they can talk with delegations of 13 other member states and  with international organizations. The Ukrainian deputy prime  minister will come, and we will try to have them implement the  decision of the Ukrainian Parliament of 1991, namely to close  down these two reactors, which would be best. Otherwise, one  possibility would be to discuss what can be done if they really  keep these two reactors in operation.    [Renschke] What can you actually achieve at this special  conference, in view of this situation?    [Meyer] Specifically, we can make it clear what our experts  found. This week we have another team of experts in Chernobyl,  who are reexamining and analyzing all the accidents that you  mentioned before to find out why they happened. During our last  visit in March we clearly found several particularly severe  defects -- deficient fire protection; above all, deficient  radiation protection in the facility; a lack of spare parts;  then, above all, the difficult situation of employment. This  year alone 13 highly qualified people have left Chernobyl. Last  year a far higher number of them left. Twenty percent of the  good staff has left.    This situation must be pointed out again -- and this is the  purpose of this conference today and tomorrow. Some of the  things can be improved relatively easily. However, as I said  before, the issue also is to find out whether the facilities  cannot be closed down once and for all.    [Renschke] Incurring the danger that you will correct me  again, is it justified to deal only with Chernobyl at this  conference since there are nuclear reactors of this type and in  this condition not only in Ukraine but also outside?    [Meyer] I did not want to correct you again, Mr. Renschke.  It is certainly good that -- and this is what we are doing --  one is dealing with all East European reactors. We have  programs for all reactors. However, in this case it is  necessary to act right now because these two reactors in  Chernobyl that are in operation are in such bad condition. At  this conference we will concentrate on these two reactors.  There is no point in acting globally at the moment. We are  doing that anyway. Here we want to bring about quite specific  improvements or the closing down of these reactors.    [Renschke] Does the West, which has often promised to help,  actually do enough?    [Meyer] This is a difficult question to a representative of  the International Atomic Energy Agency. In one sentence, I  would say the West could do much more. However, there is the  question of how much it wants to do.    [Renschke] Put in one, two, or even three sentences, Mr.  Meyer, what will be the result of the special conference?    [Meyer] One cannot predict that at the moment. We really  have to wait until tomorrow noon. As I said before, 30 percent  of the power is produced by 14 reactors, and, since we are now  moving toward summer, I assume that there would be a possibility  to close down these two reactors. However, there is the danger  that, if the Ukrainians cannot promise that the reactors will be  closed down permanently, the reactors will be left idle during  summer, nothing will be done, and then in winter, when power is  needed urgently -- and last winter they really needed power  urgently -- the two reactors will be put into operation again  without having undergone any repair work. This is a far greater  danger.    [Renschke] Do those who are responsible for the matter in  Ukraine play down the issue?    [Meyer] I cannot say that at the moment. We are waiting for  what they are going to say now, how they will behave at this  meeting. They come with a very high-ranking delegation. Deputy  Prime Minister Shmarov will come and so will the deputy energy  minister. Thus, we hope that they clearly see the situation and  realize what must be done.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sandinist Assembly Member Omar Cabezas: "My </F> Position in the FSLN"]    [Text] I have never written in Sandinist newspapers or  appeared on radio programs because for personal reasons I felt  that after 25 February 1990 the controversy within our party  and, in particular, the public controversy were being handled  poorly. The debate in our organization was characterized by  epithets, mutual disparagement, and too many subjective attacks.    I have also declined invitations to the legitimate  gatherings  of various groups and refused to sign their equally legitimate  documents.    I have decided today to break my self-imposed public  silence.  I am doing so for a sound reason: so that all Sandinists, the  people of Nicaragua, and perhaps those who know me outside the  country can become familiar with my position. While not wishing  to be immodest, I harbor the secret hope that my position is  shared by most rank-and-file Sandinists, whether organized in  party bodies or not, by countless mid-level officials, whether  long-time or not, and even by our brothers who have quite  rightly already taken a definite stand on the internal problems  of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], which are  reflected publicly in the disagreements between Daniel and  Sergio.    I am not frightened by the democracy that has been  developing  in the FSLN because we all wanted it and were involved in it. I  am not frightened by the lawful and legitimate meetings of  various groups of Sandinists, whether they receive press  coverage or not. I am not frightened by the disagreements within  our party. They enrich us. They are a fact. We must acknowledge  it.  <H5>  A Poorly Handled Controversy </H5>   I am concerned, however, about how this dispute is being  handled. I think that the poor handling of this controversy in a  young and poorly administered (understood) internal democracy  could lead to a split in the FSLN.    Those who would like to eliminate us, even physically, and  our political adversaries are fomenting division in our ranks.  They go back and forth with gossip between Sandinists, telling  one and all. Some of our brothers and, at times, some of our  media echo this gossip, thus adding fuel to the fire, which our  adversaries stoke.    Some brothers who have quite justifiably made a clear-cut  commitment to one or another position do not always do the best  job of conveying what is discussed at these meetings, whether  they are official, unofficial, or even among Sandinist  congressmen, to the National Directorate, to the rank and file,  and to the mass media.    At this point in the discussion I have the impression that a  few brothers who are coming together with legitimate excitement  and enthusiasm around the various schools of thought concerning  the "Program, Principles, and Bylaws" that the FSLN ought to  have in the immediate future (which are the outcome of a dynamic  discussion that has not always been sound and is at times far  from ethical) have wound up describing the position of others  with stereotypes and even in black-and-white terms.    I think that there are brothers in the two factions who are  already almost seeing things in black and white and losing their  objectivity. I am concerned that emotion and passion seem at  times to outweigh calm analysis and caution.    When a public political debate lapses into denunciations,  generally by those who disagree, and into the stigmatizing of  the other, it not only causes confusion in the various bodies of  organized or unorganized Sandinism but also helps to divide our  organization in the most naive way (I choose not to think that  the intentions are evil).  <H5>  Struggling for Unity </H5>   I have friends and brothers on both sides and I have been  listening to them all carefully and respectfully. There is some  truth to what they both say. I feel, think, see, sense, hear,  and observe that there is some truth to both positions. My  position right now, acknowledging that each side possesses some  of the truth, is that we should discuss what is best in each in  a more mature, ethical manner and that at the May Congress we  should extract the truth of Sandinism, which is part of the  country's truth, from all of these bits of truth and, in an  exemplary fashion for Nicaragua and the world that will be  watching us, put together a single program and set of bylaws. At  that same Congress we should then select the best men and women  to guide the crystallization of our integrated truth so that  later, in 1995, we can begin to seek out, either by ourselves or  with other parties if appropriate, the brothers and sisters who  are best suited to be our candidates in the 1995 elections.    In conclusion, I would like to point out a few things:    1. I think that along with discussing our internal problems  we ought to see to it that the government, the IMF, and the  World Bank do not condemn us to a return to the Stone Age with  their cruel economic policies that are causing so much suffering  and destabilization and that are introducing elements of anarchy  into Nicaraguan society.    2. Today I am also sending a private letter to the National  Directorate, expressing these same concerns.    3. Besides wanting to do something for Leon, Nicaragua, and  the FSLN, I am, like any professional, trying to advance in my  career as an attorney so that I can provide for my family's  future, inasmuch as I will not seek reelection as a deputy or to  run for mayor, nor do I seek any leadership post in our  organization.    Although some comrades do not realize this clearly, I am  simply trying to do what we did in 1976 or 1977, when on Kilambe  Hill, 1,750 meters above sea level, cold and hungry, Camilo  Ortega and I struggled from the two factions to which we  belonged to unite the FSLN and defeat the dictatorship. Camilo  and I made our little contribution to that heroic feat.    My father and three brothers who died in the struggle  against  the dictatorship, the thousands of Nicaraguans who fell before  and after we took power, our accomplishments (some important  ones still survive), and the accomplishments to come demand of  me and demand of us all that we fight for party unity. If this  letter succeeds in making a little contribution in this  direction, I think that it will have achieved its goal.</p>

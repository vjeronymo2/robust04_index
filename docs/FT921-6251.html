			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Anglovaal earnings rise 18% at halfway ANGLOVAAL Industries (AVI), the holding company for the industrial interests of the Anglovaal group, did well to increase earnings by 18 per cent in the six months to the end of December against the background of very weak economic conditions. Turnover rose by 8 per cent to R3.96bn (Dollars 1.38bn), but tighter margins saw profit before interest and tax restricted to a 3 per cent increase to R368.1m. A decline in profit attributable to outside shareholders helped lift earnings by 18 per cent to R121.5m. Earnings per share rose by 17 per cent to 425 cents. The results compare favourably with other large industrial groupings to have reported recently, arguably under easier conditions. The share has enjoyed a significant upward re-rating in recent months, from a low of R70 last year to its current level of about R130. Favourable share ratings formed the basis for AVI and two of its subsidiaries recently raising R785m through rights issues. The largest contributions to earnings came from Consol, the packaging and rubber company, and National Brands, which is involved in branded, fast-selling consumer goods. Their respective contributions were 27 and 28 per cent. AVI Diversified Holdings, whose main activities are textiles and engineering, and Irvin &amp; Johnson, the frozen products group, contributed 21 and 20 per cent respectively. The only laggard was Grinaker Holdings, the technology, electronics and construction company, which contributed only 3 per cent to earnings despite accounting for 25 per cent of group turnover. The directors expect earnings for the full year to exceed those of the previous year.</p>

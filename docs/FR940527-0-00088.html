			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [B]uilt-in restraints have been demonstrated to significantly out perform add-ons. Excursion in add-ons is significantly higher, thus making a specific vehicle shell test more significant for these restraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agency Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has decided to deny Hassel Free's petition. NHTSA disagrees with each of the arguments underlying the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first argument is that Standard 213's compliance test procedure unduly burdens built-in restraint manufacturers. Petitioner did not dispute that dynamically testing built-in systems for vans will better ensure the safe performance of those restraints in crashes, or question that manufacturers must bear some responsibility for ensuring that their restraints will provide the level of crash protection required by the standard. Instead, the petitioner suggested that NHTSA change the means of conducting the dynamic test to lessen what the petitioner believed were unnecessary burdens on small manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has decided against changing the test procedures after considering the nexus between the standard's performance requirements and the laboratory compliance test. Standard 213 specifies requirements that reduce the likelihood that, in a crash, a child using a child restraint system will be injured by the collapse or disintegration of the system, or by contact with interior of the vehicle, or by imposition of intolerable forces by the restraint system. Standard 213's dynamic test must simulate an actual vehicle crash to ensure that these requirements are effective in protecting the child and that the restraint will perform in the real world as it does in the laboratory. For the most accurate evaluation, the simulation must be as representative of a real world crash as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing a built-in restraint in the specific vehicle shell approximates a real world crash almost as nearly as possible. Only testing a built-in restraint in an actual vehicle provides a better approximation. The parts of the vehicle interior that are included in the specific vehicle shell are those parts that a child positioned in the system could contact during a frontal crash. 52 FR 9194, 9196; March 23, 1987 (NPRM to permit built-in restraints in passenger cars). Without those parts, the representativeness of the test would be severely reduced, and the ability of the test to evaluate the safety of a built-in system would be compromised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that it is because the shell replicates the actual vehicle that Standard 213 does not specify limits on the head excursion of the child dummy restrained in a built-in system. NHTSA determined it is unnecessary to limit head excursion for built-in restraints if the standard limits the head acceleration of the restrained dummy and the dummy impacts in the shell any structure that might be present in the vehicle in the real world.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 9194. If features of the vehicle interior that a child could impact are not included in the apparatus that tests a built-in restraint, an incomplete evaluation of the child seat's performance would result. That is, it would be possible that head acceleration might be within the limits of the standard even though a child's head could strike harmful structures in the vehicle interior in an actual crash. For these reasons, NHTSA concludes that the burden of testing a built-in restraint in a specific vehicle shell is not undue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hassel Free made other arguments with which NHTSA does not agree. Petitioner believed built-in restraints should be tested on a standard seat assembly without the surrounding features of the vehicle interior because built-in restraints universally outperform add-on restraints with regard to head excursion. Petitioner did not provide any information supporting this claim. Further, the agency does not believe that a head excursion limit would be an appropriate measure of the ability of a built-in system to provide head impact protection. A head excursion limit is unnecessary for built-in child restraints because these restraints will be tested in the actual environment (either in the vehicle or in a vehicle shell that replicates the actual vehicle) in which the restraint is installed in the real world, and because the testing directly measures forces on the head of the restrained test dummy. As long as those measured forces are below a head injury criterion (HIC) of 1,000, the dummy's head may travel any distance and may impact any object in the test environment (those objects would be ``soft,'' i.e., padded, for the HIC to be less than 1,000). A head excursion limit is undesirable because it would restrict travel of the head even when a HIC measurement resulting from excursion over the limit shows that the excursion would not result in harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioner argued that NHTSA should test built-in restraints without the surrounding features of the vehicle interior because its restraints can be installed in innumerable vehicles with different interiors. NHTSA believes testing in the specific vehicle shell is needed because of this variation in the design of vehicle interiors. Built-in restraints can be installed by the manufacturer anywhere in the vehicle, e.g., the front seat, or middle row of seats in vans, or rear seat. Seat location can vary significantly, and so too can the features of the vehicle interior surrounding a built-in restraint, including features such as roof pillars, consoles or other hard structures. To assure that a restrained child does not hit structures in the vehicle interior, NHTSA must test the built-in restraint with the surroundings of the vehicle interior that a child can impact in a crash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the built-in restraint manufacturer has control over which vehicle interiors will surround its restraints. Standard 213 requires built-in restraint manufacturers to specify in installation instructions accompanying the restraints which types of vehicles and seating positions the restraint can or cannot be installed. (S5.6.3, adopted by the April 1993 final rule.) By limiting the vehicle models and seating locations in which the restraint is to be installed, the manufacturer can manage its certification responsibilities. The manufacturer would be responsible for the compliance of its restraints with respect to the specified vehicles and positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

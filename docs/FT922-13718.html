			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Marcos body row A showdown over the body of the late former Philippines president, Mr Ferdinand Marcos, loomed yesterday following a government move banning its return until after the May election, Jose Galang reports from Manila. The ban, explained Mr Franklin Drilon, the executive secretary, was imposed owing to concerns of national security officials that a return to the country of Mr Marcos' remains 'will create public disturbance.' He said the current campaign for the May 11 poll, at which Mr Marcos' widow, Imelda, is seeking the presidency, is hotting up and the return of Mr Marcos' body could affect public safety and order.</p>

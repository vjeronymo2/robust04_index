			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lower dollar weighs on most bourses ANOTHER plunge in the dollar, taking it down through DM1.50 in London, was blamed for falls on most bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was disappointed that prices had failed to react to Monday night's compromise in Bonn on a 30 per cent withholding tax on interest income. But it took some comfort from the US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady, who inferred at the Munich G7 summit that the Bundesbank might cut interest rates soon. The DAX lost 4.85 to 1,767.51 after an early loss of 10 points, and a fall of 3.10 to 697.36 in the FAZ at midsession. Dealers said that the rebound might have been technical, as futures market traders were seen buying the 30 DAX shares to narrow the gap between the cash index and the DAX futures contract. Siemens shed DM6 to DM667 after saying on Monday that it saw little room for a higher dividend on 1991-92 results. Chemicals also came under pressure from expectations of poor second-quarter results, Bayer leading the way down with a fall of DM2.60 to DM279.90. Schering overcame the trend to close with a gain of DM9.40 at DM732.40 on talk that it was about to announce it had found buyers for its chemicals businesses. ZURICH liked the Brady comments but not the higher dollar, and the SMI index closed 6.0 down at 1,856.6 after an earlier low of 1,850.3. Nestle bearers fell SFr100 to SFr9,460, dealers saying that there had been several major sell orders. Brown Boveri, also export-sensitive, lost SFr40 to SFr4,250 francs. PARIS was given a late lift by the bond market but turnover remained thin, with only FFr1.8bn worth of business. The CAC-40 index finished 10.57 higher at 1,879.09 in quiet trading. Alcatel Alsthom remained active, adding FFr13 to FFr654, while the lower dollar and fading hopes of an early economic recovery in the US prompted profit-taking in Rhone-Poulenc which dropped FFr24 or 4 per cent to FFr559. Havas ended 60 centimes lower at FFr495.90 with 215,000 shares traded, as two blocks were traded ahead of the July 15 expiry of a warrant issue. AMSTERDAM was knocked lower by some disappointing company reports and the weaker dollar. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.5 to 121.7. The office supplies group, Oce van der Grinten, shed Fl 4.80 or 7 per cent to Fl 64.70 after releasing poor second-quarter results. The food producer Nutricia fell Fl 7.90 to Fl 145.50 after its chairman said that recent profit growth would be hard to maintain. MILAN got dangerously close to the support level of 420 on the Comit index as it fell 7.15 to 434.20 in turnover estimated at slightly more than Monday's low L72.1bn. Dealers said thatthere were rumours of financial problems at various Sims, due to losses incurred in the bond market which has fallen heavily on currency devaluation fears. The recent rise in interest rates and the government's plans to freeze public tariffs weighed in particular on the telecommunications sector. Stet fell L26 to L1,629 and was down to L1,580 in the after-market. Sip lost L43.5 to L1,187. OSLO ended mixed in thin trading, with Aker A shares gaining NKr2.5 to NKr54 on news the company had sold its stake in Spanish cement company, Valenciana. The all-share index ended 0.61 firmer at 397.71 in low turnover of NKr182m. MADRID suspended Valenciana ahead of a takeover bid by Cemex of Mexico, reportedly at Pta15,000 a share. Valenciana closed off Pta350 at Pta14,500 on Monday. The general index fell 0.45 to 236.29. STOCKHOLM cited the weak dollar as the Affarsvarlden General index fell another 9.7 to a new 1992 low of 894.4. Trelleborg, the metals group, saw its B shares fell SKr4 lower at SKr106 while A shares in Asea, one of this year's top performers in Europe, fell SKr9 to SKr383 for an accumulated SKr14 loss this week. TEL AVIV closed sharply higher in active trading on strong buying by mutual funds, the blue chip index rising 3.13, or 2.1 per cent to 153.09 in turnover of Shk137.5m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1131.10  1129.10  1128.55  1128.36  1129.49  1130.00  1130.12  1129.83  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1131.10            Day's Low  1127.93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Jul 6        Jul 3       Jul 2        Jul 1        Jun 30      1134.09      1142.19     1134.63      1132.36      1139.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE -- COURTESY OF CARL'S JR.;  </P> <P> MANAGEMENT: THE FAST-FOOD COMPANY HOPES TO REDUCE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER BY OFFERING  TO PAY UP TO $405 A TERM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.  </P> <P> At 23, Andrew J. Maldonado manages a nearly $1-million operation and a crew of  more than 30 employees at the Carl's Jr. restaurant in the Mall of Orange.  </P> <P> The demands of management require long hours and many skills -- fix-it man,  recruiter, bookkeeper and chef. It has left Maldonado little time to earn a  college degree in business -- an achievement that he feels is necessary for  future advancement.  </P> <P> But this semester, aided by an innovative program offered to all Carl's Jr.  employees, Maldonado has resumed earning credits toward his degree. He is  taking a class at a nearby community college, and the bill is being paid by his  employer.  </P> <P> Maldonado is participating in an educational program offered by the chain's  parent company to reduced employee turnover. Anaheim-based Carl Karcher  Enterprises Inc. is paying up to $405 a term for some employees' tuition,  transportation and books.  </P> <P> "It's the right thing to do," said John A. Kubas, Carl's vice president for  human resources. "It's reflective of Carl's philosophy that we have an  obligation to return something to the community."  </P> <P> Strictly from a business standpoint, it also is reflective of Carl's desire to  return something to its kitchens -- namely workers.  </P> <P> That has not always been easy for Carl's Jr. The chain's work force has an  average annual turnover rate of 160%, Kubas said. That means Carl's Jr. must  fill each position three times within a two-year period. Such churning takes a  large toll on the company in expenditures for recruitment, training and other  factors.  </P> <P> Carl's Jr. is not alone. Kubas said other fast-food chains have even higher  turnover rates. The industry as a whole averages yearly turnover of 225% to  250%, Kubas said, meaning that each position must be filled more than twice a  year.  </P> <P> The reason is that many young people no longer look at flipping hamburgers as a  good part-time job while in high school or college or as a good entry-level  job. They are turned off by minimum wages, low prestige and poor working  conditions.  </P> <P> The fast-food industry, aware that declining birth rates in the 1970s have  shrunk its historic labor pool of young people, has sought out senior citizens  and other groups to try to fill the uniforms.  </P> <P> Carl's Jr.'s education program, which has attracted industrywide attention,  represents a new tack -- albeit an expensive one -- to try to retain more of  its young work force and attract new recruits.  </P> <P> Though still an experiment, the program has paid the costs of a semester's  worth of schooling for 96 Carl's Jr. workers, or their immediate family  members, since it began in August, 1989. Only about 10% of the chain's 557  restaurants are participating so far.  </P> <P> Both full- and part-time workers can use the benefits to attend college, go to  trade school, or take English, Spanish or other language classes. The program  is available to employees who have worked at least one month at a participating  Carl's Jr. outlet.  </P> <P> Benefits are based on the number of hours an employee works a week. The maximum  benefit of $350 toward tuition, $30 for books and $25 to cover transportation  costs goes to employees working 26 hours a week or more.  </P> <P> Terry Newman, 20, said he is using the Carl's Jr. program for his first  semester at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson. "It makes ends meet, believe  me," Newman added.  </P> <P> He said that word of the program has spread at the Carl's Jr. where he works  near the university. Some workers transferred to the restaurant from other  Carl's Jr. sites in order to take advantage of the benefits.  </P> <P> Maldonado, who hopes to earn a degree in business administration, has attended  Fullerton College and Cal State Fullerton in the past to study computers. This  semester, he enrolled in an elective photography class at Cypress College, with  Carl's picking up the tuition tab.  </P> <P> He said that he has tried to promote the educational benefit program among  members of his restaurant crew but that, so far, few have enrolled. He said  many of the employees are Latino, supporting themselves or families on the  money they earn at Carl's, and have only sixth- or eighth-grade educations and  no immediate desire for more schooling.  </P> <P> "It's really hard to get them motivated to use it," Maldonado said, adding that  many Latinos are unaccustomed to receiving job benefits. "Some are afraid of  it. They don't really trust it."  </P> <P> Kubas said that 43% of Carl's work force is Latino, and many of them are recent  immigrants. He said that he hopes, over time, to attract more Latinos to the  education program.  </P> <P> Dr. Sal D. Rinella, vice president for administration at Cal State Fullerton,  said that the challenge will be to show Latinos that the program is available  and that education will help them work their way into the mainstream.  </P> <P> "I think what it will do is develop the worker so that the company gets better  performance and so that the worker can (eventually) move on to other things,"  Rinella said. "Turnover goes down. Morale is sustained very high."  </P> <P> Rinella has worked extensively with Robert J. Kopecky, a consultant based in  Troy, Mich., who helped formulate both the Carl's Jr. plan and a similar  program in two Detroit-area Burger King franchises. Kubas said it was an  article in a trade magazine on the Burger King experiment that first drew him  to the idea.  </P> <P> In Detroit, Kopecky said he experimented with various programs to try to cut  Burger King's turnover rate of 179%. The restaurants initially tried  cash-incentive programs, improving the look and comfort of uniforms, making  schedules more flexible and enticing managers to extend better treatment to  workers. Though the changes were appreciated by employees, none stemmed the  high dropout rate.  </P> <P> Then the two Burger Kings set up the program to pay for tuition and books. It  appeared to strike an immediate chord with workers. "They all wanted to get an  education somewhere, because they didn't necessarily want to flip hamburgers  the rest of their lives," Kopecky said.  </P> <P> President of the Excellence Group Inc., Kopecky said that absenteeism dropped,  productivity increased by 3% and employees stayed on the job longer. "For some  reason, the workers began to feel the company was really behind them," he said.  </P> <P> Even though the tuition costs are high compared to the workers' relatively low  hourly wages, they are less than the estimated turnover cost of $600 for each  new worker. Turnover costs include the value of management time to advertise an  opening, scout for and interview applicants, and provide a uniform and  training.  </P> <P> Rinella, who studied the Detroit experiment, said that the educational program  appears to have a staying power that other kinds of incentives lack. With the  program, he said, a fast-food job "is not a dead-end anymore. It also changes  the image of fast foods as companies that take in great numbers of people (as  employees) and don't care very much about them."  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: Der Rosenkavalier - Opera Is there any opera that reeks more of nostalgia than Der Rosenkavalier? As the waltzes begin to play, it is difficult to resist Strauss's blandishments to cast one's mind back over the years. The first production of the opera at the London Coliseum was almost 20 years ago in January 1976. It marked a turning-point in the fortunes of English National Opera. The company had recently adopted its new name and was struggling to rebuild after a damaging strike that had torn morale to shreds and left the theatre closed for six weeks. Headlines such as 'NATKE members stage mid-performance walk-out' tell their own story. How times change] Now, two decades on, Der Rosenkavalier is back. And again ENO stands at a cross-roads. The all-powerful triumvirate that ruled for over a decade has departed, while the newcomers have not yet had time to put their stamp on policy. They are probably right that the old production of the opera had had its day. This replacement may not surpass or even equal it in some respects, but that does not necessarily mean that the company is heading downhill. If memory serves, the ENO orchestra plays a good deal better than it used to. Given that Der Rosenkavalier is such a lofty summit for a company to climb, it is surprising that Sian Edwards, the new Music Director, is not in charge. Yakov Kreizberg, a guest conductor of noted promise elsewhere, must take credit for the best features of the playing, but he does let the opera drag. The opening prelude, an explicit depiction of a night of passion, set out without thrust or energy, as though Octavian was half-hearted about getting on the job. The final act drooped way before the climax. To some degree that is reflected on stage. As in his first production for ENO (The Marriage of Figaro) Jonathan Miller is more interested in observing the period social decorum on the surface than releasing the passions that burn below. The period that he gives us here is not the 18th-century reign of Maria Theresa intended by Strauss and Hofmannsthal, but the Edwardian era of Upstairs, Downstairs. By this time Vienna was in decline, which Miller evidently feels is more appropriate to Strauss's decadent music. Among the phantoms in the Act 3 charade is a first world war soldier, looming ominously over the comedy below. There is no Rococo finery left in the Marschallin's bedroom. Its walls are bare, the furniture sparse, not even a clock for her to stop during the night. It is surprising to find breakfast still served by little black Mahomet. This can be a passionate scene with Octavian rolling on the Marschallin's lap, but not here. He just gives her a peck on the cheek - a shame, as Sally Burgess's self-confident Octavian, a naughty-looking boy with a cheeky smile, would surely demand more. Everything she does would be really involving, if only the top notes did not glare so. For the second act we move to the most impressive of Peter J. Davison's sets, a rather modern-day nouveau riche mansion, adorned outside by a splendidly vulgar line of huge, bronze, mock-classical statues. In the hall Rosemary Joshua's Sophie, a shallow girl without a lot of charm, awaits her husband-to-be. What she gets is the exhausting, larger-than-life Baron Ochs of John Tomlinson, a lecherous county squire, who is forever stalking his prey. Joshua was nervous for the Presentation of the Rose, but found her silvery top notes later; Tomlinson was relentlessly loud, but made every word of Ochs's long role clear - a major bonus. Among the large cast Christopher Booth-Jones was a no-nonsense Faninal (Miller excises much of the traditional comic business, though without putting anything in its place). Claire Powell and Nicholas Buxton turned the Italian intriguers into a very highly coloured pair. Peter Bronder sang the Italian tenor without overt parody. It was good to see Eric Shilling, an ENO old-timer, back as the Notary. More important, it was good to hear again Anne Evans, who sang the role of the Marschallin in that previous production two decades ago. I happen to believe that the Marschallin is younger in spirit than she makes her, not so defeatist in her outlook on life and love, but that may be because Kreizberg's slow speeds introduced a mood of moroseness into her scenes, also sometimes dragging her down in pitch. The dignity of her portrayal is happily remembered from before, its heartfelt warmth and sincerity, too. Since 1976 Evans has gone forth to take her place on the international stage, Tomlinson too, both of them notably at Bayreuth. It is a mark of what has happened at ENO that it can now field a world-class Brunnhilde and Wotan in the cast. Expectations are higher these days and that means that a middling achievement like this Rosenkavalier can come as a disappointment. Perhaps, in fact, we should be counting ourselves lucky. Performances continue until March 16</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 74 (564) </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] The Armenian and Azeri presidents had failed to meet  each other in Moscow because of continued differences over a  peace settlement to the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh, Armenian  Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan said in Moscow on Monday. He  also ruled out the possibility of such a meeting in any  foreseeable future.    Papazian said the scheduled four-party meeting of Russia,  Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh whose Defence Minister  Robert Kacharian was in Moscow during the CIS summit had been  derailed because of Baku's rejection of the Moscow-proposed  regional peace plan.    The meeting would have been held had Baku accepted the plan  providing for the deployment of CIS peacekeepers in the region  something that Yerevan and Stepanakert agree to, he said.    Papazian said Russia had alone agreed to send its troops to  the region because the United Nations was unable to do so at the  moment. However, he said Russia would prefer to join a  peacekeeping operation sponsored by the CIS or Eastern Europe  instead.    "So will Azerbaijan, I am sure," he said.    On Azeri leader Heydar Aliyev's accusation of Armenia of  launching aggression on Azerbaijan, Papazyan stressed that  although "Armenia is a party to the conflict, it is not a  warring side."  IF Note: President Aliyev called on other CIS leaders to pass  a political assessment of Armenia's aggression on his country,  demand an end to hostilities against Azerbaijan and an immediate  Armenian pullout from occupied lands. In a statement at the CIS  summit, he demanded that Yerevan provide firm guarantees for a  non-resumption of hostilities calling for sanctions against  Armenia for its aggression on a fellow CIS state. Aliyev  accused Yerevan of derailing any constructive proposals for  regional peace by setting knowingly unacceptable conditions.  Armenia, which set up a military beachhead inside Azerbaijan,  now seeks to swap annexed lands for the enclave's independence  or in other words, to partition Azerbaijan, Aliyev said.    For his part, Papazyan said that although Yerevan refrained  from internationalizing the conflict, it would step immediately  if Karabakh Armenians had to face the threat of deportation or  genocide.</p>

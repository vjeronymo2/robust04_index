			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Ford cuts price of most Mondeos Ford has cut the prices of its best-selling Mondeo car range by Pounds 265 on most models, John Griffiths writes. The company, however, is denying motor-trade reports that it plans to scrap its dealers' 10 per cent profit margin on the cars in favour of a simple handling charge. 'Such reports are nonsense,' Ford said yesterday. But it confirmed that it had told its dealers to cut prices of all Mondeos by Pounds 265, except the most basic version, backdated to May 1, and to more than halve the cost of some options such as anti-lock braking. The measures are equivalent to a price cut of about 2 per cent on the most popular fleet model, the 1.8 litre LX.</p>

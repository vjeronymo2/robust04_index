Following the vogue for stock exchanges and Eurobonds, the  purchase of companies and real estate has become the fashion  among foreign investors. Citibank, for example, is investing $1  billion in the privatization of Brazilian state-owned  enterprises and in launching a $100-million fund to purchase  shares in Brazilian companies.    The Chemical Bank has followed suit. It is analyzing  Brazilian companies with growth potential. Funds like these are  also open to Brazilians, but their financial resources must be  huge -- anybody with $5 million at his disposal may consider  himself a candidate.    This is the reason why investors are companies and  capitalists at the top of the tree in the financial world.  Garantia, one of the forerunners of this new market in Brazil,  is successfully managing an investment fund that has already  invested $30 million.    The purchase of Artex by Garantia was, in fact, that sort of  business deal. The new owners of Artex are the shareholders --  both Brazilians and foreigners -- in Garantia Partners (GP) -- a  fund especially established for this business transaction.    Claudio Haddad, a Garantia manager, stated that this market  deals with companies that do not negotiate shares on the stock  exchange and that have some special characteristics. "We also  have a special fund for medium-sized companies," he said.    Pactual and Icatu Bank have also followed suit. The largest  fund is that of Icatu, with assets totalling $100 million. The  much-publicized DM-9 advertising agency only exists because of  investments by Icatu. Once Nizan Guanaes became a successful,  international advertising man, Icatu sold its shares in DM-9 to  the owners of the company.    This market looks as if it will be the fashion in the  financial world this year. JP Morgan recently bought 15 percent  of Latasa stocks and 10 percent of Mappin stocks. This is a  strategy followed by JP Morgan worldwide -- it buys shares in  companies with good possibilities and then sell them at a profit.    As Citibank Vice President Jose Monforte explains: "We are  beginning a new round [preceding word in English] of company  ownership changes. The generalized feeling is that the country  will achieve stability, because of time considerations, and  resume growth. This situation creates a good opportunity to  make money."    If everything turns out all right, the value of assets will  increase. Monforte believes many companies will be unable to  keep up with the new stage of growth due to the lack of capital.    "Once they become aware of that, they will inevitably have  to  start selling," he says, adding that "every foreign investor  with whom I talk remarks on this trend."    Icatu Bank President Daniel Dantas explains that investment  funds may also participate in new endeavors that spring from  brilliant ideas -- like what happened in the United States with  Apple, one of the great successes in computer science that  started in a garage.    Dantas notes: "We invested, for example, in Nilton Molina, a  former insurance broker. It is a pleasure to see how successful  he is. If any businessman, regardless of the size of his  business, wishes to talk to us, he need only look for us. Money  is no problem."    This aggressiveness in the Brazilian market has led the  Chemical Bank to bring specialists to Brazil. "Capital flows  wherever there are good business opportunities," says Chemical  Bank Investment Director Wayne Perkins, adding that "we must  enter now, otherwise our competitors will outstrip us."</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Tory MPs rebuked on Lloyd's secrecy The cross-party committee on MPs' interests yesterday issued a strong rebuke to 11 Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, for failing to declare full details of their involvement in the Lloyd's insurance market. In a 23-page report it also recommended removing the requirement for MPs to register their Lloyd's syndicate numbers for any current year and their membership of any syndicates with open years. The recommendation prompted Mr Peter Hain, the leftwing Labour MP, to claim that the committee had 'caved in to backstairs manoeuvres by Lloyd's and Tory MPs'. He called for the 11 'refuseniks' to be suspended. The committee said that the behaviour of the 11 MPs who had not supplied their Lloyd's syndicate numbers 'sets a bad precedent and is to be deprecated'. It recommended that MPs be required to disclose the categories of insurance business they were underwriting. Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, committee chairman, said there was a balance between individual privacy and the public's right to know about pecuniary interests that might influence an MP's parliamentary activities. 'We could just let the thing rot as it is and create a feeling of hostility and unwillingness to comply,' he said. The MPs named in the report are: Mr David Ashby (Leicestershire North West), Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme), Mr Michael Colvin (Romsey and Waterside), Sir Edward Heath (Old Bexley and Sidcup), Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North), Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud), Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams), Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth), Sir Gerard Vaughan (Reading East), and Sir Jerry Wiggin (Weston-super-Mare). Registration of Lloyd's Syndicates. HMSO. Pounds 10.</p>

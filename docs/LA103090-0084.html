			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREPARING FOR 'THE BIG ONE'  </P> <P> The county and all 86 of its incorporated cities staged a daylong  earthquake-response drill Monday, dubbed "Disaster Response '90." The exercise  was staged to evaluate the county's ability to assess the damage from a quake  in Willowbrook and communicate with the cities, said Richard B. Dixon, county  chief administrative officer. Included among the tests were the response to a  collision between a chemical tanker truck and a van; helicopter transport of  victims, and emergency evacuation of residents within a hazardous materials  zone.  </P></p>

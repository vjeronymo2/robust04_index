			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Heracles mixes politics with the cement: A look at the political fallout after former prime minister Mitsotakis' indictment for bribery The travails of Heracles General Cement, Greece's leading producer and Europe's largest exporter of cement, have all the makings of a modern Greek myth. Thursday's indictment by parliament of Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former conservative prime minister, on charges of taking a Dollars 22.5m (Pounds 14.4m) bribe in the sale of the state-controlled cement producer in 1992 to Calcestruzzi of Italy, underlined the extent to which Heracles has become entangled in politics over the past decade. Earlier this year, Mr Michalis Vranopoulos, former governor of the National Bank and the government's main negotiator in the disposal of Heracles, was assassinated by November 17, a Greek terrorist group, for his part in the sale. The privatisation of Heracles has proved just as controversial as its nationalisation in 1983 by Greece's first socialist government. At that time, Mr George Tsatsos, the company's chief executive, fled Greece together with other family members on the board of directors to avoid facing charges of criminal fraud that in theory carried the death penalty. Most charges were dropped. Now Mr Mitsotakis, an opposition backbencher, faces trial by a special criminal court. Two other conservative former cabinet ministers involved in the Heracles disposal, Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos and Mr Ioannis Paleocrassas, were also indicted by parliament, on breach of trust charges, and will be tried at the same time. Mr Andrianopoulos, who as industry minister was the conservative government's keenest exponent of privatisation, said yesterday: 'The whole procedure of the parliamentary inquiry has been absurd. This is enough to drive me out of politics.' On the Athens stock exchange, shares in Heracles, depressed by a prolonged recession in the Greek construction industry, picked up 1 per cent as the indictment procedure neared completion. Nor have the company's results been affected by political wrangling. Last year Heracles posted a 4.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year to Dr7.3bn (Pounds 19.8m), while turnover was up by 11.7 per cent to Dr71bn. It retains a share of around 42 per cent in Greece's increasingly competitive cement market. The conservatives' view is that Heracles has become a political football as the governing socialists seek revenge on Mr Mitsotakis for bringing Mr Andreas Papandreou, then the opposition leader, to trial in 1991 on corruption charges connected with the Dollars 200m (Pounds 128m) Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal. Mr Andrianopoulos rejects an allegation accompanying the indictment, that Heracles was sold too cheaply, pointing out that at Dollars 425m, the price was at the high end of a series of valuations carried out by Morgan Stanley, the investment bank acting as the government's adviser in the sale. Mr Mitsotakis and his conservative colleagues were also held responsible by the parliamentary committee investigating the sale for the disappearance of a number of paintings, part of Heracles's large collection of modern Greek art, from the boardroom suite. Yet whatever the shortcomings of the sale, the Greek state managed to hold on to a substantial stake in the company, as Calcestruzzi formed a joint venture with the state-controlled National Bank of Greece, Cal-Nat, in order to acquire Heracles, in which the bank holds a 68 per cent share. Heracles, founded by the Tsatsos family before the first world war, expanded rapidly in the late 1970s, opening a second cement quarry and a deep water port on the island of Euboea and increasing its fleet of bulk carriers to help boost exports to the Middle East and North Africa. But the company borrowed heavily to finance its new investments, while profit margins were shrinking. By the time the Socialists decided to nationalise Heracles, its share capital to debt ratio was 1 to 15. Moreover, the Tsatsos family controlled only 20 per cent of the shares, against 35 per cent for National Bank. A total of Dr27bn in debt was converted to equity, diluting the Tsatsos holdings still further, and new management was appointed by the government. By the late 1980s, however, Heracles was making sizeable profits again. As the largest and one of only a few healthy companies in the conservatives' privatisation portfolio, it was an attractive buy. One local analyst said: 'Calcestruzzi needed a cement supply to back up its ready-mix and construction equipment leasing business. It had coveted Heracles for some time, building up a shareholding from the free float well before the company was put up for sale.' However, Heracles did not escape being drawn into the Ferruzzi group's own political troubles, through a series of allegations that the Greek company was used as a channel for pay-offs made to Italian politicians. Italian magistrates have been in touch with the Greek judiciary over this and have questioned several Ferruzzi officials.</p>

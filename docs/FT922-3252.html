			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bone china lift for John Tams The recession continued to hit John Tams Group, the USM-traded earthenware and bone china manufacturer. Over the 12 months to end-March, profits slipped from Pounds 2.88m to Pounds 1.64m on turnover down just 3 per cent at Pounds 19.8m. Volumes were broadly maintained but margins were sacrificed, said Mr Gerald Tams, chairman. Nevertheless, the outcome masked an improved second-half performance, particularly in bone china. The company acquired Royal Grafton just before the year-end, a move that 'opens new markets for us' Mr Tams said. It should add sales of some Pounds 3m in the current year. Earnings per share fell to 4.92p (8.34p); a final dividend of 2.41p holds the total at 4p.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME-TIME FLICKS  </P> <P> If you haven't seen Singin' in the Rain (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.) lately you're  in for a treat. It's just about the most engaging musical ever, set in  Hollywood at the advent of the talkie revolution.  </P> <P> Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor are all justly celebrated for  their terrific contributions, but no less dazzling is Jean Hagen as the  pretentious, glittery silent star undone by her terrible nasal voice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SET YOUR VCR  </P> <P> The Professionals (TMC Tuesday at 5 p.m.), Richard Brooks' terrific, slam-bang  1966 Western, finds Ralph Bellamy hiring some soldiers-of-fortune to rescue his  gorgeous wife Claudia Cardinale from a dastardly Jack Palance. Burt Lancaster,  Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan and Woody Stroke star. Notable, too, for Conrad Hall's  dexterous, beautiful cinematography.  </P> <P> Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train (TMC Thursday at 2:30 a.m.) features Wendy  Hughes in this cryptic 1987 Australian thriller as a chameleon-like hooker who  seduces men on a weekend night train, changing her personality to suit every  fresh conquest.  </P></p>

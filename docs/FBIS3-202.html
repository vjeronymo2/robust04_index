Ajello was  reacting to an AFP report that the UN could agree to elections  being held in October even if the two armies were in place. AFP  based its report on statements by Behrooz Sadry, Ajello's  deputy. Ajello told our correspondent that he questioned his  deputy about the report but that Sadry had denied the remarks  attributed to him by AFP.</p>

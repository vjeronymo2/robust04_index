			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Eunetcom wins Dollars 200m contract The telecommunications joint venture between the French and German state operators has won a Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) contract to provide international data services to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US information and business services group. Eunetcom, the Franco-German joint venture, will provide all of D&amp;B's worldwide data communications needs, taking responsibility for an existing network covering 30 countries, run by more than 150 staff. The contract, Eunetcom's most significant advance so far in the market for 'outsourcing' the telecoms needs of multinationals, comes amid negotiations between the Franco- German alliance and Sprint, the third-largest US long distance operator, about the formation of a larger alliance. Eunetcom is believed to have won the D&amp;B contract against strong competition from British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US telecoms operator. BT and MCI forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance last year geared to the outsourcing market, estimated by analysts to be worth at least Dollars 1bn a year in Europe. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom launched Eunetcom last September, and have since announced an Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) alliance to fully integrate their data communications services. Mr Claude Olier, Eunetcom chief executive, said: 'This proves that Eunetcom is set to play a big role in the international outsourcing market: we are not going to leave it to AT&amp;T and BT.' He added that up to 25 other contracts were in various stages of tendering, and that the saving on offer to companies outsourcing their telecoms was 'between 10 and 20 per cent of their current bill'. Eunetcom's opponents in the fast emerging global struggle for multinationals' telecoms business are AT&amp;T, the US operator, the BT-MCI alliance, and Unisource, a joint venture between the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch state operators. Unisource is working with AT&amp;T in one significant European contract, and analysts believe a full alliance may be in the offing. An announcement by Sprint about its relations with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom is expected within the next 10 days.</p>

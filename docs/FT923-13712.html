			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: On a train to nowhere - Radio THERE was Russian drama on Monday on Radio 4 and Tuesday on Radio 3. Tuesday's was outstanding, Moscow Stations by Venedikt Yerofeev, an hour's monologue spoken by Tom Courtenay with great skill. We are with a drunk on the train from Moscow to Petushki, where the birds always sing and the flowers bloom and his girl waits for him. He has lost his job as brigade-leader on useless work, but can afford endless 'cocktail' drinks with increasingly unlikely ingredients. Station follows station, but 'nobody ever gets to Petrushki'. The train may actually pass it, yet they are back at Kursk station in Moscow - if they ever left - and there come pain and a blackout that may last for ever. Philosophic, artistic, biblical and historical references abound in the tale, as comic as it is pathetic. There are Angels on call, but in the end they only laugh. The fine English version is by Stephen Mulrine, and the direction by Faynia Williams. Radio 4's Going Under, dramatised by Ken Whitmore from Lynda Chukovskaya's novel, is set in 1949 and has the quality of the Russian tales we know from that period. Set in a rest-camp where writers are sent to alleviate their deviance, it is the love-story of Nina Sergevevna, who believes her husband to be working in the mines, and Bilibin, who knows he is not. There is a contrapuntal theme from Veksler, a Jewish poet, who also cares for Nina. Literary taste is allowed more importance than politics ('It's poetry that keeps us apart'), and the tale seemed to me everyday stuff. Annette Crosbie was Nina (she reads Bilibin's 500-page manuscript in one evening), Graham Crowden was Bilibin and Martin Jenkins directed. Your Place or Mine? is a promising new series for Radio 4 on Sunday evenings. British and American documentary makers have combined in snapshots of Provincial Britain and Middle America that will be unfamiliar to the opposite sides. This week we visited Sedona, Arizona, revered by the Yevepoi Apache Indians for standing on red rock, red being sacred. The tribal chairman, Theo Smith senior, introduced himself to us, and we were told much about Sedona's history, which so entrances American tourists that New Age worshippers (no connection with our lot) have settled there in strength. You get more spiritual growth from the vortex there, said a settler, than from all the energy of New York. The wise Apache view is that you can worship just as effectively from anywhere you like. American scenes to come include the snake-handlers of the Appalachians, who quote biblical reference for the healing power of serpents, and the followers of quasi-Nazi David Duke in Louisiana. And we? Well, there are the Birmingham Moslems, including the English ones. There is the rivalry of Welsh- and English-speaking students at Bangor. These may seem as odd to the Americans as the snake-handlers to us, for the programmes are to go out on both sides of the Atlantic. Last night, still on Radio 4, Ray Gosling, one of the better commentators on ordinary life, began a new series, Gosling in the High Street, telling the history of firms we take for granted. He discussed with Montague Burton's son Arnold how those tailors began, and very romantic too - the first shop opened by teenage Sir Montague, an immigrant European Jew, on a handful of money, with the idea of providing everyone with a three-piece suit for a week's wages. To attract customers, he added dance-halls upstairs and billiard-saloons below.</p>

Foreign Ministry official Omar Morales told PRENSA LATINA  that since the beginning, his country was pleased with the idea  of creating the AEC because it is considered an important step  toward regional and Latin American integration.    He underscored that Cuba's main objectives at the meeting  that will be held 16-18 March in Kingston will be to work toward  integration and to tighten the cultural, scientific, and  technological ties of the countries of the region.    The Caribbean Basin and Central American countries, as well  as the countries of the Group of Three (G-3) -- namely Colombia,  Venezuela, and Mexico -- should comprise the AEC.    Morales added that the largest Antillean island is  considered  a potential member of the future AEC and that "we are willing  and politically determined to take part in all of the regional  integration processes."    Morales said the Foreign Ministry commends this project,  "because we are, above all, members of the Caribbean."    Asked about the importance of this zone for Cuba, he replied  that the island's current trade with these countries amounts to  some $25 million, which he deemed "a significant amount."    "This area has a lot to offer us in the tourist sector, and  Cuba, as member of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, has  signed agreements in this sector."    He said the signing of other agreements on the tapping of  maritime resources and transportation also confirm the need for  a greater Cuban presence in the region.    He added that, after the Kingston meeting, the foreign  ministers of the member-nations will meet to sign the charter  and that the AEC will become a reality with the signatures of  the heads of state.    "The preparatory work will conclude sooner than later, and  everything will be ready to make this project a reality," he  underscored.    Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez-Parodi will head the  delegation that will go to Kingston.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN FIRM SELLS UNIT TO BAYER AG  </P> <P> Nova Corp., a Canadian energy and chemical firm, said it is selling its Polysar  rubber division to the West German firm Bayer AG for $1.06 billion.  </P> <P> Nova will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt, the company said  in a statement from its Calgary, Alberta, headquarters. The rubber business is  part of Polysar Ltd., a firm acquired by Nova in 1988.  </P> <P> Bayer said the acquisition would supplement its rubber business, giving it  plants that produce synthetic rubber primarily for tire and industrial uses.  </P> <P> The transaction, which must be approved by government officials in the United  States, Canada and Europe, also provides for Bayer to assume Polysar's  outstanding debt.  </P></p>

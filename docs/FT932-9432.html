			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (8): Cote d'Azur, take a sentimental journey - The region's museums and art galleries embellish its glamorous image TRAVELLING around the Cote d'Azur conjures images of Brigitte Bardot sunning herself in Saint Tropez during the 1960s, or the packed pavement cafes of coastal towns in the 1990s. But there is another aspect to the Cote d'Azur, the tiny museums and art galleries tucked away in the Provencal hills, or clinging to the cliffs along the sea. These are the places that give a glimpse of the south before the Bardot-boom and of the serene lifestyle that attracted some of Europe's most famous artists - such as Renoir, Matisse and Picasso - to the region. Musee Renoir is typical. It is a sturdy stone house perched in the hills above Cagnes-sur-Mer where the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, lived with his wife and three sons from 1909 to 1919. The house and its contents have been left intact. Renoir's wheelchair is still in the studio, as are his easels, brushes and frames. The walls are hung with his paintings and those of friends such as Bonnard and Dufy. The garden is lovely, with ancient olive trees straggling down the hill and a view that stretches to the Cape of Antibes. But the real appeal of the museum, as with all France's musees sentimentaux, is that it is impossible to visit without imagining what it was like when Renoir himself lived and worked there. (Musee Renoir, avenue des Collettes, Cagnes-sur-Mer. Tel: 9320 6107.) If Renoir was content with a simple rustic house, Pablo Picasso's taste was a little more opulent. Picasso spent a long part of his life in the south, but one of the best collections of his work is at Musee Grimaldi-Picasso on the Antibes waterfront, where he lived for the summer and autumn of 1946. Musee Grimaldi-Picasso is a pretty old stone castle with stunning views onto the sea. The collection, although not as impressive as in the Musee Picasso in Paris, has a decent selection of oil paintings, ceramics and sculpture, most of which were completed while Picasso lived there. (Musee Grimaldi-Picasso, place Mariejol, Antibes. Tel: 9334 9191.) A little further along the coast from Antibes in the village of Biot is the Musee National Fernand Leger, the fruit of a donation by his wife, Nadine, to the French government, which houses one of the most extensive collections of Leger's work. The museum, contains many of Leger's most important paintings. The building, a modernist edifice set in rolling lawns and embellished with Leger's own brightly coloured friezes, is spectacular. The collection is illustrated by sketches and photographs which give a glimpse of the gregarious artist's life. (Musee National Fernand Leger, chemin du Val de Pome, Biot. Tel: 9365 6349.) The Cote d'Azur also houses a number of private collections. Fondation Ephrussi de Rothschild on Cap-Ferrat has an air of the Hollywood hills with its motley assortment of antique treasures - a Grecian column here, a Gothic doorway there - and its candy-coloured Italianate facade. The house was built at the turn of the century as a home for the baroness' collection of art and furniture, which ran from Tiepolo ceilings to Louis XIV chairs, Beauvais tapestries, Fragonard paintings and the tiny circular room on the ground floor where she entertained her lovers. (Fondation Ephrussi de Rothschild, Cap-Ferrat. Tel: 9301 3309.) A very different collection is lodged high in the hills near the village of Saint-Paul-de-Vence at Fondation Maeght. This is the gallery bequeathed by the Maeghts, a family of Paris art dealers, to house their private collection and temporary exhibitions which include some of the best-known names in modern art, including Giacometti, Miro, Arp and Zadkine. (Fondation Maeght, 06570 Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Tel: 9332 8163.) The village is also home to La Colombe d'Or, the famous restaurant, where Picasso, Braque, Calder, Miro and Chagall used to eat, paying for their food with their work. The restaurant, now run by the fourth generation of the founding Roux family, has been left with an art collection - a Leger frieze along the terrace, Braques and Picassos hung between the tables - which would be the envy of many museums. French foodies are wont to say that La Colombe d'Or's food is not as good as it used to be - but they tend to say that about almost every restaurant. Its tables quake under the weight of hearty Provence fare and it still scores a respectable 12 out of 20 in the snooty Gault Millau guide. (La Colombe d'Or, 06570 Saint-Paul. Tel: 9332 8002.) Visitors to Saint-Paul should also look in on the Chapelle du Rosaire in the neighbouring village of Vence, a tiny church designed by Henri Matisse, who believed that it included his finest pieces of stained glass.

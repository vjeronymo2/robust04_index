			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Jump in cost of materials The prices paid by manufac-turers for materials are rising sharply, according to the latest purchasing managers' index, increasing fears that inflation may be set to accelerate. The purchasing managers' index, produced by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, reached a record seasonally adjusted level of 62.2 per cent in July, from 61.3 per cent in June. The institute seasonally adjusted the index for the first time in July - had it not done so, the index would have recorded a small fall. The index is a weighted average of several factors such as order books, delivery times and prices. Any figure above 50 per cent indicates an increase in activity over the previous month. The repeated highs achieved by the index suggest that economic activity has been strengthening this year. However, the strength of the economy is causing some capacity constraints and price pressures. Suppliers' delivery times are lengthening as they struggle to fulfil new orders. This in turn is putting upward pressure on prices. The prices component of the index reached a record high in July, with a price increase on items such as paper, packaging, timber, aluminium, methanol and steel products. The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly trends survey, published earlier this week, also showed evidence of inflationary pressure, with an increase in the number of companies planning to raise prices. However, Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, downplayed the significance of the price findings. 'It tracks producer input prices rather than output prices. All it is telling us is that commodity prices have gone up, which we knew already.' The institute, which interviewed 280 purchasing managers, also reported that output is at its highest level since July 1991, and that recruitment rose this month.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Observer: Credit where it's due Peter Wallenberg, overlord of the mighty Wallenberg industrial empire, is probably rueing his decision to abandon his family motto Esse Non Vidare - To be, not to be seen. Wallenberg is worried at the rocky state of Sweden's economy. So he wrote a newspaper article and gave a highly unusual hour-long television interview, ahead of Sunday's general election. Grasping the media tiger by the tail is a dangerous exercise. For Wallenberg's message - that the new government must slash the budget deficit  -has been drowned in a welter of negative headlines, some perhaps justifiable, others obviously not. The really hot water came via Wallenberg's reference to South Africa. He referred to svartingar - roughly translatable as 'blackies' - as not being able to manage without the whites. Phew] This, within a country which was for years one of the leading backers of the African National Congress. 'I expressed myself inconsiderately and wish to apologise,' said the 68-year-old Wallenberg. But ill fortune hunts in packs. Yesterday, the tabloid newspaper Expressen carried an alarming headline - 'Wallenberg threatens to leave Sweden if we vote the wrong way'. Sensational stuff, given that Wallenberg companies dominate Swedish industry and the family has always been intensely patriotic. The Wallenberg camp has now hastily disclaimed any such notion; what he really said was that some companies would be under pressure to shift their HQs overseas if Sweden's credit rating was lowered. Lowered credit ratings all round, perhaps.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance provided by small business development centers (SBDC), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority institutions (MI), and procurement technical assistance centers (PTAC). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance furnished by the mentor's employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A mentor firm may receive credit toward the attainment of an SDB subcontracting goal(s) for each subcontract awarded for a product or a service by the mentor firm to an entity that qualifies as a protege firm pursuant to I&hyph;104(a). With respect to a former SDB protege (firm(s), a mentor may take credit for awards to such concern(s) that, except for its size would be a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, but only if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The size of such business concern is not more than two times the appropriate size standard; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The business concern formerly had a mentor-protege agreement with such mentor firm that was not terminated for cause; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The credit is taken not later than October 1, 1999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Amounts credited toward the SDB goal(s) for unreimbursed costs under the Program shall be separately identified from the amounts credited toward the goal resulting from the award of actual subcontracts to protege firms. The combination of the two shall equal the mentor firm's overall accomplishment toward the SDB goal(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed under paragraphs I&hyph;109(a) and (b) if the DoD Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization determines that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its SDB subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards declined from the prior fiscal year without justifiable cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for mentor firm's participation in the Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The mentor firm shall be afforded the opportunity to explain the decline in SDB participation before imposition of any such limitation on credit. In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, the DoD Director shall consider_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The mentor firm's overall SDB participation rates (in terms of percentages of subcontract awards and dollars awarded) as compared to the participation rates existing during the two fiscal years prior to the firm's admission to the Program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the prior two fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract awards under such contracts; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The decision of the Director regarding the imposition of a limitation on credit shall be final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Any prospective limitation on credit imposed by the Director shall be expressed as a percentage of otherwise eligible credit and shall apply beginning on a specific date in the future and continue until a date certain during the current fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Any retroactive limitation on credit imposed by the Director shall reflect the actual costs incurred for developmental assistance (not exceeding the maximum amount reimbursed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) For purposes of calculating any incentives to be paid to a mentor firm for exceeding an SDB subcontracting goal pursuant to 252.219&hyph;7009, incentives shall be paid only if an SDB subcontracting goal has been exceeded as a result of actual subcontract awards to SDBs (excluding credit under paragraphs I&hyph;109 (a), (b) and (c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an approved mentor-protege agreement, and have been charged to, but not reimbursed through a separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement entered into between the DoD and the mentor firm, or through a separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract, shall not be otherwise reimbursed, either as a direct or indirect cost, under any other DoD contract, irrespective of whether the costs have been recognized for credit against SDB subcontracting goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protege agreement is distinct from, and shall not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontract. Costs associated with the latter shall be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under the Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> I&hyph;110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Advance agreements on the treatment of developmental assistance costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking reimbursement, credit, or a combination thereof, are strongly encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the development assistance pursuant to the mentor-protege agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and address the need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protege agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed, credited or a combination thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (8): Pleasure in diversity - Angela Wigglesworth joins the tourist beat WHAT brings 3.5m visitors to Devon each year? The answer lies in the diversity of what the county has to offer: wide surfing and sandy beaches, pretty villages, the resorts of Torquay, Brixham and Paignton and attractive old towns of Totnes, Dartmouth and Salcombe. For excellent wet weather facilities you have Plymouth and Exeter. There are the wild, open spaces of Dartmoor and Exmoor, the coastal paths on the South West Way Peninsula Walk and any number of sporting facilities. Publicity brochures list 300 tourist attractions, and accommodation ranges from low cost to luxury. But although the number of visitors has fallen this year - and those who came have spent less - Devon is awash with new schemes to care for the countryside and prevent tourists from destroying places they come to enjoy. The Devon Action for Tourism and the Environment (DATE) is an initiative from the county council; the Dartmoor Area Tourist Initiative (DATI) is a public and private sector partnership providing village, town and farm interpretations, guided walks, grant-aided conservation work, public transport initiatives, and a Green Business Guide for tourism businesses to adopt a go-green policy. On Exmoor, the National Park authorities are coordinating public transport to make it easier for visitors to use. National Trust is using car parks as tools to keep people away from 'honeypots'; the Devon and Cornwall Rail project seeks to make local transport services (the Tamar Valley line and the Tarka Line) more viable for visitors; the Tarka Trail, now being developed, will be a long-distance walking and cycling route along a disused railway track linking Exmoor and Dartmoor. 'Celebrate the Countryside,' to be launched on November 9, seeks to encourage people to speak of the West Country as a rural rather than seaside resort destination. 'While this is a marketing campaign,' says Janet Reynolds, the county council's tourism development officer, 'it will enable us to find out what people want, and we hope ultimately to have a system into which private sector operators put money to fund local projects.' This summer, South Devon's green efforts (which include, in Torbay, using energy-saving 12 volts instead of 250 for its illuminations) were rewarded when the area was chosen to be a national pilot for an English Tourist Board project to promote environmentally friendly tourism. The country's first-ever Green Tourism officer will be appointed soon. 'I think this is the missing link,' says Sue Beswick, marketing and tourist officer for South Hams, one of the areas in the scheme. 'The advantage of having a specific officer is that he or she will be able to get and talk to the industry. It's all very well telling hoteliers they should use enviromentally friendly products, but what are they going to cost and where do they get them?' Up in North Devon, many involved in the tourism industry feel the area does not have a high enough profile, and that local councils should spend more on marketing it. Mr Gordon Moore, who manages the Clovelly Visitors Centre and is chairman of the Devon Association of Tourist Attractions says that although tourism is the biggest industry in North Devon, the two councils covering the area (North Devon and Torridge) only spend about Pounds 120,000 in total on promoting it, and the figures should be doubled. At The Milky Way, near Clovelly, where the Stanbury family turned their dairy farm into a successful tourist attraction when ruin stared them in the face after the introduction of milk quotas in 1984, Mr Trevor Stanbury feels that, as most Torridge councillors do not work in tourism, they cannot see the benefits. There are problems, too, with planners. Nick Harvey, the North Devon MP, believes they are over-protective and not sufficiently flexible. The North Devon link road, which opened three years ago, cut into the wilderness to replace the old road with its pubs and hotels. No one uses this one now, but the local authority is refusing permission for hoteliers and publicans to put up directional signs on the new road to tell visitors what facilities are available nearby which would make their stay in Devon more enjoyable. 'Some of the villagers are pleased to be passed by,' Nick Harvey admits. The holiday resort in Devon which probably has the most problems is Ilfracombe. Unemployment is 22 per cent (its largest increase was over the last year - top of the national league). A few hotels are feeling the recession so much that they are advertising to people on social security in Liverpool with the message: why be out of work in Liverpool when you can be out of work in Devon? (People have already responded - and come, causing intense controversy in the town.) The chief executive, Bob Hall, admits Ilfracombe needs to be served by a better road system - but as this would cost Pounds 32m and the council has Pounds 8m a year to spend, it is not likely to get it. The town's decaying Victorian theatre will have to close in two years time unless it is rescued by a private developer, because there is no public money to restore it. Mr Nigel Smith, the tourism officer, admits the town needs millions spent on it to make any real difference But he is optimistic about the county's future. 'Britainhasn't got a good reputation for value for money in the tourism field,' he says, 'but I think Devon's hotels, particularly, do offer very good rates. A Devon success story? 30 years ago Percy Brend, a butcher who supplied meat to the local luxury hotel at Staunton Sands, dreamed of buying it. He did buy it - and now his three sons run it, together with nine other hotels in the West Country. Percy's widow, Florence, now in her 80s, still has a hand in the hotels' interior decoration. This year the family bought another three star hotel in Barnstaple, and has built a luxury out-door pool at Staunton Sands overlooking the resort's three mile long sandy beach.</p>

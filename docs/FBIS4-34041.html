			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Frantz Roberto  Monde, Haitian Chamber of Deputies president, is prepared to  support parliament's ratification of the de facto government of  provisional President Emile Jonassaint if a U.S. invasion takes  place.    The deputy criticized the international community for not  having accepted the plan to solve the Haitian crisis approved by  parliament this past 2 March. This plan recommended the  appointment of a prime minister by constitutional President Jean  Bertrand Aristide and General Raoul Cedras' resignation from the  Armed Forces leadership. "Since the international community  refused the plan and decided in favor of an invasion, we at a  the local level must adopt measures to ensure the defense of the  territory," Monde stressed in statements which were broadcast  last night over the radio.    Monde confirmed his willingness to support the Jonassaint de  facto government if foreign military forces intervene in the  country. "If an invasion takes place, this government will  cease to be a government of exception and will become a legal  government in order to defy the invasion," the deputy stated.    In reference to reservations held by the majority of the  deputies not to recognize the de facto government, Monde pointed  out that he hopes the parliamentarians "will participate in the  sessions in order to adopt this decision in case of an  invasion." He added that "if the majority of the deputies  decide to abstain from participating and expressing their  opposition to an occupation, I believe the last measure to be  adopted then should be to dissolve parliament."    Monde, as president of the Chamber of Deputies has not yet  adopted an official position in favor of installing the de facto  government. Monde, however, has been closely linked to all the  government decisions proposed by the military and has appeared  in all official ceremonies beside Jonassaint.    On the other hand, the "Crisis Group," created following the  implementation of the state of emergency on Sunday and composed  by the ministers of economy, foreign affairs, interior, defense,  and information, met for the first time yesterday.    In addition, during an irregular Senate session, a group of  senators in favor of the de facto government revived the memory  of the military removed by the United States in 1915 and 1916  during Haiti's occupation. In their resolution, these senators,  most of whom were elected during the fraudulent 18 January 1993  elections, abolished the expulsion order decreed by the U.S.  Navy against the Haitian military and reinstated them to the  Army with their respective ranks.    In explaining the resolution, described as bizarre and  demagogic by political observers in the Haitian capital city,  Senator Ehrane Cadet, member of the Alliance for Parliamentary  Cohesion that supported the Aristide overthrow, stated that its  objective is to encourage Haitians to defend the nation.</p>

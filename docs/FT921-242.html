			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Personal View: A sensible bank merger The recently announced intention of the Midland and Hongkong banks to merge raises questions about the future of British banking. I shall discuss two of them, but in doing so I may not be able to display the appropriate degree of objectivity. Having spent much effort trying to bring this merger about, and having apparently failed 18 months ago, the possibility that it might now actually occur fills me with a pleasure as intense as it is wry. The first question is: if the UK is over-banked, would not an intra-market merger be strategically better than one with an overseas bank? The second is whether, in view of so many mistakes, banks are wise to aspire to global status rather than stick to their back yards? Is the UK over-banked? If one thinks of personal banking services, the answer must be yes. Including building societies, there are some 650 institutions operating some 20,000 branches engaged in selling and processing a limited range of inherently simple products for the personal customer: loans, including mortgages; deposits; the receipt and payment of cash and the transfer of monetary claims and liabilities. With most institutions having a small share of the market for these products (even Barclays, the biggest UK clearer, has less than 14 per cent of deposits) there could be many mergers before problems with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would arise on this count. Individual mergers could help to reduce the duplication of resources. But they could provide only a partial solution because the problem arises less from the number of players than from the wasteful way in which the industry distributes its products. Few personal banking services require either a visit to a branch or the kind of paper and labour intensive processing now done in branches. It will be a long time before the revolution in methods of distribution is complete, but the elements of a solution are already visible: automated teller machines; telephone and postal banking; centralised processing and electronic transmission networks. In the end, it will be the application of technology, money and imagination more than greater concentration which will reduce the economic waste in distributing personal banking services. For the banks' corporate customers, the picture is different. The UK already has one of the most concentrated corporate banking industries in the world. If NatWest's existing share of the small business market were to emerge now as the result of a proposed merger, it is very unlikely that the MMC would allow it. For the handful of banks in this market, it is hard to avoid both bad debts and criticism. (Abbey National's shareholders must be praying that they do not try to enter it). There are doubtless many ways in which banking support to the corporate sector could be improved, but it is hard to believe that further reducing customers' already limited choice is one of them. For the largest companies, including the multinationals, the picture is different again. Competition to provide banking services to these clients has been worldwide and intense. Corporate treasurers have played banks off against each other, driving margins down to derisory levels, while economic conditions and management errors have led to some significant losses for the world's largest banks. There must be a temptation for a big bank to withdraw from this field altogether. But generally, this cannot be a correct response. Business, even medium-sized business, is becoming increasingly international. Some banks at least will have to follow it. Within a decade, there may be perhaps a dozen or so truly global players. And conditions are already changing to make their role a profitable one. Multi-banking without loyalties does not look so smart for a company when the going gets rough. There is now a clear move back to relationship banking. The recent behaviour of the Japanese banks (everyone in - everyone out) has been an object lesson. A merger between the Hongkong Bank and Midland would mean that the UK would have three truly international banks. And the new bank would probably be the only non-Japanese global bank with a substantial presence in Asia, the fastest growing area in the world. Of course, as in any industry, global size has its risks. The decentralisation of management that is essential carries dangers of loss of control, which can be especially serious for a bank. Financial and credit controls will have to be tight. But size can convey great advantages. For Hongkong/Midland, the integration of their worldwide treasury operations and their correspondent banking and trade services would be very valuable. Size and geographical spread would enable them to serve corporate customers particularly well. And capital strength would help with credit rating and Midland's ongoing attempts to rationalise and reduce the cost of its retail banking.

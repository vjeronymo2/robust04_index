			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadier day as oil issues show strength Wall Street US SHARE prices were flat to slightly higher in a lightly traded session yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average managing a small improvement after posting a 68-point drop on Friday, writes Laurie Morse. Market analysts said strength in oil shares and a recovery in tobacco marketer Philip Morris helped the Dow Average higher, while the broader market was flat. The Dow closed 8.38 better at 3,379.19, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged forward 0.90 to 442.29 and the American SE composite was 0.32 firmer at 417.84. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.86 at 670.71. New York SE volume amounted to 238.63m shares, down from Friday's 323m. Philip Morris's stock, which lost 23 per cent of its value on Friday after the company said it would reduce the price of its best-selling Marlboro cigarette in an ongoing price war with tobacco discounters, recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 49 7/8 and was the most actively traded issue of Monday's session. Other US tobacco giants were mixed, with RJR Holdings, the recent spin-off of RJR Nabisco, slipping Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 6 1/2 and American Brands closing steady at Dollars 30. The shock of Philip Morris's name-brand discounting spread to other non-durable consumer products stocks yesterday. Procter &amp; Gamble was Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 47 3/8 , while personal care company Gillette lost Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 58 and Colgate-Palmolive fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 . Analysts said price-cutting could extend to branded items such as detergents, disposable diapers, and mouthwash. Friday's timber summit in Seattle lent support to forest products companies. Weyerhauser gained Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 42 1/4 , while Georgia Pacific advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 61 3/4 and Louisiana Pacific finished Dollars 1 3/8 higher at Dollars 70. IBM ended unchanged at Dollars 52 5/8 , after trading higher initially on news that it plans to cut the compensation packages of employees who leave the company after July 1, a development which may hasten planned personnel cuts at the computer giant. Oil issues boosted the Dow Average, with Exxon finishing Dollars  3/4 ahead at Dollars 67, Texaco Dollars 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 64 3/4 and Chevron Dollars 2 1/4 stronger at Dollars 83 1/2 . Canada TORONTO finished mixed after a heavy trading session, with gains in the oil and gas and financial services sectors compensating for transportation share price losses. Traders said market sentiment on Canadian banks is generally on the upswing. One commented: 'People like bank stocks because they think the worst is over. They expect earnings to improve once all the loan/loss provisions are taken care of.' The TSE 300 index gained 9.3 at 3,604.4 but declines outpaced advances by 330 to 303, with 267 issues steady. Volume came to 53.1m shares valued at CDollars 512.84m. Active shares included Suncor, which dipped CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 25 1/8 on volume of 7.6m shares after the Ontario Energy Corporation sold its entire Suncor stake for a total of CDollars 190m, and Pure Gold Resources, which firmed 14 cents to 60 cents with 1.8m shares changing hands.</p>

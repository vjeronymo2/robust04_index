			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Georgia vote lifts Republican spirits: Democratic incumbent loses run-off for Senate seat despite Clinton support THE Democratic party's majority in the US Senate will not be increased following the defeat of Senator Wyche Fowler in a run-off election in the state of Georgia on Tuesday. Mr Paul Coverdell, the Republican candidate and director of the Peace Corps under President George Bush, apparently beat Mr Fowler by about 15,000 votes in a poll of 1.25m, less than half the turnout recorded on November 3. Mr Fowler did not formally concede defeat, pending a count of absentee votes, but admitted it looked as if Georgia would be getting a new senator. The Coverdell victory gives the Republicans 43 seats, the same number as in the old Senate. The Democratic total is expected to remain at 57 assuming that in North Dakota Mr Kent Conrad wins another special election next week. Mr Conrad is already a senator from the state. He declined to seek a second term because of congressional inability to reduce the budget deficit, but changed his mind when another seat came up. Mr Fowler narrowly won on November 3, beating Mr Coverdell by 49-48 per cent. But Georgia state law, unique in the US, requires a run-off if no candidate wins at least 50 per cent, a total denied both men by the 3 per cent scored by the Libertarian party candidate, who was excluded from Tuesday's election. President-elect Bill Clinton had campaigned in person for Mr Fowler on Monday, but Mr James Carville, his political strategist, rejected suggestions yesterday that he had sacrificed prestige by becoming involved. Mr Clinton carried Georgia in the November presidential election, an important breakthrough in the south even though his victory was by a slender margin. Mr Coverdell becomes only the second Republican senator from Georgia since the reconstruction era after the Civil War. The first, Mr Mack Mattingly, was defeated in 1986 by Mr Fowler, previously a congressman. Mr Coverdell consistently attacked Mr Fowler for being an inside member of the Washington establishment His victory is also the first piece of good news for the national Republican party since the presidential election. The party has been consumed by painful post-mortems of why it lost the White House and achieved only small gains in the House of Representatives.</p>

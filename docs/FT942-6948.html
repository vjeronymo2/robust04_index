			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Trafalgar omits interim dividend Shares in Trafalgar House fell by almost 10 per cent yesterday after the UK-based group reported lower than expected interim profits and said margins would stay under severe pressure in its core engineering business. Trafalgar's shares closed 9p lower at 86p although the group, whose interests range from engineering, construction and property to London's Ritz Hotel and the Cunard liners, reported that it had moved back into profit. It omitted the interim dividend. The group posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.4m in the six months to March 31, compared with a Pounds 98.6m loss a year ago when the group made substantial write-downs in the value of its property portfolio. Turnover was almost unchanged at Pounds 1.78bn. Operating profits in the engineering division fell to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 18.1m) on turnover which slipped to Pounds 1.09bn (Pounds 1.13bn). Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'Economic conditions throughout the world, whilst slowly improving, remain very competitive, particularly in the engineering and construction industries, and we do not expect any significant change in the near term.' Mr Keswick, also chairman of Hongkong Land Holdings, which holds a 25.3 per cent stake in Trafalgar, added: 'Against this background we are continuing our efforts to improve the underlying competitive positions of our businesses. Achieving a return to profit in the half year, albeit a modest one, is a first step, following the reconstruction of the group's finances.' Earnings per share were 0.4p, compared with a loss of 18.2p. Details, Page 20</p>

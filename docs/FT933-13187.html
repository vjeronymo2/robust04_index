			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / BA credit union may spur greater challenge to banks BRITISH AIRWAYS has become the UK's first private sector employer to establish a credit union in a move expected to encourage more companies to offer banking services to their staff. The credit union, which was registered with the Registry of Friendly Societies in June, comes into full operation at the end of the month. It hopes to attract several thousand members and eventually offer a full range of financial services, including mortgages, cheque books and credit cards. Credit unions in countries such as the US, which has more than 60m credit union members, are permitted to offer banking services such as credit cards, but British credit unions are barred from doing this. However, a rapid expansion in the British credit union movement, which has seen its membership and assets grow by about 40 per cent during the past year, is fuelling demands that British credit unions be allowed to operate along US lines. The Association of British Credit Unions, which represents 190 of the country's 405 credit unions, is drawing up proposals for new legislation with the Registry of Friendly Societies, the sector's regulator, which it hopes to put to parliament by the end of the year. Mr Michael Parkinson, chief executive of Abcu, said a significant shift was occuring in the role and image of credit unions, with the fastest growth among public sector employee credit unions. These represent some 60 per cent of the Pounds 30m of savings controlled by Abcu. 'A lot of credit unions now want to offer banking-type facilities. We don't see why they can't - there is a lot of disillusionment with the banks and building societies now,' he said. Although credit unions had originally made their name by providing a banking system for poor people who could not use banks, most credit union members were now using them as an additional means of banking or source of cheap loans, Mr Parkinson said. At present, credit unions are not allowed to charge more than 12.68 per cent annual interest on loans, a rate that is considerably cheaper than most bank loans. Members of a credit union, however, are not allowed to borrow until they have saved for three months, and in most cases can only borrow up to two or three times the level of their savings, with a maximum loan of Pounds 5,000 plus an amount equal to their savings. Although credit unions do not officially pay interest, and can only use their members' savings as assets, they can pay dividends of up to 8 per cent per annum. The organisers of the British Airways UK credit union, who point out that the airline has been running a credit union in the US for nearly 40 years, say the move has already prompted inquiries from other companies. Other credit union organisers yesterday said reform of the sector could be a difficult battle. Ms June Nightingale, administrator at the Glasgow City Council credit union, which has more than 4,000 members, said: 'It will probably take years before we can offer mortgages or credit cards because we are going to be up against the banks and the building societies.'</p>

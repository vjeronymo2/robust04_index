			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO BECOME A MARROW DONOR  </P> <P> Almost any healthy adult can register to become a bone marrow donor, according  to Liz Quam, a spokeswoman for the National Marrow Donor Program based in St.  Paul, Minn.  </P> <P> Potential donors are sent to a local testing center where two tablespoons of  blood are drawn to test four of six tissue factors. The results from the  initial test are then entered into the center's national computer system for  comparison to patients throughout North America and in some European nations.  </P> <P> So far, private donations and some federal funding have borne the $50 cost of  the initial tests, Quam said.  </P> <P> If the volunteer's first four tissue factors match that of a patient -- a  statistically rare event -- a program worker may visit the volunteer at home or  at work to take another blood sample to match the final two factors.  </P> <P> The $200 cost of the second test is borne by the patient.  </P> <P> "If you match again, by that time, everybody starts to get excited," Quam said.  </P> <P> The volunteer is given an extensive physical examination to assure that he or  she is in perfect health before any final agreements are signed.  </P> <P> Once an exact match involving a healthy donor has been found, the patient then  undergoes chemotherapy to destroy his or her existing marrow. During the seven  to 10 days that this process requires, Quam said, donors often feel a  heightened sense of responsibility.  </P> <P> "One woman told me she felt like she was pregnant again, and that every time  she crossed a street or drove a car she had to be extra careful because she was  in charge of two lives," Quam said.  </P> <P> The donor then is admitted to a hospital for an overnight stay. During the  removal procedure, the donor is placed under general anesthesia and needles are  inserted in the pelvic bone through the small of the back to draw the marrow.  </P> <P> The procedure causes a bruised sensation that lasts about a week, Quam said.  </P> <P> "Donors have said it's like falling on ice on your rear end," she said. "It's a  Tylenol type of pain. . . . We've had donors who said they went jogging the  next day."  </P> <P> Information about the program is available by calling (800) 654-1247.

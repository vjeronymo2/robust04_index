			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: VNU sells printing operations VNU, the largest publishing group in the Netherlands, is to sell its printing division to De Boer Boekhoven, a Dutch printing group, in a cash and paper deal that will leave it with a 30 per cent stake in the new printing company. The transaction will create the largest printing group in the Netherlands, with annual turnover of Fl 1.2bn (Dollars 665m). It will enable VNU to concentrate on its core publishing activities, in line with a strategy pursued successfully by Elsevier and Wolters-Kluwer, the Netherlands' other two dominant publishing groups, since the early 1980s. VNU is to receive Fl 100m in cash, shares worth Fl 19m and 1.88m five-year warrants in De Boer Boekhoven. It will provide the new printing group with a Fl 40m subordinated loan and a Fl 18m convertible bond. Last month, it took a Fl 80m charge on 1992, reflecting expectations that it would sell its printing division for less than book value. Mr Joep Brentjens, VNU's chairman, said VNU intended to hold its stake at around 30 per cent, which meant that it may sell shares that it gains through the conversion of loans or exercise of warrants. De Boer Boekhoven is only one-third the size of the printing activities that it will be acquiring from VNU. The Fl 100m in cash is to be provided by a banking consortium led by ABN AMRO, which owns 42 per cent of De Boer Boekhoven.</p>

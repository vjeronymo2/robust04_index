			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Head-On Blow at `Human Rights' Mongers"] </F>   [Text] At the 50th panel session of the UN Human Rights  Commission in Geneva on the 9th of this month, representatives  of Western countries again produced a so-called draft resolution  on "China's human rights situation." In so doing, they  attempted to raise provocations against and impose greater  pressure on China by using pretexts they have cooked up. The  Chinese representative refuted the resolution with perfect  justice at the meeting and raised a no-action motion on the  text. It turned out that China's motion passed the panel by a  majority vote. This incident clearly tells us that interference  in the internal affairs of other countries under the cover of  human rights can find less and less public support these days.  Chinese Premier Li Peng's remarks on the incident in his  Government Work Report delivered at the NPC session yesterday  were met with a thunderous applause, thus showing clearly the  disgust of the 1.2 billion Chinese people with these human  rights mongers.    It is known to all that China is the world's biggest  developing country. China's backwardness is, to a great extent,  the result of the protracted aggression and oppression of a  number of major western countries, which today are engaged in  selling "human rights." As an independent sovereign country,  China is now concentrating its energy on economic construction  with a view to build itself into a modernized country. The  Chinese Government has gained the thoroughgoing understanding  that realization of this goal requires a sound social  environment of stability and unity. Any turbulence in China  will not only bring disasters to the Chinese people, but will  also produce a great adverse impact on the stability and peace  of Asia as well as the world. Practice has proved that the  policy of reform, development, and stability currently pursued  by the Chinese Government is a correct and successful policy.  However, there are always people with ulterior motives in  foreign countries who fly in the face of the facts, deliberately  create over and over again so-called "human rights problems,"  and seize on the subject to exaggerate matters. The "shells"  they are using in their attacks against China are no more than  the few violators of Chinese law. They never concerned  themselves in the past and do not take an interest today in the  sufferings of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.  It is obvious to all that their real aim in brandishing the  club of "human rights" is to impose political pressure on China,  obstruct China's stability and development, and force the  Chinese people to give up the development road they have chosen  which conforms to China's national conditions. It is natural,  therefore, that what they are up to has been cast aside by the  Chinese people and the Chinese Government.    It seems strange that all human rights mongers in today's  world suffer from farsightedness. They can only envisage or  imagine the problems of other countries, especially the Third  World developing countries, yet turn a blind eye to the human  rights situation in their own countries. As a matter of fact,  the human rights records of their own countries are most  inglorious. Among those who are selling "human rights," the  most hard-working will perhaps be a handful of people with power  and influence in the United States. Over recent years, these  people have gone so far as to lump together the "human rights"  issue with totally unrelated trade issues, asserting that  "China's MFN trading status will be abolished" provided China  fails to improve its "human rights" situation. Such an absurd  idea has been found unacceptable even by many in the Western  camp. At his meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher the day before yesterday, Australian Foreign  Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in firm and clear-cut terms  that Australia disapproves the current practice of the United  States to lump together human rights with the MFN issue, for the  MFN trading status "is not an honorable privilege but a form of  normal trading relations."    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to  arrive in Beijing today for a visit, and he is the  highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China since President  Bill Clinton took office. That China receives him during the NPC  and CPPCC sessions has clearly underscored the fact that China  attaches great importance to its relations with the United  States. The Chinese Government believes that establishing and  promoting friendly relations between the two countries not only  tallies with the interests of both, but is also beneficial to  maintaining peace in the Asian-Pacific region and the world.  China's policy toward the United States encompasses augmenting  mutual trust, reducing troubles, stepping up cooperation, and  refraining from coming into confrontation. During Christopher's  visit in the country, China is willing to exchange views with  him on bilateral relations and wide-ranging international  affairs on an equal footing with a view to further mutual  understanding. Yet, if someone takes China's forbearance for  frailty and vulnerability to attack, makes indiscreet criticisms  with insufferable arrogance, and even threatens to cancel  China's MFN trading status, then he is sure to meet with a  rebuff in China.</p>

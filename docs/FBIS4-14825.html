			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] It has been reported by the government press  service that the government has decided to satisfy the request  from the Estonian EVTV and Reklaamitelevisioon [RETV] television  companies to jointly use the television channel vacated by the  Russian Ostankino Television and Radio Company. The government  has also decided to propose that the Kanal Kaks television  company use the whole of the former Russian television channel.  According to the government's resolution today, the Ministry of  Culture and Education will have to issue temporary licenses for  relays of local television programs in the areas around Sillamae  and Narva.    EVTV and RETV have decided to split the use of the channel  between them for the time being. Mart Siiman, RETV's managing  director told the Estonian Telegraph Agency that there is a  possibility of a merger in the future. [passage omitted]</p>

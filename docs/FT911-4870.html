			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Egyptians face austerity package NEWS OF an austerity package, including a 10 per cent sales tax, dampened Egyptian celebrations for the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan yesterday. The announcement, timed to coincide with the most cheerful day of the Islamic calendar and the forthcoming May Day bonus for government workers, also heralded sharp increases in petrol prices and electricity charges to comply with the demands of the International Monetary Fund. Egypt, which has just agreed in principle a new Dollars 350m standby arrangement with the Fund, has been under pressure to reduce its budget deficit by further reining in subsides and by increasing revenue-raising measures. Petrol prices will rise by 30 per cent and electricity by 35 per cent.</p>

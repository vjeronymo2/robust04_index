			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Gonzalez Amador] </F>   [Text] Hermino Blanco Mendoza, under secretary for  international trade relations at the Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretariat (Secofi), acknowledged yesterday that  Mexico's productive sector has expressed its opposition to  attempts to lower tariffs in advance on 155 goods included in  the Free Trade Pact (TLC).    The official stated that, following discussions between  Secofi authorities and Mexican manufacturers, "very few articles  will undergo tariff exemptions adjustments, since the position  adopted by Mexican manufacturers and farmers is not to negotiate  with respect to this aspect."    Yesterday, Herminio Blanco participated in hearings by the  Senate's Trade and Industrial Development and Foreign Relations  Commissions in which he provided an explanation with respect to  the status of the free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa  Rica.    Departing from the hearing's agenda, Angel Sergio Guerrero,  Durango State PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] senator,  said that lowering duties in advance on 155 items included in  the TLC -- announced in the 22 May Official Gazette -- "would be  similar to substantially modifying the North American Free Trade  Agreement [NAFTA], which is of concern since adjustments have  been suggested by one of the parties to the agreement." The  senator asked: What's the reason for this attempt to propose  tariff exemptions in advance?    The Secofi official explained to the PRI senator that "there  should be no apprehensions because the treaty allows lowering  tariffs in advance if requested by one of the parties and if the  other two are in agreement."    Blanco added that Secofi had analyzed the issue ever since  the announcement was published in the Official Gazette. He also  indicated that Secofi is expected to conclude discussions on the  issue by 23 June. However, Blanco pointed out that the position  adopted by the country's productive sector is not to negotiate  lowering tariffs in advance.    Under Secretary Blanco stated that of the 155 items on which  tax exemptions had been proposed "per Mexico's request," 107  were proposed by Mexico, 43 by the United States, and seven by  Canada. These items represent a "relatively low bilateral trade  flow," which represents 3.8 percent of Mexico's exports to the  United States and 2.8 percent of U.S. sales to Mexico.    The U.S. counterpart, Blanco added, requested tariff  exemptions for items such as potatoes, beans, cheese, and wine.  However, Mexican growers pointed out that exemptions in advance  are unthinkable in these cases. Hermino Blanco explained to the  senators that the final outcome of this process will be that  "very few items will receive tariff exemptions before the dates  established by the free trade agreement."    In a meeting with federal representatives, Hector Teran, a  PAN [National Action Party] member and Baja California senator,  indicated that along the northern border "there are problems  realizing the benefits of the free trade agreement." He also  voiced his doubts with respect to the ever-growing trade  deficit's being profitable to the country, saying that, on the  contrary, the imbalance in the exchange of goods could undermine  the currency's parity during the next few months.    In reply, Blanco pointed out that the trade deficit, which  totaled $4.317 billion during the first quarter, is natural and  indicated that Mexico is a country that imports capital goods  and raw materials essential to its development. He added that  this past April, for the first time, monthly exports to the  United States surpassed $4 billion. He also proposed that  Secofi exercise more vigilance in order to expedite export  transactions, although he insisted that, regarding deregulation,  "many things have changed favorably."    During the hearing, which was presided over by Hidalgo  Senator Humberto Lugo Gil, PRI bloc coordinator in the Chamber  of Senators, 10 legislators intervened to request more  information with respect to the free trade agreement between  Mexico and Costa Rica signed this past 5 April by both nations'  presidents.    In his presentation before the question and answer period,  Herminio Blanco Mendoza pointed out that, as a result of the  agreed upon trade liberalization program, Mexico will be able to  export, starting on the day the treaty comes into force, all  goods that Costa Rica does not produce. Thus, 70 percent of  nonagricultural Mexican sales to that nation and 75 percent of  Costa Rican exports to Mexico will be tariff-free.    In reply to a question by Morelos Senator Angel Ventura  Valle, the Secofi official said that agricultural exports from  Costa Rica to Mexico will not harm national production. Costa  Rican coffee and plantains were excluded from the agreement, and  the elimination of tariffs on Costa Rican corn and beans will be  implemented in 15 years, he added.    Sinaoloa Senator Gustavo Guerrero said that produce growers  in his state worry about the possibility of illegal  transshipment of tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce, and other produce  from the United States to Mexico. Blanco Mendoza said that the  rules on the origin of products specified in the agreement are  clear. He added that Mexican authorities, in coordination with  national producers, will ensure that this type of illegal  practices do not occur.    Herminio Blanco Mendoza said that the trade agreements  reached on the American Continent in past years constitute a  firm step toward the establishment of genuine regional trade  integration. "After decades of speeches there is finally  progress," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Guan Anping, director of the Beijing-based Anpingcheng </F> Law Firm: "Old Contract Laws Need Repair To Fit Into New  Reality"]    [Text] China needs to work out a new set of contract laws  compatible with international practice so as to better serve the  market economy.    China's contract laws, written during the years of a planned  economy, cannot meet the new demands. Under changed realities,  many articles contradict each other.    And China has different contract laws for domestic and  foreign trades, as well as for different businesses. This no  longer complies with the demand of a unified domestic market,  which will become an integral part of the world market.    Different economic contract laws for domestic and foreign  trades are designed by developing countries to protect their  weak industries.    But as China is now preparing to re-enter the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and to fully participate  in international business activities, the dual-standards are  apparently out of date and detrimental to the establishment of  the market economy.    Overseas investors find these dual-standards increasingly  troublesome. When they co-operate with Chinese partners in  export and import, they are to abide by a foreign contact law;  when they establish joint ventures with Chinese firms, they have  to abide by domestic contract law.    This creates much inconvenience for foreigners wishing to  trade and invest in China.    The same is true with the technological contract laws.    The overseas technological contract law applies to domestic  business people that import overseas technologies and their  foreign suppliers, while the domestic technological contract law  concerns deals between domestic business people. Due to the  inconsistency of the two laws, the role of science and  technology in promoting productivity has been limited.    Besides even now China does not have a law stipulating the  export of technologies.    Also the contract laws and regulations in various areas --  such as civil engineering, property insurance, sales of  agricultural and industrial products -- have mainly been drafted  by different departments who follow significantly different  principles. As a result, they can hardly form a coherent system.    In another respect, as the laws tend to deal with  principles,  they are not easy to be implemented. They need to be more  detailed.    The inconsistency and administrative nature of the country's  old contract laws will surely reduce the vitality of enterprises  and hinder the competition between them.    Contracts play a vital role in the market economy. The  allocation of resources, such as commodities services funds  human resources and information, are all realized through  contacts. Contract laws are fundamental to business dealings.    To ensure the role of contracts in resource allocation and  the country's smooth re-entry into Gatt, China must work out a  new set of contract laws.    To draft the new laws, China should follow the principles of  the contract laws of Britain and the United States, the Gatt,  the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of  Goods (1980), the Principle for International Commercial  Contracts and other international codes on foreign trade.    Britain and the United States have accumulated rich  experience in this field. Also as a commercial language,  English and its legal terms have been very popular in the world  business community.    If China refers to the contract laws of the two countries,  its contract laws will be more detailed and much closer to  international standards.    Amended contract laws are likely to be convenient for  overseas business people and reduce business disputes.    China should study the demands of the Gatt and make the new  contract laws comply with the Gatt's basic principles of free  trade, eliminate trade barriers and improve the protection of  intellectual property rights.    China's new set of contract laws can be written into a  statute book composed of general principles and specialized  contract laws.    The general principles should be based upon the general rule  of the civil law, economic contract law and the overseas  economic contract law and the above-mentioned foreign contract  laws.    The specialized laws should also reflect the spirit of the  various foreign laws. For example, the drafting of the new  regulations concerning the contract guarantee should refer to  the Uniform Rules for Contract Guarantees Publication.    If China can adopt the advanced achievements of other  countries in formulating the new set of contract laws and forge  a strict logical link between the general rules and the specific  articles, its competitiveness in the international market could  be strengthened and its legislative level will be greatly  upgraded.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Investors face a credibility gap - Why the energy industry is puzzled by RJB's bid Two weeks after the government announced its preferred candidate to take over British Coal's English mining assets, the coal and electricity sectors remain perplexed. Industry executives are struggling to work out why RJB Mining is prepared to pay so much more than anyone else for the pits and opencast sites and why the government believes its plan is feasible. 'I just cannot understand it,' said one electricity executive. 'We think that RJB is assuming far too much both for the future market and for the prices it can get. Are we missing a trick?' RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank advising it, remain unperturbed, saying they have a high level of confidence that they can raise the funds needed for the bid and for working capital, together thought to total Pounds 1.08bn. However, they are not revealing any details of the Pounds 900m deal, which is due to be concluded on December 24. In the absence of any guidance from them, speculation is rife. One theory among British Coal executives who may soon be RJB employees is that RJB will haggle down the price in the 'due diligence' process in which it is now engaged. 'RJB has the government over a barrel,' says one. 'The government will lose so much face if it declares a deal with RJB is not possible after all.' Other merchant banks are less sure. 'The government would not accept that kind of haggling,' says one banker. 'BZW would lose considerable face with the government.' His argument is that the due diligence exercise could trim tens of millions of pounds from the price, but is unlikely to get it down to the Pounds 600m which was the next highest bid. If the eventual price remains about Pounds 900m, how can the bid be funded and the resulting debt paid off? RJB is thought to want to raise about 40 per cent of the Pounds 1.08bn through issuing shares and the rest, about Pounds 600m, through debt. Most of the failed bidders for the English regions, as well as Scotland and south Wales, have either been told, or have assumed, that any debt incurred through a successful bid would have to be paid off by the end of existing contracts with the electricity generators in 1998. It is thought that BZW's business plan for RJB assumes the debt will be paid off by 1998, although the banking facilities lined up for it do not require this. The Pounds 600m of debt would be likely to attract interest rates of at least 8 per cent. The amount of income left to RJB to pay off the debt and cover the interest bills depends on production costs. In the English regions, coal is currently being produced at an average of about Pounds 1.20 a gigajoule, against an average selling price in the contracts of about Pounds 1.40. That implies a profit of 20p a gigajoule which equates to Pounds 4.80 a tonne. As the English regions have contracts to sell 29m tonnes of coal a year to the generators the difference between the selling price and production cost would be about Pounds 140m a year, or Pounds 455m until April 1998 at current cost levels. There will also be more limited income from selling household coal, where margins are high, as much as 50p per gigajoule, but volumes small, at 2.5m tonnes and falling. British Coal struggles to make money on industrial coal sales of about 5m tonnes in the English region, but RJB could make profits if costs are reduced. It would also hope to make sales to to other UK regions. With only limited scope for sales growth, the key to greater profits is clearly cost reduction in the mines. If RJB can get costs down to Pounds 1 a gigajoule, as rival bidders acknowledge is possible, annual selling price/production margins from electricity contracts would double to Pounds 280m a year. However, reaching Pounds 1 would take time. In addition, producing coal in the private sector also results in financial penalties. Dividends will need to be paid on the Pounds 400m or so that RJB raises in equity and the company will also have to pay for insurance at market rates, something British Coal has been able to avoid. Nor will it enjoy the pensions holiday that British Coal has benefited from in recent years. Making an assessment of the effect of all these factors is difficult prior to RJB announcing its plans, probably next month. RJB is thought to dispute strongly contentions by Mr John Reynolds, an analyst at James Capel - broker to rival bidder Coal Investments - that RJB could still be Pounds 200m in debt by the end of 1998. If, however, Mr Reynolds' predictions were realised, RJB's ability to pay off the debt would depend on the English market after 1998. Most bidders assume that the two main generators will buy 20m-25m tonnes of coal a year from the purchaser of British Coal's three English regions at Pounds 1.10 a gigajoule after 1998. They believe RJB is expecting about 30m tonnes at perhaps Pounds 1.25. A large majority of both generator and coal industry executives believe the lower figures are the more likely. The credibility gap is narrowed considerably by the endorsement of RJB's plans by both BZW and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which has advised the government. In choosing the preferred bidders, the government said it was guided by considerations about preserving the largest economically viable coal industry as well as tender prices. Nonetheless, RJB and BZW have a challenging task ahead to convince lenders and investors that the doubters have got it wrong.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as Chinese issues move higher Buying by overseas and corporate investors supported share prices in the afternoon, and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was up 114.13 at 20,635.83 after a day's low of 20,502.20 and high of 20,638.93. Low-priced steels and chemicals moved ahead on buying by foreigners, while telecommunication-linked stocks and issues related to the 'Aids theme' strengthened on demand from individuals and corporate investors. Volume totalled 227.3m shares, against 266m. Many domestic investors remained inactive ahead of the Obon holidays next week, while others were cautious of stock and bond fluctuations in the US. Analysts expect domestic institutions to remain on the sidelines at current levels of the Nikkei 225. James Capel said that while Japanese institutions believe that the economy may have bottomed out, they still regard the chances of a 'triple dip' as significant. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 7.04 at 1,656.78 and the Nikkei 300 edged up 1.50 to 300.94. Rises led falls by 523 to 439, with 203 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 4.70 firmer at 1,347.15. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y6 to Y369 and NKK gained Y5 at Y284. Chemicals, beneficiaries of a rise in industrial output, were also higher, Showa Denko adding Y5 at Y361 and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Y11 at Y538. Canon, the precision products group, moved up Y30 to Y1,760 on reports that the company will see an 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profits for the current business year. With the International Aids Conference being held in Yokohama until Thursday, Ajinomoto, the food maker, advanced Y60 to Y1,360 on the 'Aids theme'. Drug shares were also higher, Green Cross firming Y30 to Y1,170 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical Y20 to Y1,170. Telecommunication stocks were popular, led by a rise in DDI, the long-distance telecoms operator listed on the second section. The issue rose Y39,000 to a year's high of Y1.03m. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, put on Y110 at Y7,430. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, however, dipped Y3,000 to Y851,000. In Osaka, the OSE average added 66.07 at 22,988.74 in volume of 40m shares. Winners here included export-related stocks, and beneficiaries of rising domestic consumption. Roundup Taipei was closed due to a typhoon, losing an opportunity to respond to events in other Chinese or China-influenced equity markets. SHANGHAI continued to assert itself as Hong Kong's H share index opened, the Shanghai B share index climbing by 6.1 per cent. The index rose 4.55 to 78.95, aided by overseas interest following the spectacular gains last week  -adding up to 108 per cent in five days - in the A share market for local investors. Yesterday, the A share index gained a further 4.1 per cent. Brokers also credited recent economic data for the surge in foreign investor interest in China, citing a drop in companies' accounts receivable and new credits for state enterprises. HONG KONG had a mixed day. The Hang Seng index of blue chip domestic stocks lost 64.34 at 9,537.87 on profit-taking by overseas investors and fears of higher US interest rates; but Chinese companies firmed on interest sparked by the debut of the new H shares index, which ended at 1,323.71, up 26.44 or 2 per cent. Turnover was a preliminary HKDollars 3.21bn, against an adjusted HKDollars 3.93bn on Friday. Overseas institutions were said to be cautious on the interest rate outlook, and most investors to be waiting for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's interim results due next Monday. The novelty value of the new index helped to lift H shares. Speculation that it paved the way for fresh trading opportunities, such as derivatives, also prompted buying interest. SEOUL ended sharply lower after a price plunge in the market's pacesetters Posco and Korea Mobile Telecom triggered a round of selling in late trading. Posco shed Won600 to Won77,900 and KMT Won1,000 to Won378,000. The composite index lost 12.41, or 1.33 per cent, at 919.76. Volume hit a new 1994 low of 16.56m shares. However, Mr W. Lee of Jardine Fleming said: 'The market seems to be approaching a bottom. From the middle of this week, the index will show a gradual recovery.' SYDNEY closed lower, with interest stilled by sharply weaker bonds and the fall on Wall Street on Friday. The All Ordinaries index shed 10.8 to 2,081.1. BHP fell 12 cents to ADollars 19.48, News Corp 4 cents to ADollars 8.91 and CRA 6 cents to ADollars 19. Delta Gold slipped 8 cents to ADollars 2.95 and Highlands Gold declined 5 cents to ADollars 1.46. WELLINGTON finished softer, although above the day's worst levels, which were triggered by Wall Street's decline on Friday. The NZSE-40 capital index dipped 4.64 to 2,106.62 in moderate volume. A reasonable performance by the Australian market helped local sentiment after an earlier fall of almost 20 points. Cart Holt Harvey led the recovery, closing 4 cents up at NZDollars 3.96. SINGAPORE was slightly easier after profit-taking ahead of the National Day holiday today. Analysts expected the market to be influenced by Wall Street, rather than domestic factors, as the Straits Times Industrial index closed 5.47 points off at 2,267.65 in volume of 217.8m shares. Creative Technology dropped SDollars 2.90 to SDollars 28.50 on disappointing fourth-quarter results. KUALA LUMPUR closed 12.81, or 1.2 per cent, down at 1,076.34 in volume of 355m shares, ending a two-week climb in the benchmark index. Analysts suggested that investors booked profits as foreign funds took a breather. MANILA edged forward as second-line issues took the limelight and blue chips consolidated. The composite index added 0.64 at 2,884.03.</p>

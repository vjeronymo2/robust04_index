			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Charges over Hussein plot Ten Moslem fundamentalists in Jordan are to be charged with plotting to assassinate King Hussein at a university ceremony last June, writes James Whittington in Amman. In April, 31 students and staff from Mu'ta University were arrested. All were suspected members of the banned Islamic Liberation party. Twenty-three have been released, but security sources confirm that the remaining eight, along with two other suspects still at large, will be charged with treason, an offence punishable by death.</p>

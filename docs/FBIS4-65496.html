			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Challenge to Broadcasting Ban Fails"] </F>   [Text] A legal challenge to the Government's broadcasting  ban on Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, has been  rejected by the European Commission on Human Rights.    The Commission has declared inadmissible an application to  take the British Government to court in Strasbourg charged with  breaching freedom of expression, which is safeguarded by the  European Convention on Human Rights.    The decision was greeted with dismay by the National Union  of  Journalists [NUJ], which has been backing the challenge mounted  by seven broadcasters and journalists and one member of the  public.    The NUJ said yesterday that it was now considering other  courses of action "to highlight the effect of the ban on the  freedom to receive and impart information which is so  fundamental in a democratic society."    The broadcasting ban means that actors have to be used on  radio and television to give the text of Sinn Fein's speeches.    The Commission, which vets all applications to the European  Court of Human Rights, has followed an earlier decision that the  broadcasting ban is acceptable in the Irish Republic.    But the NUJ has pointed out that the Irish ban was removed  this January by the Dublin government when it did not renew the  relevant part of the Broadcasting Act.    "It was widely accepted that the crude censorship imposed by  the ban could no longer be justified," the union said.    The NUJ statement went on: "The operation of the ban in the  United Kingdom, particularly following the visit of Gerry Adams  to the United States, has highlighted how it is interfering with  the free movement of information within Europe and the rest of  the world."</p>

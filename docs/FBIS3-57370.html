The price rises  in December led to a new rise in the level of inflation which,  according to previous assessments, reached almost 200 percent.    Incomes of the consolidated budget for January-November 1993  were 33.718 trillion karbovantsi, 8.765 trillion karbovantsi in  credits from Ukrainian banks were drawn into the budget to cover  the planned deficit and a number of other expenses. The  mobilization of the budget's incomes took place in difficult  conditions: a considerable number of enterprises, organizations  and institutions and also citizens violated the tax law,  actually underestimating earned income and profits and delayed  making payments to the budget. Expenditure of the consolidated  budget for January-November was 38.673 trillion karbovantsi. Of  this figure, 12.464 trillion (32.2 percent of total expenditure)  were directed at the implementation of measures for the social  protection of the population; 8.944 trillion (23.1 percent) for  the financing of socio-cultural measures, and 8.725 trillion  karbovantsi (22.6 percent) for the national economy. The  financing of expenditures on defence was 1.639 trillion  karbovantsi and 1.096 trillion karbovantsi for maintaining law  enforcement bodies. The consolidated budget of Ukraine was  fulfilled with an excess of expenditure over income of 4.955  trillion karbovantsi.    The emission of money in 1993 was 12.299 trillion  karbovantsi  which is 25 times more than in 1992. In the fourth quarter  alone an additional 7.537 trillion karbovantsi entered into  circulation of which 3.776 trillion karbovantsi took place in  December.    Creditors' debts between Ukrainian enterprises and  organizations and economic subjects of former USSR countries  declined in November by almost 40 percent and was 5.7 trillion  karbovantsi at the beginning of December while debts grew by 15  percent reaching 4.6 trillion karbovantsi. Creditors' debts of  Ukrainian enterprises with Russian trading partners declined by  38 percent (from 8.2 trillion karbovantsi as of 1 November to  5.1 trillion karbovantsi by 1 December) and with Turkmenistan by  96 percent (from 588.1 billion karbovantsi to 24.3 billion  karbovantsi respectively). In total over 11 months of 1993  creditors' debts grew by 17 times and debtors' debts by 10 times.    In 1993 measures were carried out to form a hard currency  market in Ukraine. As a result of this, the volume of currency  sales at the Ukrainian interbank currency exchange rose  continuously throughout January-August. Thus, if $7.3 million  were sold during trading in January, in March the figure was  40.4 million, in June -- 122.3 million, in July -- 142.7  million; trading in German Marks: in April -- 5.1 million, in  June -- 11.5 million, in July -- 12.9 million, in August -- 16.8  million; trading in Russian rubles: in April -- 11.6 billion and  in June -- 74.2 billion.    However, from August to September the volume of sales of  these currencies began to decline at exchanges and in October  only $29.3 million, 3.3 million German marks, and 10 billion  Russian rubles were sold.    During the year there was a sharp drop in the exchange rate  of the Ukrainian karbovanets in relation to foreign currencies.  Thus, if during trading on 5 January 1993 the exchange rate was  798 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar, during trading on 28 October  it was 31,000 karbovantsi. During trading in April the German  mark was being sold at 1,886 karbovantsi but at the end of  October it was 19,300 karbovantsi and the Russian ruble was  3.5-4.3 karbovantsi and 25 karbovantsi respectively.    During 11 months of 1993 (compared with December 1992)  prices  for consumer goods and services increased by 54 times, by 57  times for foodstuffs, and by 70 times for non-food products.    Average monthly salaries for workers in the state sector of  the economy increased by 19 times in the 11 months of 1993 and  in November amounted to 307,200 karbovantsi which is almost 40  times lower than the value of the minimum consumer budget.    At the beginning of 1994, 123,400 citizens who required help  to find work were registered in employment establishments. Of  these 83,900 were granted the status of unemployed.</p>

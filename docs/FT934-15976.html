			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure improves ALLIED LEISURE, the ten pin bowling and night club group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up from a restated Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 2.94m for the year ended July 16 1993. However, the dividend is cut from 4.75p to 3p, with a reduced final of 2p against 3.25p. At the interim stage a profit fall of 25 per cent to Pounds 1.24m was reported. Of the figures, which were adjusted in accordance with FRS 3, turnover was down from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 24.8m, while excluding a figure for wholesaling of Pounds 4.1m last year and Pounds 700,000 this year, underlying turnover increased by 1.9 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 5.22p (5.02p). Mr William Davis, chairman, said that he was confident although trading remained difficult throughout the company. Bowling activities continued to expand but operating profits were down reflecting pressure on discretionary spending. Mr Davis said night clubs performed well and profits rose in a difficult market. Some of the rights issue proceeds have been used to reduce short-term debt with the effect that net borrowing has been halved to 25 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEMATHEQUE CELEBRATES ART OF MUSIC VIDEO  </P> <P> And here you thought music video was just glamour boys with poufy hair preening  behind blemish-obscuring smoke -- money for nothing, as it were.  </P> <P> But this relatively recent genre represents something else entirely to the  American Cinematheque, which, in conjunction with the Long Beach Museum of Art,  has scheduled this weekend a mini-festival whose brave assertion -- as stated  in its printed program -- is nothing less than that "music video is the art  form of the '80s."  </P> <P> To prove it, more than 100 titles grouped into seven programs will run at the  Directors Guild, 7920 Sunset Blvd., beginning at 6 tonight with the premiere of  a documentary on Soviet rock and continuing all day Sunday. The focus is  largely on how the form has unexpectedly brought true experimental film making  to the masses.  </P> <P> "Robert Longo's Megadeth video, 'Peace Sells (But Who's Buying?),' has almost  1,000 edits in it," said an admiring Michael Nash, media arts curator of the  Long Beach museum, who put together the exhibition for his museum in August and  has had it on the road ever since.  </P> <P> "It was unimaginable before the inception of MTV that you could make  programming that would appear on a commercial venue that would move that fast.  . . .," he added. "But people are learning to be able to move faster and faster  and are willing to fill in the blanks a lot more."  </P> <P> Nash's presentation encompasses both the ambitious origins and -- he hopes --  expansive future of music video. "Audio Auteurs" (showing tonight at 7)  showcases such early work as Devo's 1977 "In the Beginning Was the End," an  11-minute video that has the crude power of a snuff film crossed with a bizarre  industrial education trailer.  </P> <P> Nash's hope for the future can be seen in "Vanguard Re-Visions" (Sunday, 8:45  p.m.), featuring experimental forays into video art, and "Unseen Music"  (Sunday, 6:15 p.m.), which showcases videos from independent record labels.  </P> <P> Also of interest: "Ad Art" (tonight, 9:30), which includes amusingly  self-reflexive clips by the Replacements, Tom Waits and Les Rita Mitsouko;  "Extended Plays" (Sunday, 4:30 p.m.), "video albums" by The The and R.E.M., and  "Digital Harmony" (Sunday, 2:30 p.m.), a work for computer by composer John  Whitney Sr.  </P> <P> Receiving its U.S. premiere tonight at 6 (its first of six showings) is Ken  Thurlbeck's "USSR&amp;R: Rock on a Red Horse," a fitfully intriguing  documentary about the underground Soviet rock scene.  </P> <P> General admission prices are $5; $3 for Cinematheque members. Information:  (213) 461-9737.  </P></p>

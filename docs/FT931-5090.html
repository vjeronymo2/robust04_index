			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / A brief to build bridges: Hans van den Broek, the new EC commissioner for external political relations, talks to Lionel Barber and David Gardner Mr Hans van den Broek is a man trying to carve out a new role, both for himself and the European Community. After 10 years as Dutch foreign minister, he has come to Brussels to stake out what he sees as a growing role for the European Commission in framing a common foreign and security policy for Europe. His ambition is tempered by realism. The backdrop to his new job as the European commissioner responsible for external political relations could hardly be more unfavourable. Europe is stuck in the worst recession since the second world war, feeding into a crisis of confidence caused by the delay of Denmark and the UK in ratifying the Maastricht treaty, the foundation text for the new EC foreign policy. As if this were not enough, Mr Van den Broek is fighting for elbow room inside the Commission which has chosen to divide the foreign affairs portfolio between himself and Sir Leon Brittan. Sir Leon takes charge of trade, relations with industrialised countries and aid to eastern Europe. Since trade has until now been the substantive foreign business of the EC, the Brittan camp has been crowing about where the real power lies. 'Van den Broek will do the hand-shaking; Leon will do the horse-trading,' smirked one of Sir Leon's allies. Sitting in front of two Dutch masters in his office last Friday, Mr Van den Broek, a patient man with a faintly clerical air, appeared relaxed about a job he insisted he had sought. True, he was still struggling with Sir Leon over the division of power and staff within the bureaucracy, which he described as a 'constructive uphill fight'. But he remained confident that he would secure 'certain minimum tools' to do his job. Mr Van den Broek is clear there is a job to be done. After the collapse of communism in the east and amid doubts about the long-term military commitment of the US to Europe, the EC - until now a purely civil power - is moving hesitantly to fill the vacuum. 'Maastricht is about coming to grips with our international political role,' he says. This means, in his view, enlarging the EC to bring in new members, starting with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway; involving eastern Europe immediately in consultations on the political future of the Continent; standing behind the Russian reform effort; and fashioning credible solutions to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, which Mr Van den Broek is convinced must involve the US and Russia. Until Maastricht is ratified, negotiations on enlargement form the backbone of Mr Van den Broek's job. Talks began last month with the Austrians, Swedes and Finns, with a view to accession in 1995. The Dutchman warned at the time that these negotiations would not be a walk-over. Public opinion in the Nordic countries remains suspicious of European integration, though this may change if the Danes approve Maastricht in a second referendum in May. It remains EC policy that the newcomers cannot expect Denmark's special treaty opt-outs. 'We do feel we have to be strict on the conditions.' But he stresses: 'It is our ultimate conviction - though it is a choice to be made by the applicants - that membership is in our interest and theirs.' On eastern Europe, Mr Van den Broek is insistent that 'we need to make clear that they belong to the fact of European construction'. By this, the commissioner means that ways must be found to bind the former communist satellites into western Europe, until such time as their economies can withstand the rigours of full EC membership. The idea is to expand trade, technology and market access to the east Europeans under the so-called EC association agreements. A second, still inchoate proposal is to hold joint political councils with a view to deciding matters of common interest. The process of building bridges to the east is running at several speeds. Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics are in the vanguard, followed by Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. Eventually, Mr Van den Broek can foresee the Baltic republics coming aboard. The commissioner believes that closer ties of this nature could act as a catalyst to closer economic integration between eastern and western Europe. But he is honest enough to admit that the EC has not been sufficiently generous with market access. 'I sense a growing sentiment among member states that we have to make a greater effort.' On Russia, Mr Van den Broek is much less categorical. The economy is struggling, yet amid the chaos there are still untapped western credit lines: 'I am not convinced that financial transfers are the main problem.' Instead, he calls for the whole international community to show unequivocal 'solidarity' with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. On March 26-27, Mr Van den Broek and a troika of EC foreign ministers will be in Moscow hoping to hear from Mr Yeltsin 'what other means may be needed' to underpin economic and political reform. As a long-time Atlanticist - 'Euro-Atlanticist', he corrects - the Dutchman is convinced of the need for a full US role. 'The US remains, also for (us in) Europe, the natural counterpart of Russia.' It is not, therefore, surprising to learn that Mr Van den Broek has been quietly urging EC support for President Clinton's Bosnian air-drop initiative. This is part of a broader view that the US - and most likely Russia - must be involved in enforcing a political settlement in former Yugoslavia, if and when it comes. The problem in the past was that 'the parties were led to believe that undertakings reached at the negotiating table would never be enforced'. Mr Van den Broek presided over the purely European effort to broker peace in Yugoslavia when he chaired the EC's Council of Ministers in the second half of 1991. While loath to undervalue the EC's role as by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid, he acknowledges that 'the Community has often given the impression of division', notably when Germany pressured the 12 into premature recognition of Croatia in January 1992. He draws the comparison with the EC's swift and united response to the August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow. Here the Community had an old enemy in its sights, and reacted almost reflexively. Post-cold war, however, the Community was forced to deal with a resurgence of ethnic rivalries and nationalism in the east which in the west had largely been consigned to the past. The result was that France recalled its historic links with Serbia and Germany its ties with Croatia. The Franco-German axis which carries the EC forward did not work. At the time, as the commissioner acknowledges, he was bitterly at odds with Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then Germany's foreign minister. Mr Van den Broek now wonders whether 'my colleague Mr Genscher would be as angry with me about my position (on recognition of Croatia) as he was then'. The lesson he believes the EC should draw applies not only to Yugoslavia, but also to its post-cold war relationship with the fragmenting east of the Continent as a whole. 'I do not dispute the right of self-determination for one moment. But are we also prepared to defend that recognition in the event of an appalling state of violence - the extent of which we could barely imagine?'</p>

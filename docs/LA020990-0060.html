			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES  </P> <P> Q: I will be getting married in March at a simple ceremony with only close  friends and immediate family in attendance. As this will be a second wedding  for me, I was thinking of wearing a suit.  </P> <P> What do you recommend for someone 36, 5'6", Size 10? -- S.E.  </P> <P> A: How about a lace jacket with a chiffon skirt, as illustrated here? This  romantic suit is by Susan Lane, bridal gown designer and owner of Country  Elegance, who suggests that you buy the jacket in ivory lace over rose-beige  satin and the skirt in blush pink, a shade lighter than rose-beige. Lane says  that blush pink is the No. 1 color for all wedding gowns sold at her shop,  replacing white and antique ivory. She believes it's especially appropriate for  what she calls encore brides. This suit, priced at $450, comes in Sizes 6-16 at  Country Elegance, 7375 Greenbush Ave., North Hollywood, Calif. 91605.  </P></p>

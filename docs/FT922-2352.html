			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Conflict between roles and masters led to confusion trade union leaders, civil servants, businessmen and politicians - met regularly amid great secrecy to plot the nation's economic future. They drew up secret national economic plans that paved the way for the voluntary incomes policy that the Heath government introduced in late 1972. They met at the offices of the National Economic Development Office. A former senior Nedo economist who sat in on the sessions recalls: 'We tried to agree on the rate of profit which would be required to finance the investment needed to increase productivity by enough to finance the unions' real wage claims.' It was the closest Nedo got to combining its many roles into real power. It was also indicative of one of the weaknesses that has dogged Nedo from its birth in early 1962 to yesterday's announcement that it is to be disbanded: the confusion between its different roles and masters. Nedo was created by Mr Harold Macmillan's Tory government in 1962 as an attempt to mimic the apparent success of indicative planning in the post-war rebuilding of French industry. The unemployment of the 1930s had persuaded him that co-operation between government, industry and unions was essential for economic growth. Nedo was intended to create that co-operation. Harold Wilson's Department of Economic Affairs, which was responsible for economic planning and was intended as a counterweight to the Treasury, was substantially staffed by Nedo officials. After Labour's brief but unsuccessful experiment with planning in the mid 1960s, Nedo became a feeble instrument of incomes policy and industrial strategy in the 1970s. In the 1980s it withered under the ideological onslaught of the Thatcher government's attack on the corporate state. Nedo's performance has to be assessed against its various roles. Planning: Nedo was established when French planning was already becoming less effective and it lacked many of the tools that French experience suggested were needed for planning. Nedo was discredited by the failure of Labour's national economic plan in the mid 1960s. Economic policy: After the voluntary incomes policy of 1972, Nedo was a largely ineffective forum for agreeing and policing incomes policy deals. In the 1980s, the unions lost much of their power, companies decentralised bargaining and the growth of the service sector made national industrial bargaining less relevant. Industrial strategy: The Labour industrial strategy between 1976 and 1979 gave Nedo new life, exploring the supply side of the economy and British industrial competitiveness. Former Nedo officials say much of the work was overblown special pleading by sectional interests. But many of the so-called 'little Neddies', which will be retained under the DTI's umbrella, did useful work on grassroots issues of competitiveness. Information: Nedo's most consistently useful role has been as an independent assessor of the health of the British economy. Its highly influential report on value added tax in 1965 was followed by extensive and critical reports on the nationalised industries in the 1970s and the parlous state of training in the 1980s. On balance, Nedo was not a success across its 30-year life. It did not succeed in its original aim of being the mechanism for public policy to improve industrial competitiveness. It was better at small things - economic reports and sectoral initiatives - than big things - planning and promoting social co-operation. Its weaknesses were a reflection of the institutions that were its parents. The leadership of the TUC and the CBI could not persuade their members to abide by agreements made at Nedo. Most important, the central state was unwilling to devolve any of its power over economic policy to an independent body. Nedo was always overshadowed by the Treasury. It was never a fully accepted part of the machinery of the state nor fully outside it. It was deprived of influence over policy making on the inside but never had the political independence it needed to produce radical ideas. A former Nedo chief economist recalls his work: 'We spent a lot of time inspecting a huge setting sun. We were dealing with an industrial decline which was so deep-seated that we could do very little to arrest it. We produced a lot of useful diagnoses of the problems, but we were not able to do anything about them. We had no agenda to change British society.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial plenum of the Communist Party of Cuba  in Matanzas analyzed, as a special point on the agenda, the  current situation in the province regarding implementation of  the measures recently approved by the Council of State as well  as Decree-Law 186, which regulates self-employment violations.  Osvaldo Umpierrez, president of the Administration Council in  the province, advised that there are currently 10,227 people  self-employed, mostly as hairdressers, manicurists, and  transport cart drivers.    Since February when Decree-Law 186 was approved, a  contingent  of 231 tax inspectors have imposed over 400 fines, of which more  than half are against violators from other provinces. Also under  review is the situation of over 500 automobiles that are not in  the possession of their owners, 52 of which have been  confiscated. Additionally, 1,300 motorcycles have been  inventoried. Currently, in the province, 47 cases of money  hoarding are being worked on, six of which are now being  analyzed by the commission created for this purpose.</p>

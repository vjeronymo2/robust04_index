			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAELI PARTY DELAYS VOTE TO LEAVE COALITION  </P> <P> Ministers of the center-left Labor Party today postponed a special meeting in  which they were to have considered pulling out of the government.  </P> <P> The party acted after 12 people were killed when a Palestinian grabbed the  steering wheel of a bus and caused it to plunge into a ravine.  </P> <P> Three left-wing parties filed no-confidence motions against the government in  Parliament.  </P> <P> Avi Gil, a spokesman for Labor leader and Finance Minister Shimon Peres, said  the party's 100-member bureau will convene Monday to decide what course of  action to take.  </P> <P> Shamir explicitly ruled out a chief condition of Palestinians, the  participation of 140,000 Arabs in East Jerusalem in the elections. He also  rejected establishment of a Palestinian state and said the balloting could not  be held until the Palestinian uprising ended.  </P> <P> In Tunis, Tunisia, Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman Ahmed  Abdul-Rahman today said Shamir's hard-line conditions have closed the door to  peace, and he vowed that the uprising of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip would be "escalated because this is the only answer to  intransigence."  </P></p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (7): Accounting for change is only the start - Andrew Jack notes that new regulations reflect more rigorous attidudes ACCOUNTANTS will be in the ascendancy over the next few months in many British charities, as a result of tough new legislation and a more vigorous attitude from regulators. Detailed regulations in the wake of the 1992 Charities Act, new voluntary accounting rules for charities on which they may in part be based, and the sharpening claws of the Charity Commission, will all soon make their presence felt. The 1992 Charities Act is the most fundamental. It has brought about even more sweeping change than the most significant previous Charities Act, in 1960. By next summer, the Home Office is expected to release a series of detailed regulations; these are expected to apply from September 1 next year. At present there is still some uncertainty over their content. But the principal ones, concerning financial reporting, accounting and auditing, are: Accounting records: Proper accounting records must be kept for up to six years. These must show day-to-day entries of all money spent and received; a record of assets and liabilities; and other information sufficient to explain all the charity's transactions, to show its financial position accurately and enable trustees to ensure that it complies with regulations. Annual accounts: There will be detailed guidelines on the form and content, methods and principles, supplementary information in notes to the accounts, determination of accounting periods and income thresholds. Annual audit and examination: Accounts of charities with gross income or expenditure above Pounds 100,000 in the current or previous two years will require an annual audit from a charity auditor; those below this threshold but above Pounds 1,000 have the alternative option of an annual audit from an independent person believed by the trustees to have suitable ability and practical experience. Annual report: Within 10 months of the financial year-end, charities will have to file with the Charity Commissioners, giving a report on the year's activities and information on the charity and its trustees and officers. The file must include the audit report on the accounts. Access to accounts: The charity trustees must provide anyone who asks with a copy of the latest audited accounts within two months of the request, on payment of a reasonable copying fee. These requirements are in addition to existing obligations for charities which are incorporated and already comply with the requirements of the Companies Act. They do not all apply to certain 'excepted' charities subject to other supervisory requirements; neither do they apply to 'exempt' charities, (such as those with income of up to Pounds 1,000, no permanent endowment and no use or occupation of land). There is general agreement that the quality of financial reporting among charities has improved considerably. Many larger ones already comply with the new requirements of the Act, including the employment of an external auditor. The quality of financial reporting in smaller charities is far more variable. The judges in last month's charity annual report and accounts award warned that many submissions still made elementary mistakes, such as not including the accounts with the annual report, or failing to sign and date the balance sheet. With the introduction of the new regulations, charities face a double pincer. The government's willingness to tackle charities with important legislation has been mirrored by its decision to grant more money to the Charity Commission. That has allowed the regulatory body to begin computerising charity accounts, and may have helped it towards an active role in financial reporting and enforcing greater accountability from charities. For example, the commission has pledged that 80 per cent of its list of principal charities will have lodged their accounts by 1994. In 1989, only 11 per cent of the principal charities registered with the commission lodged accounts. By last year it had risen considerably - but it was still only 46 per cent of the registered 135,000. The commission has also taken a more significant role in new guidelines on financial reporting. SORP 2, the statement of recommended practice first issued in 1988, is being up-dated. But while the original was driven by the Accounting Standards Committee, the commission is taking the lead with the new version. SORP 2 remains voluntary. But it is important, because many larger charities feel obliged to comply with its guidelines, and because it may form the basis of the detailed Home Office regulations on the contents of annual reports and accounts next year. Pressure from outsiders has called for amendments which would provide greater information on, say, charities' sources of income; expenditure by areas of activity; details of costs; valuation of assets; and consolidation of subsidiaries. Many charities have traditionally shown reluctance to provide a good deal of financial information which may easily be misinterpreted. But with wider realisation of the privileges they receive and the significance of their assets, they are now being called much more vigorously to account.</p>

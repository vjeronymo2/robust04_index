			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: A German example on competition Sir, Mr Jacques Calvet's personal view (April 30), as well as your report on EC Commission proposals to subsidise training programmes in the automobile industry ('Shake-up urged in EC car and aircraft sectors', April 30), are hardly believable against the background of German experience. Am I really being ideological or a 'competition fundamentalist' if I point out that the German automobile industry has performed pretty well without subsidies and without protection against Japanese competitors? And is it on the basis of their experience and expertise that Mr Bangemann and his staff conclude that the cause of the European industry's inefficiency is simply lack of training? Or is it, rather, that political activism and populism makes them want to spend taxpayers' money? Can they really be sure that the deficiencies of industry and of specific companies do not have their roots elsewhere, and that subsidies will not be a waste of our money? Or will they concentrate subsidies on those companies which, so far, have performed best and can be expected, therefore, to make a good use of our money? Competition forces companies to rely on themselves. It is the only guarantee against the states or the EC wasting money on an industrial policy they are not qualified to handle. We must be aware that the evidence collected by governments and as well as the Commission in support of such policies regularly comes from those who have had no success and want to extricate themselves from inefficiency at the expense of others.

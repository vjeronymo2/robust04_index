			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Gilts gave best returns - Bonds / But political doubts have now unsettled the UK market DESPITE THREE months of political and economic uncertainty, the UK government bond market turned in a creditable performance in the first quarter, although analysts warn that the gains may not be repeated. In fact, the gilt-edged market gave investors better returns than any other major government bond market during the first quarter, measured in local currency terms. According to JP Morgan's Government Bond Index Monitor, the gilt-edged market gave investors a total return of 6.65 per cent over the period. This strong performance is not surprising, seen against a background of sharply falling interest rates. The base lending rate stood at 14 per cent at the turn of the year. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, currently faces calls for rates to be cut by a full 1 per cent to 11.5 per cent. However, the rise in gilts prices over the quarter was largely concentrated in the first few weeks of the year. For example, the benchmark 10 per cent gilt maturing in 2001 stood at a yield of 10.21 per cent in the first week of January. The price rose steadily during January, such that the yield had fallen to 10.24 per cent by February 15. Since then, however, there has been less pattern to the market, with the yield bouncing back to touch 10.64 per cent by mid-March. There are two main explanations for the uncertain tone to the market in recent weeks: Political uncertainty, with the government seen to be split over the issue of local government finance and in danger of losing an election later this year. Although the Labour party has won many friends in the City, in general the gilts market takes the view 'better the devil you know'. Supply pressures, with the market depressed by the prospect of heavy issuance of new government bonds. Mr Lamont predicted a government borrowing requirement of Pounds 8bn this year, but many in the market expect the eventual outcome to be higher. The effect of new issues on the market was seen on April 5, when the Bank of England announced the issue Pounds 800m 9 per cent Treasury bonds, maturing 2008. The outstanding bonds fell by nearly a point. In the face of these uncertainties, investors happy to accept currency risk have looked for value in overseas markets. Many have made currency exposure work for them. For example, the performance of the dollar on the foreign exchange markets during March led to heavy gains for holders of dollar-denominated bonds. Once the currency gains are taken into account, US government bonds gave sterling-based investors a hefty return of 12.27 per cent over the quarter, according to figures from Kemper Investment Management. This performance was only bettered by Canadian, New Zealand and Australian government bond markets - each of which gave sterling-based investors a total return of around 16 per cent over the first quarter. However, the foreign-exchange markets have recently shown once again that they can be volatile. This poses a hazard for even the most sophisticated investors. For example, the dollar fell to an all-time low of DM1.45 on February 11. Fearing a collapse, many central banks intervened to support it. Just six weeks later, the central bankers were forced to intervene in the opposite direction, trying to cap the dollar's meteoric rise. By the end of March, the dollar stood at DM1.70. The movement against sterling was less severe, but the warning is clear. A less risky method of diversification might be to invest in some of the European government bond markets. After all, sterling can only fluctuate by 6 per cent from its central DM2.95 exchange rate against the Deutsche Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism. But this is still enough to alter return on investment profoundly. Thus the rise of sterling, from being the weakest currency in the ERM to the second strongest (after the Spanish peseta) during March, depressed the returns available to UK investors from top-performing European bond markets. For example, French investors saw a total return of 6.45 per cent from their own government bond market during the first quarter. The weakness of the French franc, however, meant that UK investors saw a return of just under 4 per cent, measured in sterling terms.</p>

But  then again, the marasmus is gaining strength. Judging by  everything, they have even managed to make a fool of the  president himself, the supreme commander-in-chief. In his  message to the Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin gave quite high  marks to the course of Armed Forces reform which cheered up the  highest Russian generals. One of the key ideologues of military  reform, Assistant Minister of Defense for Military Policy  Lieutenant-General Gennadiy Ivanov, officially stated at a press  conference that Yeltsin's very positive response on the course  of military reform attests to the "correctness of the path  selected by us". But then it has not been excluded that the  positive presidential response on reform was also prepared in  the bowels of the Ministry of Defense, and that General Ivanov  himself had far from the last participation in it.    Let's pose the question this way: Does Yeltsin know  about the state of military reform? As a General Staff officer  who worked quite a bit in its structures, as an official who is  often in the troops and who is well acquainted practically with  all of the information that affects the assessments of the state  of combat readiness of the Army, I dare to assure you with all  responsibility that the supreme commander-in-chief knows exactly  as much about the state of affairs in the Armed Forces as the  minister of defense and his closest entourage want him to.    General Pavel Grachev at one time admitted that he contacts  Yeltsin on a daily basis at a strictly determined time and  reports the most recent and the most important things which  occurred in the Army. (Let it be on the minister of defense's  conscience that he doesn't always manage to do that -- it has  happened that he has been unable to reach the president for  three-four days).    And now imagine that Grachev day after day reports the same  thing to Yeltsin: combat training of ground troops and naval  forces is being disrupted everywhere. The moral-psychological  state of personnel is declining. Theft of arms and ammunition is  not ceasing. Money is not being issued to personnel in a timely  manner, and because of that strikes are already beginning in  units. Nearly 60 percent of the combat pilots have long ago  forgotten what it is to fly systematically. Plans to introduce  housing for homeless servicemen are not being carried out. New  combat equipment is practically not entering the troops and the  fleets. Scientific and experimental design work has been reduced  to 10-15 percent. And so on and so forth.    We would all need to be too naive, and the minister of  defense too bold for us to be able to believe that. Grachev  understands very well: if he day in and day out honestly  confessed all of this to the president, the quick-tempered Boris  Nikolayevich would take it up one day and would not mince words:  if everything is falling apart in the Army, why does it need you  in the role of minister? Only both of them know precisely how  and in what form Pavel  Sergeyevich reports to Boris Nikolayevich. But we already know  for certain what the supreme commander-in-chief's opinion is on  the state of combat readiness of his Army. In that same (already  half-forgotten) message to the Federal Assembly, he suddenly  arrived at the conclusion that the combat readiness of the Armed  Forces is at a level that permits it to reliably ensure Russia's  military security. It's easy to guess who led the president to a  conclusion that is so dreadful in its unfairness. There's no  doubt that it was first and foremost he who is directly  responsible for the Army's combat readiness. On this score, I  will say in passing that it would be good to have an article on  false reporting of progress on an especially large scale (from  10 to 15) in our Criminal Code. In order to realistically judge  the true state of combat readiness of the Army and Navy, it  would be sufficient for the clerks from the presidential staff  to request restricted analytical documents and report back  materials from the Main Military Inspectorate in which they  would discover, to their great horror, a conclusion that only  1-2 divisions in each military district and only 1-2 ships in  each fleet are combat ready today! And that is the main and most  honest conclusion on the primary result of military reform. And  based upon it, now judge the "correctness of the path selected  by us" which both the minister of defense and his court  theoretician of military structural development so stubbornly  attempt to convince their fellow countrymen.    The combat readiness of the Army is a state category. And he  who thoroughly deceives his own people with regard to its actual  state is certainly committing a state crime. But who today could  place an objective report on the actual state of the Armed  Forces and on the results of reform on the desks of the  president, the chairman of the Council of Ministers, and the  chairmen of both houses of parliament? I can boldly dare to  assure you -- no one. And this is why.    Approximately two-three years ago "democratically minded"  political figures and people's deputies aggressively spread the  conclusion that the so-called Ministry of Defense Main  Inspectorate was incapable of objectively assessing the level of  combat readiness of ground troops and naval forces because it is  organizationally part of the military department, and is  directly subordinate to the minister of defense who, naturally,  is to a considerable extent an interested party. And that was  the absolute truth. I personally have repeatedly had the  opportunity to participate in the work of teams of main  inspectors in military districts and groups of forces, and to  write report back and analytical documents. The results of the  inspection depended to a very large extent, for example, on how  we were received in the military district or group of forces,  how the personal relations of the minister of defense and the  commanding general or main inspector had developed, and what  quantity of boxes, with all kinds of gifts from those being  inspected, the inspectors transported back to Moscow.    There are many "interesting" episodes in my memory. For  example, at the beginning of the 1980's, a team of Ministry of  Defense inspectors traveled to Germany with the undisguised  mission of replacing Group of Soviet Forces in Germany  Commander-in-Chief General of the Army Ivanovskiy. Few people  knew at that time that on the eve of our trip Yevgeniy  Filippovich had "poorly received" the marshal-inspector, his  wife, and children for rest. Therefore, the inspection was  excessively strict, and the result of it was that Ivanovskiy and  Group Political Directorate Chief General Ivan Mednikov were  removed at practically the same moment. It is an altogether  different matter when the commanding general prepares  beforehand, say, a collection of precious stones. In the Far  East they sent entire teams of explosives experts into the  mountains to extract them. After summing up the results of the  inspection, each inspector received large amounts of red caviar  and smoked fish.    Once they surreptitiously handed the chairman of an  inspection team an enormous unique coral for which the fleet's  best scuba divers dove into the depths of the sea. As was  customary, they carried an identical gift to Moscow for the  minister of defense (an inspection gift for the minister was  considered to be an unwritten law for many, many years). Of  course, all of the primary combat readiness assessments of the  inspected formations and units had to depend on the quantity and  quality of the gifts, the generosity of the tables that were set  three times a day, the content of the so-called cultural program  (fishing, hunting, swimming in unique sources, baths, saunas,  and visiting the families of the commanders being inspected  where "by chance" there frequently turned out to be single women  and also married garrison women, and, after a certain amount of  contact with them, an inspector did not really want to write in  the inspection report that not one of the company's tanks had  hit the target...).    An off-color Army anecdote even existed on this score.  A not completely sober inspector says to the regimental  commander in the morning:    The battalion is satisfactory but the company is  unsatisfactory!    The regimental commander quickly determined what was  wrong with the inspector and poured into a glass:    And now the battalion is satisfactory and the company  is outstanding!    And when active conversations occurred that General of the  Army Konstantin Kobets as the main military inspector would  allegedly be directly subordinate to the president, it became  clear that now the Ministry of Defense anticipates difficult  times. But the music played for a short time. "Having hung  around" for a period of time in an undetermined state, Kobets  with the entire inspectorate was returned to the native bosom of  the Ministry of Defense, and is directly subordinate to Grachev.  Moreover, Yeltsin also assigned Kobets as deputy minister of  defense.    Well, judge for yourselves. Say Kobets traveled to inspect a  military district. He brought back a grade of two from there.  Naturally, Grachev is unhappy. How do you report that to the  president? Naturally, they talked. Naturally, they agreed on the  fact that "individual shortcomings" exist. And that is already  easier -- where aren't there individual shortcomings now?  Therefore, should we report them that way? Order. Let's also  assure you that "we are at the guaranteed level". And if it  isn't guaranteed, Boris Nikolayevich will remove them.    Matters are being reduced to extraordinarily strange things.  Today, it is being announced that the Northern Fleet is the best  in the Russian Navy, but tomorrow practically all of the mass  media report that the wives of military seamen have gone on  strike and have blocked the runways: their husbands are not  being paid on time, they are not being provided with apartments,  the apartment buildings are cold, and there is nothing to buy in  the stores. And the combatant commanders themselves say that  recognition of the fleet as the best in the Navy -- is blasphemy.    You only reflect: it was named the best, and, therefore, the  most combat ready, not the vegetable store, but the entire  fleet, the Russian strategic combat unit. And you would read  what the reports from the fleet say about the state of combat  ships and coastal facilities, about reserves and the  availability of fuel-lubricants and other materials. It's no  accident that one submarine commander bitterly joked: "It will  soon reach the point if just one ship from our fleet leaves the  quay -- they will then recognize the fleet as the best...".    In the Ministry of Defense Main Military Inspectorate they  know very well precisely what criteria are being utilized to  determine the combat readiness of a military district or fleet.  Minister of defense and chief of the general staff special  orders or directives have long existed on this score. Naturally  not only the main inspectorate, but also the commander-in-chief  directorates of the services of the Armed Forces must be  strictly guided by these criteria. But what actually happens? I  visited the Pacific Fleet last year on an inspection trip with  the deputy commander-in-chief. And, suddenly, soon after that we  read in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA that the fleet's combat readiness will  largely be assessed based upon the results of the live firing...  of just one ship which the admiral visited. Well that's a fine  how-do-you-do! For such a "criterion" to be more understandable  for a civilian reader, I will say that this is practically the  same as arriving at a conclusion about the normal state of both  arms and legs based upon one finger.    But that shouldn't happen. Whom are we deceiving? Ourselves.  One general even contrived to use a word like "nedoboyegotovka"  [not quite combat ready] while talking about the criteria of the  state of combat readiness of a division in the troops  subordinate to him. This is something like "nedoberemenna" [not  quite pregnant] or "nedoubita" [not quite killed]. Today, as  never before, an epidemic of gigantic false reporting of  progress and lies has swept over the Army. The generals inspect  themselves, they assign grades to themselves, they themselves  develop the criteria of the state of the troops and fleets, and  they themselves ignore them, if they see that the state of  affairs does not reach even a primitive "three".    General Konstantin Kobets' main military inspectorate has  actually been transformed into a well trained and devoted dog of  the minister of defense. It can vigilantly protect his peace or  subordinates who are sympathetic to him can "bite" those being  fined. Recently PVO [Air Defense] Commander-in-Chief,  Colonel-General Viktor Prudnikov "had the gall" to notify the  former Supreme Soviet that the air border defense system is  dying due to the Ministry of Defense's inaction and its  conciliatory position. The matter at times reached the point  where foreign and Russian aircraft that were flying, say, from a  Westerly direction had already nearly penetrated to the skies  near Moscow. And what about the minister? Not only did he  severely criticize the PVO commander-in-chief, he also appointed  an investigation. It's clear -- that it was appointed to remove  the garbage from the "Arbat Hut". Rumors are already circulating  that Prudnikov will soon leave his post and will move to  another, less visible post. And, of course, "according to his  own desires".    And in the background of this state of affairs in the Army,  General Grachev and his team are furiously whispering into the  president's ear that reforms in the Army are proceeding at full  speed. And with each passing month this lie is being  increasingly and more obviously transformed into a means of  survival of the generals in their high posts. Of course, these  are not the generals who courageously placed the barrel of their  pistols to their temples when it became obvious that their  troops are not combat ready or when they learned that they had  been totally misled in the assessments of the state of affairs.  In my opinion, they themselves are sooner ready to give the  pistol to settle scores with the lives of those who suddenly  detect that a gigantic deception is being created and whose  conscience is beginning to torment them.    Let's pose a simple and clear question: what are the  specific  results of military reform after its first stage? The father of  military reform, General  Ivanov, and the minister of defense always begin by saying:  first of all the Ministry of Defense was created. Maybe they  built a new building? Did they lay thousands of lines of  communication? Did they select new staffs? Did they purchase  furniture or electronic equipment? Of course not! They obtained  all of this -- durable capital -- in enormous quantities from  the old Soviet Ministry of Defense. So, where is the matter  right now, just where is reform? And it turns out that reform is  limited to replacing blank forms, stamps, and name plates from  offices, redrawing the diagram of the organization of the  military department, altering the names of certain directorates  and departments, and rewriting functional duties. Perhaps that's  all. But then again, how loudly it sounds -- "the Ministry of  Defense was created".    And later the most ordinary chaos began which both General  Grachev himself and his closest subordinate today call reform.  They all have repeatedly asserted that the Army will be reduced,  and, therefore, the Ministry of Defense itself will be reduced.  And at the same time the number of Grachev's assistants has  increased to seven, and the authorized strength of the military  department has increased by approximately a factor of 1.5. The  number of generals on the ministry's floors has also increased.  It has reached the point where general's ranks have even been  awarded to those who were in colonel's positions. General's  shoulder boards have even been donned on a man who is  responsible for the electric light bulbs and carpeting, the  decanters and toilet paper.    Sometimes you get the impression that Grachev and his  assistants are playing at reform of the Ministry of Defense  staff. And how can you say otherwise if the names and functional  duties of many directorates and departments have been changed  from three to five times, their chiefs have been replaced, and  the transfers of enormous masses of people from offices to  offices have been carried out over the course of one and a half  years. The missions of some structures have been transferred to  others, then the missions have been returned, again "taken  away", and later it suddenly turned out that two and sometimes  three directorates or departments were involved with one and the  same issues. And so on --without end. That leapfrogging has laid  additional financial burdens on the military department, and,  based upon the simplest calculations, has cost the taxpayers  many millions of rubles. And, judging by everything, a new  spiral of organizational-staff leapfrogging awaits the ministry  already in the near future.    The Ministry of Defense leadership, while attempting to pass  off the desired as the actual, quite often resorts to primitive  ruses that are calculated for simpletons. For example, the  reduction of the Army is being passed off as one of the key  directions of reform. Grachev and company also often place this  process in the same rank with the so-called "results" of  military reform. But why make fools of the people? The reduction  of the Army is a process that goes without saying. Hundreds of  thousands of officers and warrant officers are leaving the Army  based upon years served, according to their own desires, or due  to illness. And many, putting it mildly, "are leaving". So where  is reform here? Here for some reason I'm reminded of the episode  of a story where a bureaucrat, who didn't have anything to  report back to the leadership on the work completed, wrote in  the report: "Organized the onset of evening".    Take any strategic direction of military reform and you will  see that the state of affairs there is extremely insignificant.  Yes, for instance, the lack of budget resources for manning of  the troops with contract personnel which both the minister, his  deputies and his assistants love to boast about. From the very  beginning, it was clear that the introduction of contract  service in the current situation of financial starvation was the  purest folly. Initially, R6 billion (prices at the end of 1992)  was allocated for 100,000 contract personnel. Already a year and  a half later it has become clear that inflation is literally  gobbling up this sum before our very eyes. It has been barely  enough to pay the salaries of contract personnel. And it was  contemplated that they would be provided separate housing or a  dormitory with all of the comforts, that their work day would be  standardized, and that they would have quite a few advantageous  social benefits. It has turned out that all of this is once  again a lie. People don't even have the opportunity to bathe  with hot water. And they are writing many letters of complaint  to the president and to the minister about how they were grossly  misled. Deception has become an integral element of military  reform because it sort of compensates for its absence.    Today, the Army has barely enough money to pay the salaries  of personnel. It's no accident that they say when Chief of the  General Staff Colonel-General Kolesnikov, during his meeting  with students of the General Staff Academy, was asked by the  students which of the Army's missions does he consider to be  most important under current conditions, he flabbergasted  everyone with his brief answer: "To survive!".    Not only that but also many other examples attest to the  fact  that military reform is becoming increasingly covered with the  dirt of immorality. Many honest generals and officers of the  Ministry of Defense and General Staff treat with great caution,  for example, that "secret chemistry" which is being created in  the issues of financing the troops. Ministry of Defense Main  Directorate for the Military Budget and Financing Chief  Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyev was recently compelled to  frankly admit a number of devastating facts. Here is just one of  them. R3 million that had left Moscow for the Northwestern Group  of Forces has been lost no one knows where for approximately 1.5  years. Something similar was repeated several months later but  with a much larger sum. Experts have calculated that during the  time when the military money "traveled around the world" it  could be circulated from three to six times and receive a profit  that totals tens of millions of at that time "wooden rubles".  General Vorobyev bemoans the fact and sighs. He said these are  the procedures that we have! The main military financier tries  to prove that he aggressively looked for the money and wrote  dozens of letters. But that, in my personal view, was only a  false imitation of concern. They didn't try too hard to find the  money, allowing it to circulate even more. Because with the  sincere desire to "find tails", both the minister and his  treasurer could have put, as they say, the investigators on  their ears and could have closed the case in a month maximum.  But that did not occur. And in the ministry they are already  openly talking about the fact that A CERTAIN FINANCIAL  MAFIA EXISTS THAT CIRCULATES MILLIONS FROM THE MILITARY BUDGET  AND FOR SOME REASON THOSE WHO SHOULD ARE NOT RUSHING TO SORT  THAT OUT.    No matter which sphere of military reform you poke with your  finger, you see lies, hypocrisy, deception and the powerlessness  of our highest military leadership everywhere which is  attempting to put up a bold front. For example, the minister of  defense quite recently announced to the entire world that the  housing problem in the Army will be resolved already in 1996.  Who convinced him of the possibility of doing that -- is unknown.    The concept of military reform was publicized in 1992 and  they divided it into three primary stages. But Military  Structural Development and Reform Directorate Chief General  Ivanov is already announcing some sort of new variants of  structural development of the Russian Army after 1995. And where  then do you hide the previously approved "general plan" of  military structural development? You can't make heads or tails  of it. Sometimes we in the General Staff get the impression that  not staid generals are involved with military reform but  children who do not know what they should do with the complex  electronic toy. But it's no accident that one of the deputy  ministers of defense was recently compelled to frankly call all  of this the "the triviality of dilettantes".</p>

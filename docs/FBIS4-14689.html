			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to its schedule, the CIS delegation  [led by Medetkan Sherimkulov, chairman of the Kyrgyzstan Supreme  Council] was to go to Khankendi [Stepanakert] from Baku, and  from there to Yerevan. But for some reason the guests left for  Yerevan instead of Khankendi.    [Begin recording] [correspondent Mehmen Qayibov] The  delegation left Baku airport for Yerevan. The guests were seen  off by Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Afiaddin Dzhalilov, Deputy  Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov, and other officials.    Before the delegation's departure we interviewed its  members.  [passage omitted on Sherimkulov statement in Russian]    [Qayibov] Mr. Afiaddin Dzhalilov, certain changes have been  introduced into the delegation's program. What can you say on  this?    [Dzhalilov] As Mr. Sherimkulov said [words indistinct]. I  want to state that at first the Armenian side accepted our  program but later they opposed Mr. Sherimkulov's delegation  going to Stepanakert, that is Khankendi, via Agdam. Thus, the  Armenians disrupted the program unilaterally. However, Mr.  Sherimkulov's personal peace mission is continuing. He will now  be flying to Armenia. From there he will go to Tbilisi, then to  Karabakh, and then to Baku again at the invitation of Geydar  Aliyev. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Review of tax departments threatens thousands of jobs A sweeping reorganisation of the Treasury's two main tax collecting departments is being considered by the government in a move which could put thousands of civil servants' jobs on the line. Ministers are examining the integration of a number of the functions of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise in a bid to cut costs as part of a wide-ranging review of expenditure. They are also considering any overlap between the two departments and the Contributions Agency of the Department of Social Security. One senior Revenue official said yesterday: 'We don't rule anything in and we don't rule anything out.' A senior Customs official said: 'Absolutely anything will be considered.' The exercise - known as the Fundamental Expenditure Review - is being conducted as part of the government's long-term spending review co-ordinated by Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary. Outline details were announced at the time of the Budget last November and the instructions from ministers to the heads of the Revenue and Customs were to consider 'radical' proposals. Interim findings from working groups within the two agencies will be submitted to ministers over the summer, although any fundamental changes may take several years to implement. The examination will include consideration of whether there is needless duplication in the separate tax investigation roles performed by the agencies when they are visiting companies. At Customs, civil servants are examining topics including the way in which value added tax and excise duties are administered, the operation of its anti-smuggling activities, and how trade statistics are run. Opponents of a merger of the central functions of the two departments argue that it would run contrary to the substantial efforts to decentralise and delegate power in Customs and the Revenue. The Treasury wants to show it is not exempt from its own spending strictures, in order to strengthen its hand in negotiations with other departments.</p>

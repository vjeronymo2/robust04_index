			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency worries depress equities THE SUDDEN wave of adverse developments in European currency markets, reflected in a setback in the pound, brought a vicious reversal in the UK stock market, which fell heavily yesterday afternoon. Led downwards by a collapse in stock index futures, the FT-SE Index closed a net 34.5 points off, a turnround of more than 50 points from the opening minutes of the session. Gloom deepened at the close on reports of a negative Maastricht opinion poll in France. Increased Seaq volume reflected hectic trading between marketmakers as they struggled to avoid taking on positions in what has become a very dangerous market. Pressure from stock index futures, where the September contract on the Footsie was at a discount to the cash market at one time, provided the driving force for equities. But there was no doubt that it was the interest rate worries provoked by currency markets which did the damage . Equities opened higher and the Footsie showed a gain of nearly 17 points in early trading. Euphoria quickly vanished as Finland effectively quit the ERM and devalued its currency, Sweden raised interest rates and Italian repurchase rates jumped to record highs - all acting to protect their currencies and leaving sterling in the firing line. As sterling dropped below the important DM2.80 level again, UK share prices quickly turned back. By late afternoon, the pound was within a pfennig of its permitted ERM floor and the Footsie had plunged by more than 35 points. A very modest rally brought a final reading of 2,337.7, down 34.5. Sentiment was further discouraged by some, at least, of the day's corporate reporting statements. Shares in Fisons, the pharmaceuticals group, fell sharply on lower profits, the stock extending the substantial loss suffered earlier in the year when concerns about the trading outlook first surfaced in the market. The rest of the drug share sector declined cautiously while awaiting further trading news from leading names. Glaxo, reporting full-year figures on Thursday, receded after the firm performances of recent sessions. The renewed worry over sterling, and therefore over domestic interest rates, hit hard in the building sector as brokerage houses again downgraded the leading stocks. A reduced dividend payment, together with lower profits, from George Wimpey hurt the housebuilding sector. But store shares held up fairly well, helped by the increased consumer debt levels reported on the previous day. Seaq volume finally totalled 418.1m shares, comparing favourably with the 299.8m of the previous session. But Monday's total, which reflected retail, or customer, business worth only Pounds 536.2m, was limited by Wall Street's holiday.

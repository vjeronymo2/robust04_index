			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Liability on shares? I work in the City for the UK subsidiary of a continental company. I am resident in Britain but domiciled elsewhere. Last year and this, I received shares in the parent organisation. They are reported as income to the Inland Revenue. But I received them in a securities account outside the UK. 1. If the shares pay a dividend which is not remitted to the UK, is there a liability to UK tax? 2. If the shares are sold for a gain and funds NOT remitted to the UK, is the sale subject to capital gains tax? 3. If the shares are sold for a loss and funds remitted to the United Kingdom, can the loss be offset against income if there are no other capital gains? Can it be offset against capital gains? 1. No. 2. No. 3. The loss would not be eligible for relief, regardless of whether the proceeds were remitted to the UK. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / German towns warn of waste crisis THE Association of German Towns, which comprises 7,000 towns and cities with 51m inhabitants, yesterday warned of an imminent waste crisis on German streets due to the mounting problems faced by Duales System Deutschland (DSD), the national waste management scheme, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Meeting Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister and chief architect of Germany's recycling laws, the association said urgent new measures were needed to ensure that municipalities were not faced with the costs of a collapsing DSD. DSD, which collects packaging waste from households in Germany, faced near-bankruptcy last month before being partially rescued at the last minute by funds from industry. The company recently announced it will cut by 20 per cent the price it pays to municipal waste management companies for the waste it collects and cannot recycle. DSD has been overwhelmed by the mounting flow of plastics it collects and for which Germany has no recycling facilities. The company announced that it will from now on only recycle plastics bottles under five litres and large plastics. It also said it will stick to the legal recycling requirement, which stands at 100,000 tonnes of plastics for 1993 and 1994. The new measures will place severe burdens on municipal waste management companies who must collect and dispose of all the waste not taken care of by DSD. Cash-straped municipalities already face a shortage of landfill space and limited incineration possibilities. Just over 40 per cent of waste management companies in Germany are run by municipalities and are not private enterprises.</p>

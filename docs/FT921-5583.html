			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Taking Wellcome on trust FT-SE Index: 2,554.3 (-7.8) It would be difficult for any investor to resist the temptation to take profits on a holding that has risen nearly sevenfold since flotation in 1986, and more than doubled in the last year alone. While most might have chosen merely to top-slice, however, the Wellcome Trust never really had the option of anything but a blockbuster sale if it was to avoid creating an overhang of Wellcome shares. So it is difficult to read any real lessons from the size of the deal for Wellcome shares in particular or for the pharmaceutical sector in general. That said, the trust could hardly admit to doubts about whether the company's growth prospects were enough to justify a multiple of 36 and a yield of 1.3 per cent. Such doubts are real, though, even if in the short run they may not matter too much. There will be technical factors underpinning the shares despite the loss of scarcity value which took 5 per cent off their value yesterday. UK institutions will doubtless want to correct their underweighting in Wellcome. Demand should also be high from overseas investors, particularly those in the US who have hitherto been deterred by the lack of liquidity in the stock. Since Wellcome generates less than 10 per cent of its sales in the UK, the offering should be relatively well absorbed, whatever the investment climate that follows the election. Yet the difficulty remains that of picking the moment when exponential growth has simply run its course. Wellcome's forecast yesterday of a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first half of its current financial year indicates it is still able to provide the growth that its price requires. How much longer that will hold is largely a matter of faith. The trust will be sitting on a tidy profit, whatever happens.</p>

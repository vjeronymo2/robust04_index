			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC postpones 'green' currency changes THE EUROPEAN Commission has postponed for a month changes in the European Community's complex 'green money' system for translating farm price supports into national currencies. But Brussels is under strong pressure from Germany to re-link common agricultural policy prices to a rising D-Mark, a move that would bust an already-strained farm budget and complicate delicate negotiations within the Uruguay Round trade talks, where France is threatening to veto the farm chapter. After inconclusive talks on Tuesday night, the Commission told EC farm ministers it would bring proposals on the agri-monetary problem to the next Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on October 20. The root of the problem is Germany's desire to protect its farmers from losing income as a result of the D-Mark revaluation against other EC currencies, in the wake of the August 2 decision to float all currencies within 15 per cent fluctuation bands of the European exchange rate mechanism. Until August 2 every ERM realignment pushed up every member state's farm prices to follow the movement of the strongest currencies, invariably the D-mark but also often the Dutch guilder. This so-called 'switchover' mechanism to protect German farmers is now in abeyance because the wide bands make formal ERM realignment near impossible. But the ERM chaos from last September to August 2 had already meant an extra charge to the farm budget of Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.15bn) as a result of 'switchover'. Since August 2, the Commission had been adjusting national farm prices every three trading days, leading to several revaluations of the 'green' French franc and Danish krone - at the expense of German and Dutch farmers. Ten days ago, however, Brussels froze any further changes, partly as a sop to Germany, which had demanded a special meeting of the Council of Ministers to address the issue. That freeze will now remain in force until October 20. 'We've had a lot of pressure from the Germans in the past few weeks,' a senior British agriculture negotiator acknowledged. As things stand, the Commission maintains that restoring 'switchover' would add a further Ecu1.42bn to farm spending. Its own proposals, for compensating farmers affected by currency appreciation, would cost Ecu870m for each 1 per cent revaluation between 1994 and 1998, Brussels estimates. But this is a sliding scale formula targeted on some national farm prices; switchover affects all farm prices and locks the spending into the budget 'for ever', as one Commission official put it. Switchover has led to heavy inflation of the 'green' Ecu, giving it a D-mark-loaded value 21 per cent over the value of the market Ecu. To weight the common green currency further in favour of the D-mark would make it almost impossible to bring farm prices down to world market levels - the goal of last year's CAP reforms. The consequences within Gatt - if the Commission caves in to German demands - would be profound. The French demands for more concessions on farm trade are intended to ensure that the 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports agreed in last November's Blair House agreement between the EC and the US will never have to be applied. If EC prices reach world level, export subsidies will become redundant and France and its partners will be able to export what they want, without any restraint except finding buyers. The price cuts of nearly one-third agreed under CAP reform make reaching world price levels a realistic possibility by about 1997 - provided the Council of Ministers stops chipping away at the reform's mechanisms for restraining production. But if prices are again hitched to a rising D-Mark, the effect of those price cuts will be badly eroded and the Blair House 21 per cent curbs on subsidised exports will come into play. The Commission's best ally in resisting Germany is the need for EC budget restraint, something Bonn insists on in everything except its own farm interests. France itself will resist making its lucrative farm exports hostage to the fortunes of the D-Mark, while the UK is taking a very hard line on maintaining the farm budget ceiling. 'We recognise that there is a political problem to be solved,' said one senior UK official, 'but let's face it, we can't solve it by conjuring up cash which doesn't exist'.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMED WRITER FRANK DEFORD BEHIND PROJECT;  </P> <P> CAN A NATIONAL DAILY SPORTS PAPER BEAT STIFF COMPETITION?  </P> <P> The talk in the press boxes began about the time the NBA playoffs started.  </P> <P> Celebrated writer Frank Deford, who had left Sports Illustrated after 27 years,  was starting a national daily newspaper devoted entirely to sports. And with  guaranteed three-year contracts and salaries apparently as high as $250,000,  Deford was getting some of the biggest names in sportswriting to consider  joining.  </P> <P> Today, a month later, the paper they are calling "the National" is still mostly  an idea with money behind it, and the idea is to mix the scope and statistics  of USA Today's sports section with the style and intelligence of Sports  Illustrated. The owners as yet have neither market surveys nor prototypes, and  Deford is still interviewing to find a managing editor.  </P> <P> But even so, the National is already causing tremors of worry and expectation  in sports journalism: Columnist Scott Ostler of the Los Angeles Times is  considering joining. So is Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News, basketball  writer Peter Vecsey of the New York Post, college basketball writer and  best-selling author John Feinstein, and others. Times sports columnist Jim  Murray has also been approached by the new publication.  </P> <P> The publisher is former New York Post Publisher Peter Price, a Princeton  classmate of Deford's. The man behind them both is Mexican broadcasting magnate  Emilio Azcarraga, the most powerful figure in Spanish-language broadcasting.  </P> <P> And the essential question behind it is obvious: How deep is the American  appetite for sports, when the fan can watch ESPN on cable, get his local paper  and USA Today the next morning and read the Sporting News and Sports  Illustrated each week? The answer may set a new measure for the financial and  cultural power of sports in this country.  </P> <P> The other question is more subtle. Does Azcarraga, with all his great wealth  from TV programming, have the will and financial patience an American national  newspaper may require? Most consider the venture a long shot and believe that  unless Azcarraga is willing to risk hundreds of millions of dollars, the answer  may be no.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that it might be an idea that would work," Murray said.  </P> <P> The Times' Ostler is "mulling" the offer and is considered likely to go, as are  several of the other names mentioned. Of those, only one has confirmed that he  is leaving: John Feinstein, the former Washington Post writer who struck it  rich writing a book about Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight.  </P> <P> In addition, the headhunting firm of Youngs, Walker &amp; Co. of Illinois  interviewed nearly every major sports editor in the country by phone to find a  managing editor.  </P> <P> They are down to a few finalists, among them John Cherwa of the Los Angeles  Times, John Rawlings of the San Jose Mercury News and Van McKenzie of the  Atlanta Journal and Constitution.  </P> <P> But what they would be joining remains speculative.  </P> <P> Plans call for the paper, which could be either tabloid or full size, to have  anywhere from 32 to 48 pages "at least six days a week," Price said, all of it  about sports. It would include a page on business, one on entertainment, and an  editorial page, according to Deford, and about 25% of the pages would be  advertising. The paper would cost 50 cents and make use of full color.  </P> <P> There would be three or four national columnists -- two each day -- plus Deford  writing once a week.  </P> <P> Price is promising a launch "by the end of the year," although insiders say  that is probably unrealistic. A second target is before the Super Bowl in late  January next year.  </P> <P> And the paper would start in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles and possibly one  or two other cities. For each city the paper would include four to eight pages  of local coverage with two alternating local columnists. New York Times writer  Peter Alfano has signed on as editor of the New York edition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $100-Million Estimate  </P> <P> The total staff, Price said, would be about 100, most of them editors and  reporters, with a smaller advertising and business staff.  </P> <P> "You can get the scores on ESPN or USA Today," Deford said. "Here you can get  everything, including English sentences. Sportswriting is already the best of  American journalism. This will be the best of the best."  </P> <P> The business plan is sketchier. "We've only been at it for a month now," Price  said.  </P> <P> Working, he said, on experience and instinct, Price is estimating publicly that  the paper could require an investment of up to $100 million and would not  likely begin to turn a profit for five years.  </P> <P> That investment should be adequate, Price believes, because the paper will not  build printing plants or a distribution network. Instead it will contract for  those tasks.  </P> <P> But others think $100 million may not be enough, if that is all Azcarraga is  willing to lose before the National turns a profit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Analysts Not Confident  </P> <P> One of the few start-up national newspapers in decades, USA Today has lost  close to $600 million since it began in September, 1982.  </P> <P> And that number does not include costs that Gannett was able to absorb by  borrowing staff and resources from its more than 80 local papers. To date, USA  Today still has yet to turn a profit for an entire year.  </P> <P> "My guess is it will not be that big a property," said J. Kendrick Noble Jr.,  who analyzes the newspaper industry for Paine Webber in New York. "I am not  confident."  </P> <P> John Morton, a newspaper expert with the brokerage firm of Lynch, Jones &amp;  Ryan in Washington, said the obstacles to success are enormous.  </P> <P> One is strong competition from high-quality sports sections. And some, such as  USA Today, are unlikely to let the National evolve without a fight. Despite  public assurances to the contrary by Gannett, sources at USA Today familiar  with its marketing research said its sports section is the dominant reason  people buy that paper.  </P> <P> Second is the costly problem of distribution, by satellite to various areas and  then regional distribution beyond that. Third are all the other costs of  starting up, from assigning contracts and assembling staff to buying news  racks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lots of Talent Involved  </P> <P> Knight-Ridder attempted a sports publication in 1982-83 at the Pasadena  Star-News called All Sports, which circulated in Southern California. But after  failing to get adequate circulation and after internal market surveys showed  little natural advertising market for it, according to Knight-Ridder's Larry  Jinks, the company dropped it after less than a year. Jinks, now publisher of  the San Jose Mercury-News, was in charge of the newspaper division at the time.  </P> <P> Does Azcarraga have the necessary resources, financial, managerial and  editorial? Deford himself is one advantage. "Frank is the pied piper of sports  journalism," said Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser, who is said to be  talking to Deford about a job but declined to talk about it. "He isn't just the  key that opens the door. He's the dynamite that blows it off the hinges."  </P> <P> Price's background is largely in magazines. Before joining the New York Post  about a year ago, Price, who had trained as a lawyer, worked for Time Inc.,  rising to director of corporate development. Later he helped found a magazine  advertising company which was sold to 3M Co. in 1977 for $20 million. About the  same time he founded Avenue, a magazine given free to the wealthy on New York's  Upper East Side.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Recent Idea  </P> <P> Azcarraga is more of a mystery. His resources are vast, but his experience is  mostly in broadcasting, not newspapers. His company, Univisa, is an American  arm of a Mexican broadcasting empire that has no parallel in the United States  and is largely family owned.  </P> <P> The idea began only "four or six months ago," said Price, when he and  Azcarraga, who knew each other socially, "got around to the subject of why the  United States didn't have a national sports newspaper like most countries in  the world."  </P> <P> The Mexican sports daily Esto, owned by another wealthy Mexican, former UPI  owner Mario Vazquez Rana, is that country's largest paper in circulation.  </P> <P> After Price left the New York Post in April, he persuaded his former college  classmate to join. Deford, who has no editing experience, did not even meet  Azcarraga until two weeks ago in Mexico.  </P> <P> "I don't think there are many more breaks in the clouds for newspapers," Deford  said. "I turned 50 last December and wasn't liable to get this kind of chance  again."  </P></p>

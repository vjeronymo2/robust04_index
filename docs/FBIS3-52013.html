			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Giselle Chassot: "Brizola Supporters Seek </F> Alliance With Left Wing of PMDB"]    [Text] A surprising political alliance may be in the making  for the upcoming general elections. On one side is Rio de  Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola's PDT [Democratic Labor Party],  and on the other is at least a part--the so-called ethical  wing--of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. The  PDT's president, Deputy Neiva Moreira (Maranhao), is trying to  conceal the fact by saying that "so far there is no localized  effort in that direction," but the president of the PMDB, Deputy  Luiz Henrique (Santa Catarina), says that the two parties "will  sit down to talk before the end of the year [1993]."    What is most surprising about the deal is Brizola's  willingness to give up an old precondition. According to  reports, the governor of Rio de Janeiro is willing not to impose  his own candidacy for president of the republic as the basis for  any discussion. "The problem with these alliances is that they  zero out all political aspirations," commented Senator Pedro  Simon (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the government's leader in the  Senate. He admitted that his party was indeed going to talk to  Brizola "before this year is out," but he feels that any  political alliance that might result should unite all of "social  democracy and also include the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party]."    Simon commented that the only party that could not be  included would be the PT [Workers Party], since it already has a  candidate (party president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva). "The PDT  also had Brizola at one time, but now he is willing to talk,"  the senator continued. He emphasized that in order for any  agreement to be possible, all parties would have to sit down at  the negotiating table as equals or, in this case, without having  already picked their candidates.    Courtship--Some PMDB and PDT congressmen say the courtship  between the two parties was the idea of Neiva Moreira, the PDT's  president; Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), party leader in the  Chamber of Deputies; and Deputy Vivaldo Barbosa, all on the  PDT's side. The cupid on the PMDB's side was reportedly Jarbas  Vasconcellos, mayor of Recife.    In the PDT, both Neiva Moreira and Salomao deny having taken  the first step toward the agreement. Moreira insists that  Brizola is the party's candidate for president of the republic  and that the governor is not even free to decide whether or not  he will head the party list if there really is a political  alliance of some kind. "That decision is made not by him but by  the party," he emphasizes. Salomao says the idea is not his, but  he adds enthusiastically that "in view of the crisis in the  PMDB, if we do not try to attract the wing of the party that  interests us, it will wind up in the arms of the PSDB."    Salomao feels that the problems facing the PMDB at the  moment  may lead to a rapprochement with the party's so-called ethical  wing. Or, as the PDT leader prefers to put it: "We are not  interested in the PMDB's Sarney wing or its Quercia wing; what  interests us is the Simon wing."    Although no one is openly claiming responsibility for the  flirtation between a rather significant wing of the PMDB and the  PDT, there is consensus on at least one point: the initiative  came from the PDT. The PMDB's president points out that such an  agreement already exists in some states. "But for the time  being, there is nothing that goes any further than that; I have  simply received from Neiva Moreira, Vivaldo Barbosa, and Luiz  Salomao a statement of their desire to hold official talks  between the PMDB and the PDT," he says.    Luiz Henrique claims, however, that the possible  rapprochement with the PDT is in no way related to the crisis  being experienced by the PMDB. Targeted by accusations that  several of its most prominent members are involved in the budget  scandal and split into several wings, the PMDB cannot agree on a  consensus candidate. Even so, the president feels that if part  of his party is arousing the interest of the PDT, that is  "because of the party's size and importance."    Luiz Henrique made it a point to emphasize that there is no  agreement between the two parties. "They took the initiative of  talking, and that is very good," he said. According to the  president of the PMDB, the flirtation between the two parties  began less than two weeks ago.  <H5>  PDT Even Calls on Silvio Santos To Ensure Growth </H5>   Sao Paulo--The PDT leadership in Sao Paulo is trying once  again to resurrect the party in that state and trying to induce  businessman and TV host Silvio Santos to join in order to run  for governor in the upcoming elections. The PDT's new secretary  general in Sao Paulo, former Deputy and former Osasco Mayor  Francisco Rossi, says Governor Leonel Brizola has given him the  job of conducting the talks with Silvio Santos in order to  attract him to the party.    "We are working against time because Silvio still belongs to  the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the deadline for changing  party membership is 8 January," Rossi points out. Silvio Santos  will meet with his staff on 3 January to make a decision.    For its part, the PDT is already announcing the start of a  campaign to attract 1 million new members in Sao Paulo. At the  moment, the party cannot even say how many members it has in the  state. It has only one federal deputy from Sao Paulo--its  regional president, Liberato Caboclo--and one state deputy,  Hilkias de Oliveira. "But the party will be different after the  next elections," promises Rossi, who was a member of the PDS  [Democratic Social Party] and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]  before joining the PDT in September.    Rossi says he talked to Silvio Santos 20 days ago. "The  talks  are still under way, and the only difficulty is that deep down,  he still has some hope of being the PFL's candidate for  president," Rossi admits. "He says that politics is not part of  his life at present, but he does not rule out the possibility  that it might be in the future," the PDT leader says.    Parallel with that, the Sao Paulo PDT is talking to  businessman Antonio Ermirio Votorantim, superintending director  of the Votorantim Group. "Antonio Ermirio is also leaning toward  being a candidate, but he had a bitter experience in the race  for state governor in 1986," says Rossi. "In any case, people on  the street are constantly calling on him to be a candidate, and  as far as he is concerned, that is more important than any  opinion poll. Besides, he has great admiration for Leonel  Brizola," Rossi adds.    In its efforts to attract Silvio Santos and Antonio Ermirio,  the PDT will have to match forces with the PFL. Both men are  also being considered by the PFL as possible candidates for  governor of Sao Paulo, according to the president of the PFL's  executive board in Sao Paulo, former Minister Antonio Cabrera.    Elephants--This is not the PDT's first attempt to strengthen  its position in Sao Paulo, where its share of the vote has  historically been small. On several occasions it has invested in  former politicians of declining prestige in the attempt to  reorganize itself. Successive examples of this were former  Deputy Roge Ferreira, his political heir Adhemar de Barros  Filho, former Lieutenant Governor Almino Affonso, and former  Deputy Airton Soares. None of them was able to put the party on  solid ground or even to get anyone on the new slate elected.  Brizola received less than 2 percent of Sao Paulo's vote for  president of the republic.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Magic card tricks - How your wish for simpler and cheaper phone calls from abroad can be granted The extortionate hotel telephone bill need never enrage you again. The need to rummage around for piles of foreign coins to feed a pay telephone is an irritation of the past. So is the hunt for a kiosk that sells a telephone card - which you then usually carry home on the aircraft with most of its value unused. Most European executives, however, still have not realised that carrying a telephone charge card is a way to short-circuit many of the hassles involved in calling home from abroad. The idea behind 'calling cards' is simple. You make your calls toll free, quoting a personal identification number, and the cost is charged either to your home or office telephone account, or to a credit or charge card account. The majority of US travellers - at home and abroad - now have a telephone charge card. AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, alone has more than 27m in circulation within the US. But it is estimated that only one in five UK travellers has a card, while elsewhere in Europe the proportion is thought to be lower still. 'Our main UK competitor isn't British Telecom: it's ignorance,' says Mr Peter Valentin, AT&amp;T's consumer markets manager in the UK. 'Most travellers still don't carry calling cards; and their employers don't seem to realise the cost.' While a card can reduce the worry, frequent overseas travellers stand to gain from having more than one phone charge card. Different cards have different virtues, in terms of where you can call and how much it costs. And since most of the cards come free, the only drawback is the time it takes to work out which card to use when. Calls by card are charged at a premium rate. But a typical hotel call from the US to the UK costs more than twice as much as using a US telecom charge card. Similar savings can be made from using cards issued by local telephone operators when calling between European countries. All Europe's larger state telecommunications operators issue calling cards. And in most of the main business destinations you can use any card to phone home. Competition between the card companies is fierce, and no two cards are alike. For the overseas traveller, therefore, three things need to be taken into account: Tariffs. For the US traveller, it is almost invariably cheaper to use a domestic than a foreign card to ring home. Rival US card producers are led by the three long-distance operators, AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI. The same does not apply to UK or European travellers. In Europe, you are usually better off phoning home with a card from your national operator, but in the US you are likely to find it cheaper calling home with a US card. From next month, Sprint, the long-distance US carrier, is advertising a tariff from the US to the UK on its Foncard barely one-fifth that available on BT's Chargecard. For UK travellers, Mercury's card generally works out cheaper than BT's. A 10-minute peak-rate call from Germany to London costs Pounds 9.89 with a BT card, but Pounds 8.99 with Mercury. Ease of calling. Some cards have wider coverage than others. The main American, European and Asian destinations are covered by most cards. But while BT boasts 82 countries from which the UK can be called by Chargecard, Mercury's Calling Card extends to only 36. AT&amp;T's card can be used by US travellers almost anywhere: it even offers an online translation service in 140 languages, 24 hours a day. Billing and calling procedures vary. Some cards allow you to charge the cost to a credit card; others restrict you to a home phone account. Of the UK cards, Mercury allows you to call direct, without going through an operator, while BT obliges you to go through an operator. Third-country calling. To protect their international revenues, some countries do not allow you to use a card to call a country other than that from which it originates. The principal business destinations affected are Spain, Japan, Singapore, China, Argentina and Brazil.</p>

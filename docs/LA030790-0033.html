			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> SETTLING AN ACCIDENT 'ON THE SPOT'  </P> <P> Question: Something interesting has happened to me, and I am wondering if it  indicates a new trend in the automobile insurance field. A few days ago, I was  driving my brand-new, 2-month-old Toyota Celica when a woman driving a van  broadsided me at an intersection. I had the right of way.  </P> <P> After making sure I wasn't hurt, the woman readily admitted she had stopped for  the "Stop" sign but had then pulled out and hit me. She was most insistent that  both of us avoid our insurance companies and said she would write me a check  with no questions asked as soon as I had an appraisal made.  </P> <P> What really surprised me, though, was that when I checked with my insurance  company, they seemed to think it was a perfectly logical way to settle the  matter. When the lady and I talked later, she told me she had checked with her  insurance carrier and that they, too, approved of the arrangement. The lady  obviously wants to keep the accident off her record and keep her premiums down.  In a subsequent phone conversation with her (before I had gotten my estimate),  she said that when I was satisfied with the estimate, she would meet me at her  bank, write me a check -- which I could deposit to my own account immediately  -- and she would have a notarized form releasing her of liability for me to  sign. The advantage to me, of course, would be that I would get my car repaired  without paying the deductible.  </P> <P> It all seems perfectly legal, and I have gotten the impression that "let's  settle this matter privately" is a new trend. Is it? And as the injured party,  are there any dangers in it for me? -- D.C.  </P> <P> Answer: According to Mary Crystal, director of communications for the Insurance  Information Institute at Preston, Calif., and Bob Christensen, a longtime State  Farm Insurance agent in Glendale, this is a long way from being a "new trend."  It's been going on for many years, and at one time or another, virtually all of  us have participated in it. (You backed out of a parking space and nicked the  car pulling in behind you. It was your fault, but it was also a $50 repair job,  far under the deductible for both of you. So your "victim" had the nick taken  care of and sent you the bill. End of story.)  </P> <P> "It's always depended on circumstances," Crystal said. "How much money is  involved, whether one or the other of you is at fault, that sort of thing.  People today are just more sensitive about premiums and what can affect them,  and so the dollar figures have gone up."  </P> <P> State Farm's Christensen concurred. "The key to the whole thing," he adds, "is  injury. If there is no injury, then it's simply a matter of money and the two  parties can work out an agreeable deal between them. But both of them have to  be careful when they do this. It sounds to me like the lady who hit this person  may have a driving problem that could seriously impact her premiums if it  became a matter of record, since she was clearly at fault. The comment about  having a (liability release) for him to sign would also seem to suggest that  she's had a little experience in this sort of thing. State Farm, however,  wouldn't raise the premium of the driver who wasn't at fault, but simply not  having to pay the deductible would make a deal like this worthwhile for him."  </P> <P> But, as Christensen points out, both parties to a private settlement such as  this have to watch out for some potential pitfalls. The victim has to make sure  there are no physical injuries that might flare up later; that the estimate  from the body shop is a firm one and that additional repairs won't surface  after he's accepted her check (because, Christensen said, "once he's accepted  and banked her check he's got no recourse"), and that the check he receives is  "good." Also, if the victim's car is going to be out of action for several  days, the other party should pay for the rental. "The victim shouldn't be out  of pocket for anything," Christensen added.  </P> <P> For the guilty party (in this case the woman who broadsided the other car),  "her insistence that he sign a release of liability when payment is made is  perfectly good business," Christensen stated. "She doesn't want him coming back  in six months with a mysterious whiplash injury."  </P></p>

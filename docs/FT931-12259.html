			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / American Steel Tariffs: US not planning a steel war yet - Clinton administration may look at the fairness of its own trade laws A SHORT statement by Mr Ron Brown, the new US commerce secretary, was easily lost amid the cries of outrage which greeted Wednesday's steel dumping decisions. 'These determinations follow mandated procedures and other results of exhaustive investigations; as such they are not policy statements,' he said. After one week on the job, the Clinton administration has found itself 'on a train which had already left the station' as far as steel is concerned, said one Washington analyst. The Commerce Department and US trade representative still lack the deputies, under secretaries and assistant secretaries whose influence will be vital in designing and implementing trade policies. US officials have been at pains to emphasise that Wednesday's decision was preliminary. The Commerce Department will make its final determinations between April 12 and mid-June. The International Trade Commission will then have 45 days to decide if the imports have caused injury to the US industry. Where President Bill Clinton has had to be specific - on supporting the North American free trade agreement - he displayed a willingness to take on domestic interests, and the labour unions, for the sake of a forward-leaning policy. It will not be conducive to good relations in North America if the final decision is to impose dumping duties of 49-76 per cent on Mexican steel and up to 68.7 per cent on Canadian steel. The Canadian government has reacted to the steel cases in a way bound to grab the attention of the new administration. Three weeks ago it found American steel companies guilty of dumping steel plate. Today it is expected to find the US guilty of dumping hot rolled steel. Mr Frederik Pelmer, chairman of Stelco, the largest Canadian-based steel producer, drove the point home at a press conference in Washington on Wednesday. 'This kind of tit-for-tat action is ridiculous,' he said. 'It diverts our attention, our time and our money from dealing with the real structural challenges facing the steel industry in North America.' Canada's swift and strong response illustrates the danger foreseen by many US trade experts. The use of 'unfair' trade laws is spreading and providing a tool for protection-minded industries the world over. With the US industry in jeopardy, the administration may take a closer look at the fairness of its own trade laws. They give the Commerce Department considerable discretion in how it determines dumping and subsidies. More and more studies are finding those formulas skewed towards the domestic industry. Critics complain that the US dumping law punishes foreigners for pricing behaviour that is no different from that of US companies, or that does not really distort trade patterns. Another common criticism was voiced on Wednesday by the American Institute for International Steel, which represents importers. The dumping margins were overstated because they are based on distorted exchange rates. The Clinton administration may agree to negotiate another round of 'voluntary quotas'. Or it may move to reform its trade laws. The much-abused 'policy wonks' now in power have to be given time to study their options. Sense of duty, Page 15</p>

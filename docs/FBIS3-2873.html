"I spent the night at the police station  and the police made it clear I was not to go too far," Yang said  in a telephone interview.    His detention came less than an hour after the arrival of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is expected to  ask the Chinese government about progress on human rights.    Yang, a 50-year-old veteran dissident, was one of the nine  founders of the Peace Charter, a human rights movement set up  last November. Two of its leaders, Qin Yongming and Zhou  Guoqiang, have been imprisoned. The secretary general of the  Human Rights Association, Shanghai-based Wang Fuchen, was also  detained for questioning Friday.    The Chinese government has launched a major offensive  against  dissidents and rebel intellectuals over the past 10 days,  questioning about 15, of whom three are still in custody. The  latest crackdown coincided with the annual session of the  National People's Congress, which began sitting Thursday.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> Baubles, Boxers, Requisite Tie  </P> <P> "Perfect." That's what Julia Roberts said when she saw the antique necklaces  with watches, lockets and other Old World charms at Tracey Ross, a new shop in  Los Angeles. She scooped up several of the pretty baubles priced from $200 to  $300. Farrah Fawcett also cruised the store recently and purchased a pair of  $20 flannel boxer shorts printed with playing cards and dice -- for herself.  </P> <P> TIES? AGAIN? Need a present for the man on your list? How about a tie? The  numbers indicate that it is the universal lack-of-imagination gift. The  Neckwear Assn. of America estimates that between 14.4 and 19.2 million ties  will be sold this holiday season. Even former First Father Ronald Reagan won't  be spared. Daughter Maureen wrapped up her Christmas shopping at Fred Hayman  Beverly Hills with a couple of tie purchases for dear old dad.  </P> <P> HEAVY TRAFFIC: Three rap masters, Young M.C., Vanilla Ice and M.C. Hammer, have  been shopping at Traffic in the Beverly Center for their formal attire. Young  M.C. bought a $1,200 rhinestone-encrusted tuxedo, and Vanilla Ice had to have a  tux for his new video. M.C. Hammer opted for a more sedate, black silk Fugi  suit.  </P> <P> STILL ON THE RISE: Joey Rodolfo recently received some surprising news from the  California apparel industry. It seems the 12-year design veteran was a nominee  for the California Mart's Rising Star menswear designer award, along with newer  talents Mat Gaspers, June Hiroshima-Lentz, Sepp Donahower and Walter Muroya.  "Isn't the rising star supposed to have pimples and be fresh out of design  school?" Rodolfo asked Listen. Rodolfo created his first menswear line, under  the Lifeguard label, in 1978. His new, Seattle-based collection of traditional  menswear is called Cutter &amp; Buck. "I'm going to have to call the Mart and  ask them to start a survivors award," he joked.  </P> <P> HIDDEN CHARMS: Not all candles are created equal. Some carry buried trinkets.  At Tops in Malibu the hot seller of the season is the Treasure Candle,  available in an $18.50 and $30 size. As the pyramid-shaped candles melt, hidden  charms -- anywhere from four to eight -- appear. The charms are made of such  materials as sterling silver, rose quartz and jade. Michelle McIntosh, daughter  of gallery owner Robert Walker, reports her grandmother, Jennifer Jones, found  a jade frog in one. McIntosh says Pat Benatar, Mick Fleetwood, Whoopi Goldberg  and Julie Andrews are among the celebrities who have bought the candles as  Christmas gifts. Let's hope their friends have chopsticks, the recommended  device for removing the bounty.  </P></p>

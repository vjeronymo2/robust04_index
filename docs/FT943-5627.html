			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME aluminium prices surge to 3 1/2 -year highs Aluminium prices reached 3 1/2 -year highs at the London Metal Exchange yesterday as traders anticipated further improvements in the market's fundamental picture. Expectations that the multilateral pact agreed earlier this year to cut output would continue to eat into stocks of the metal, already bolstered by Wednesday's news of threatened power cuts at Kaiser's Ghanaian smelter, were given a further fillip by the likelihood of a potline closure at an Australian plant (see adjacent story). The news helped the LME's three months delivery price to break through the resistance area around Dollars 1,550 a tonne to touch Dollars 1,570 before closing at Dollars 1,564, up Dollars 29.50 on the day and Dollars 51.25 on the week so far. 'The move on aluminium today was always on the cards considering recent news of production problems and improving charts,' one dealer told the Reuters news agency. 'Prices are now set to go higher.' As cuts under the multilateral pact have worked through LME stocks of aluminium have declined by more than 200,000 tonnes, or 7.5 per cent, from the record level reached on June 10. Producer stocks have also shown a substantial fall in recent months. And with developed economies moving out of recession demand for aluminium is generally expected to pick up quite strongly. 'We may be on for levels around Dollars 1,600 soon,' the dealer told Reuters.</p>

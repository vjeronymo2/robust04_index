			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to  China Michihiko Kunihiro visited the Chinese Foreign Ministry on  Saturday [7 May] to clarify his government's position on the  Nagano affair, a Japanese official said.    Kunihiro told Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan that the  basic stand of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa would be "to make great efforts for  future-oriented relations between Japan and China," an embassy  spokesman said.    Tang said the Chinese Government "was reacting with  restraint" over the Nagano affair, but seeing the enormous  political repercussions the issue has aroused, they "felt  indignant and very concerned," the spokesman said.    The Chinese vice minister said his government will pay great  attention "to the manner in which Japan deals with Nagano."    Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano caused an uproar Wednesday  when he denied that Japan waged a war of aggression in Asia  during the 1930s and World War II and massacred hundreds of  thousands of Chinese in Nanjing in 1937.    Chinese newspapers Saturday reported Nagano's public  retraction of his remarks and apology on Friday and also the  possibility of his resignation after Hata's return from a trip  to Europe.    Tang told the Japanese ambassador to convey to the Japanese  Government that Nagano's statements "greatly hurt and angered  the people of China," the spokesman said.</p>

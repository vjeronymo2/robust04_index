			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-AROUND SUCCESS FOR DIMAS;  </P> <P> GYMNASTICS: EAST GERMANS SCORE TEAM VICTORY, BUT UNHERALDED NEBRASKAN STEALS  THE SHOW.  </P> <P> The Americans lost to the East Germans in a men's gymnastics meet here Sunday,  but for U.S. Gymnastics Federation officials, not all was lost. They found a  new star.  </P> <P> Trent Dimas, a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Nebraska, wasn't even  invited to this meet. His coach at Nebraska, Francis Allen, pulled some strings  to get him in. Then Dimas, unranked and unexpectedly good, beat the 10th-ranked  gymnast in the world, East German Sylvio Kroll, to win the all-around title.  </P> <P> "I'm as happy now as I was when our team won the NCAA championship last week,"  Dimas said, referring to Nebraska's victory at Minnesota. "I wasn't even  supposed to be at this meet, I wasn't invited."  </P> <P> Dimas entered the last event, the high bar, trailing Kroll by .35 points.  Kroll, East Germany's top gymnast in the meet, fell on his first release move  and scored a 9.2.  </P> <P> Dimas, the last gymnast to perform, stuck a flawless triple back-flip on his  dismount to score a 9.8. and delight a crowd of 1,500 at the Mid-South  Coliseum.  </P> <P> Dimas finished with 57.75 points. Kroll had 57.50 and East German Andre Hempel  57.25. UCLA's Chainey Umphrey, who was closing in on third place before the  high bar, fell and finished sixth.  </P> <P> Dimas won the high bar, scored a 9.75 on the parallel bars, a 9.6 on vault, a  9.55 both on the rings and the pommel horse, and a 9.5 on floor. Nothing  spectacular, just consistent.  </P> <P> The United States won two events, the vault and the high bar, but could not  keep up with East Germany, which won by 1.45 points, 284.80 to 283.35. To put  this in perspective, however, the East Germans finished second to the Soviet  Union at the 1989 World Championships. The United States tied for eighth.  </P> <P> East Germany took the lead from the beginning, outscoring the United States by  .60 points after the first event, the floor exercise.  </P> <P> But the pommel horse proved costly for the United States, which fell behind by  1.95 points after Jeff Lutz and David St. Pierre each fell and scored 8.4 and  8.85, respectively.  </P> <P> A solid performance on the rings helped, but the United States was still  outscored by .15 points. Umphrey scored the highest, 9.7, with a full-twisting,  double-back flip dismount in a pike position.  </P> <P> On the vault, the Americans outscored the East Germans to move to within 1.7  points. Lutz earned a 9.75 with his Kasamatsu -- a cartwheel onto the vault --  with a 1 1/2 twist.  </P> <P> Dimas, who performed a Yurchenko layout with a full twist, earned a 9.6. On a  Yurchenko vault, a gymnast does a round-off onto the springboard, and a back  handspring over the vault. It's a vault performed more by women than men,  because the vault is turned lengthwise in men's gymnastics.  </P> <P> On the parallel bars, two falls by Lutz and Dominick Minicucci, who is coming  back from an injury, put the United States behind by 2.9 points with only the  high bar remaining. Even though the United States won the final event, it  couldn't make up the deficit.  </P> <P> In the all-around, Lutz finished 10th and Minicucci finished last.  </P> <P> Also competing for the United States was Mark Warburton, who finished fourth,  and alternate Jarrod Hanks, who finished ninth.  </P></p>

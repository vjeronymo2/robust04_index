			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: SA's Anglovaal and JCI show decline on variable gold price LOWER grades and milling rates and a weaker gold price caused taxed profits to fall sharply during the September quarter at the four gold mines in the Anglovaal group. Taxed profits fell to R25.9m (Dollars 9.20m) from R44.6m in the June quarter, mainly due to a 45 per cent fall in profits at Hartebeestfontein, the group's largest mine. Gold production at Hartebeestfontein's main plant fell to 6,502kg from 6,864kg on a fall in ore milled and grade sliding to 8.6 grammes per tonne from 8.9 grammes. Although unit revenue rose slightly, unit costs were higher at R28,187 per kg compared with R25,599 per kg. This caused profits per kg of gold to fall to R3,137 from R5,298. The group's troubled Loraine mine incurred another loss of R3.4m, the same as last quarter. This figure, however included R1.5m flowing from one-off retrenchment costs. Meanwhile, the three mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group produced more gold in the September quarter, but profits after tax and capital expenditure fell due to problems at the Joel mine. Total gold production rose to 12.3 tonnes from 12.2 tonnes in the June quarter. A slightly higher gold price was offset by increased costs following the annual round of wage negotiations. Profits after tax and capital expenditure fell by 12.2 per cent to R17.8m from R20.3m, due to losses of R8.1m at Joel. Randcoal, the South African coal-mining group, raised sales and profits in the year to September, but contrary to its April forecast, second-half profits did not match those of the first. Turnover rose 30 per cent to R1.62bn (Dollars 560m) from R1.24bn, and operating profits advanced rose 22 per cent to R306.8m from R251.9m.</p>

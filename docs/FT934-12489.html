			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes at record high in late surge Wall Street AFTER A slow start, heavy demand for blue chip and cyclical issues sent the leading US stock market index to an all-time high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.31 at 3,673.61, comfortably eclipsing its previous record of 3,652.09 set in August. Secondary indices fared less well. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.93 firmer at 464.20, the American SE composite down 1.67 at 475.58 and the Nasdaq composite off 2.93 at 769.75. Trading volume on the NYSE was 260.3m shares. Although investors started the week optimistic about the economy, concern that stocks may be overpriced, with almost every major index at or near to its record high, initially kept demand in check. Also depressing sentiment were fresh worries about rising interest rates - bond prices fell sharply for the third consecutive day yesterday, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up above 6 per cent. There were, however, some positive factors at work in the market, such as the latest developments in the bid battle for Paramount Communications, and good news on monthly home sales. Eventually, investor sentiment recovered and, amid steady buying of blue chip and cyclical stocks, the Dow posted a strong gain in the final 90 minutes of trading. The big corporate story of the day was Paramount, which climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 79 in volume of 3.2m shares on news that Viacom had matched the Dollars 4.8bn hostile takeover bid for the entertainment group made by QVC Network, and had begun a tender offer for Paramount stock at a price of Dollars 80 a share. The news left Viacom, traded on the American Stock Exchange, down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 59 and QVC, traded on the Nasdaq market, Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 53 7/8 . Among the cyclical stocks, Alcoa advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 70 3/4 , Allied Signal firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 7/8 and CSX added Dollars 1 at Dollars 78 3/8 . General Motors, however, retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 44 1/2 in volume of 5.57m shares after brokerage house PaineWebber lowered its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral'. Investors also seemed to be unsettled by the news that GM had agreed on a three-year contract with the auto workers union which gives the company more room to avoid paying laid-off workers but offers it little relief from pension and medical costs. Fresh rises in bond yields hurt bank and brokerage issues. Citicorp declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 and Chase Manhattan gave up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 33 1/2 , while Merrill Lynch slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 92 1/2 and Morgan Stanley Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/8 . Canada TORONTO finished virtually unchanged after a day of lacklustre trading ahead of last night's federal election results. The TSE 300 index inched up 1.4 to 4,155.3. The index had been down slightly for most of the session, before staging a modest rally to move into positive territory. Rises led falls by 381 to 368 after volume of 42.9m shares valued at CDollars 468.3m. Inco, off CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 26 5/8 , said its third-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 91.2m from CDollars 10.6m a year earlier, but the latest quarter included an after-tax gain of CDollars 127.9m from the sale of Inco's stake in TVX Gold.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: MGN finance director astonishes MPs ASTONISHED MPs yesterday questioned Mr Lawrence Guest, chairman of the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Fund's investments committee, after he testified that he did not know the ownership of companies in which the pension fund held stakes. Mr Guest, who is also MGN's finance director, said he believed his role was simply to monitor the returns earned by the pension fund's various investment managers. The MPs asked him how the fund had come to invest so heavily in entities related to Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Guest, whose investments committee kept no minutes of its decisions, testified that he did not know the extent of the pension fund's self-investment until November 1991. Prior to that, he relied on Bishopsgate Investment Management to provide valuations of what was in the fund and believed that self investment was no more than 7 to 8 per cent of the fund. 'I made no specific inquiries into who owned those companies,' Mr Guest told the Select Committee - sparking titters of disbelief from MPs and audience alike. By April 1990, the MGN pension fund accounts showed that over 40 per cent of all investments were concentrated in 20 companies - over half of which had some connection with Mr Maxwell or his private interests. Mr Guest conceded that on one occasion at least, he had received a letter from an MGN pensioner asking about the unusual pattern of investments, but said he did not pursue the matter. Other revealing testimony concerned Lord Donoughue, formerly a director of BIM. According to a letter from Lord Donoughue's solicitor, he was concerned about stock lending activities in early 1991 because they were done without his knowledge. The activities had not ceased by July 1991 and Lord Donoughue asked that the matter be brought to the attention of the trustees - a request Mr Maxwell rejected. Two weeks later, Lord Donoughue left the employ of BIM. But his departure apparently went unheralded and unrecorded, even to pension fund trustees to whom he had to report. Mr Ernest Burrington, then managing director of MGN and a trustee of the pension fund - and currently its chairman - said he noticed in the autumn that Lord Donoughue hadn't been around in some time. 'I noticed he was missing,' Mr Burrington testified. 'It was a little like Argentina before the junta,' he said - adding that he assumed Lord Donoughue had had a falling out with Mr Maxwell but didn't want to ask about it. Mr Burrington testified that he had been about to resign from MGN over the missing funds and a lease arrangement the company had agreed which he felt was particularly disadvantageous for shareholders. Mr Burrington said he later learned that Mr Maxwell had borrowed funds against the lease. He said that he and Mr Maxwell had exchanged views about the matter at an hotel during the Labour party conference last autumn and he had offered his resignation. Meanwhile, a Scottish printer has emerged as the unsung hero of the Maxwell pensions saga. Mr Harry Templeton, formerly at the Scottish Sunday Mail, told how he had been fired from the paper after 18 years service because of his role as a pension fund trustee. 'Mr Maxwell told me I would sit on the board (of Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Fund trustees) over his dead body,' said Mr Templeton, a Scottish printer formerly employed by MGN's Scottish Daily Record. 'That's when I began to suspect he was not to be trusted. Because when I got on, he lived on.' Mr Templeton said he repeatedly challenged decisions urged by Mr Maxwell, going so far as to consult a QC over what actions could be taken to prevent abuses in the investment of pension funds. He said that Mr Maxwell repeatedly threatened to wind up the fund if trustees questioned the way it was being operated. Mr Templeton was sacked for 'gross industrial misconduct' in 1986 and, except for a six-month stint that year, has not since worked in the newspaper business. Mr Templeton said he believed he had been blacklisted because of his role on the pension fund. Minutes of MGN pension trustee meetings show that Mr Templeton's appointment was opposed by Mr Maxwell. Mr Templeton testified that of those trustees appointed by management, none ever voted against Mr Maxwell. 'Some of them never even spoke,' he said.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Insolvency work could go private, report tells DTI SUBSTANTIAL PARTS of the work carried out by the government's Insolvency Service could be handed over to the private sector, according to a consultant's report submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry. The report, which was commissioned by the DTI in July from accountants Stoy Hayward, suggests that up to Pounds 42m of the Pounds 50m in annual work conducted by the Official Receivers' office could be privatised. The findings may lead to an announcement in parliament in the next few weeks by Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, on whether to proceed with a second detailed study to consider the feasibility of privatisation. The consultants conclude that the private sector could handle most of the mechanical processing of bankruptcy and compulsory liquidations work, leaving officials to concentrate on their investigative role. But the report says that it is 'unclear' from the initial study whether contracting out would yield significant savings or improved value for money. The areas which would prove most difficult to privatise include public examination and court appearances, creditor queries and sanctions for liquidators and trustees. It suggests that 'managed service providers' would be best placed to take over the work on grounds of economy, efficiency, effectiveness and value for money. These would include a mix of both local and regional contractors. Of six different 'scenarios' it calls for most close examination of one which would involve the private sector as soon as possible after a petition was lodged. But it concedes this might give rise to conflicts of interest and interference with the Official Receivers' investigations. Two alternative scenarios it suggests are feasible would introduce the private sector after interviews or meetings with those involved in bankruptcies or insolvencies. The report stresses that changes in the law would be required for implementation of the proposed changes. It recommends a further feasibility study and the launching of pilots of the different approaches. Mr Keith Ellis, a spokesman for the trade unions at the Insolvency Service, said: 'The services we have provided in the past, our professionalism and experience will be destroyed by large-scale privatisation. We will be approaching MPs to win support for our cause.'</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BSM tops flotation profit forecast BSM Group, the owner of the British School of Motoring which was floated last October, increased both operating profits and turnover by 12 per cent for the year to the end of December. Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.11m to Pounds 4.63m, just ahead of the Pounds 4.55m forecast in the prospectus. Turnover rose from Pounds 21m to Pounds 23.6m. Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said the company was delighted to have beaten its profit forecast. After clearing about Pounds 30m of debt with the proceeds of the flotation, the group was in a good financial position for the future, with a strong balance sheet and high cash generation. At the pre-tax level profits were Pounds 1.02m, after paying net interest of Pounds 3.77m. That compares with a loss of Pounds 528,000 for 1992 after paying net interest of Pounds 4.69m. A high tax charge of Pounds 698,000, or a little less than 70 per cent, depressed earnings per share to 2.2p, compared with losses of 10.2p last time. From now on the group expects a constant tax charge of about 25 per cent as it takes advantage of capital allowances on its fleet of 2,000 cars. The group said pro-forma pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.47m, up from a pro-forma Pounds 4.06m for 1992. With tax at 25 per cent, pro-forma earnings were 11.8p (10.7p). The pro-forma net interest payment was Pounds 154,000, compared with Pounds 45,000. As forecast in the prospectus, this year's interim dividend will be the first to be paid, but the company estimated a pro-forma dividend of 5.78p for 1993. BSM is the UK's biggest driving instruction company, operating 134 branches and 2,000 franchised instructors. It said the decline in the UK market, which has been in double figures, levelled out last year, falling just 2 per cent. BSM's own business rose by 4 per cent. The group also operates a health and safety division, which provides training to company car drivers, and MCR, its maintenance arm which is expanding beyond BSM's own fleet. These two accounted for 10 per cent of turnover.</p>

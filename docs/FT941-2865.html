			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JM and Cookson in ceramic link Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, and Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, are planning to link their ceramic interests in a joint venture that would be number two in the world market. The colour and print division of Johnson Matthey, which makes colours, stains and liquid precious metal preparations for the tableware, sanitary ware and glass industries, would be joined with Cookson's ceramic supplies and minerals division. This side makes colours and glazes for the tableware, sanitary ware and tile industries. Both companies cater for different aspects of the world market, which Mr Chris Clark, managing director of Johnson Matthey, estimated as worth Pounds 1bn a year. The market leader is Ferro of the US, with more than 20 per cent. Johnson Matthey's division made operating profits of Pounds 11.3m on sales of Pounds 103.3m in the year to the end of March 1993, when its net assets were Pounds 69.9m. Cookson's division made operating profits of Pounds 11.8m on sales of Pounds 135.6m in the year to end December, when net assets were Pounds 90m. The joint venture, to be known as Cookson Matthey Ceramics, would be owned half and half and have up to 20 per cent of the world market. Both companies are transferring assets of equal value to the venture, so there would be no compensating payments. Mr Richard Oster, who has spent the past few years refocusing Cookson on its core businesses, including ceramics, described the proposed deal as 'sort of a dream come true'. Mr Oster will be chairman of Cookson Matthey Ceramics, and Mr Clark chief executive.</p>

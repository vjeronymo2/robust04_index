			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco abandons Dollars 1.5bn stock offering RJR NABISCO, the US cigarette and food manufacturer, yesterday called off a plan to raise around Dollars 1.5bn through an offering of shares pegged to the performance of its food division. The decision to abort was made at the 11th hour - Wall Street had been anticipating that the new shares would be priced after the market closed last night. RJR Nabisco blamed the general weakness in food company stocks for its decision, saying that a 'significant' fall in the market value of comparable food companies since it announced the plan in March made it 'difficult to complete successfully an offering at the price range stated in the offering prospectus.' RJR Nabisco, which had already revamped the share sale plan once because of the problems faced by its tobacco interests, had planned to sell about 93m shares - 25 per cent of the food division's equity. The parent company would have continued to hold the remaining 75 per cent. The indicated price range for the shares was Dollars 17 to Dollars 19 and, had the shares been sold at the mid-point, the sale would have valued the food division at around Dollars 6.7bn. Last year, the division made an operating profit of Dollars 769m on sales of Dollars 6.7bn. Analysts had suggested that, at Dollars 18, the shares would have been priced at about 14 times prospective 1993 earnings. RJR Nabisco claimed share prices of comparable companies had fallen by some 5 to 15 per cent since March. According to the Dow Jones sector indices, 'worldwide' food shares have fallen by just over 3 per cent since the beginning of March. However, in the US, the sector has declined by about 10 per cent. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank in charge of marketing the issue, said the sale could have been achieved but 'at somewhat below the indicated price range'. It supported the decision not to proceed at a lower price. RJR Nabisco had planned to use the sale proceeds to pay off its debts. These stand at about Dollars 14bn - an overhang from the Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out of the group in 1989. However, Mr Charles Harper's, RJR's new chairman, said that the company saw 'no reason to raise capital in an unfavourable market environment.' The failure to complete the offering is the latest blow for RJR Nabisco. Its tobacco division has been hit by the cigarette price-war and mounting restrictions on smoking in the US. The group also lost Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of the group since the buy-out, to IBM, although it recruited Mr Harper from ConAgra.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Warburg shares fall 36p on warning SG WARBURG, the UK investment bank, yesterday warned that profits in the current half year would fall below those of the preceding six months, due to the continued delay in any upturn in the UK economy, writes Richard Waters. The bank said that profits in the half year to the end of March were expected to fall below the Pounds 89m of the previous six months, but be higher than the Pounds 66m of the second half last year. As a result, profits for the full year are predicted to be between Pounds 155m and Pounds 178m, below some analysts' forecasts at the time the interim results were published last autumn. Commenting on the statement, Mr Michael Gore, finance director, said of the earlier market forecasts: 'At the time, most people hoped the recession would come to an end and business pick up quicker than it has.' There had been no single problem holding back profits, more a general decline in business volumes, he said. The announcement pushed Warburg's shares down from 574p to 538p. The statement was made in connection with a proposed private placement of debt in the US. The bank plans to raise about Dollars 75m (Pounds 43m) of long-term loan capital from institutions, principally insurance companies, in the coming weeks. The ten-year debt will add to the Pounds 200m of long-term debt the bank already has, though at about 20 per cent its gearing remains low compared to its competitors. See Lex</p>

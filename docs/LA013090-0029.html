			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA  </P> <P> Quarterback Michael Wynn of San Fernando High School made an oral commitment  Monday to attend San Diego State University.  </P> <P> Wynn, 6-feet-3, 205-pounds, said he also visited the University of Washington  but cancelled trips to USC and Colorado.  </P> <P> The fact that he has two cousins at SDSU -- redshirt freshmen George Glaze  (defensive line) and Sebastian Glaze (linebacker) -- helped sway him, Wynn  said.  </P> <P> "I had insight into SDSU all season," Wynn said. "That made me feel more  comfortable. I just didn't feel as comfortable at other schools."  </P> <P> Wynn completed 53 of 140 passes (37.8%) last year for 726 yards and four  touchdowns.  </P> <P> MEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> San Diego State won all but the top two singles matches in defeating U.S.  International, 7-2, in a nonconference match at USIU. The Gulls' Yoram Boran  defeated Tole Marinkovic, 7-6, 6-2, in No. 1 singles, and Marc Shumacher downed  Ricardo Herrera, 6-4, 6-0, in No. 2 singles.  </P> <P> Joe McDonough won at No. 3 singles and teamed with Dax Peterson at No. 1  doubles for SDSU, which was playing its opener. USIU fell to 3-2.  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / No such thing as a free treaty: Nafta will not solve the deep-seated structural problems facing the Mexican economy Two months ago, the Cummins Engine company closed down an assembly line in its Mexican subsidiary. With output of the assembled truck engine one-tenth of that in its US factory in Columbus, Indiana, Cummins Mexico could not compete against its US parent, and production was moved north. Since Mexico tore down trade barriers in the mid-1980s, Cummins' subsidiary in Mexico has seen a trade balance in engines with the US turn into a trade deficit of four to one. The company now produces only one heavy engine in Mexico - even this might go when the country's remaining trade barriers are dismantled, says Mr Steve Knaebel, president of of the Mexican subsidiary. US critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, to be voted on by the House of Representatives next Wednesday, say the treaty will encourage US companies to move to Mexico in search of cheap labour. But as the Cummins case shows, Mexico's low productivity makes large parts of its economy vulnerable to competition from the US. 'The US is already competing against countries which have much lower wages than Mexico, while many parts of Mexico's economy are still heavily protected,' says Daniel Oks, a World Bank economist. 'I am not convinced Mexico is well prepared for competition.' He foresees bankruptcies and job losses in sectors that cannot hold their own with US rivals - capital goods, for instance - if Nafta passes. This gloomy view has gained ground as Mexico's economy has stagnated. Gross domestic product grew by just 1.3 per cent in the first half this year, and 23 of the 49 manufacturing sectors tracked by the Inegi, the government statistics institute, were in recession. Even though the economy is sluggish, Mexico is set to run a worryingly high current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP this year. Some Mexican businessmen, who until recently have been almost unanimous in their support for Nafta, have begun to see the treaty's disadvantages. Lorenzo Servitje, a prominent businessman and the billionaire president of Bimbo, Mexico's bread maker, complained at a business conference in Cancun that Mexico's abrupt trade liberalisation 'has not taken into consideration that restructuring must be a gradual process, and has failed to appreciate the limitations of our economic structure'. Under Nafta, Mexico would sacrifice its high protective tariffs, which average about 10.3 per cent, but which are higher on some goods. The average US tariff on Mexican goods is just 4.5 per cent. More significantly, Mexico would open up to free trade and investment certain sectors that have been fully or partially protected from competition for decades - cars and car parts, banks, agriculture, and government procurement, among others. The US economy, with a few minor exceptions, is open to Mexican imports and investment. US critics of the treaty claim Mexico has one significant advantage: low wages. But wages are not as low as some argue, and in dollar terms have been growing faster than productivity. While Mexico's minimum wage is Dollars 4.20 a day, only 16 per cent of workers earn this amount. Average pay plus benefits in manufacturing is Dollars 4.50 an hour, according to government figures. The World Bank has calculated that labour costs in Mexico are about a fifth of those in the US, but that productivity is about a quarter of the US level. Since last year, when the figures were calculated, Mexico's peso has appreciated in real terms. Mr Oks of the World Bank says he doubts that there is any average cost advantage to doing business in Mexico compared with the US. The Mexican government under President Carlos Salinas has pushed strongly for Nafta in the belief that free trade and the new foreign investment drawn by the treaty will raise low productivity levels. New investment and greater efficiency are expected by many economists to be products of the treaty. 'Nafta will reinforce reforms and boost foreign confidence in the Mexican economy. Mexico should continue to be able to attract Dollars 20bn of foreign investment a year without problems,' says Mr Jeffrey Schott, a fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. 'A defeat would lead to a cut in those flows.' Many foreign investors in Mexico's stock and money markets have been betting on Nafta. At close yesterday, the market was up 4.2 per cent on the day, stimulated by renewed optimism over the treaty. But earlier signs that it might be rejected by the US Congress had sent the peso tumbling by almost 4 per cent on Tuesday, thus threatening the government's policy of a strong exchange rate and price stability. Even if Nafta does spur new investment, as many supporters predict, it is unlikely to be evenly spread. Some sectors - cars, parts of the textiles industry, fruit and vegetables, glass - whose productivity levels compare favourably with those in the US, are likely to prove attractive to foreign investors, but others - basic grains such as corn and wheat - are not because they are inefficient and unmodernised. Mexico's biggest competitive disadvantage is the relatively small size of its industrial operations compared with those in the US. Like Cummins, many US companies built factories in Mexico to avoid high tariffs or other trade barriers. But with tariffs on the verge of falling further, some companies have found it makes more sense to export spare capacity from the US rather than to maintain costly plant south of the border. For instance, General Motors announced this year that it was going to move production of the Cavalier car in northern Mexico to Lansing, Michigan, where economies of scale have reduced costs. Quality Coils, a US company that makes electro-magnetic coils, decided in April to move its factory from Ciudad Juarez to Connecticut after it found Mexico's low wages did not offset lower productivity. A further obstacle to Mexican productivity and thus its ability to capitalise on Nafta is its crumbling infrastructure, lack of qualified managers, and untrained workers. 'It's not as simple as wages being one-fifth of those in the US - let's go to Mexico,' says Mr Joseph Donahue, senior vice-president of the US subsidiary of Thomson, the French electronics company. 'You have to ask, 'Can I buy the tools, where are the managers, what are transport costs, and other things?' ' Mr Donahue says it is hard to find a good manager in Mexico, and when you do, 'he will have 10 job offers'. Mr Knaebel, of Cummins, points to truck journeys that take 40-60 per cent longer in Mexico than in the US as a disincentive to foreign investors. While Mexico is building new private toll roads, the cost of the tolls for many businesses is prohibitive. These and other impediments to business - notably high credit costs and an unreliable legal system - may explain why the country has had only limited success in attracting direct foreign investment since liberalising investment regulations in 1989. Since then, Mexico has received a total of Dollars 33.1bn in new investment, but only about half of that has been direct investment in plant and machinery. Much of it has been in the service rather than the export sector. President Salinas proposed Nafta in 1990 to draw foreign money into the country. If the treaty fails, his government will have little choice but to proceed with economic reforms in the faint hope that Mexico will draw the necessary investment from Europe and Japan. The government plans to apply for membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development next spring, and is likely to approve a more liberal foreign investment law later this year. Though the treaty may succeed in persuading US companies to invest in Mexico, competition will prove a nasty jolt for many industries. Deep-seated structural problems will remain, whether or not Nafta passes. Mr Jesus Reyes Heroles, an economist who heads the economic consultancy GEA, says: 'If Nafta does not pass, there will be a problem next year. If it does, the troubles start in 1995.'</p>

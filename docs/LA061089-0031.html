			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY TROOPS FIRE ON BEIJING CROWDS  </P> <P> United States should terminate all relationships with the present fascist  government in China. Those officials are not the legitimate government, they  are ruthless, barbaric butchers. They do not represent the people of China.  </P> <P> The blood of those unarmed students in Tian An Men Square will not be shed in  vain.  </P> <P> The democracy movement in China does not end, it just begins. American people  should stand up and give them moral support in every way we can.  </P> <P> The first thing we can do is to urge our government to stop all the military,  financial, and technical aid until a more humanistic government is seen in  China.  </P> <P> ROGER HSU  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

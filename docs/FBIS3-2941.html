Praising Jiangsu's achievements in various fields of  endeavor, Song Jian stated: During the Spring Festivals I have  spent in Jiangsu over the past two years, I witnessed its rapid  development, which was very heartening. All provincial, city,  county, and township cadres followed a clear ideology, adopted  effective measures, and scored remarkable achievements. The  economy has been thriving in many localities. Last year,  Jiangsu's provincial gross product increased 18.5 percent, or  5.1 percent more than the national growth rate. This remarkable  feat explains the brilliant performance of the provincial party  committee and provincial government. Moreover, Jiangsu adopted  realistic measures in promoting development, such as efforts to  minimize the use of crop lands in establishing economic  development zones. By relying mainly on its resources, cadres,  and people, Jiangsu has taken its own road of development with  distinctive Chinese characteristics.    Song Jian discussed agriculture at length. He said: By the  CPC's centenary in the next century, our population will  probably reach 1.6 to 1.7 billion. To feed such a large  population, we must increase the output of grain and farm  products by 50 percent over the current level, thereby catching  up with intermediate developed countries. To this end, we must  imbue ourselves with a sense of urgency in developing  agriculture. Due to various reasons, we did not pay sufficient  attention to agricultural science research. From now on, we  must further uphold the policy of relying on policies first,  investments second, and science and technology third when  developing agriculture. Governments at all levels should give  top priority to agricultural basic research and development, and  should increase investments in these areas. This will be  crucial to scaling new heights in agricultural production over  the next few years. Only a developed agriculture can support  the nation and maintain sustained development and stability.    Underscoring the importance of popularizing agricultural  science and technology, Song Jian added: We must grasp the work  with two hands. On the one hand, we should allocate all-level  financial resources to steadily popularize agricultural science  and technology; on the other, we should develop and nurture new  mechanisms for popularizing science and technology through  innovations by the masses and in line with the requirements of a  socialist market economy. He praised some localities for  popularizing science and technology through integrating  production, supply, and marketing; establishing associations of  special trades; and introducing share-holding cooperative  systems.    Discussing ways for implementing large-scale management in  rural areas, Song Jian stated: We should encourage  diversification and multi-polarization instead of practicing a  single mode and demanding uniformity. On the issue of  readjusting farm product prices, he said: Rural prosperity  depends to a large extent on the prices of farm products.  However, in the long run price hikes alone cannot promote  prosperity. At the core of the issue is to increase rural labor  productivity. All sectors of society should make more  contributions to promoting high-tech in rural areas in order to  facilitate the production of high industrial goods and gradual  agricultural modernization.</p>

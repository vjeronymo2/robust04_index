			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever With the benefit of hindsight Unilever's chairman Sir Michael Angus might have chosen another year in which to unveil valedictory results. Recessionary scars on both sides of the Atlantic were obviously reflected in yesterday's 1 per cent pre-tax profits and 4 per cent earnings advance in calendar 1991. Even so, the 1 per cent underlying volume increase looks a touch pedestrian set beside Nestle and BSN. No doubt the market's response in marking Unilever's shares 3 per cent lower was compounded by publication of one of the gloomiest US consumer confidence indicators since the mid-1970s. What really stands out is the company's formidable balance sheet strength. Net debt was nearly Pounds 3bn in mid-1990, but with the 4P packaging company proceeds and promised sale of the agricultural businesses, plus a continuing working capital squeeze, that figure could be not far above Pounds 1bn by the end of the year. A lower interest bill ought to maintain the profits momentum in the absence of an upturn. European margins, meanwhile, already boosted a point or so by the sale of poor performing oil milling, paper and agricultural merchanting businesses, are set to reach double figures with the cost-cutting benefits of the single market programme. Given the huge medium-term potential the shares are well worth holding for an earnings multiple just 5 per cent higher than the market average.</p>

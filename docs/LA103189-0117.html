			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN GETS 16 LIFE TERMS IN ISRAELI BUS DEATHS  </P> <P> A 23-year-old Palestinian was sentenced Monday to 16 life terms in prison for  killing 16 people, including an American and two Canadians, when he forced a  crowded passenger bus off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway.  </P> <P> The attack July 6 was the bloodiest in the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising in  the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the sentence imposed on Abdel Hadi  Ghanem was one of the stiffest in Israel's history.  </P> <P> Ghanem, 23, was sentenced to life in prison for each of the deaths in the bus  attack. He also received 20 years for each of the 24 passengers wounded in the  attack.  </P> <P> The sentences are to be served concurrently.  </P> <P> Chief Prosecutor Uzi Hasson said there is no parole for murder sentences and  that Ghanem could only be freed if the Israeli president intervened on his  behalf.  </P> <P> The victims of the bus attack included the only American to die in the  uprising, lawyer Rita Levine, 39, of Philadelphia. Two other victims were  Canadians, Fern Rykiss, 17, of Winnipeg, and Shelley Halpenny, 32, of  Vancouver.  </P> <P> Ghanem, who was injured in the incident, said he carried out the attack to  avenge a friend paralyzed by soldiers in a clash near his home in the Gaza  Strip's Nusseirat refugee camp.  </P> <P> The attack by Ghanem prompted several days of revenge attacks by Jews on Arabs  in Jerusalem and other cities.  </P> <P> Also Monday, newspapers said the army will soon begin using observation  balloons equipped with cameras to keep track of protests and disturbances  related to the uprising.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Building societies feel the squeeze: David Barchard on conflicting pressures that have brought unusually narrow margins YESTERDAY seemed, on the face of it, an odd time to be making a cut in savings rates. The savings market is shrinking and building societies have been complaining for months that they have been losing business to National Savings. But as Mr Mike Whitehouse, operations director of Halifax, the largest society, announced an average 0.35 percentage point cut in the savings rates he said: 'The alternative was just not realistic.' Building societies saw a Pounds 314m net outflow of funds in June and they fared even worse in July. The figures will not be published for another fortnight but are expected to show a net outflow of about Pounds 450m, leaving a net outflow of about Pounds 105m for the first seven months of this year. National Savings has easily outstripped building society receipts in every month except January. The pressure on societies is compounded by the fact that many people are repaying debt rather than saving. Mr David Barnes, finance director of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, said: 'We are all chasing just a little money around.' In this situation societies would normally improve their rates to investors to attract more business and pass on the cost to mortgage customers. On Tuesday Skipton, the 14th largest society, tried to do this but the larger societies would not follow. Since February building societies and Abbey National, the retail bank which was formerly a society, have been holding standard mortgage rates about 50 basis points above the London Inter-bank Offered Rate. A few years ago many societies would have considered that their rates to borrowers should be at least one full percentage point, and perhaps even two, above Libor. The present unusually narrow margin was introduced by Abbey National in February as a sort of discount to borrowers in the hope of reviving the housing market. Such a tight rate not only squeezes profits but reduces the amount of income societies can put aside against their unprecedentedly high levels of bad debts. Six months later there is no sign of a market revival but the large societies feel strongly that rates to borrowers should not go up. One reason is that they have recently prevailed on the government to lower National Savings rates - not once but twice. The unspoken quid pro quo was that mortgage rates would stay down, and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which had announced a mortgage rate rise, withdrew it smartly. Halifax said: 'Increasing rates to borrowers is just not realistic, partly because we want to encourage a housing market recovery and secondly because we want to make continued progress in dealing with arrears and serious arrears.' Any rise in lending rates would have been modest but societies say it would have made it even more difficult to manage the accounts of about 305,000 mortgage customers with arrears of more than six months. Mr Donald Kirkham, group chief executive of Woolwich, the third largest society, said: 'Raising mortgage rates by say 0.5 per cent may not look very onerous but even an additional payment of perhaps Pounds 8 a month could be the last straw for some people.' The savings outflow is a problem which the larger societies can live with. Their liquidity is mostly good and their mortgage business is about 60 per cent of what it was two years ago. They can turn to the wholesale money markets to fund these reduced volumes and rely on the growth of retail deposits from accrued interest. Some large lenders even say they can live with the narrow margins between saving and lending rates. Mr John Bayliss, Abbey National retail oper-ations director, said: 'We have no intention of cutting our savings rates as things stand. We do not need to do so.' Things look rather different for small societies. They have to woo savers hard to stay in business. They are less able to tap commercial money markets and are reliant on volatile deposits from savers with a high net worth who shift money quickly when a better rate is available elsewhere. In recognition of this, Halifax yesterday tapered the reductions in its investment rates to favour customers with deposits of more than Pounds 50,000. The building society world has until now been used to a fairly tidy and uniform interest rate structure. What has emerged in the last week looks anything but uniform. There are clear signs of polarisation between the large societies and smaller ones. As to whether the new rates are sustainable, Mr Kirkham said: 'It all depends on how we fare in the savings market in the next few months. If societies do not get the inflow of savings that they need, then there will have to be a change eventually.' THE INLAND REVENUE is to launch a probe of individuals claiming to be non-taxpayers and receiving interest gross from banks and building societies, after discovering that up to a million of them are liable for tax, Andrew Jack writes. Investigators have found that up to 14 per cent of the 7m individuals who have registered to receive interest gross earn income in excess of their tax-free allowances. The audit of claimants by tax inspectors has been triggered by market research backed up by internal investigations and approaches to individuals claiming to be non-taxpayers and receiving gross interest at levels close to their allowances. The revenue yesterday played down the possibility of widespread deliberate fraud. It said: 'We think that mostly this is a case of people misunderstanding the rules.' Individuals whom investigators conclude have deliberately falsely registered could be liable for fines of up to Pounds 3,000 and penalties up to the value of the tax they should have paid.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Canadian killed in Bosnia A CANADIAN peacekeeper was killed yesterday when an anti-tank round hit his armoured vehicle in central Bosnia shortly after another ceasefire came into force throughout the republic, Our Foreign Staff writes. Bosnian Croat leaders meanwhile said some 2,000 Croats had been killed in recent fighting against Moslems in central Bosnia. Fighting was reported yesterday even after the truce, brokered by the UN among the three warring factions, went into effect at noon. In New York, the United Nations Security Council voted last night to deploy 7,600 troops, backed by air power, to provide protection in six designated 'safe areas' in Bosnia, including the capital Sarajevo. The council also authorised the deployment of 300 Americans to Macedonia to help prevent fighting in nearby Bosnia from spreading. The vote on both deployments was 15-0. EC foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Bosnia tomorrow, the eve of the EC summit in Copenhagen. The talks were called after Lord Owen, the EC mediator, said he needed new guidelines after the collapse of the Vance-Owen peace plan.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Keating puts his stamp on cabinet AUSTRALIA'S Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, is expected to promote several backbenchers and junior ministers in a wide-ranging government reshuffle to be announced today. Meanwhile, Mr John Hewson, whose Liberal/National party alliance was unexpectedly trounced by Labor in the March 13 poll, early today beat off a challenge to his Liberal party leadership. He defeated Mr John Howard, a former leader, by 47 votes to 30. In Mr Keating's reshuffle, up to 12 ministers are likely to be replaced and several others moved as the prime minister stamps his authority on the government in the wake of his unexpected election victory. The prime minister is also expected to announce changes to the structure of the government by merging departments and replacing or moving senior public servants. Changes are expected to include the appointment of Mr Ted Evans, Australia's representative on the International Monetary Fund, to replace Mr Tony Cole, the Treasury head. The most prominent ministerial casualty is likely to be Mr John Kerin, trade minister, who was demoted by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, after a lacklustre spell as treasurer in 1991. Several other ministers face the sack, while Mr Keating's freedom of action has been increased by the retirement from parliament of a number of senior ministers. Mr Neal Blewett, social security minister, and two other senior ministers who contested the election have since volunteered to return to the back benches. The only minister certain to retain his post is Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, who was appointed by Mr Keating shortly after he replaced Mr Hawke in 1991. But Mr Keating has resisted pressure to give Mr Dawkins the additional job of deputy prime minister, currently held by Mr Brian Howe, health minister. Senator Graham Richardson, a former minister who resigned last year after allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges, is expected to return to the government.</p>

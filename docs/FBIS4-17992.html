			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Itogi" newscast: Video report from Kazakhstan by </F> Aleksandr Gerasimov]    [Text] [Gerasimov] "Zone of consequences of the politics  of the absurd" -- this is probably the most apt description of  the stationing locations of Strategic Missile Forces units in  Kazakhstan. This is the fourth year since the disintegration of  the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the nuclear republics have  still not reached agreement on the division of nuclear weapons.  These weapons, used as a deterrent until recently, are being  turned into an instrument of political blackmail. Those who  stand to lose from this are our own security, and the thousands  of servicemen serving in the missile forces.    Formally, anything located on Kazakhstani territory belongs  to Kazakhstan. At the same time, Alma-Ata [Almaty] has acceded  to the offensive arms reduction treaty and does not regard  itself as the owner of nuclear missiles. However, as a result  of the cooling of relations between Kazakhstan and Russia, which  followed the rejection of Nazarbayev's concept of the ruble  zone, nobody is currently able to clearly define the nuclear  weapons' status.    The nuclear weapons concerned are 104 of the world's most  powerful strategic missiles -- the SS-18 -- deployed in two  divisions on the territory of Kazakhstan. The prevailing view  is that these are Russian divisions. However, unlike in other  armies, no state flag is flying above the headquarters.  Admittedly, the main orders and the wages come from Moscow.  Both the officers who have sworn allegiance to Russia, and the  men who have taken the Kazakhstani oath and whose knowledge of  Russian is poor, but who serve under Russian service  regulations, are being paid in Russian rubles.    [Unidentified Russian officer addressing servicemen] No. 12  Platoon don gas masks!    [Gerasimov] At the same time, Alma-Ata is also issuing  menacing orders. Their implementation has resulted in the  accumulation at nuclear bases of an impermissibly large number  of warheads which have come to the end of their guaranteed  service life.    [Akhmet Khashchegulgov, missile division commander] The  accumulation of nuclear warheads in the missile division is in  excess of the set norms. This is primarily the result of a  decision by the leadership of the Republic of Kazakhstan banning  the removal of nuclear warheads, missiles, missile fuel  components, and other types of hardware from the territory of  Kazakhstan.    [Gerasimov] According to our information from the Russian  Government, the explanation for this stance adopted by Alma-Ata  is President Nazarbayev's intention during his upcoming visit to  Moscow to demand compensation for the highly enriched uranium  contained in nuclear charges. In addition, strategic missiles  offer a good bargaining chip in the political horse-trading  between the two states whose relations are far from  straightforward.    Officers here take the view that nuclear safety can be  guaranteed only if their divisions are given the status of  Russian military bases. For some reason, they believe here that  this will be resolved during the upcoming meeting between  Yeltsin and Nazarbayev.    Perhaps when this meeting has taken place, the local  Kazakhstani authorities will stop cutting off the electricity  and water supply to the military garrisons. In that case  officers' children will no longer have to freeze in schools and  kindergartens, and the officers on duty will no longer have to  struggle to maintain the survivability of the nuclear missiles.  Commanders will be able to find the money needed to repair heat  supply networks, and the pipes for this work will no longer have  to be flown in from Moscow.    To Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kryukov and Major Vasiliy  Salashnov, who are on alert duty deep down under ground, empty  shelves in the garrison's stores are nothing new. Just like  their comrades, they are constantly ready to implement orders.  Nonetheless, most of the officers are dreaming about returning  to Russia where conditions of service are more comfortable.  Many of them remain in Kazakhstan only because of speedier  promotion and because 12 months of service counts for 18 months  here.    Meanwhile, certain circumstances seem to indicate that  Kazakhstan's leadership is not really seeking to improve  relations with Russia. So, for example, a strategic  installation -- a Kazakhstani air defense unit located near the  missile division at Derzhavinsk -- is completely snowed under.  When the Kazakhstani air defense troops were still Soviet  troops they protected the nuclear missiles from air attacks.  Now the station is deserted.    A Kazakhstani-U.S. joint venture for extracting high-grade  metals from missile silos, which are being taken out of service,  is being set up in Alma-Ata. It appears that the Kazakhstanis  trust Moscow less and less. The Russian authorities, in turn,  are taking no steps toward a rapprochement with Kazakhstan.</p>

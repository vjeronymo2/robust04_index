			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W in CDollars 35m phone sale to Call-Net CABLE AND Wireless has sold its Canadian long-distance telephone business to its chief competitor, Call-Net Enterprises of Toronto. Call-Net paid about CDollars 35m (Pounds 19.6m) cash. Cable and Wireless Canada had revenues of about CDollars 75m a year from 7,000 customers, mostly small and mid-sized businesses. Mr Robert Watson, executive vice-president, said the company would now focus on securing the international business of large Canadian telecommunications users for the group's subsidiaries in other parts of the world. C&amp;W recently forged a link with BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, the country's biggest phone company. BCE now has a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications, a C&amp;W subsidiary. Prior to the sale, Cable Canada was among the largest of the country's 'resellers' of telephone lines. By leasing lines in bulk from the established phone utilities and setting up their own networks, the resellers are able to offer substantial discounts on long-distance calls. The resellers as a group have garnered 6.5 per cent of the market since regulators opened access to them in 1990. Mr Watson said, however, that business was 'very competitive' among a highly fragmented group of suppliers. The deal firmly establishes Call-Net as the dominant reseller. Call-Net said yesterday that the acquisition and a smaller one completed last week gives it about 15,000 customers and annual revenues of CDollars 175m. It now claims to have a larger market share than all of its competitors combined.</p>

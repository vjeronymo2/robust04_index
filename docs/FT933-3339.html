			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nervous selling sends gold price to 4 1/2 -month low THE GOLD market continued on its downward spiral yesterday taking the London bullion market price to its lowest level since mid-April. Dealers attributed the Dollars 5.60 fall to Dollars 344.25 a troy ounce to technical pressure. They said the breach of a support level at Dollars 348 an ounce had unleashed a fresh wave of selling. Some thought the market would soon be steadied by a return of physical demand, signs of which were discerned last week. But Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at T. Hoare and Compnay, said yesterday there appeared to be no follow-through to recent Far Eastern buying. She also noted that the bargain-hunting that lifted the price after the Dollars 12.60 plunge last Wednesday and Thursday had quickly dried up. On the other hand there was as yet no sign of 'short' sellers trying to force the market lower, Ms O'Connel said. 'The latest selling seems to have been liquidation.' She did not rule out yesterday's breach of the Dollars 345-an-ounce mark encouraging a test of support at Dollars 340, but suggested: 'At prices below Dollars 350 gold represents good long term value'. 'The physical market, so strong at the start of the year, naturally weakened as prices rose,' Ms O'Connell explained in a market report issued at the end of last week. 'There are early signs of revival, but as yet the upturn has little momentum.' Meanwhile: 'The speed of downward spikes has been exacerbated by the triggering of stops (stop-loss selling orders) on the futures market, which has more than once left would-be sellers in the lurch as the market sailed away from them.' This had left an overhang of potential investment fund sales, she said, 'and the market is still nervous in the short term'. Looking further ahead, however, Ms O'Connell saw the prospect of an upturn in demand from jewellers in the 'Christmas stocking season'. 'Very few (jewellers) are hedged on the long side,' she said. 'There will be strong demand for bullion as the season starts.'</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / CMN offer for Swans disappoints receiver The French company hoping to take over Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, yesterday came up with a last-minute proposal for its conditional purchase. Soffia/Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie (CMN) said it believed its new offer, under which it would immediately begin paying Swans' design staff to enable the company to tender for work, would provide a way to secure the future of the yard. But joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield of Price Waterhouse described the latest proposal as disappointing, and said it appeared markedly less attractive, not only for the receiver, but for the remaining 660 employees. Under the new offer, he said, there appeared to be little job security for the majority of the workforce. It was also further below Swans' Pounds 7.2m break-up value: CMN had taken the opportunity to reduce its offer both financially and qualitatively. 'It should be recalled that in the eyes of the receiver the previous offer was, at best, threadbare,' added Mr Horsfield. Price Waterhouse has lifted its deadline of today for the dismissal of Swans' 100-strong design and technical team to allow time to consider the revised offer. A new deadline of September 9 has been imposed in the hope that negotiations will bring an improvement, but Mr Horsfield warned: 'I certainly feel we are reaching the end of the line with Soffia/CMN.' He said the receivers would be talking to other parties who had expressed an interest in Swans. It was possible one might make a 'late run' but he added: 'I wouldn't want anybody to build a lot of false hopes on that.' CMN previously proposed it would take on Swans' existing Ministry of Defence frigates contract, and sub-contract the work to the receiver, using the balance of money to pay the design team's Pounds 200,000 wage bill until the end of the year. This plan was halted by a deadlock over price with the MoD. CMN will not buy Swans unless it has two years' workload. Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of CMN Support Services in the UK, said the latest conditional proposal included Pounds 5m for Swans' assets. He did not agree that the new offer was poorer for the workforce. He said the question of whether there would be redundancies after Swans' last frigate left in November was one for the receiver. 'It's our view a lay-off scheme should be utilised,' he said. Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, welcomed news of a new offer from CMN. However, unions at Swans, which will meet the receiver today, reacted cautiously. Mr Dick Gonsalez, union leader, said they would only discuss terms and conditions with CMN once it owned the business. At a meeting with union leaders yesterday Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, agreed to write to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Freeman urging them to be constantly involved with matters at Swans.</p>

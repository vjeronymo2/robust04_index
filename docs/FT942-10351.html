			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Lenders argue for credit where it's due: The debate over whether card use counts as borrowing The treatment of credit card 'debt' in the official credit figures is distorting the way consumer borrowing is calculated and presented, the leading research group on credit-card transactions has said. Earlier this week the Central Statistical Office issued credit figures apparently showing that the prospect of April's tax rises did not dent consumer confidence in March. Net credit levels were at a 58-month high and - more remarkably - new lending figures reached a record with about Pounds 5.2bn worth of credit being advanced in March - apparently beating even the heady surges of the 1980s. The problem is one of definition. Imagine you spend Pounds 1,000 on your credit card. You intend to repay it when the tally comes in at the end of the month, and in recent months you have always cleared your credit card bill in full. Does this sale mean you are Pounds 1,000 in debt? According to the Central Statistical Office the answer is 'yes'. The CSO's long-established practice is to include credit-card transactions in its monthly figures which show levels of net borrowing and new consumer lending. In recent months the Credit Card Research Group has been lobbying the CSO to change this way of compiling the statistics. It argues that with more than 50 per cent of consumers now paying credit-card bills in full each month, many consumers are using their cards as a means of payment rather than as a borrowing tool. The research group says that an unusually high number of processing days may have accounted for some of the surge reported by the CSO. And the CSO itself admits that the figures should be regarded with caution, not least because about Pounds 3bn of the new credit was accounted for by credit cards in the Mastercard and Visa systems. The CSO says: 'The high figure partly reflects the increased volumes of transactions and number of credit cards - there are simply more credit cards around.' It argues that credit card transactions still need to be included in lending figures because the level of outstanding credit-card debt represents about 20 per cent of the total outstanding consumer borrowing. 'We can't just ignore that,' it says. But the Credit Card Research Group believes that because the unpaid debt represents only part of credit-card turnover, equating credit cards with the other components in the figures, such as motor finance or bank loans, is confusing. Mr Peter Welch, the group's head of research, says: 'Only some two-thirds of credit-card outstandings incur interest charges and thus represent genuine borrowings.' This figure has fluctuated in recent years, rising to 70 per cent in 1984 and falling to 59 per cent in 1990. The CSO is meeting the Credit Card Research Group to consider ways of modifying the system. But as the CSO is already involved in debate about how 'broad' or 'narrow' credit measures should be, Mr Welch admits that a solution is unlikely to be found rapidly. This suggests the issue is likely to remain simply one more example of the problems statisticians face in responding to new payment systems as fast as consumers.</p>

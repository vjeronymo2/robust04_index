			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: Once more unto the breach - In the first in a series, FT writers ask if the new confidence of US industrialists is hiding America's competitive weaknesses Just three years ago, something seemed fundamentally wrong with the industrial heart of the US. Vital markets such as cars and electronics were being lost to the Japanese. Auto industry chiefs trooped over to Tokyo to complain. Tariffs were slapped on Japanese imports of semiconductors. The popular novelist Michael Crichton wrote a best-seller, Rising Sun, portraying the US as the supine victim of a business massacre. But if business is war, the Americans now seem to be winning it. The Detroit carmakers have made a comeback. The world of high-tech electronics is dominated by US companies such as Intel and Microsoft. Japanese industry is in trouble back home. After a nasty period of doubt, America's self-image is intact. The obvious question asserts itself. The US was wrong to be so pessimistic before. Is it overdoing the optimism now? The answer depends a good deal on who you talk to. The big manufacturers are mostly convinced the change is real. The 1980s, they say, were Japan's decade. Japanese manufacturers enjoyed a booming and largely protected domestic market, virtually interest-free finance and long product cycles that favoured large volumes and aggressive pricing. Now Japanese markets are static or shrinking. The collapse of the Tokyo stock market means the cost of capital in Japan is about the same as elsewhere. At the same time, international pressure has forced Japan to open its markets to more foreign competition. Also, say US industrialists, Japanese corporations tend to be culturally rigid and structurally monolithic. This makes them very powerful when moving along predictable paths. But in the fast-moving world of the 1990s, products and technologies are changing much more swiftly than before. This favours the American genius for improvisation rather than the Japanese juggernaut. Take the Japanese system of consensus management, whereby everyone has to agree to a decision before it is acted on. Mr Ed Zschau, president of IBM's storage products division, says: 'That system works really well when you have a long life cycle for products. But when you have a very short, fast cycle, you have to give more responsibility to individuals.' Above all, Japan's strength lay historically in two crucial disciplines: quality of product, and efficiency in manufacturing. Now, the argument runs, America has caught up. Mr Harvey Jones, head of Synopsys, a Californian software company, says: 'The Japanese were a source of the idea that quality is a measurement of value. We spent 20 years marvelling at that, and saying that if we didn't adopt it we would be consumed by it. In the end, people realised you either had to buy into the quality revolution or die.' US companies seem to have chosen the former option. Mr John Young, lately retired as head of Hewlett-Packard and an adviser on competitiveness to President Clinton, says: 'I give US manufacturers pretty high marks since the mid-1980s for getting to grips with their problems. If you took a tour of factories today, you would find the ideas of total quality management and process re-engineering have become deeply embedded and well executed in a very broad range of companies.' The US, it appears, has learnt Japan's secrets. To get back in the game, Japan needs to learn the kind of creative skills traditionally associated with the US, and Silicon Valley in particular. 'The Japanese have seen the religion of creativity, just as we've seen the religion of total quality management,' says Mr Jones. 'But the cultural factors inhibiting them are much more powerful. Total quality management is a mechanical process. You have to understand it, engineer it and instil it in your organisation, and none of that is trivial. But it's not rocket science. Creative thinking is much more deep-seated.' If US industry seems convinced that the future is rosy, US economists are a good deal less sure. Competitiveness, they say, is only a means to an end: raising the population's standard of living. America may have improved its performance in external markets, but the fact remains that real incomes have been static for the past 20 years. The chief reason for that is poor productivity growth, averaging less than 1 per cent a year over the same period. There has been a big revival in manufacturing productivity in the past few years. Productivity in the service sector, however, seems scarcely to have grown, even if in absolute terms it remains higher than in Europe or Japan. Besides, manufactured goods account for only some 20 per cent of the US economy. Only 40 per cent of those manufactures are traded internationally. In other words, goods competing in world markets make up less than a tenth of the economy. There is also the question of how these gains in manufacturing productivity have been achieved. Mr Fred Bergsten, head of the government-backed Competitiveness Policy Council, says productivity growth in manufacturing has been improving for six or seven years now. 'But a lot of that is through down-sizing and lay-offs. That is not a satisfactory outcome for the economy. It's essential, and I'm not knocking it, but it's not enough. You also need economic growth if you're going to create jobs.' Mr Stephen Roche, of the Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley, goes further. US industry, he says, has adopted a 'slash and burn' mentality. 'I believe we're getting overly fixated on cost-cutting as a means of boosting short-term gains,' he says. 'The gratification for shareholders is swift, but if you get hooked on cutting, you hollow out your ability to compete in the long term. I worry that when the world recovers and the party is held, we may not have enough people to party.' The argument is hotly disputed by some industrialists. It assumes, they say, that productivity improvement is a finite process. In fact, there has been a revolution in US work practices - particularly among large companies - which makes the scope for improvement practically limitless. Above all, they say, the trick is to involve the entire workforce, from the worker on the shop floor to the production director, in thinking up ways to improve effectiveness. Mr William Marx, head of manufacturing at the telecommunications giant AT&amp;T, says: 'One of the real differentiators is whether you can get your employees engaged. We've worked awfully hard on that at AT&amp;T, and it's a real source of competitive advantage.' On one point, industrialists and economists are united. International competition means Japan - and thereafter emerging nations such as Korea, Taiwan and above all China - but not Europe. Industry in Europe is universally dismissed as idle, hidebound and trapped in an old-fashioned system of social support. Those industrialists who follow European affairs regard with astonishment such recent events as Air France's capitulation to its unions or Volkswagen's move to part-time working. On the other hand, they are careful to give Japan its due. Indeed, having been convicted of complacency in the 1970s and early 1980s - and having been badly scared as a result - they now seem almost superstitious in their eagerness to praise their opponents. Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric, says: 'We are students of Japan here in GE. We think they're marvellous, marvellous industrialists. We like their new product development, we like their speed, we like their quality focus. I put them at the pinnacle, and we're working every day to learn everything we can from them.' Mr James Cannavino, IBM's senior vice-president for strategy and development, says: 'They're relentless. Relentless. If you tell them the mountain is this high, and they have to run up it, they run up it. If you say, 'I'm sorry, but it's 10 times the height', they don't say 'hey, that wasn't the deal' - they run up that too.' This attitude may prove not merely healthy but essential. In some areas, the US advantage may prove temporary, based on nothing more fundamental than the cyclical weakness of the Japanese economy and the strength of the yen. In the auto industry, for instance, there is an uneasy awareness that the long-term growth market is probably not the US or Europe, but the Asia-Pacific region. 'If that turns out to be true,' says Mr Wayne Booker, Ford's head of international operations, 'the Japanese are sitting in the catbird seat.' Autos apart, the US is being inexorably drawn into the world arena by the growth of world trade. Mr Bergsten says: 'If you look at exports plus imports in goods and services, that's now equivalent to 25 per cent of America's gross national product. That's identical to Japan and the EC. In the past 20 years that ratio has doubled for us, whereas for Europe and Japan it hasn't changed. The US has joined the world, and now has to worry much more about the international dimension of its economic performance.' In any case, Mr Bergsten argues, competitiveness is not merely a matter of the trade balance. 'You have to look at productivity, the national standard of living, the fundamental stuff that makes up the domestic economy. That doesn't look so good.' Thus, the critics repeat, productivity growth for the whole economy is still unsatisfactory. In addition, investment as a proportion of GNP is still very low. So are savings. And - a recurrent theme among the doubters - the average real wage in America is at least 10 per cent lower than it was 20 years ago. The picture is less bad if non-wage benefits are included. Even so, total compensation over 20 years seems to have been broadly static. Another vital component of competitiveness is human capital, or the quality of education. The worry here is not the American universities, which have a deservedly high reputation. 'We have this terrific higher education system,' Mr Bergsten says. 'It's a big profit centre, a competitive part of America. We export Dollars 6bn worth of education services a year. But people forget that only one out of four Americans makes it through college' (that is, completes a degree). The real problem, he argues, comes in the schools. 'The statistical results of the American primary and secondary school system are unimproved from 30 years ago, and may be worse. They are lagging more and more behind every other country for which comparable data are compiled: not just industrial countries, but Hungary, Korea and some developing countries.' This raises another fundamental aspect of the competitiveness debate: how far will the US have to compete with the third world by settling for third-world living standards? Everyone you talk to in the US would reject this as unacceptable. But part of the problem is the very technology which the US has done so much to pioneer. In a world in which communications are bringing the true global corporation ever nearer, the threat to the US may come not from foreign competition, but from US companies moving their plants to eastern Europe or their software research to India. Mr Daniel Burton, president of the Council on Competitiveness (an independent think-tank unrelated to the Competitiveness Policy Council), says: 'The US can't run an economy on industries and services where you're not competing with third-world economies on some level. For the first time, a China or a Bangladesh can combine third-world wages with state-of-the-art technology. It's not that hard. The stuff's around, an investor picks it up and sticks a plant there. We have to compete with that.' The effects of all this on the American psychology are not easy to gauge. Again, it comes back to standard of living. The American tradition is based on the expectation of rising wealth. Large parts of the population are now faced with the reality of being poorer than their parents, or even their grandparents. The price of industrial competitiveness may thus be the lowering of expectations, not only for wages but for working hours and conditions. In the US, the lesson is proving painful. Europe, for the most part, has yet to confront it. Mr Welch of GE puts the point bluntly: 'The world's changing. People in the US and Europe aren't going to live the way they do 100 years from now unless they do a lot of things differently. Who says that because we have 240m people on this big piece of land we should have two cars and second homes, while 800m people in India and 1bn in China should live the way they live? We've only been wealthy in this country for 70 years. Who said we ought to have all this? Is it ordained?'</p>

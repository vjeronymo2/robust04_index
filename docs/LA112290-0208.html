			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SILENCE GOLDEN FOR OLD SOUND SYSTEM  </P> <P> City Council members had begun discussing a proposal to repair the failing  audio system in their meeting chambers when the sound system itself seemingly  lobbied for the item.  </P> <P> The glitch-ridden system went dead.  </P> <P> Unaided by amplification, council members were forced to shout their comments  and questions to city staff members about the proposed repairs.  </P> <P> And, soon after the council unanimously agreed to spend $6,380 requested for  the improvements, the sound system kicked on again.  </P> <P> Actually, the latest audio system letdown was not related to the problems for  which the interim repairs were recommended, said Walter Eby, the city's  engineering supervisor in charge of the system. After a City Hall power failure  had ended, electricity to the facility returned but the sound system didn't,  Eby said.  </P> <P> "We finally turned up that there was a sticky regulator in the back," he said.  </P> <P> But, at least for the sake of appearances, the timely sound outage spotlighted  the chronic problems of the system, which both amplifies voices in the council  chambers and broadcasts them for cable television.  </P> <P> New wiring parts will be purchased to temporarily restore the system to a  reliable state, eliminating most of the crackling noises and intermittent sound  interruption that has plagued it, he said.  </P> <P> An engineering consultant has recommended that the city install a $20,000  wireless system to replace the existing one. And, although cumulative repairs  on the current system are approaching that figure, the council has not yet  agreed to buy a new system.JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

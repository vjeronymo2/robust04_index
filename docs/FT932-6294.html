			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (6): Moving picture has slowed down  -Prospects for the troubled property sector GEOLOGISTS tell us the southern UK is gradually sinking into the sea while the north rises higher each year. The property market has finally adopted the same motion after resisting for the last couple of centuries. Rents have collapsed in the south, dragged down by the the contracting service sector. They have not escaped north of the Wash, but the decline is less sharp. In other words, the pressure to flee high occupation costs around London has eased. A great surge of relocation out of the south-east slowed last year and looks like drying up before long. But more than 'cost-push' factors are involved. Anyone looking to move has to shed their old building, an almost intractable problem when few replacement tenants are taking space. Fewer than two dozen companies moved out of central London last year taking just under 11,000 jobs, according to Jones Lang Wootton's annual office decentralisation survey. That compares with 36 in 1991, the peak for relocations. Only nine are scheduled to follow them this year and five between 1994-96. The picture could change, of course. Property costs were the main reason for most moves and southern rents may rise again as the economy recovers. But that seems unlikely in the near future with so much empty space on the market. The government may also begin another surge of reorganisation. Political decisions to disperse civil servants into the provinces accounted for almost 40 per cent of last year's relocations compared with less than 20 per cent in 1991. But the Treasury appears to have decided London is the best value for its charges. English Heritage and the Prison Service have both cancelled moves, while the Ministry of Defence has juggled the number of posts involved. Other current relocations might also have come to a stop if they had not progressed so far. Plans were drawn up at a time when space was short, rents high and labour scarce around the south-east. That is one reason why companies were tending to move much longer distances. By last year only 35 per cent were within the region compared with almost 80 per cent in the previous decade. Big movers in 1992 included Eagle Star to Gloucestershire, the Departments of Social Security and Health to Leeds, National Grid to Coventry, Nationwide Building Society to Swindon and the British Library to North Yorkshire. The taxman, true to reputation, was everywhere. Moves were organised to Cardiff, East Kilbride, Salford, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, according to JLW Research. The top central London rent today is quoted by JLW at Pounds 37 a sq ft, around half that during the boom. Even that is optimistic, as there is plenty of space that owners would consider unloading at around Pounds 25 a sq ft - plus incentives such as rent-free periods. 'That might still look expensive compared with Pounds 12 in Newcastle,' says Jean Crawford, senior relocations consultant at JLW. 'But it still may not compensate for the cost of moving.' The CBI quotes an average of Pounds 24,000 to move each worker - although that could rise as high as Pounds 40,000 when including incentives such as guaranteed home-purchase packages. The chancellor did not help matters by slapping a limit on tax allowances for such incentives in the budget. It was all very different during the boom. 'Rents in leading provincial centres ran at about 20 per cent of London costs through most of the Eighties,' says Peter Evans, head of research at Debenham Thorpe. 'Then they jumped rapidly to 70 per cent, reducing the incentive to move.' This was partly due to a catching-up process as some provincial prices doubled, but mainly because London crashed so quickly and so far. Now everyone is feeling the cold. Rents in the regions fell by almost 16 per cent in the 12 months to March, says Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, with only Southampton and Aberdeen showing any uplift. In the same period, however, London dropped far more, narrowing the financial gap. In the first three months of 1993 rents have stabilised in some places but continued to fall in the south. Will decentralisation bounce back as the economy recovers? In theory it should, as relocation is highest at times of expansion, when firms need more or better space and find it hard to attract staff. But rents in London are likely to lag the general economic revival because of the surplus space available. 'Cost differentials between central London and the provincial office markets are unlikely to start widening until the mid-1990s at the earliest,' says the JLW report. That does not mean moves will not happen. Short hops are by far the biggest component in relocation but statistics are almost impossible to find unless companies cross local authority boundaries. 'Despite the high profile accorded to major, long-distance moves, the great majority of organisations relocate within the same town or city,' says Mr Evans. Nowadays they are motivated more by the chance to pick up new premises at rock-bottom prices. Every agent from Croydon to Carlisle will tell you that the only business is coming from tenants within spitting distance of the space they are offering. Other pressures can also lead to moves. Mergers are likely to accelerate as casualties of the slump are eaten up by stronger rivals. That can lead to two buildings being given up in exchange for a third more suitable one. Even the joining of healthy outfits can do this. SmithKline Beecham took over The Fountains in Brentford, Middlesex, after merging. This was no simple amalgamation under one roof, however, as the scheme involved four campus buildings. But it served its purpose of giving a new expression to the unified company's culture. The great stumbling block to such moves, however, is getting rid of existing space. Almost 30 per cent of City tenants questioned by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley would like to use the low rents to find a better home but almost three-quarters were having trouble disposing of existing space. The vast majority are potential local movers who want to stay within the City, but the same problem would apply if they were aiming to travel across the other side of the country. Landlords are no longer willing to take back leases when they know they may never find another tenant. Assigning leases is also often out of the question. Like many home-owners trapped in property worth less than the mortgage, these tenants are paying passing rents far above the current market level. It would require a huge reverse premium to attract an alternative occupier and that, like the extra costs of moving staff, can wipe out any financial advantage in moving. This is probably the main factor which undermined London's Docklands, which for a while became the nation's favourite relocation target. Poor transport and lack of facilities are still being quoted as reasons why companies refuse to make the short hop from central London and cut their occupation costs in half. But the real reason is the very public decision by the administrators of Canary Wharf not to support pledges by failed developer Olympia &amp; York to take over tenants' old leases. Even the government could not save the day. It managed to keep relocation totals ticking over by shifting thousands of jobs to Bristol, Edinburgh and Leeds, but proposals to move the Departments of Transport and Environment a few miles down river were howled down. The silver tower's time will come, when it is too financially attractive to ignore. But not this year - perhaps not this decade. It may take that long for central London occupation costs to recover enough to make a difference - and for relocators to find tenants to take their old buildings. The provinces, however, will drift upwards without any help from London's cast-offs, relying on thousands of movers who are not so squeamish about making such a short hop.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ PROJECTS BY REGION 1991-92  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Region        Number of     New jobs   Safeguarded       Total                projects                       jobs        jobs  ------------------------------------------------------------------ East                  9          471         4,210       4,681 East Midlands         4          254             0         254 North East           38        3,802         2,350       6,152 N.

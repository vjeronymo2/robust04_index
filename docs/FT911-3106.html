			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: Consultative answer for industry Sir, In the 1970s we were told that government interference would solve Britain's economic problems. It didn't. In the 1980s, we were told that getting government out of industry would solve our economic problems. It hasn't. A new approach is needed in the 1990s. We might learn from Europe and welcome the proposed ideas of consultation with employees laid down in the modest EC-proposed directive of Euro-Works Councils. Instead, your leader (April 23) continues to sing the song of the 1980s. Left to themselves British companies, taken as a whole, won't train, won't invest in manufacturing, and won't consult in a partnership fashion with their best resource - the skills of their workforce. In the long (very long) run your hope that market forces will make British companies consult their workers might come true. But by the end of that long run as someone might have said the productive British economy will be dead. Denis MacShane, International Metalworkers' Federation, 54 bis, Route des Acacias, CH-1227 Geneva</p>

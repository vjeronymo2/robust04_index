His excellency stated this during a meeting in his office at  the Friendship Hall this morning with a delegation of  representatives of returnees from the rebel movement.    The delegates confirmed their support for the revolution's  aims and programs designed to achieve a real peace, saying the  revolution was the dynamo of economic, social, and political  development. The delegation dwelt on the rebel movement's  intransigence and frivolity on the peace issue, as had become  clear through the Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Abuja talks. The  members of the delegation added that they would play their part  in all the country's issues and participate in the political and  social aspects. They affirmed that the plan for redividing the  states would lead to the achievement of a comprehensive peace by  widening the scope of participation.</p>

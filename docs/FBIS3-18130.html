			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Defense Ministry and  the naval industry are to push ahead with a submarine program  worth several billion Deutschmarks [DM] before the Bundestag  election [on 16 October]. That way they want to avoid a  possible lack of political consensus following a change of  government in Bonn, the BERLINER ZEITUNG (Monday edition)  reports. According to the report, the industry will save the  Defense Ministry quite a few million marks in interest if the  latter pushes through the procurement of four new U 212-type  submarines worth DM 2.8 billion before the election.    The industry is prepared to bring forward the construction  work on the four new submarines to 1995, the report says.  According to a report from the naval arms working group, the  project was "of such crucial importance" to the industry that  the industry would be prepared to allow interest-free advance  financing. In return the Defense Ministry is to yield to the  industry's demand for "definite plans" that "the project will be  dealt with in parliament before the Bundestag election on 16  October 1994."</p>

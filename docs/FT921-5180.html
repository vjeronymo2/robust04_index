			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities show signs of stability - Traders expect modest price gains and a gradual rise in volume When traders return today, following the traditional Carnival holiday, they will be expecting a period of stability in Brazilian stock markets. This trend was already evident during the last two weeks in February. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa index closed the month at 14,498, a 29.37 per cent upswing in local currency terms, representing real growth of 4.75 per cent over inflation. In dollar terms, the index rose 12.8 per cent last month. The country's second leading market, the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange, ended the month with a real decline of 0.15 per cent, as a strong second half made up for a poor first fortnight. Except for a predictably slow Friday on the eve of Carnival, volumes in Sao Paulo hovered around Dollars 100m last week. 'We've recovered the volume we had in the late 1970s,' notes Mr Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros, director of Planibanc, a Sao Paulo investment bank. Volume is expected to continue to grow, albeit at a more gradual pace. Judging by the futures index, brokers expect the Bovespa index to increase by about 7 per cent in dollar terms over the next 45 days. 'That's a well-behaved gain by Brazilian standards,' says Mr Mendonca de Barros. If the late February relative calm continues, it will contrast with performance since late 1990, when the ups and downs of foreign debt negotiations, the prospect of the government's privatisation programme, and alleged price manipulation by two Sao Paulo brokerages were among the factors which kept the market on edge. Most of the news pushed equities up: the Bovespa index rose by 46.48 per cent in real terms in January while Rio de Janeiro's BVRJ index recorded a 38.40 per cent real increase. By contrast, few analysts expect any shocking news to rattle the market in March. 'The post-Carnival scene is set, especially with the two accords with the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club (of official creditors),' predicts Mr Marco Antonio de Nigro, market analyst for the Sao Paulo financial information service, Dinheiro Vivo. In addition to the IMF and Paris Club agreements, brokers offer several reasons for the steadying trend: the monthly inflation rate is expected to drop modestly, with the aid of the seasonal agricultural harvest and resulting lower food prices; an official inquiry into the price manipulation allegations is forcing 'speculators' to keep a low profile; and the jump in liquidity which comes with the growth in volume is proving to be a calming influence. Part of the added volume represents a recovery in internal savings with the gradual release of funds blocked by President Fernando Collor's March 1990 economic plan, says Mr Mendonca de Barros. The rest is coming from foreign institutional investors. Since they were allowed to invest directly in Brazil for the first time last August, foreign institutions have sunk Dollars 685.5m into the country's stock markets, according to government figures. Just Dollars 40.1m of that has since been siphoned back out. If these trends persist, Mr Nigro predicts that the current daily volume in Sao Paulo, about Cr150bn (Dollars 92m), could reach Cr200bn in the coming weeks. With the government's announcement on February 18 of tax incentives for exporters, companies with considerable foreign sales have taken the centre stage in the stock market. For instance, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining company, saw its stock rise by 40.2 per cent in February. The effect of generally negative 1991 company results has been mixed. Investors were braced for a poor performance from the corporate sector, given the recession and the effects of new legislation, known as 'law 8,200', which requires companies to revalue assets to reflect real inflation rates, which were higher than original government figures. Blue chips continued to fare well. The stock of Petrobras, the state-controlled petroleum company, rose 40.1 per cent in February despite the release of the worst results in its history. Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications group, enjoyed a 37.8 per cent increase in the value of its stock even although its expected Dollars 1bn profit was trimmed to Dollars 106mn, after 'law 8,200' was taken into account. On the other hand, Copene, the petrochemical concern, saw its stock lag behind the Bovespa index by 4.7 per cent last week after announcing its first loss since its foundation in 1978. Pirelli, an electronics maker, lost 21.6 per cent against the index after it released negative 1991 results.</p>

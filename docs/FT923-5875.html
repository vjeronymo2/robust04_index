			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm after differing data US TREASURY prices were slightly firmer yesterday in the wake of some conflicting economic data. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 98 1/16 , yielding 7.406 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly firmer, up  3/32 at 100 1/16 , to carry a yield of 4.201 per cent. The good news for bonds was that the original estimate of 1.4 per cent growth in second-quarter gross domestic product was not revised upward on a second reading, as had been expected. The absence of a revision confirmed that the economic recovery was extremely weak in the second three months of the year. The not-so-good news for the market was a 92,000 decline in weekly jobless claims, the largest one-week drop in history. The figures, however, were distorted by unusual factors, including a series of temporary layoffs at General Motors' manufacturing plants. UK GOVERNMENT gilts ended lower again as prices fell in afternoon trading in line with a weakening pound. Shorter dated gilts were less affected but longer issues lost as much as half a point. The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 95.08 to 94.21 while the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 fell from 101 5/32 to 100 23/32 in late trading. 'It was currency factors again,' said Mr Philip Tyson, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Sterling fell a pfennig from its opening of DM2.8005 during the day and in late trading stood at DM2.7898, just above its absolute floor against the D-Mark of DM2.7780. Rumours in London, quickly denied, that the Bank of Italy was about to raise interest rates also hit gilts in the afternoon. The lira and sterling are both close to the bottom of their ERM bands and dealers feared an Italian rate rise would force the UK to follow suit. Some London dealers said the longer end of the yield curve was also overshadowed by Wednesday's poor response to the Pounds 2.5bn auction of 8 3/4 per cent gilts due 2017, which was covered only 1.24 times. OTHER European government bonds traded quietly after recent volatility, with main markets little changed. German government bunds were marked down after slightly higher-than-expected inflation figures for former West Germany showed prices rose a preliminary 3.5 per cent year-on-year in August, compared with 3.3 per cent in July. But bunds recovered most of their losses and analysts said the inflation figures were distorted by one-off rent increases. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.09 and was quoted in late trade at 88.01 after briefly slipping below the 88.00 resistance level. Some switching into higher yielding Dutch bonds was reported, but dealers said the contract's quick recovery above the resistance level showed the German market remained firm and was still benefitting from worries elsewhere in Europe ahead of the French referendum next month. French government bonds ended slightly lower. Another poll, conducted for the French bank Societe Generale, suggested public opinion is split down the middle on Maastricht. The yield on the benchmark 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 rose slightly from 9.13 per cent to 9.17 per cent. Dealers said uncertainty would keep a cap on price rises before the referendum. But following falls this week, the market is now well underpinned, they said. JAPANESE government bonds closed little changed as attention focused on the stock market and today's announcement of measures designed to stimulate the economy. Poorer-than-expected economic data on industrial production and retail sales boosted hopes of an interest rate cut. But news that the package would be worth a larger than expected Y9,000bn, and the authorities' moves to dampen speculation about an imminent reduction, kept the market guessing. The No 145 bond, which took over as the benchmark yesterday, opened at 4.825 per cent and closed at 4.815 per cent after volatile trading. Dealers said sentiment towards bonds remained positive.</p>

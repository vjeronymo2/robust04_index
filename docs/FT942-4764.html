			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Social chapter misread: David Goodhart argues UK interpretations of European labour laws are unfair and misleading European labour law is the issue that has most sharply divided the two main parties in the UK's European election. But in so doing, it has become a focus of rhetorical exaggeration and straightforward misunderstanding on both sides. In the course of the campaign, the social chapter, a voting mechanism which makes it easier for the European Union to pass some types of employment legislation, has been routinely and wrongly described in the UK as ushering in a 35-hour week and a minimum wage. Last week Mr John Major, the prime minister, attributed France's rising unemployment to its acceptance of the social chapter and Britain's falling unemployment to its rejection of it. This assertion belied the fact that not a single piece of European employment legislation has been passed under the terms of the social chapter. The argument over workers' rights and conditions does overlap with genuine domestic policy differences on labour market regulation. But neither the existing framework of European employment law, nor proposed extensions to it, can bear the weight of acclaim or disapproval heaped upon it by, respectively, the Labour and Conservative parties. There is 'much nonsense' talked in the UK about both the volume and the nature of social legislation at a European level, says Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner in Brussels. More than 90 per cent of employment legislation, and the costs associated with it, is determined by national governments and not by Brussels. The three main areas where Europe has an impact - health and safety, equality for men and women, and labour mobility  -are all relatively uncontroversial. Further, the din of hustings rhetoric has obscured the fact that the scope of Europe's social ambitions is going through a subtle mutation or 'a period of creative confusion', according to Mr Peter Reid, of the UK's Engineering Employers Federation. A few months ago Mr Reid and others were worrying that social legislation would be extended into national domains such as individual redundancies. Not any longer. The first clear step away from the agenda of detailed Europe-wide legislation to protect those at work came last December with the white paper of Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, on growth, competitiveness and employment. That paper - like yesterday's jobs study from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - called for more flexible labour costs and for a better balance between protection of the employed and access to work for the unemployed. Mr Flynn's less noticed green paper on European social policy, which will itself become a more formal white paper next month, is expected to mark a further step away from detailed, prescriptive labour legislation. In a recent speech, Mr Flynn said Europe's social dimension had established a critical mass and now required less legislation. 'It is no longer possible, or productive, to focus too narrowly on specific questions such as labour law,' he added. The scepticism of the UK government has had some effect in this debate and there is growing interest in labour market deregulation throughout Europe. But this does not mean that the social dimension is dead, or that Britain has 'won the argument'. Even after some deregulation, most EU countries will have more regulated labour markets than the UK. Germany and Spain now see Europe-wide minimum standards - on, for example, part-time worker rights - as a useful balance to domestic deregulation. Even in the UK, clashes over labour law seem set to continue at least for a couple of years. Though the UK won an opt-out from future social chapter legislation during the Maastricht treaty negotiations, the rump of 1980s legislation coming into force now means that British workers are acquiring new rights in maternity leave, working hours and part-time work. These measures amount to a qualification, not a negation, of the deregulatory policies of the Conservative government. For instance, Europe has not prevented the abolition of minimum wage protection in the UK. The above regulations, and the current batch of directives on matters such as parental leave for childcare, represent the last gasp of 1980s social Europe. Mr Flynn suggests the future will be more modest. There will be more emphasis on implementing existing legislation (Greece has implemented virtually no health and safety legislation), and more sensitivity towards subsidiarity in the social field where, many argue, decisions should remain at national level. In the longer run there is likely to be more harmonisation of employment standards and even pay rates in Europe, but this will probably be the result of economic integration, not directives. It is also likely to involve convergence between British deregulation and continental regulation. As Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Cadbury inquiry into corporate governance, said last week, talking about the company of the future, Britain will move towards Europe in giving employees more rights, while Europe will move towards Britain by doing the same for shareholders.</p>

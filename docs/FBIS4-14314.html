			<p>BFN     [Text] The General Committee of the General People's  Congress [GPC] held a meeting yesterday under brother  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council  and assistant secretary general of the GPC. The General  Committee reviewed developments on the local scene in light of  the regrettable incidents witnessed at the 'Imran camp yesterday.    The General Committee issued the following statement:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. There  is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may  dazzle thee. And he calls Allah to witness about what is in his  heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic  verse]    O masses of our great Yemeni people: The GPC has observed,  with extreme concern, the developments of the regrettable  criminal incident witnessed by the city of 'Imran on Wednesday.  At 1200 that day, a group of the 3d Armored Brigade, acting at  the behest of the separatists within the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], carried out a treacherous, cowardly act against the  members of the 1st Armored Brigade and innocent citizens in the  city of 'Imran. They used tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy  artillery, firing shells at the personnel of the 1st Armored  Brigade, when the personnel were having lunch peacefully at the  dining hall where the members of the joint military committee  were present. The joint military committee was on a visit to  the camp as part of its efforts to check military developments  and pave the way for implementing the military part of the  accord document.    Consequently, many members of the 1st Brigade were martyred  and injured. The military situation inside the camp also flared  up. The comrades-in-arms inside the camp had previously stayed  together peacefully for over four years enjoying a spirit of  amity and camaraderie. However, the influential separatists did  not like this, so they sought to sow discord and ignite fighting  between the sons of the Yemeni Armed Forces, using the commander  of the 3d Armored Brigade and his accomplice in the crime and  sabotage, who is called Yahya Dahish 'Alyan. Both were used as  pliable, criminal tools to ignite fighting between the members  of the two brigades, causing the loss of dozens of innocent  martyrs of troops and citizens in the valiant city of 'Imran.  The shells of the 3d Armored Brigade did not spare the homes of  those citizens, thus claiming the lives of dozens of innocent  martyrs and victims as a result of this treacherous, cowardly  act. In addition, many homes and public facilities in the  valiant city of 'Imran were destroyed.    The General Committee of the GPC condemns and deplores this  heinous crime, which was carried out by certain YSP leaders and  which happened at a time when national and political peaceful  efforts are being dedicated to the implementation of the accord  document, signed in Amman on 20 February, 1994. The crime also  took place at a time when efforts were being exerted to bring  the state institutions closer to a peaceful and positive  relaxation of the crisis, which was engineered by the advocates  of separation who rebelled against democracy, unity, peace, and  peaceful coexistence. This stand is being repeated with every  step made toward a relaxation of the crisis and containment of  its developments and the beginning of the implementation of the  accord document. It began in Abyan when the situation flared up  against the forces of al-'Amaliqah, Shabwah and Harth Sufyan, in  addition to the reckless acts carried out by the camp of the  Ba-Fahd Brigade, terrorizing defenseless citizens in the city of  Dhamar. This situation is being repeated today in the city of  'Imran through the forces of the 3d Armored Brigade, which  caused the martyrdom of dozens of victims.    While expressing its regret, warm sympathies, and  consolation for all the families of the innocent victims who  fell in the premeditated criminal incident -- all of them being  sons of the one Yemeni homeland and whose chaste blood and  precious lives are dear to all of us -- the General Committee  appeals to the heroic troops, noncommissioned officers, and  officers of our valiant Armed Forces to rise to the level of  their national responsibility and match the expectations of  their people as protectors of the homeland and a shield of its  unity and democratic approach. It also appeals to them to be  vigilant so as to avert all schemes that target the homeland,  its unity, security, and stability. They should not heed the  orders issued by the influential separatists within the YSP who  seek to throw them into an inferno of death and fighting with  their brothers and comrades-in-arms, who stand with them in one  trench defending the homeland, the revolution, the republic, and  unity. Those influential separatists want to satisfy their sick  whims and narrow personal interests, having been blinded by the  glitter of [word indistinct] money paid by the enemies of the  Yemeni homeland to ignite fighting between the sons of the  Yemeni people, divide the homeland, and harm its unity and  democracy.    The General Committee also appeals to all parties, factions,  and mass organizations and unions to condemn such criminal  stupidity, reject calls for separation and division, and close  ranks to unify the sincere national will so as to implement the  accord document by showing collective responsibility. This will  spare the homeland the danger of falling into the trap of this  conspiracy that targets the will of the people, their unity,  security and stability.    The General Committee stresses dialogue as a means to  resolve  all differences. It also asserts that the accord document  should be translated into reality, without hesitation or  procrastination, since this document is the common denominator  between all parties, in order to build a modern Yemeni state.    The General Committee urges the masses of our people to  demonstrate more vigilance and alertness and reject and denounce  this conspiracy that aims at dragging the country toward more  fighting, fragmentation, and sedition. It also reiterates the  appeal made by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the  chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of  the GPC, to the constitutional, legitimate institution -- the  House of Representatives -- to assume all its legal and  constitutional responsibilities to put an end to these stupid,  criminal acts that threaten the safety, security, and stability  of the homeland and citizens. This will safeguard and protect  unity, enhance and protect constitutional legitimacy, and  protect the citizens and the homeland from the intrigues of  enemies and conspirators.    Glory and immortality to the martyrs of unity; death to  plotters against unity. Allah will certainly aid those who aid  His cause; for verily Allah is full of strength, exalted in  might, able to enforce His will. [Koranic verse]    Issued by the General Committee of the GPC.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Argentine market down sharply Argentina's stock exchange had another stormy session yesterday in a cash-squeezed financial market, with blue chips closing 4 per cent down on the day in heavy selling. But government officials said no fiscal measures would be taken to calm the markets, and refuted rumours that several first-line banks were on the brink of financial collapse. The stock market's selective MerVal index closed at a fresh low for the year of 437.08 points. The bourse has nosedived 17.2 per cent in the past six sessions, after Brady bonds and Argentine ADRs (those traded in New York) had taken a pounding on the heels of Mexico's shock currency devaluation last week. 'There's absolutely no chance of a devaluation or any tax increases,' Mr Carlos Sanchez, deputy economy minister, said. He predicted that the surge in call money rates from 12 per cent last Thursday to about 25 per cent, and the stock exchange's slide, would be reversed in the short term.</p>

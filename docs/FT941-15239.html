			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: The magic of Horowitz - Records Horowitz: The Complete Masterworks Recordings, 1962 -73. Boxed set of 13 CDs grouped in nine volumes. Sony Classical SX13K 53 456 Throughout his long life Vladimir Horowitz was involved in making records - not continually, but in bursts separated by long intervals of silence, all of which mirrored the ebb and flow of his extraordinary career. His involvement began in Hamburg, in 1926, with a session devoted to creating a set of piano rolls for use on a player-piano. In the early 1930s he was a regular visitor to the recording studios. But then came those longer breaks, reflecting the pianist's depression-dominated withdrawals from concert-giving. Between 1953 and 1965, when he made no public appearances whatsoever, the RCA Victor company continued to record him, but mostly at his New York home; these and other items from the RCA-Horowitz partnership have been regularly re-issued on CD. There has been an equally steady CD stream of the recordings that Deutsche Grammophon made from 1985 to 1989 (the year of his death), of an artist in his 80s and miraculously restored to health and performance after the medically-drugged darkness and silence of the previous two years. In addition, a 1990 EMI References two-disc album republished a valuable number of Horowitz goodies from the 1930-51 period. But perhaps the most enticing issue of Horowitz records is the new, large-scale one by Sony. As purchaser of the CBS label, the Japanese company owns the rights to the CBS recordings of 1962-73, in many respects the golden period of Horowitz's recording career. This is the complete set of Horowitz's recordings from his 60s and 70s. Super-complete, indeed, since that handful of Scarlatti, Debussy and Skryabin items for which space was lacking on CBS's original LPs is now included. The box set is handsome. Its 13 component CDs are intelligently grouped in nine subject-volumes, each of which is graced by a scene-setting essay by Thomas Frost, Horowitz's CBS record-producer, as well as by a general Horowitz appreciation from Byron Janis, the most distinguished of his pupils. The reasons one may claim this as the golden period of Horowitz's recording career - and for the newcomer to the marvels of his playing probably the best starting-point - have to do with both the sound-characteristics of the CBS recordings and the particular quality of Horowitz's performances. RCA Victor's discs of the 1940s and '50s, though they contain examples of his art at its most compelling (such as his 1951 version of the Rakhmaninov Third Piano Concerto, a contained, controlled pianistic whirlwind unleashed with indescribable brilliance - available on RCA GD87754), tended to be boxy, airless in sound. Too often this over-emphasises, to a point verging on listener's discomfort, the mailed-fist forcefulness of Horowitz's bravura playing. Even in those live CBS recordings - such as those from the celebrated 1965 and 1966 Carnegie Hall concerts, given here in Volume 3 under the title 'The Historic Return' - the recording ambience achieves, by contrast, a warmer, rounder, more 'filled-out' impression of the Horowitz sound-world. And so, even though there is no dulling or diminishing of the current of Horowitz electricity (as on occasion there was to be in the post-1973 period), the CBS-Sony records show how much wider, more wonderfully musical was his art than that of the RCA-Victor keyboard wizard. Listening to these 13 CDs, I was seized all over again by the conviction that the keyboard-wizard legend has only ever told part of the Horowitz story. A true part, undoubtedly: on Volume 9, devoted to 'Late Russian Romantics' ie Skryabin, Rakhmaninov and a single, delectable Medtner 'Fairy Tale', the diablerie he brings to such Skryabin works as the Op. 65 no 3 Study or 'Vers la flamme' - compounded of the tightest, lightest, most ferociously accurate rhythmic and tonal focus, and the ability to layer each line of thought with unimaginable distinctness - is the stuff of that legend. The 'Grand Romantic master of them all' was Dominic Gill's phrase for Horowitz (uttered on this page) when he returned to London in 1982, after three decades of absence: it is this master whose Skryabin and Rakhmaninov excites almost to the point of frenzy even such a listener as myself, normally apt to feel pretty swiftly the onset of boredom at the transports of both composers. But it is the delicate, musically delightful Horowitz that has lingered longest in my mind - the Horowitz of the Clementi, Scarlatti, Mozart and Bach-Busoni readings, with their wit and subtlety of hue, their fabulous imaginative responses to the dramatic potential of texture and rhythm, their bel-canto conception of melody-singing. The controversy that all his life accompanied the Horowitz legend - was he just a set of ten super-brilliant fingers or a 'real' musician? - must, I believe, be settled once and for all by this splendidly vast conspectus of his peculiar gifts. Of course, in the work of so supremely 'personal' an pianist, not everything will convince every listener equally. I take endless pleasure in the clarity of sound and shape of his best Beethoven accounts, while recognising that for many their distance from the world of High German seriousness will count as an insuperable handicap. Occasionally, a passing quirkiness proves disconcerting. More often I find myself hearing, in the iridescent tracery of his phrasing, a musicianship that may not belong to the later 20th-century but is no less elemental for that. Of performances such as the Schumann Fantasy and Kreisleriana contained here, Neville Cardus's description still stands supreme - 'not interpretations but enchantments'. The price of this 13-CD compendium is hefty. Considered in the light of all the enchantments on offer, it is a bargain.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOLSA GRANDE GIVES PIONEER A DOUBLE SHOT  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande High School's Wilson twins -- Marcus and Maurice -- sparked a  second-half offensive burst that led the Matadors to a 40-20 nonleague victory  over winless Pioneer Thursday night at Pioneer High School.  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande (1-2) led, 7-6, at halftime, but the Wilson brothers took over in  the third quarter.  </P> <P> Maurice, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound tailback, finished with 155 yards rushing and  two touchdowns in 15 carries. Brother Marcus, a 6-1, 200-pound fullback, gained  146 yards and scored two touchdowns in 16 carries.  </P> <P> Pioneer (0-3), which dropped its 13th consecutive game, managed to exploit  Bolsa Grande's special teams for its three scores, including an 84-yard kickoff  return by Anthony Perez and an 85-yard kickoff return by Oley Khounesavath.  </P> <P> Tony Troung scored Bolsa Grande's first touchdown on a three-yard run, but  Pioneer closed the gap to 7-6 in the second quarter when Mike Moreno recovered  a blocked punt in the end zone. Bolsa quarterback Brian Taylor ran for a  35-yard touchdown in the third quarter on a fake punt play. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

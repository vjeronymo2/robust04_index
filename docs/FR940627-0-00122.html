			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Welfare Evaluation Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) states that the Administrator may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require manufacturers to furnish ``reasonable and necessary''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information for determining ``the extent to which F/FA emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the public health or welfare''. The term ``welfare effects''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompasses a variety of complex and interrelated factors. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of motor vehicle F/FA emissions, welfare effects could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the impact of air pollution on the public health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment, including a broad range of effects on aquatic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terrestrial ecosystems, cultivated crops and other vegetation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural and man-made materials, wildlife, and stratospheric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone. Air pollution effects on the public welfare also include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important environmental concerns such as noxious odors or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visibility impairment, which may detract from human well-being.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for stipulating that welfare effects should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed, the statute gives EPA broad discretion about how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address welfare effects. EPA recognizes that, at the present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, scientific experience and laboratory screening methods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evaluation of welfare effects are more limited than in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area of health effects. Thus, today's rule limits the routinely required welfare evaluation to requirements that are coincident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or concurrent with the evaluation of health effects. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the literature search, emission characterization, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure analysis requirements of Tier 1. While at this time EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not requiring biological testing for welfare effects, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator retains the authority to require additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation and/or testing of welfare effects at the Tier 3 level,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the outcome of lower tiers demonstrates both significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental toxicity and exposure potential. EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the need for Tier 3 welfare effects testing on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require modeling analyses for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric reactivity, environmental fate/partitioning, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure as part of the welfare evaluation. EPA requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on the feasibility of requiring such modeling analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a routine requirement for registration. Commenters urged EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to limit the modeling requirements due to the lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized methods in this area of study. Recognizing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations of modeling methods and the availability of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for some of the areas of study of interest in this rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule does not require modeling analyses as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that other EPA programs are actively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> researching and controlling mobile and stationary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributions to major air pollution problems such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tropospheric/stratospheric ozone, global warming, and acid rain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, modeled ozone reactivity data are already available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for most conventional and alternative fuels. EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if additional modeling is deemed necessary, this could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed by manufacturers under Tier 3. Also, EPA may conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple modeling, using the emission data submitted by registrants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Tier 1, if needed for regulatory decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding environmental fate and exposure modeling, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that these types of analyses will be extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult due to the complex nature of F/FA emissions. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both environmental partitioning models and exposure models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address single compounds rather than mixtures, it would be unduly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome and unreasonable to require all registrants to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these analyses on each individual emission constituent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring the modeling of each individual emission product would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also result in duplication of information and, therefore, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be inconsistent with the original intent of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the environmental models are applicable only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a limited number of emission products for which appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical/chemical data are available in order to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. In terms of available exposure models, these usually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rely on carbon monoxide monitoring data and related emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates to estimate potential exposures. This means that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of available exposure models is somewhat limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the analysis of compounds whose chemical/physical behavior is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to carbon monoxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above factors, EPA believes that quantitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations of potential exposures and environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fate/partitioning of F/FA emissions will be better addressed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Tier 3 level on a case-by-case basis, where they can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focused on specific compounds of potential environmental concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

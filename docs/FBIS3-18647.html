			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] In light of the appointment of Admiral  Fuzeta da Ponte as the new Armed Forces Chief of Staff (CEMFGA),  press articles have focused on the complements and strength of  the Portuguese Armed Forces.    The 17 February Lisbon weekly VISAO detailed the composition  of the Armed Forces. According to the weekly, the Army has  21,648 men and women (447 women officers, noncommissioned  officers, and privates in administrative positions). The ranks  of officers and noncommissioned officers were thinned out in  recent years: There were 10,911 in 1973, 7,728 in 1990, and  6,381 at the end of 1993, at which time volunteers represented  32 percent of the force (6,905 officers and noncommissioned  officers), almost equal to the career force. The Navy's total  strength is 11,210, including 151 women. Some 5,026 sailors are  career and 1,088 are volunteers. The Air Forces' total strength  is 7,754, of whom 1,752 are officers, 2,609 are noncommissioned  officers, and 3,393 are airmen. There is one four-star general  and 10 three-star generals, 804 captains, 362 lieutenants, 184  majors, 166 second lieutenants, 140 lieutenant colonels, 60  colonels, 16 brigadiers, and two cadets. The Air Force has the  highest number of women volunteers, including a lieutenant  colonel and five lieutenants.    According to Cesar Camacho writing in the 24 February Lisbon  daily PUBLICO, while the Independent Mechanized Brigade  dedicated to NATO needs volunteers to maintain the necessary  level of preparedness and operational capability, it does have  the required number of officers and noncommissioned officers.  Camacho notes that the lack of privates stems from the "drastic"  reduction of compulsory military service to no more than four  months, "sufficient for little else besides basic training."  Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira is cited as believing that  the offer of technical-professional training to new recruits  will attract volunteers. He has therefore given his approval to  the creation of a professional training center in the field of  civil engineering, including disciplines such as civil  construction design, stone masonry, carpentry, electricity, etc.  Other, higher-level courses in accounting, civil construction,  and technical management are already offered.</p>

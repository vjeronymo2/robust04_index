			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HEA requires that an institution must agree to comply with the Secretary's regulations governing financial responsibility and administrative capability. Thus, the Secretary would specify that the institution must agree to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with proposed-to-be-redesignated &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HEA requires that an institution must submit reports, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed by the Secretary, to the Secretary, or, as appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holders of student loans under the Title IV, HEA programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing information required to administer the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The Secretary considers this provision to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations without substantive modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HEA requires that an institution may not provide any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement to a student or certification to a lender under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL programs that qualifies a student for loans in excess of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual and aggregate limits for which the student is eligible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with statutory requirements. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to extend this requirement to include unsubsidized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Stafford loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HEA requires that an institution must comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer information requirements in subpart D of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The Secretary considers this provision to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations without substantive modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HEA requires that an institution that advertises job  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement rates as a means of procuring enrollment must make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to prospective students data necessary to substantiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the truthfulness of the advertisement. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1992 require that an institution make available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective students the relevant State licensing requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any job for which an institution's educational program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to prepare prospective students. The HEA also requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution must inform all eligible borrowers under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL programs of their eligibility for and the availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State grant assistance. The Secretary considers this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to streamline these regulations, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to list in one place in this section all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications that an institution must make to participate in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program. The institution would have to agree in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its program participation agreement to provide these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications. These certifications include the following: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That the institution has in operation a drug abuse prevention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program accessible to any of the institution's officers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, and students; and (2) establishment of a campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security policy and disclosure requirements as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 485(f) of the HEA. The Secretary considers this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HEA requires that an institution make available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who receive Title IV, HEA program aid based on their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to benefit from the training offered a program proven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful in assisting those students to obtain the recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of a high school diploma. The Secretary considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments of 1992 require an institution to agree that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it will not deny any form of Federal financial aid to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible student solely on the grounds that the student is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution. The Secretary considers this provision to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations without substantive modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments of 1992 require that as a condition for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation any institution seeking to participate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first time in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal SLS programs and any institution participating in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan programs that changes ownership resulting in a change of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control or changes its status as a main campus, branch campus, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an additional location, develop and implement for two years a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default management plan. The Secretary proposes to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to develop and implement, or submit if required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary, a default management plan developed in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the default reduction measures described in appendix D of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations to meet this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

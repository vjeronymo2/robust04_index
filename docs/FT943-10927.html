			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Foreign banks gain entry to Mexico Twenty foreign banks plan to open up subsidiaries in Mexico this year. US banks formed the majority of those that applied together with French, Spanish, German and Japanese banks. No UK bank applied, to the Mexican government's surprise. Mexico agreed to open up its banking sector under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Initially foreign banks are limited to holding 8 per cent of the sector's total capital, although this limit is increased to 15 per cent by 1999, and then abolished. Under Nafta rules, all banks not from the US or Canada have to apply through US or Canadian subsidiaries. Each bank is limited to 1.5 per cent of the banking capital and, like Mexican banks, has to make a minimum capital payment of 60m pesos (Dollars 17.6m). Finance ministry officials said last week that only a minority of banks would apply for the maximum permitted market share. The government hopes competition from foreign banks will reduce margins earned by domestic banks, and put pressure on interest rates. Foreign banks are expected to target the corporate rather than consumer sector. The banks that sought authorisation are: Bank of Boston, Morgan Stanley, Bank of Tokyo, Banque National de Paris, Citibank, Chemical Bank, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, First Chicago Bank, International Bank of Commerce, J. P. Morgan, NationsBank, Republic National Bank of New York, ABM/Amro Bank, Banco de Santander, Societe Generale, American Express, Fuji Bank, ING Capital Holdings and Dresdner Bank. They will be the first to offer full services in Mexico, with the exception of Citibank. Finance ministry officials have said that the banks should receive authorisation in a month or so, and be operating by the end of the year.</p>

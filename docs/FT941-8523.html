			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / EU turns screw on Greece over Macedonia: Athens receives a stream of strong diplomatic protests over controversial blockade Greece's partners in the European Union yesterday strongly increased their pressure on Athens to lift its controversial trade blockade on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, and Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, said in the Greek capital that they had asked Greece to reconsider its action. After meeting Greek President Andreas Panadreou, Mr Kinkel said that Greece's move could further destabilise the region and was 'against the interest' of the EU. Britain, along with other EU member states, delivered an official diplomatic protest to the Greek government in Athens, and, in Paris, the French government summoned the Greek ambassador to express its concern. European officials are expected to discuss the issue with Greece on Monday, when the EU's foreign ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the Balkans crisis and issues involving possible EU enlargement. Diplomats in Brussels are deeply irritated at the move, which has been interpreted by some as an attempt to divert attention away from Greece's unease about the threatened Nato air strikes in Bosnia, and European Commission officials said yesterday that they would be seeking further 'clarification' from Greece. However, they said that it was unlikely that Greece's partners would seek to take concerted action until the Commission's legal services had prepared a report on whether the action had contravened EU law. The Greek delegation in Brussels said yesterday that it would argue that its action was legal since it involved national security. Despite the heavy criticism from its allies, Greece, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has begun stopping ships from handling goods for Skopje, the new republic's capital, at Thessaloniki and blocking trucks from crossing the border 70 kms to the north. Mr Claes and Mr Kinkel were in Athens for a regular meeting of the EU troika, which groups the current holder of the EU presidency with the previous one (Belgium) and the next one (Germany). 'I want to say openly and clearly that the EU expects Greece to show solidarity with the attitude of the other 11 (EU member) countries,' Mr Kinkel said. 'I expect that Greece will withdraw this decision.' Asked if the Macedonian republic should first meet any Greek demands, he said 'No'. Greece is demanding three pre-conditions before resuming UN talks to resolve the two-year-old feud. It wants the new republic to change its name, national symbols and constitution to prove it has no territorial ambitions on Greece's Macedonia province, where 2.5m Greek Macedonians live. Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and gained UN admittance last year under the temporary name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister for European Affairs said in Athens yesterday, the blockade would last until Skopje, capital of the republic, bowed to Greece's demands.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Regulator relies on price cap to maintain control THE BEST way of regulating BT's prices is by a price cap rather than by controlling the telecommunications company's profits directly, Oftel, the industry regulator, made clear yesterday. Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, also said, however, that profits had to play an important part in deciding the appropriate price cap. The main consideration was to set a cap that would lead to BT's making 'reasonable' profits if it achieved likely levels of efficiency. Unlike previous price reviews, Oftel will be conducting this one mainly in the open. In particular, it is making explicit what it means by reasonable profits, has disclosed how BT's actual profits have diverged from its forecasts, and has published disaggregated profits of the company's different services for the first time. Oftel says that in judging reasonableness, profits as a proportion of capital employed should be weighed against the company's 'cost of capital' - what it must pay to raise finance. That is the level of profitability that a company in a competitive market would expect to earn. Oftel uses two measures for cost of capital. The first is a calculation of how much BT would have to pay to raise funds through a mixture of debt and equity, taking into account the fact that its business is less risky than most of the rest of British industry. The second is an attempt to judge what rate of return investors are looking at by comparing the company's share price with expectations of future dividends. Ideally, Oftel would do all those calculations on a current-cost - inflation-adjusted - basis, but it has to rely on BT's conventional historic-cost accounts. On that basis Oftel calculates that a reasonable rate of return is 17 per cent to 20 per cent for BT's regulated services. That is not directly comparable with BT's reported return on capital because the figures cover all its business. Oftel calculates that in 1990-91 BT's return on regulated business was 25.4 per cent, compared with its expectations of 18 per cent when the last comprehensive price review was conducted four years ago. The implication is that BT's profitability is about 40 per cent higher than expected. Another way of judging BT's profits is to compare them with those of other companies (see table). According to Oftel's document 'comparisons made on this basis suggest that BT's returns are currently above average'. That conclusion is consistent with an analysis of BT's profits last year by the Financial Times and Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbroker. Oftel's document explains how BT's profits diverged from expectations. The main reason was that international call charges were not initially regulated. If those are removed, the return on BT's regulated businesses was only 20 per cent in 1990-91. A tighter price cap, requiring BT to cut the average level of prices by 6.25 per cent after inflation, came into effect in September and is intended to correct that. Sir Bryan made clear that the decision on the new price cap would have to take into account expectations of how effective the current price cap would be in reducing BT's profitability. The fall in BT's quarterly profits, announced yesterday, is evidence that the tighter cap is having some effect. But other factors were also responsible, in particular the weak economic climate and growing competition. The breakdown of profits for each of BT's main services supports the company's case that it loses money in supplying telephone lines to residential and business customers. It also shows BT is earning very high profits on international and domestic long-distance calls. It does not support BT's contention that the situation is deteriorating. Its loss on residential line rentals as a percentage of capital employed fell to 11.8 per cent in 1990-91 from 14.3 per cent in 1989-90. So the jury would still seem to be out on whether BT should be given greater flexibility to increase rental charges - something likely to be one of the most contentious features of the review.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE BT MAKES - OR LOSES - MONEY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to March 31, 1991                                 Pounds million                  -------------------------------------------                                                     Mean       Return Standing/                     Operating             capital    on connection       Turnover     costs       Return    employed   capital charges  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Business           789          911       -122      1,518      -8.0%  Residential      1,368        1,896       -528      4,468     -11.8% Calls  Local            2,057          988      1,069      2,463      43.4%  National         2,837          994      1,843      2,480      73.3% International   calls           1,721          919        802        979      81.9% Inland private   circuits          898          730        168      1,379      12.2% Public payphones    252          317        -65        316     -20.6%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW BT'S PROFITABILITY COMPARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage return on capital employed                               1987/      88/      89/      90/                                 88       89       90       91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All industry                  18.3     20.2     19.6     16.5 All manufacturing industry    20.3     23.8     23.2     18.6 All non manufacturing   industry (excluding oil)    18.4     19.4     17.1     14.9 Electrical/electronic   companies                   23.3     26.0     22.2     18.9 BT                            21.0     20.9     19.1     21.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

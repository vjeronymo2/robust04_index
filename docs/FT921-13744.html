			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Move to avert Brussels 'own goals': Planned EC unit would be watchdog to ensure smooth ratification of Maastricht treaty THE European Commission is planning to set up a unit to prevent Brussels scoring damaging 'own goals' in an effort to smooth ratification of the treaty on European Union agreed at the Maastricht summit in December. The unit will seek to ensure that Eurocrats do not produce measures of particular sensitivity in individual member states at moments when they might cause political rows that could disrupt ratification of the treaty. A senior Commission official said the ad hoc grouping would offer advice on the timing of EC measures without attempting to alter their substance. A less structured attempt to anticipate controversy operated in the run-up to Maastricht itself. This was largely in response to UK sensitivities, after Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, lambasted Brussels for trying to 'exert its influence in every nook and cranny of daily life'. The apparent spark for this row, amid much pre-summit posturing, was a letter to the UK government from Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner. This sought to delay work on seven big construction projects until an environmental impact assessment had been completed and publicly disseminated, as required by EC law. Senior Commission officials confirm that a range of sensitive measures were then taken off the Brussels agenda until after the summit. These included the decision to prosecute the UK for the England and Wales Milk Marketing Board's attempts to extend its monopoly over the purchase of liquid milk, finally taken just before Christmas. Plans to extend environmental impact assessment requirements from individual projects to national policies, and a green paper on the liberalisation of postal services, were held over until later this month. Mr Ripa di Meana acknowledges 'that anguish was felt here before Maastricht', adding that 'I have to recognise that there are tactical moments when a slackening is requested.' He said he was not aware of any new monitoring unit, but reasoned that the pressures on his office not to rock the boat were sufficiently constant that he would not necessarily notice. He repeated his remark during the pre-Maastricht controversy, that 'either you're a troublemaker or you're useless as an environment commissioner'. The Commission also intends to make life harder for 'nook and cranny' guardians in other ways. It has issued its public relations front line with a catalogue of rebuttals to charges that Brussels is bent on 'harmonising' everything from condom standards to crisp flavouring. This document argues that 'an immediate, simple and good-humoured reply to each and every allegation of 'Euromadness' is our best line of defence'. While it is passably simple and not without humour, its immediacy is somewhat blunted. Most of the replies were sought by British journalists in the run-up to Maastricht, following a rash of UK tabloid attacks on Eurocracy. The current Portuguese presidency of the EC has scheduled the formal signing of the political, economic and monetary union treaty for February 7. Even if this deadline is met, ratification then requires the assent of 12 parliaments, and a referendum in Ireland and Denmark.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / London exiles put faith in Tsongas MR PAUL Tsongas won a stunning presidential caucus victory last night over governor Bill Clinton - in London, writes Ken Warn. The ex-senator won 53 per cent of the vote at the London meeting of Democrats Abroad, the party's overseas arm, against 15 per cent for Mr Clinton. Some 32 per cent registered as uncommitted. The caucus, amid the hoopla balloons of US political campaigning, took place in London's National Liberal Club. Presided over by party worker and actress Deena Gornick as Aunty Sam, the vote was part of Iowa-style caucuses held in 22 countries to elect delegates to three regional conventions for Democrats Abroad. These meetings in turn choose delegates to the Democratic National Convention, where Democrats Abroad will send 22 delegates and two alternates, with nine votes, out of a total of 4,288. For Democrats Abroad this was the first caucus, rather than a postal ballot.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Resources must not be wasted Sir, We hear that fewer women than ever are numbered among senior British managers. Recently, while awaiting a delayed flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow, I sat near the telephones in the Shuttle lounge. Over the next two hours a stream of businessmen phoned their wives/secretaries/girlfriends to rearrange what time they were to be collected, postpone dinner appointments, and 'be taken straight to the opera house'. One man spoke to his child. A similar procession of businesswomen phoned their nannies/childminders and mothers to re-arrange children's tea, bath and bedtime. Most of the women talked to the children, explained why they were going to be late and offered reassurance and comfort. This is hardly a random sample but on reflection I pity the men - no wonder we women start our own businesses. Hedda Bird, managing director, Conservation Papers, 228 London Road, Reading</p>

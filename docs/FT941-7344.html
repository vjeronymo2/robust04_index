			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / SIB plans split of safety funds Financial services companies will no longer have to bail out companies in other sectors of the industry that are unable to meet their liabilities to investors, under new arrangements published yesterday by the City's chief watchdog. The proposals from the Securities and Investments Board will mean an end to present arrangements for the investors' compensation scheme, under which costs - up to a liability of Pounds 100m a year - are met by a levy on all the firms which are members of the self-regulating organ-isations. The ICS offers a safety net for investors who are entitled to redress but find that the firm responsible for their predicament has gone out of business. The paper underlines SIB's aim of withdrawing from direct regulation of firms. It says that those firms which it does regulate will be treated for the purposes of the compensation scheme as though they belonged to the appropriate self-regulating organisation. Since this decision was the most controversial of the proposals, it offers further evidence that SIB is determined that even firms that are not enthusiastic should have as little choice as possible about joining the new regulator for retail financial services, the Personal Investment Authority. Cross-contribution has been a contentious issue in the industry. Under the new ICS arrangements each self-contained fund will have a limit of Pounds 100m for its potential liability to claims. Assuming the PIA comes into existence there will be three funds, one for PIA members, one for members of Imro, the self-regulating organisation for the fund-management industry, and one for the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body for private-client stockbrokers. The date for the introduction of the new 'stand-alone' funds will depend on when the PIA becomes operational, which is expected to be in mid-July.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Fears of overvalued Real Brazil's central bank yesterday intervened in the foreign exchange markets for the first time since the July launch of a new currency, the Real. The bank was reported to be buying moderate quantities of dollars in return for Reals. The move follows mounting concern that the Real is overvalued against the US dollar. Foreign investment, mainly via the stock market, has flowed into Brazil since the currency's launch, amid rising optimism about the country's economic outlook. The Real has appreciated nearly 15 per cent since July and yesterday opened at 0.85 to the dollar. But the rise in the Real has led to worries, especially among exporters, that Brazil's trade performance might suffer. With foreign exchange reserves of more than Dollars 40bn, and a trade surplus of Dollars 13.1bn last year, the country faces no serious balance of payments risk. But the government is also in the process of lifting import tariffs and is trying to soften the impact of greater foreign competition on some less-competitive sectors of the economy.</p>

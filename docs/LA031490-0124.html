			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER GIVES UP ON JAZZ CLUB PLANS  </P> <P> A local developer has abandoned plans to open a downtown jazz club because of  the city's building moratorium.  </P> <P> The freeze on all new construction was imposed in January by a City Council  concerned about potential water shortages this summer.  </P> <P> The jazz club would have occupied a former bank building, but the moratorium  also prohibits any renovation that would increase water use by 25%.  </P> <P> "The City Council imposed a broad, sweeping law, and we just got caught up in  it," developer Ray Campbell said. "I'm tired of fighting for this."  </P> <P> Campbell's club on north El Camino Real was approved last November by the City  Council, despite complaints from some downtown residents that the night spot  would cause parking and traffic problems.  </P> <P> "It just took the pleasure out of the effort," Campbell said of the moratorium.  "I've got other things to do than to hassle it out for another 10 months."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The seven-party ruling  coalition is splitting into two groups as differences have grown  over how to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  who announced his resignation Friday, political sources said  Monday.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP) and the new party Sakigake [Harbinger] are  strengthening unity against the coalition's majority group  comprising Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and the  Japan New Party (JNP).    Meanwhile, the main opposition group, the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), continues to watch and wait, putting priority on  keeping its own unity and preventing defections as the two  coalition groups woo its members, they said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the coalition's  largest party, Sunday proposed holding a meeting of the heads of  all the coalition parties at noon Monday to discuss who should  succeed Hosokawa as prime minister.    Murayama's proposal aims at leveling up to the top leaders  of  coalition parties from the present level of secretaries general  to discuss the choice of a successor to Hosokawa.    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Masayoshi  Takemura supported the idea but Shinseito and Komeito rejected  the proposal.    Hosokawa, the JNP head, also responded coolly to Murayama's  proposal.    On Sunday, the secretaries general of the coalition parties  began discussions on how to choose the next premier but the  meeting broke up after only 20 minutes because of differences  between the two groups.    Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, regarded as the  coalition's chief strategist during the eight months of  Hosokawa's government, said, "there was a consensus that the  caucus of the ruling parties (at the level of secretaries  general) is to discuss" the choice of a successor.    Ozawa told reporters that if the heads of the SDPJ, the DSP  and Sakigake attend the proposed leaders' meeting it would  constitute "a private talk."    Koji Morimoto, chairman of Komeito's Diet Affairs Committee,  also told a news conference Sunday that his party will not  accept Murayama's proposal for a meeting of the coalition party  heads.    Shinseito and Komeito are considering throwing their support  behind the LDP's Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister, as  a candidate for the premiership if he defects from the LDP, the  sources said. On Sunday, Watanabe signaled his readiness to bolt  from the LDP and join hands with all or portions of the  coalition if a comfortable number of LDP members to leave the  party with him.    Sakigake is scheduled to announce an outline on forming the  next government Monday and is likely to begin seeking a tie-up  with reformers within the LDP, the sources said.</p>

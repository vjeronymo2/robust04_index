"However, the opening of Tuzla airport will be permitted  under the conditions somewhat different from those proposed by  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, for his scenario is  unacceptable for the RS. The French foreign minister has  clearly indicated the West would like to apply the Sarajevo  recipe, in the form of a NATO ultimatum, in the case of Tuzla  airport. Was the experience of the Sarajevo ultimatum not  sufficient for Mr Juppe?", Buha said.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: Renaissance reworked - The artistic quality of paintings rather than the subject is what really matters The present public debate on the merits of figurative as opposed to abstract painting is based on an unsustainable prejudice: that figurative is inherently good; and that abstract is too easy - a snare and a delusion. Yet there is clearly no objection to abstraction of itself - or where would music be, or architecture, or the great decorative traditions of Islam and the east? And what about the strange acknowledged power of the single, simple stone standing in the middle of the field, or the middle of Whitehall for that matter? But the general feeling is that because the visual arts, and painting especially, possess the facility of direct representation, then that facility must be exercised, come what may. Yet it is never the mere reference that makes the art, or every Crucifixion or Annunciation would be as good as any other. The distinctions to be drawn between them are as abstract, formal and intuitively obvious as those between any Mozart and Salieri. It is only the quality of what the artist does that matters, of whatever kind, and in London we have work pass through the galleries, often coincidentally, to make the very point. Paul Storey, at 37, is still quite young, but the scope of his work, as much in its scale and technical application as in its subject-matter, bespeaks an ageless ambition. Certainly he is rare in attempting, as he has done consistently since his student days, the full-dress subjects of the Renaissance tradition, both sacred and profane - the Virgin Mary or The Baptism of Christ on the one hand, Agamemnon or The Rape of Helen on the other. He has studied deeply the art of 15th century Italy, of Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca in particular, to which in costume and architecture his reference is insistent. Yet the cocktail is more complex than that, for, to add to the Italian serene, there is more than a pinch of the northern grotesque and fantastical. And while again he stays with the 15th century, and with Bosch, he also seems closer to our own times in this respect, to Victorian fairy painters such as Richard Dadd, and to the great Edwardian illustrator, Arthur Rackham. But it is this grotesque aspect, always markedly characteristic of Storey's work - and a most effective device besides by which to draw attention to a young artist - which now seems increasingly forced and artificial. When mannerism becomes affectation, it ceases to serve, and here too often we have an histrionic distortion that attracts attention only to itself. The encouraging thing is that Storey now makes the point himself in so many of the smaller, less overtly ambitious works, the small, straight forward heads especially, which are by far the best things shown. This is an accomplished show which makes us look forward positively to the next. Ellsworth Kelly's new paintings could hardly afford a greater contrast. Now over 70, Kelly is an American painter and sculptor who came to prominence in the 1950s and early '60s upon the wave of minimalist reaction to the tuff-boot extravagance of abstract expressionism. And if anyone is to give minimalism a good name, it is he. Yet the bare description of his work must give any sceptic ammunition - a roomful of variations upon the simple sector, either variously imposed upon a square white canvas as a blue, green, red or yellow figure, or presented simply as a discrete red or white panel: a pure white square canvas set askew upon a black, or a green upon a blue; a large yellow equilateral triangle set on its side with a smaller black right-angled triangle; an orange right-angled triangle and a grey chord set together upon the mutual vertical. And of course we all could do as well, given the same refinement of sensibility and exquisite nicety of judgment. We worry too much about the artist and the apparent simplicity of his work, and tend to forget that the work, on its own terms, actually works. Kelly gives us now the subtlest chromatic dissonance, now the gentlest of harmonies: the composition now formal and monumental, now light and active, the contours sprung taut as a bow. And it all acts upon the eye and the sympathetic imagination like a drop of pure water falling into a clear pool. Two floors above the Kelly, at Annely Juda, we have a last chance to see Line + Movement, a small but magisterial show of work from the European abstract constructivist tradition from which Kelly himself springs - indeed it includes a work of his of 1959. It is a selection of very high quality, from Fritz Glarner and Naum Gabo to Max Bill and Kenneth Martin. Best of all it has a group of paintings from 1927 by Mondrian in his prime. Arrangements of rectangular black lines on an off-white ground, selectively filled in with blue and red and yellow, nothing more, and they sing like Lorenzo's angels. You have until Saturday to hear them. Paul Storey - New Paintings: Jason &amp; Rhodes, 4 New Burlington Place W1, until October 15. Ellsworth Kelly - New Paintings: Anthony d'Offay Gallery, 21, 23 &amp; 24 Dering Street W1, until October 18. Line + Movement: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until September 17.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / California dominates primary day in US California dominates the heaviest mid-term primary round today in the US, where eight states choose candidates to contest four governorships, five senate seats and 87 House of Representatives places. Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, and Ms Kathleen Brown, the Democratic state treasurer, are strongly favoured in California to emerge as opponents in the country's most important race in November. The outcome will have a heavy bearing on the 1996 presidential election  - a Republican victory would be a clear setback for President Bill Clinton and the Democrats. Mr Wilson must first beat Mr Ron Unz, a computer magnate from the far right whose campaign has been mostly self-financed. The governor holds a lead of upwards of 20 points. Ms Brown's father, Edmund G. Brown Sr, known as Pat, and her brother Jerry each served two terms as governor of California. She must overcome challenges from Mr John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, and Mr Tom Hayden, now a state senator, once an anti-Vietnam War activist and once husband of Jane Fonda, the actress. Six months ago, with California still in recession and Mr Wilson unpopular, Ms Brown seemed certain to continue the family political dynasty. But, with her campaign lacking definition and the economy improving, the governor, prominent in rebuilding efforts after the Los Angeles earthquake in January, has recovered. Mr Wilson has also benefited politically by riding with the Californian backlash against illegal immigration. A Los Angeles Times poll last week found 59:32 per cent support for a proposition that may be on the November ballot and would bar illegal immigrants from many public services, including education. Ms Brown opposes such a move. Also closely watched is the race for the Senate seat held by Ms Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. Her likely Republican challenger is Congressman Michael Huffington, if he beats former Congressman Bill Dannemeyer, another ultra-conservative. Mr Huffington's main claims to fame are less his political record than his vast oil wealth - he spent a national record of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) to win his House seat two years ago - and ambitious wife. She is the former Ms Arianna Stassinopoulos, an author who cut a wide social swathe through Britain in the 1970s and now seems intent on propelling her husband to the top of the US political tree. Again, Ms Feinstein had looked unbeatable, but her approval ratings have dropped below 50 per cent and she now holds poll leads of only 5-14 points. As in the Wilson-Brown race, Ms Feinstein and Mr Huffington have already begun directly attacking each other. In other races across the country, there is less opportunity for the fundamentalist right to make a clear mark, as happened last weekend with the nomination of Mr Oliver North as Republican senatorial candidate in Virginia. Senator Bob Dole, Republican minority leader in the Senate, was concerned enough about the broader message of that selection to say he might not welcome Mr North to the chamber. Most closely watched will be the Democratic senate primary in Montana, where Senator Conrad Burns is one of the few vulnerable Republicans for November. Mr Jack Mudd is favoured to beat former Senator John Melcher, but the Democratic race has been complicated by the presence of a third candidate, Ms Becky Shaw, girl-friend of a former close aide to Mr Melcher. She may draw votes from Mr Mudd. In Iowa, Governor Terry Branstad, in pursuit of a fourth term, is in a tight Republican primary against Congressman Fred Grandy.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS TO PRINT EDITED MAGAZINE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: DOZENS OF POEMS, STORIES AND ARTWORKS WERE CHANGED OR DROPPED BY  SCHOOL AUTHORITIES. CENSORSHIP IS CHARGED.  </P> <P> Amid charges of censorship, students at Redondo Union High School went to press  Friday with a student literary magazine in which more than half a dozen  allegedly offensive artworks, poems and stories had been altered or excised at  the behest of school officials.  </P> <P> Scott Powell, the 18-year-old editor of the student publication Opus, said the  changes were forced on staffers after a teacher who was not involved with the  magazine seized the galleys 2 1/2 weeks ago and complained to the principal  that some submissions were sacrilegious and obscene.  </P> <P> Among the items the teacher found objectionable, Powell said, were a poem by an  honor student titled "(expletive) Authority" and a drawing of a demon  swallowing a crucifix on which the face of Christ was a Happy Face logo.  </P> <P> "The material that was presented to me was very obscene," said Principal Jack  Clement, who added that he responded by convening a five-member committee of  faculty and administration "to review the literary merit" of the publication.  Clement said he was particularly concerned that parents and others in the  community would be offended by the profanity and religious and sexual  references in some of the works.  </P> <P> "As a school official, I feel I have a responsibility to make sure the image  our school projects reflects our various audiences," he said. "Yes, there ought  to be freedom of expression. But we serve several different audiences, not only  in our school but in our community, and our charge is to bring out the best in  our students in terms of their writing and talent."  </P> <P> But students disagreed, as did the magazine's faculty adviser, David Lemire,  who, like Clement, sat on the committee.  </P> <P> "Many of the things (Clement) wanted edited were so insignificant," said  Lemire, an English teacher who has been volunteer adviser to the magazine for  three years.  </P> <P> Lemire noted, too, that this is Clement's first year with the district.  </P> <P> "I think he just wanted to avoid any potential phone call from any potential  parent of any potential frame of mind," Lemire said.  </P> <P> Lemire said that even though the author of the poem had already agreed to  change its title and the magazine staff volunteered to excise the sketch,  Clement alerted the committee to dozens of submissions that he felt should be  censored, ranging from a sketch of a serpent entwined around a crucifix to the  use of such words as rape. Most of Clement's suggestions -- including those two  examples -- were overruled by the committee, Lemire and Clement agreed.  </P> <P> But, Lemire added, the principal exercised veto power over the committee in  some cases, insisting that all profanity involving the word God be removed from  the students' short stories and poems.  </P> <P> Clement denied that he had used veto power over the committee.  </P> <P> "It was an open, collaborative effort, and . . . we walked away feeling that we  had enhanced the quality of the product," Clement said.  </P> <P> Lemire said he and Powell plan to bring the matter before the South Bay Union  High School District trustees at their next meeting.  </P> <P> Moreover, he said, he has consulted the American Civil Liberties Union about  his concerns, along with the Washington-based People for the American Way, a  national First Amendment rights watchdog organization. Ironically, People for  the American Way recently lauded Redondo Beach's elementary trustees for  withstanding efforts by a local Christian parents' group to censor the  grade-school reading curricula.  </P> <P> "From what I can tell, it seems to be a pretty broad and sweeping attempt at  censorship," said Deanna Duby, senior staff attorney for the group, adding that  many of the changes appeared to be illegal under the California Education Code.  The code expressly prohibits censorship of student publications by school  officials except where a publication is obscene, libelous, slanderous or an  incitement to unlawful or disruptive activity.  </P> <P> School Board President William Beverly, told about the censored materials,  added that he was surprised the students had not yet complained to the board.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen what the offending works were, but from what I'm hearing, much  of what the committee found objectionable wouldn't upset a person of ordinary  sensibilities," he said.  </P> <P> But school Supt. Walter Hale defended Clement's actions.  </P></p>

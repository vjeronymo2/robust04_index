			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / CBS abandons Dollars 7bn QVC merger in face of rival bid A proposed Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) merger between CBS, the US television broadcasting network, and QVC, the cable television shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, collapsed yesterday in the face of a rival Dollars 2.2bn bid for QVC by Comcast, one of the US's leading cable television service companies. Comcast, which is one of QVC's three largest shareholders, with a 15 per cent stake, surprised Wall Street late on Tuesday night with the news that it strongly disliked the CBS/QVC merger and was itself launching a cash and stock bid for QVC worth around Dollars 44 a share. That is substantially higher than the Dollars 38 a share offer for QVC announced by CBS two weeks ago. CBS said yesterday that it would not pursue the acquisition of QVC and would instead launch a cash tender offer for up to 3.5m CBS shares - roughly 20 per cent of its fully diluted stock outstanding - at a price of Dollars 325 a share. The move will cost around Dollars 1.1bn, which is about the size of CBS's cash pile. The tender was viewed by Wall Street as designed partly to protect CBS's share price following the collapse of the QVC deal, which had been viewed very positively on Wall Street and included a cash distribution to shareholders of Dollars 175 a share. CBS stock rose Dollars 8 to Dollars 308 at the close of trading, while QVC jumped Dollars 6 to Dollars 42 and Comcast dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 1/8 . Comcast said it would sell assets or bring in partners to finance its offer for QVC, which analysts said would stretch its finances, but it denied suggestions that it was interested more in derailing the CBS deal than taking over QVC. Still, yesterday's developments left both CBS and QVC as sitting targets for bids from other media companies and raised a large question mark over the future of Mr Diller, one of Hollywood's top programming talents, who joined QVC 18 months ago. He aimed to use its television shopping business as a springboard to build a broad-based, multi-media television programming empire. Under the CBS merger agreement, he would have become chief executive of the combined group. Mr Ralph Roberts, chairman of Comcast, and his son, Brian, chief executive, played an important part in persuading Mr Diller to join QVC and said yesterday they would 'be pleased' if he chose to remain as the company's chief executive. Wall Street analysts felt it highly unlikely that Mr Diller would wish to remain in the humdrum world of home shopping, working for men who had destroyed his deal with CBS, though many also doubted he would still want to join CBS, since he is ambitious to head a company in which he has a large personal stake, rather than being an employee. It is the second time in six months Mr Diller has failed with an ambitious QVC takeover deal. In February he lost a Dollars 10bn battle to acquire entertainment group Paramount Communications - a deal Comcast strongly supported. Comcast objected to the QVC-CBS merger because it sees its stake in QVC as a means of building up a strong presence in television programming, where it has few interests. Because federal law limits broadcasters and cable operators to a 5 per cent voting stake in companies in each others' industries, its clout at QVC would have been significantly diluted by the CBS deal. So too would that of Liberty Media, a cable programming group which owns 15 per cent of QVC and is a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable service company in the US. TCI raised no objection to the QVC-CBS deal and has yet to make clear its attitude to the Comcast offer. Lex, Page 26 CBS results, Page 31</p>

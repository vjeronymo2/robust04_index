			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Herodiade - Queen Elizabeth Hall Chelsea Opera Group gave on Sunday a concert performance of Massenet's Herodiade that was nearly as successful as their Thais a few years ago. The achievement was only a lesser one in the way the work itself is: whereas Thais, a chamber drama for all its touches of exotic spectacle, contains its Grand Opera gestures within a beautifully economic account of human sexuality and human frailty, the earlier opera gives rather too often the impression of attempting to 'do an Aida' - to the detriment of Massenet's most valuable gifts. These included - as the best parts of Sunday's concert proved beyond argument - the ability to make sensuously curling melody and the intimate portrayal of characters in a state of weakness part of the same dramatic impulse. The principals of Herodiade, an opera some way 'after Flaubert' and before Wilde and Strauss, are a candidly innocent Salome (soprano), whose mother abandoned her in childhood, a Baptist (tenor) not unaffected by her charms (it is not she who clamours for his head), a clamorous, doubt-torn Herodias (mezzo) who discloses her relationship to her supposedly long-lost daughter in the opera's closing bars), and a Herod (baritone) openly in pursuit of the young girl. Whenever the four and their linked affections are dramatised in close-up, all four-square brassiness disappears. In such passages, the potency of Massenet's feeling for music-drama is not in question. Certainly, the strengths of Sunday's reading were connected with the quartet of leading characters. The casting was imaginative: young British or British-based singers, all able to deliver reasonable-sounding French - in the case of Brian Bannatyne-Scott's Phanuel and Rosa Mannion's Salome, better than that - and all able to temper large phrases with delicacy and shapeliness. By contrast, while the COG chorus and orchestra mustered their energies impressively under Michael Lloyd's vigilant baton, the Grand Opera outward trappings seemed dated and secondhand. The most complete Massenites of the evening were Anne-Marie Owens (Herodias), whose wide-ranging, lustrous mezzo is now well fitted for a whole host of big 19th-century roles, and Mr Bannatyne-Scott, whose velvety tones are filling out without forcing, and whose sense of style is impeccable. Forcing at the top was the single flaw of Miss Mannion's charming, notably musical Salome; to Massenet's dramatic-tenor Baptist, Graeme Matheson-Bruce brought dignity and power at climaxes, if not much cantabile grace. Peter Sidhom, suffering a throat infection, was nevertheless a strong, firm-toned Herod. The smaller parts were well taken by (among others) Glenville Hargreaves and Katrina Makepeace-Lott. On such an evening as this Chelsea Opera Group seem as necessary to London musical life as ever.</p>

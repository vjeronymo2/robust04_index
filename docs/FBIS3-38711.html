			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still photograph of President </F> Demirel]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the heavy  weapons of those besieging Sarajevo must be silenced with an air  operation within the framework of the UN and NATO resolutions,  and that effective measures must be taken to lift the siege.    In a message he sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija  Izetbegovic, Demirel expressed his deep regret over the  horrendous attack in Sarajevo. He said: This recent attack  shows once again that the time has come and gone for the  civilized world and for the international organizations that  represent it to fulfill their responsibilities. I call on the  civilized world once again to silence with an air operation --  within the framework of the UN and NATO resolutions -- the heavy  weapons of those forces mercilessly besieging Sarajevo as soon  as possible, and to take effective measures to lift this siege.  I am conveying our demands regarding this issue with messages  to the concerned international organizations and to the leaders  of the leading countries of the world.    I extend Turkey's and my own personal condolences to the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina for those killed in this despicable  attack. I affirm that, as always, Turkey is on the side of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and is ready to extend to it every kind of  support.    Taking this opportunity, I extend my deepest respects.</p>

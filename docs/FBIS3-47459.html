			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Iwao Nakatani, professor at Hitotsubashi </F> University: "No Way Out Yet Seen for Heisei Recession"]    [Text] Frankly, forecasts for the Japanese economy for  1994 are not bright in the least. Compared to the previous  year, a 2-percent decrease is still seen in placement of orders  for machinery and for construction, which are indicators of  future capital investment, and there is no sign of recovery in  consumption. After all, the Heisei recession has lingered on for  almost three years, and there are not yet signs of its end. On  top of this, prospects for future employment are seriously  deteriorating.    In the past, the Showa depression [1920's] and the Great  Depression of the United States were triggered by ruptures of  giant bubbles in the economies of Japan and the United States.  In both cases, several years were required to emerge from the  effects of the ruptures. In the Great Depression, for example,  the U.S. economy reached its worst condition in the fourth year  following the big crash in stock prices. The slump started in  1929, with stock prices plunging to one-eighth of their original  value by 1933. The real gross national product was one-half of  that of 1929, and the unemployment rate reached 25 percent.  Capital investment fell from $40.4 billion in 1929 to $5.3  billion in 1933. The economic growth rate finally became  positive in 1934, the fifth year following the rupture.    The Heisei recession need not follow the same path as the  U.S. Great Depression did, which would be a great calamity. But  it bears many resemblances to the U.S. case in such phenomena as  the following: financial institutions are confronting a large  number of bad loans; transactions involving assets have greatly  diminished; capital investment has been very low for a long  time; and so on. Taking these factors into consideration, to our  regret, the Japanese economy may yet face its worst period, but  it is hoped that a light at the end of the tunnel may be found  in 1995.    One bright prospect is that the foreign economic situation,  led by the United States, is on the way to recovery. The U.S.  growth rate is expected to rise to 4 percent in 1994. Its  high-technology industries centering on automobiles and  computers have regained confidence and its volume of capital  investment has increased. In Europe, too, light has at last  begun to shine. The United Kingdom has recovered, and Germany  has apparently reached a state of recovery, though hovering at a  low level. No doubt recoveries in foreign economies will  favorably affect the Japanese economy.    Another bright factor is related to the exchange rate.  Japanese export-oriented industries cannot make both ends meet  with the exchange rate at a level of 100 yen to the dollar. As  a result, the quantity of exports has rapidly decreased. Thus,  the current account balance of payments surplus began to shrink,  in terms of both the yen and the dollar. The exchange rate  responded favorably to this, and began to move toward  depreciation of the yen. The rapid U.S. business recovery may  possibly serve to slow down moves toward curtailing the trade  imbalance. In addition, disparities between foreign and  domestic interest rates are beginning to widen, which is another  factor helping to create a strong dollar and a weak yen.    The yen appreciation shock following the Plaza Accord was  absorbed comparatively easily by greatly expanded domestic  demand created immediately after the agreement. But the current  strength of the yen came in the midst of a sluggish economic  situation, and rational investments in automobile and  electronics industries alone cannot mitigate the shock. If the  yen rate returns to the level of 120 yen per dollar,  export-oriented industries may yet fare very well.    Irrespective of these encouraging factors, the fact that  1994  will be a severe year for the Japanese economy must be faced.  When the fact that employment statistics are lagging indicators  of economic realities is taken into consideration, it may easily  be predicted that the unemployment rate will reach 3 percent.    Therefore, it is necessary to implement structural economic  reform based on a long-range view, in addition to taking  short-term emergency economic measures. In order to prevent the  current economic condition from deteriorating further, it is  urgently required to put in force daring pump-priming measures  to revitalize business conditions. In that case, an  aggregate-demand policy such as simply reducing income taxes  will not suffice. The effects of the rupture of the bubble  economy linger on as burdens on the Japanese economy, and  policies are needed to eradicate them. Such capital market  activation measures as expediting depreciation of bad loans, tax  reforms to solicit active land transaction and utilization, land  procurement by public funds, and so on are inevitable.    After carrying out these short-term measures to the fullest  extent possible, a bold restructuring with the 21st century in  mind should be enforced in a daring manner. Tax reform, with  adjustments in the ratio of direct and indirect taxes as the  major element, should come first, followed by liberalization of  controls and regulations. As for deregulation, the Hiraiwa  report [by the Economic Reform Research Council] calls for  "abolition of economic controls and regulations in principle"  and a total review of all regulations within five years. This  is an epoch-making proposal for Japan, which is bound by  controls and regulations, and will depend for its success on  actual implementation.    In addition, a sweeping expansion of social capital is  necessary with the 21st century close at hand. So far, public  investment has been lamentably insufficient to meet the the  great needs of an aging society, as well as needs for skills and  information. The current basic plan for public investment has  to be reviewed in its entirety so that budget appropriations may  be adjusted to meet the needs of the times, and at least 1  trillion yen must be reserved and accumulated additionally for  this purpose. In order to ensure further development, it is  inevitable for Japan to actively build up social capital  required for its future. This must be done within the next 15  years, in which time Japan will still be able to reserve funds  before the aging of its society begins in earnest.    Economic reform is an inevitable task for Japan, which must  create an economic society of greater creativity and more  vitality. I hope that the Heisei recession will be used as an  opportunity to carry out that structural reform.</p>

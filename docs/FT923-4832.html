			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Big rally in futures STERLING futures rallied sharply yesterday afternoon after the Bank of England announced that it would borrow Ecu10bn to buy sterling on the foreign exchanges. After a week in which both cash and futures have priced in a rise in UK base rates, dealers were totally surprised by yesterday's announcement. Many regarded it as an ingenious means by which to support sterling against the D-Mark. According to one trader, the borrowing of at least DM5bn will act as an antidote to last month's depletion of the UK's foreign currency reserves, which were sharply depleted following last month's heavy intervention. Others noted that the borrowing would heavily support the UK gilt market and the government's borrowing requirement, by reducing the pressure to hold gilt auctions. The announcement was followed by a dramatic rally in sterling futures. The September short sterling contract added 28 basis points in the afternoon to close at 89.74. There was much heavier trading in the December contract, however, which rose 30 basis points from its opening level to close at 89.70. Three-month money immed-iately fell by  1/4 percentage point on the offered side to 10 3/8 per cent. The rates for everything from five months out to one year fell by  7/16 , to close at 10 7/16 per cent on the offered side. All these moves restored prices to where they had been before the dollar dropped through its historic low against the D-Mark two weeks ago. However, one clearing bank dealer said the Treasury's move will only be deemed successful if major investment funds buy sterling on the back of it. 'If they move funds into sterling, rates could go down even more,' he said. 'If not, the effects will quickly be forgotten next week.' The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 450m at the start of its money market operation, although it took most of the day to be removed. A commercial bank dealer said the shortage was in the discount market, while the clearers were probably square or even long, following Pounds 1.205bn of exchequer transactions yesterday. The Bank purchased Pounds 1m of Band 1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 114m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 105m.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Books: Author as idolater U AND I by Nicholson Baker Granta Pounds 12.99, 179 pages SO MANY novels are written, but so many more are stillborn, sabotaged by laziness or rejected by perfectionism. Many hopeful novelists are muzzled by the fear of unintentional plagiarism: to the fragile ego of the unpublished writer, the faintest sense of literary indebtedness can seem like imitation, and chapter two is abandoned in despair. Nicholson Baker circumvents the problem of literary indebtedness in this, his third novel, by taking it as his subject. His last book, Room Temperature (an extended prose-poem of love to his wife disguised as a sequence of witty meanderings which occurred to him while he was feeding his baby) showed that he could saucily confound the expectations of critics and readers. Now, U and I, 'a true story', and a portrait of the artist as an idolater and imitator of John Updike, again defies easy categorisation. We gather that Baker has read little of Updike, despite his preoccupation of 13 years. Nevertheless, he is informed about his idol's life and feeds us a miscellany of details. He eagerly identifies parallels between Updike's condition and his own and is appropriately abject during two brief encounters. Updike first fired Baker's literary ambitions; yet now, paradoxically, his example often intimidates him into silence. But those unable to share Baker's view of his inspiration's 'brilliance and longevity' will be pleased to hear that this book is primarily an idiosyncratic literary compendium. As he digresses, from the evils of the thesaurus, to literary gossip, to the trespasses of critics, Baker's neurotic tone fluctuates between mock-apology and po-faced irony. He is garrulous about literary reputations, and amusing when reminding us that they are often based on misquotation. He extols the novel as the greatest literary form; and his flamboyantly long sentences and arcane vocabulary indicate that he is testing the form's possibilities. His judgment is not infallible, however: suggestions of homophobia disappoint, particularly when they later involve him in the placatory but ambitious claim that 'most good novelists have been women or homosexuals'. There is also the occasional suspicion that this is mere legerdemain. Can Baker really be as badly read as he claims? Are his gaucheness and modesty genuine, or merely clever opportunism artfully disguised? And what of his desire to outwit critics? After all, autobiography disguised as literary manual is not new, but his references to Cyril Connolly's Enemies of Promise carefully pre-empt accusations of imitation. On balance, however, he charms and amuses us into forgiveness: if this is trickery, it is nothing if not brazen and entertaining. But it will be interesting to see what he attempts next; and also to see how, if at all, Updike responds.</p>

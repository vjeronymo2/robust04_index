			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mino Fuccillo: "The Challenge of the Prime </F> Ministers"]    [Text] Three on one side, and three on the  other--just like the Horatii and the Curiatii--in the battle for  Chigi Palace [office of the prime minister]. Mario Segni has  many sponsors [preceding word in English], but in an area that  is not very homogeneous. And Bossi--or even Berlusconi--might  come to the fore. The left says: "There is a candidate, but his  name is not being spoken."    Do you recall the story of the Horatii and the Curiatii? It  used to be taught in school. They were three against three, and  at the end only one remained standing. Something similar is  occurring a couple of centuries later, also in the region of  Rome: three "champions" per team, and in the end only one will  be prime minister. The "moderate" or "center-right" team--also  referred to as the "freedom axis"--consists of Mario Segni,  Umberto Bossi, and Silvio Berlusconi. The "progressive" or  "left" team--also referred to as the "reformist axis"--counters  with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Achille Occhetto, and Giorgio  Napolitano. The voters will decide who will be the Horatii and  who the Curiatii, that is to say, who will be the victors and  who the vanquished. Many other factors will play a role in  determining who of the six will be the last to remain standing.  Let us try to identify the factors involved.    Mario Segni is the first--and, in fact, the  leading--anti-left candidate. Yesterday, he received the support  and homage of the "lay members of the Pact for Italy," as former  PLI [Italian Liberal Party] Deputy Secretary Patuelli and the  well-remembered former Cultural Heritage Minister Bono Parrino  now call themselves. Segni also received an expression of  support yesterday from Martinazzoli (now a daily occurrence), on  condition that he not cast his lot with Bossi, and from Bossi,  on condition that he turn a deaf ear to Martinazzoli. Despite  these minor problems that remain to be solved, quite a few  people favor Segni as head of the future government, including  the newborn Italian Popular Party [PPI] (Martinazzoli); the  rising Forza Italia party (Berlusconi); the CCD [Christian  Democratic Center], in its initial endorsement (Mastella and  friends); and Lega, in its initial alliance with the  "politicians." They all want Segni and are pledged to support  him.    Segni does have a problem, however, and it is a big one: as  his supporters increase in number, so also do those who have  faith in him only up to a certain point. Also increasing in  number are those supporters who, because of certain resentments,  are themselves more or less silent candidates and will change  sides at the opportune moment. An older--and spiteful--gentleman  such as Senator Miglio yesterday explained why. "Segni has  vacillated on too many occasions," Miglio said. "He has made it  plain that what he seeks is power, and above all to become  president." As anyone can see in photographs and on TV, Miglio  has good ears; he must have heard a few things and concluded  that Segni will have to win the elections by a large margin, for  otherwise the prime ministerial candidate who gets the greatest  exposure and highest approval ratings before the elections, in  fact, will be the least likely to become prime minister. Lega,  Forza Italia, the Popular Party, and their entourage may indeed  band together and run a kind of super ticket under the slogan  "Better dead than red" (the phrase is Giuliano Amato's). In that  case, Segni will be prime minister if the super ticket obtains a  clear majority of seats in Parliament. If the ticket falls only  a few dozen seats short, however, deals would have to be made  with different groups and the flag would perforce have to be  lowered. Would Fini come to the rescue? The MSI [Italian Social  Movement] secretary does not, in fact, appear to be very fond of  Mario Segni. Commenting on the most recent "Pact for Italy"  platform, he delivered the MSI's statement of annoyance and  disapproval. "All that the platform lacks," he said, "is a  promise that with Segni in Palazzo Chigi, there will be no more  rain."    But perhaps there will be no super ticket, and Lega and  Forza  Italia will go their own way, without the Popularists [members  of the PPI]. They would then need a different standard-bearer.  Perhaps Bossi himself, but that would be like the time when the  PCI [Italian Communist Party] sponsored Terracini for the  Presidency of the Republic: It was to pay him homage and issue a  challenge, and afterward the real negotiations began in earnest.  Or it could be Berlusconi himself, inasmuch as he is already out  of control--acting as party secretary, holding meetings,  negotiating, mediating, and giving orders. Moreover, if you take  at face value the polls that are concocted at Fininvest,  Berlusconi could even win the elections; with all due respect,  however, to go from president of Milan [soccer team] to prime  minister of Italy would be a giant step indeed. What will become  of Segni if the right decides to compete with the center? He  would remain the candidate of Martinazzoli and Pact for Italy.  It would then be necessary to make deals--perhaps with the  "progressives" who, however, would not accept Segni. The  Popularists would not mind that; some of their supporters have  already made note of the fact that it was Segni who moved them  to the right, and some also point out that Segni had previously  moved them to the left. They have already let it be known that  they will not forget.    And what of the other camp? At least for now, Achille  Occhetto is not accepting the urgent invitation from  Confindustria President Abete to announce the name of the left's  prime minister-designate. Failure to do so, Occhetto said, will  cause the left's candidates to lose credibility among the voters  whose support they seek. In an interview appearing in L'UNITA,  the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] secretary said that "a  law that does not exist should not necessarily be imitated,"  namely, a law mandating that a candidate's name be announced and  publicized. And yesterday Abete made a further explanation. "If  there were such a law," he said, "we would hold primaries within  our electoral alliance. Inasmuch as such a law does not exist, I  say this to anyone who votes for us: There are three possibile  candidates, if we are victorious. They are: The leader of the  strongest party in the alliance; a prominent figure in the  alliance who would represent it; or lastly, a prominent figure  whom I would call democracy's backup player." Outside of the  IdentiKit, however, there are three other possibilities:  Occhetto himself, Napolitano, and Ciampi. The progressives are  having some difficulty in choosing their candidate before the  election, and also some embarrassment. Occhetto's candidacy is a  somewhat frightening (and somewhat disappointing) prospect;  Napolitano's candidacy has the appearance of a banner that would  subsequently be lowered; and Ciampi's candidacy could emerge at  the end of the process but not at the beginning. Can you imagine  Orlando as the nominee, in view of the fact that he is already  tempted to send his Rete party to the polls alone in order to  gain strength in Sicilian electoral districts and campaign for  Ciampi? And can you imagine Cossutta in that role,  notwithstanding all the political realism that the Communist  Renewal party has manifested in recent days? And although Ciampi  took himself out of the race, we can speak to him about it  again, but only after the elections, when the voting results  themselves might suggest him--or impose him--as the solution.  Ciampi is the right man for the progressives if they win but do  not win decisively. D'Alema and Occhetto have already said this,  but how does one go about shouting it?    And so it is the Horatii versus the Curiatii, with Miglio,  as  usual, cutting the ground from under the feet of his own people  by saying: "The moderates do not have a real leader," and with  the progressives having perhaps more than one leader but not  knowing whether--or how--to bring him to the fore. Lastly, there  is the ultimate possibility: the prospect that, contrary to what  the story tells us, this time the Horatii and the Curiatii will  kill themselves off so that no one really wins the elections.  Those who predict a center-left that is oriented toward the year  2000--a government that is an enemy neither of the progressives  nor of the Popularists but rather a friend to both--are proving  to be correct. In that case, there is a seventh possibility:  Romano Prodi. Prodi is more acceptable to Martinazzoli than  Segni is and would perhaps not displease the progressives  either. But what really is the center-left? Is it a factor for  equilibrium in Italy or a ghost of those who will never return?  The answer will come on a night in the month of March.  <H5>  [Box, p 8 (Photo captions)] </H5> <H5>  Two Teams and Six Candidates </H5>   1. Umberto Bossi: The Lega's strongest leader.    2. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi: A leader for a broad progressive  sector. The moderates also like him.    3. Mario Segni: The moderate front is united behind him, but  if it suffers defeat, the current consensus could become a  boomerang [preceding word in English].    4. Achille Occhetto: He is head of the strongest party in  the  coalition that may well win the elections. In other countries,  this would be sufficient qualification to become prime  minister--but in Italy will it be enough?    5. Silvio Berlusconi: He has already found politics to his  liking. It is a long way from being president of Milan to being  prime minister, however.    6. Romano Prodi: Martinazzoli and the progressives like him.  He is a potential leader of a "center-left [government] of the  year 2000."</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia dampens hopes of Apec deal Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's international trade and industry minister, yesterday said there was little prospect that the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Indonesia next month would reach a binding free trade pact, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Responding to a statement from Mr Bob McMullan, Australian trade minister, who said on Sunday there was a better than 50-50 chance of an agreement, Mrs Rafidah said: 'I don't know that. Many countries do not subscribe to an Apec free trade agreement, not just Malaysia.' Mr McMullan said that despite differences on the pace of change within the 17-member Apec forum, leaders at the November 15 meeting would agree on a free trade initiat ive. 'My view is that the odds are better than 50-50 that we will get some agreement,' he said on television after attending an Apec trade ministers' meeting in Indonesia last week. Mrs Rafidah said even if an agreement was hammered out it would just be an 'academic exercise'. 'As I understand it, Apec operates on the basis of consensus,' she said. 'That means no country can be bound by anything that Apec decides. So this (trade agreement) would be just an academic exercise.' She said Malaysia preferred to realise free trade goals through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 'We have, in fact, ratified Gatt, but many other countries in Apec, including the US, especially the US, have not,' Mrs Rafidah said. 'How can you you talk about free trade in Apec when you can't fulfil your obligations under Gatt?' She reiterated Malaysia's position that Apec should be a consultative forum focusing on trade facilitation, technology transfer and human resource management. Mr McMullan said that if the leaders agreed to a goal of 2020 for free trade in the Asia-Pacific region, as suggested by Apec's eminent persons group, it would be an historic achievement. However, the actual date was not important. 'I think that once the process starts it is almost certain that it will accelerate,' Mr McMullan said. The eminent persons group has suggested a timeframe which staggers dismantling trade barriers between 2000 and 2020 depending on whether a country's economy is developed, industrialising or developing. Australia, the US, Singapore and Indonesia favour fast-tracking trade liberalisation in the region, while Japan, along with Malaysia, have expressed some reservations at the pace of change and the formal development of Apec. Apec groups Australia, the US, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.</p>

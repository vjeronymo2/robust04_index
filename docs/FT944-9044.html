			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Forsyth trial put on hold Mrs Elizabeth Forsyth, a close associate of Mr Asil Nadir, cannot be put on trial until the Swiss authorities have sent evidence to Britain, London's Bow Street magistrates were told yesterday. Prosecution solicitor Mr Peter Kiernan said the Serious Fraud Office hoped to have its requirements before Christmas. It was planned that Mrs Forsyth's case would then be transferred to a crown court. Mrs Forsyth chaired South Audley Management, the company that dealt with the personal tax and property affairs of Mr Nadir, chairman of the fruit-to-electronics company Polly Peck International. Mrs Forsyth successfully applied through her solicitor, Mr Peter Krivinskas, for reporting restrictions on the proceedings to be lifted. He said such an application was unusual. Presiding magistrate Mr John Holland said he had been advised that he had no discretion in the matter and had to grant the order. Adjourning the case until December 29, he told Mrs Forsyth her Pounds 20,000 bail would continue. Mr Nadir, who jumped bail of Pounds 3.5m last year and fled to northern Cyprus, faces charges of theft and false accounting involving Pounds 30m.</p>

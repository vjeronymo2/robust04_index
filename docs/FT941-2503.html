			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Gonzalez deal on top party jobs: Compromise avoids Socialist rift ahead of European elections Mr Felipe Gonzalez , the Spanish prime minister, was forced yesterday to accept a compromise with hardliners in the allocation of top Socialist party posts. The deal, reached after long hours of bargaining in the party's three-day conference here, avoided an open rift which threatened serious damage to the party ahead of European and regional elections in June. Mr Alfonso Guerra, leader of the hardline faction, succeeded in placing his most senior allies in top posts, even though his overall support within the party's executive committee was reduced from almost half to a quarter. Mr Guerra himself kept his job as party number two under Mr Gonzalez, after threatening to pull out if the leadership were not 'balanced'. Against opposition by senior moderates in the party, he also managed to keep a prominent ally, Mr Jose Mara Benegas, in the top leadership, although not in his previous job running the party's organisation. That job finally went to a relatively obscure politician from Valencia, Mr Cipria Ciscar, with Mr Benegas taking over the party's political and institutional relations. The committee proposed by Mr Gonzalez was approved by 89 per cent of delegates at the conference, the party's first since 1990. All-night negotiations, which broke off at dawn yesterday, were resumed yesterday, delaying the end of the conference. Mr Gonzalez had admitted earlier in the conference that there was 'considerable internal tension' in party ranks. He has brought two of his top ministers, deputy prime minister Mr Narcs Serra and foreign minister Mr Javier Solana, into the executive committee. That was enlarged to make room for a larger number of women, who now make up a third. Infighting over the top posts obscured the policy debate, in which the government's free-market and budget-cutting positions had an easy ride. The party gave top priority to job-creation, backed a 'rigorous choice' in government spending and a curb on fraud, and pledged itself to 'create conditions in which private initiative can act more effectively'.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / France unveils its proposals for independent central bank THE FRENCH government yesterday outlined its plan to give the Bank of France independence, shedding a tradition of tight political control over monetary policy in the interest of anchoring inflation at a low level. International experience has shown that 'those countries which enjoy the greatest monetary stability are those which have entrusted the conduct of monetary policy to an inde-pendent central bank', Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said. The draft statute, which must be approved by parliament, provides for the creation of a nine-member monetary policy committee within the Bank of France. It would be composed of the bank's governor, his two deputies and six outsiders, appointed by the government from a shortlist provided by other institutions for nine-year terms. He hoped that the committee would not be stacked with the 'Parisian monetary intelligentsia, all out of the same mould', but would represent a diversity of interests - even though the French central bank would not follow the federal model of Germany and the US. Achieving autonomy from its own government would not necessarily make the Bank of France any less dependent on Bundesbank monetary decisions. But in recent weeks France has not always waited for Germany to cut rates before doing so itself. The new centre-right government also plans to implement radical changes in French industrial policy by taking a tougher line with France's state-controlled companies. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said the state would abandon the old interventionist approach and would, in future, be more stringent about injecting extra capital into public sector companies and less resistant to allowing international investors to take stakes. Mr Longuet has already told Bull, the loss-making computer company which last year received a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 300m) state injection, to produce a new strategy to ensure that it no longer had to be bailed out by the government. He said the government might be more amenable to international investors taking stakes in Bull as IBM of the US and Japan's NEC have done. France Telecom, the telecommunications group, is another candidate for international investment. Mr Longuet said it should consider forging links with other European telecommunications concerns, or industrial groups, to take advantage of the liberalisation of the European Community telecommunications market in 1998. France Telecom has already formed a number of international joint ventures. This shift in industrial policy is partly the product of ideology. Mr Longuet, styling himself as a 'pragmatic liberal', rejected the old-style French strategy whereby the government supported companies in sectors which were considered to be strategically important. His approach is reflected in the new government's privatisation programme, which envisages selling a wide range of financial and industrial groups to the private sector. Mr Longuet, who outlined his policy the day after Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, unveiled his 'austerity' budget, said the approach was also due to budgetary constraints.

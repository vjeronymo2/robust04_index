			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISH REPORT: LAKE PYRAMID STRIPERS BITING INSIDE MARINA  </P> <P> Fishermen at Lake Pyramid are finding it unnecessary to explore the picturesque  coves and coastline as striped bass continue to feed on shad and small trout  right inside the marina.  </P> <P> Kent Morgan of Canyon Country caught a 29-pound striper just beyond the boat  dock in the Los Angeles County reservoir. Bob Hanley of Westchester, fishing  the same area, caught three stripers averaging between 12-15 pounds.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Barinova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- "Russia's atomic industry is  now on the brink of stoppage", Vladimir Startsev, chairman of  the Central Committee of the Russian atomic energy industry  trade union, told a news conference on Monday. He said that the  precarious situation that developed in the nuclear energy  complex resulted from non-payment by the Russian Grid  joint-stock company for the electricity received from nuclear  power stations. The company ran up a debt of 674 billion rubles.    Planned work to ensure safe operation of nuclear power  stations had to be stopped because of the lack of funds. Unless  the situation changes, the Balakovo nuclear power station will  have to be shut down for safety reasons in June. The station's  operators salaries are in arrears for three months. "Operators  are despairing and the situation may get out of control any  time", Startsev said.    The work of the entire nuclear fuel cycle is paralysed by  the  lack of funds, Lev Ryabev, Russian first deputy minister of  nuclear power, told reporters. Production amalgamation  "Mashinostritelny Zavod" stopped the manufacture of clusters of  fuel elements. The Chepetsk mechanical plant producing  zirconium was stopped. There is a similar situation at  complexes in Krasnoyarsk-26, Tomsk-7, Kirovo-Chepetsk and at  nuclear machine building plants.    It will be necessary to lower the capacity of power  generating sets at nuclear stations to prolong their operation  with the use of whatever fuel remains, Ryabev said. If a  nuclear power plant is shut down, it will take seven to ten  years for reactors to cool off. Fuel storages will have to be  maintained in a safe state. This will require the consumption  of large amounts of electricity, and hence huge outlays.    In view of the fact that funds needed for the maintenance of  normal operation of stations are not allocated, the Russian  Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry and the Central Committee of  the trade union made a proposal to the State Duma to envisage  the allocation to nuclear power stations of 560 billion rubles  from the budget on easy terms when the Russian budget for 1994  is finally drawn up. If this proposal is not accepted, it will  take a much larger sum, over one thousand billion rubles, to  shut off nuclear stations.</p>

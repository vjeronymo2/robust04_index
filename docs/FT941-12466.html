			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sport: A dog of my own - Greyhound Racing a whole racing greyhound - because I now know I will never be rich enough to own a whole racehorse. Greyhounds are a lot less expensive than racehorses. I leased a greyhound once. I had asked the managers at London's White City stadium how to go about buying a dog. They shuffled their feet. Finally, they suggested that a gentle introduction to dog-racing would be obtained by leasing a greyhound. The dog that ran in my name won quite a few races - once at 8-1, which is a far richer experience than a poke in the eye. But no money changed hands. I had neither outgoings nor incomings - no training bills, no prize money. All supremely pointless. But the notion of owning a greyhound has never gone away, and has been revived by a splendid book, published this week: The Dogs, by Laura Thompson, a one-time actress but better known as a sports columnist for The Times and now as a contributing editor for Esquire. Thompson writes well, though sometimes too fastidiously, for there are echoes in her book of Joyce Carol Oates, the American novelist who has written, with visceral distinction and intellectual tone, about pugilism. There are passages in The Dogs where Thompson, one feels, struggles in vain to chase after Ms Oates. She is a quality act though. Her father owned strings of greyhounds, which is how she knows her stuff. Crisply, she opens with a chapter called Facts, which starts: 'The simple facts are these. Six greyhounds run around an ovoid track in pursuit of a mechanical hare. The hare always wins. It is the mystery of what will come second that fascinates those who go to the dogs.' In Britain, every afternoon and evening, six days a week, people go to the dogs. At present there are 37 licensed tracks, plus about 50 'flapping' or unlicensed tracks. About Pounds 400m a year is gambled on the dogs at UK tracks, and about Pounds 1.6bn off-track. It is Britain's second biggest spectator sport. Thompson says that most of the 50,000 dog races in Britain each year are 'roughage' - graded races run for a winner's prize of less than Pounds 100. The fastest dogs compete in open races, and the fastest of all may make the final of the greyhound Derby at Wimbledon Stadium, where the prize money is Pounds 40,000. 'To buy a decent greyhound over the age of 18 months, whose puppy form implies that it might turn into even a minor open racer, will cost perhaps Pounds 8,000. A dog that might make a major open racer will almost always cost five figures.' How do you buy a greyhound? Possibly from a breeder - ideally, in Ireland - or from an agent, a trainer, an auction or the back pages of The Greyhound Life. It might be a puppy or a fully-known quantity. 'Nothing ensures success,' says Thompson, 'although knowing a good breeder is probably the safest method. However, these people are not so easy to get in with . . . One has to be in the know. It is only those that are in the know that have any real chance of consistent success.' At Pounds 25-Pounds 35 a week, a greyhound is very cheap to keep. If it stays fit and wins occasionally, it should pay for itself. To make money out of a graded greyhound, however, says Thompson, you need to be an astute gambler. On the other hand, a good open racer will 'earn wads of prize money, shelf-fuls of silverware, delicious hoards of gambling returns and perhaps, if male, thousands of pounds' worth of stud fees.' The stud fee for a greyhound that has already sired good pups is Pounds 400 or more - a fraction of the stallion fee for a tip-top racehorse, but still a useful earner. Although it is the great working class sport, dog racing has declined, says Thompson, to a worrying point. 'From occupying a proud, even necessary place in sporting culture, 'the dogs' now keeps a dimly picturesque corner in popular social history: a thing that people have never not known about but have never really known about, a thing that, as with many old things, is loved not with a passion but with indulgence.' Except, of course, that there are still what you might call dog people - people doing the thing they want to be doing, casually and unthinkingly in love with their sport. Thompson is excellent on dog people, some of whom are 'lary'. Lary, she says, is a conflation of the words leery, wary and garish. 'It is a millionaire market trader, a bright gold Rolls-Royce, a country mansion in Wanstead, the good-humoured smile and suspicious eyes of a successful bookmaker.' An acquaintance of her father, who had made a lot of money, started flashing it around: red polo-necks, declamatory suits, dainty house ornaments, a condom-shaped car. ''He used to be a silly old sod', said my father. 'Now he's a silly lary old sod'.' She is just as good on dogs. She writes movingly about many of them, including one of her father's, called Commutering, a big, brindle dog, very male-looking, with ears that pricked up into tall triangles. Commutering won many open races. Then he went to stud. But cancer got hold of him. He could have been saved if the vet had been allowed to amputate a leg, but Thompson's father wasn't going to let that happen. ''I wasn't going to do that to the old feller',' her father told her, and Thompson 'understood that he had done the right thing by his racing greyhound in allowing him to die calm and intact.' References to dog racing crop up in the most unexpected contexts. In a US magazine article recently, discussing Bill Gates of Microsoft and whether Gates' enormous power in the computer world was dangerously untrammelled, a leading manufacturer of work-stations said: 'I like Bill ..But I think the problem is that Microsoft has caught the bunny. You know, when you go to the dog track they have that mechanical bunny that makes the dogs run? Well, sometimes a dog is so fast he catches the bunny and then the other dogs don't run any more. That's the situation in the software business today: Bill has caught the bunny. I admire Bill for catching the bunny, but now we can't have a race.' I will never catch the bunny; but I think I can afford a greyhound. The Dogs, by Laura Thompson, Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 9.99.</p>

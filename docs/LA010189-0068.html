			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USO GETS PERMIT TO MOVE ITS CLUB TO PINE AVENUE  </P> <P> The USO has received a city permit to move its administrative offices and  social club into the restored Masonic Temple on Pine Avenue in downtown Long  Beach, close to the 16,000 military personnel who live in the area.  </P> <P> Officials of the United Service Organizations of Los Angeles say the Pine  Avenue club will open this spring. It will provide a lounge and game room for  servicemen. In addition, it will offer a variety of services to military  families, such as housing and child-care referrals.  </P> <P> Long Beach, with its sizable military population, is now a much more suitable  site for the club than Hollywood, USO officials said.  </P></p>

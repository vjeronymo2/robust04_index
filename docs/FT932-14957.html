			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Tight rules set out for foreign banks TIGHT new rules on foreign banks intending to operate in Russia have been published by the central bank, in a move seen as part of a policy to protect fledgling Russian industries and financial institutions from foreign competition. Mr Dmitri Tulin, a central bank deputy chairman, said in an interview with the Interfax agency that foreign banks could open only one branch office besides their Russian head office, while the total capital of all foreign banks operating in Russia could not exceed 12 per cent of the aggregate capital of the Russian commercial banks this year. Already, according to the central bank, aggregate capital of foreign banks represents 6 per cent of the Russian total. This is even though only two western banks - Z-Landerbank of Austria and Credit Lyonnais of France - have received banking licences. Mr Geert D'Haese, chief representative of the Inter Alpha Group of banks - which include Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Belgium's Kredietbank and the UK's Royal Bank of Scotland - said the rules were a compromise with conservatives in the Russian parliament, who tried to ban foreign bank operations entirely.</p>

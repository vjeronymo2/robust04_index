			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / China slows pace of reforms amid fears of social unrest China applied the brakes to its programme of economic liberalisation at the weekend, with pledges of financial assistance for ailing state enterprises and calls for local government intervention to restrain prices. Chinese newspapers gave prominent coverage to a speech in Beijing in which premier Li Peng warned of growing tensions in society due to economic hardship and outlined a new strategy to deal with the problems of inflation and faltering state enterprises. The official China Daily newspaper reported that the government now intended to 'rescue' a number of ailing state-run companies in 18 cities across the country. The apparent shift in sentiment reflects increasing official concern about the risk of social unrest among disaffected workers who have either lost their jobs or are on reduced wages. About half of China's 10,000-11,000 large to medium state-owned enterprises are reportedly running at a loss, and perhaps as many as a third are virtually bankrupt. For much of this year the government has talked about driving hopeless cases into bankruptcy, but it appears to have backed away from this threat. 'A number of state-owned enterprises are in difficulty and the real income of workers has dropped in enterprises with poor economic results,' said Mr Li. 'Without a strong and highly efficient body of state-owned enterprises, there would be no socialism with Chinese characteristics,' he said. Mr Li, in his speech to an enlarged State Council, or cabinet, said that fighting inflation would be the government's top priority for the remaining months of this year. He urged localities to take 'effective measures' to curb price rises, and to enforce a price freeze. The State Council last week ordered the freeze on costs of services such as transport and electricity following publication of July inflation figures which showed that urban retail prices jumped 24.2 per cent compared with the same period last year. Beijing has also called for a drive against food price rises, the main cause of the inflationary surge. The authorities are releasing commodities from government stockpiles to stabilise prices. 'Prices have risen too fast and inflationary pressure is still too big,' Mr Li told colleagues. 'Basic facilities for agriculture are fragile, resulting in huge losses due to floods and drought.'

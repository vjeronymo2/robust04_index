			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DESERT COLLEGE BEATS SOUTHWEST IN SOUTHERN CALIF. BOWL, 17-3  </P> <P> Inspired play by a tough College of the Desert defense lifed the Roadrunners to  a 17-3 Southern California Bowl victory over visiting Southwest College  Saturday night.  </P> <P> Southwest finished its most successful season 7-3-1. With the win, Foothill  Conference champion COD finished 9-2.  </P> <P> Both teams capitalized from turnovers to get their first scores, 28-yard field  goals by each team's kicker in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Southwest Coach Henry Washington said before the game that if the Cougars could  get their running game on track, COD would be in for a long night.  </P> <P> But that didn't happen. The Cougars gained only 54 yards in total offense for  the game, 46 in the first half, when they were thrown for losses totaling a  minus 21 yards on the ground.  </P> <P> The Roadrunners moved the ball 80 yards in six plays to take a 10-3 lead at the  half.  </P> <P> Southwest got its offense untracked a bit in the third period. The Cougars went  from their two-yard line to the Roadrunners' four, but could not score.  </P> <P> Brian Carter's 74 yard interception return in the fourth quarter gave the  Roadrunners a 17-3 lead.  </P></p>

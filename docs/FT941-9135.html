			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Coal strike and interest costs mar Hanson First quarter results from Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, appeared disappointing, with pre-tax profits falling from Pounds 236m to Pounds 173m. However, once one-off items and a first-time contribution from Quantum Chemical, are excluded, there was underlying growth in pre-interest profits of 8 per cent. The shares were unchanged at 283 1/2 p. Lord Hanson, chairman, reiterated recent comments made at the annual meeting, saying: 'The industrial sun is beginning to rise both in the UK and US.' There was no increase in the quarterly dividend of 2.85p. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said signs of recovery had appeared in building materials and other construction-related activities, such as Cavenham Forest Industries and Hanson Lighting in the US, the aggregates business in the US and UK, and Butterly Brick in the UK. However, titanium dioxide prices had not improved significantly. Imperial Tobacco gained from the UK budget being brought forward, but this could be reversed in the second quarter when the budget used to take place. Group turnover rose from Pounds 2.3bn to Pounds 2.89bn, including Pounds 402m from Quantum, acquired on September 30, the last day of the financial year. Lord Hanson said the integration of Quantum, bought for Pounds 2.9bn, was on track. Profits before exceptional items and interest were Pounds 163m, down from Pounds 187m, but this was after the Pounds 67m cost of the now-settled US coal strike. A further Pounds 13m cost will fall in the second half. Quantum contributed Pounds 25m. If exchange rates had been unchanged, the previous year's profits would have been Pounds 2m higher, Mr Taylor said. Exceptional profits totalled Pounds 68m, up from Pounds 20m, reflecting profits on the Pounds 56m sale of the Axelson oil industry equipment business and the Pounds 90m disposal of 11 UK subsidiaries. Profits in the second quarter will come from the Pounds 110m sale of the office products business and the flotation of Beazer Homes in the UK and US. First-quarter interest costs amounted to Pounds 58m, an Pounds 87m reversal from interest receivable of Pounds 29m. This is part of the Pounds 275m negative swing on interest expected in 1993-94, which Hanson warned shareholders about in December. Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 3.5p to 2.5p.</p>

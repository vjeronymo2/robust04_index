This, China's economically developed province took the lead  in employing market mechanism and regulation.    The Standing Committee of the provincial people's congress  has worked out and approved 46 regulations to guarantee economic  expansion in recent years.    Included were 12 regulations which came into force last  year.    In addition, local governments and judicial departments have  strengthened the legal system.    Almost all the 118 courts in the province have set up  judicial courts and mediation centers to handle economic  disputes.    Most economic development zones, bonded zones and tourism  and  holiday zones in Jiangsu have set up law offices or agencies  engaging in the export-oriented economy, banking and futures  trading.    Judicial departments in the province handled 70,000 cases  involving economic crimes and disputes last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Abelardo Sanchez] </F>   [Text] Ocotal -- With regard to the mysterious identity of  Commander "Marcos," leader of the Mexican Zapatista guerrilla  group, the newspaper LA PRENSA offers its readers a photograph  of Marcos Rojas, an internationalist guerrilla who joined the  armed struggle of the FSLN [Sandinist national Liberation Front]  during the liberation war.    During the 1980's, Rojas was a member of the Sandinist  People's Army staff in Ocotal. He went by two names "The Compa  Marcos" and "The Mexican." Also, he had a daughter with Luisa  Amelia Sierra, an Ocotal resident who lived in the "Lacayo  Farfan" neighborhood.    Sierra, who was attending Managua's National Autonomous  University of Nicaragua at the time, was killed in a traffic  accident between Sebaco and "San Benito." After Sierra died,  Marcos returned to Mexico, taking his daughter Araceli with him.  Prior to leaving, he told his FSLN "comrades" that if they  wanted to contact him, to call 757-4723 in Mexico City.    Rojas used to hang around the church entrance in Ocotal  where  he would meet with certain FSLN sympathizers to teach them the  "Workers to Power" FSLN song and other FSLN slogans that were in  fashion back then.    Some people who looked at the photograph of the "Zapatista"  guerrilla published by LA PRENSA on Thursday, 6 January,  estimate his age to be 40 years old, which is the same age as  the Mexican Marcos Rojas.    Rojas left Nicaragua in 1985, six years after the triumph of  the revolution. Before he left Ocotal he said: "I am leaving,  but I am taking all of Sandinist Nicaragua in my heart. But like  the revolutionary that I am, I am leaving because I am needed in  my homeland (Mexico)."    It was difficult for LA PRENSA to gather all the information  on Rojas. His photograph was obtained from a file handled by  FSLN members. These were the steps taken to establish the  identity of the mysterious "Marcos," chief of the Zapatista  National Liberation Army (EZLN).    Is this only a coincidence? Two different people with the  same name, or is Marcos Rojas the man who heads the guerrilla  movement of the so-called Zapatistas?</p>

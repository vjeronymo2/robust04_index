			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ireland's meat exports grow by 20 per cent Irish livestock and meat exports grew by 20 per cent in 1993 to IPounds 1.6bn, reflecting a 75 per cent drop in sales into intervention and the growing success of Irish meat processors in penetrating retail markets in the UK and Europe. According to CBF, the Irish livestock and meat board, beef export volume grew by 50 per cent to 400,000 tonnes. Of this 160,000 tonnes was sold to the UK, while a further 120,000 tonnes went to other European Union outlets. Lamb and pigmeat sales were also buoyant, up 10 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, but CBF also warns of tightening profit margins compounded by an expected increase in red-meat production throughout the EU in 1994. That warning was reinforced this week by Mr Denis Brosnan, the chief executive of Kerry Group, one of Ireland's leading food processors, who said that operating margins in red-meat production were down to only 2 per cent and that 'it would not be inconceivable' that Kerry might pull out of the sector in the next three to four years if market conditions did not improve. One of the problems for the beef processors is that much of the increase in cattle output has been accounted for by live exports, while throughput at meat export plants has declined by 6 per cent 'to its lowest level since 1990', according to CBF. The Irish cattle herd now stands at 7m head, its highest since 1979. The national sheep flock has declined by 3 per cent to 8.7m, the first drop in a decade, while the pig herd has continued to grow to a record level of 1.5m head.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> INCONSISTENT CS NORTHRIDGE FIGURES TO RATE HIGHLY -- AMONG ALSO-RANS;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE RACE: SAN LUIS OBISPO, BAKERSFIELD AND UC RIVERSIDE ARE CONSIDERED  THE FAVORITES.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge will not have to wait long to see how it fares against the  top teams in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. The Matadors will open  conference play on the road against a pair of highly regarded teams -- Cal Poly  San Luis Obispo, at 8:05 tonight, and Cal State Bakersfield, on Saturday.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo (10-3), Bakersfield (12-1) and defending CCAA champion UC  Riverside (10-3) are the tri-favorites in the conference race, while Northridge  appears to be a leading member of the second echelon that includes Chapman and  Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> The Matadors (5-8) might have the talent to contend for the title. However,  they have played inconsistently the past three weeks, losing three of five  games.  </P> <P> Their victories have come at home against NAIA teams Biola (62-54) and the  University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (59-37), while their losses have  been on the road against NCAA Division II teams UC Davis (69-68), Cal State  Sacramento (71-65) and Division I Southern Utah State (94-79).  </P> <P> "If we have a healthy and consistent ballclub, we can compete with any other  team in the conference," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "It's just a  matter of us playing consistently."  </P> <P> Northridge will not be at full strength for at least another week, when guard  Eugene Humphrey hopes to return to the lineup. Humphrey has been sidelined for  the past three games after suffering a severely bruised right hamstring against  Cal State Sacramento.  </P> <P> Derrick Gathers, an All-CCAA second-team selection last season, leads the  Matadors, who are 0-6 on the road this season.  </P> <P> Gathers has team-high averages of 20.3 points and 8.8 rebounds a game and he  ranks third and fifth in the CCAA in those categories.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo finished a game behind Northridge at 6-8 in the conference last  season, but four starters return for the Mustangs, including All-CCAA forward  Coby Naess (14.3 points) and guard James Gamma (11.8).  </P> <P> Guard Stuart Thomas is averaging 14.2 points and a team-high 7.0 rebounds for  the Mustangs.  </P> <P> Bakersfield, which tied for third in the CCAA last season at 9-5, is the  hottest team in the conference, having won 11 games in a row after losing to  San Francisco State, 68-64.  </P> <P> The Roadrunners are led by guard Wade Green and forwards Marvin Redeemer and  Beau Redstone.  </P> <P> Green is averaging 15.5 points, a conference-leading 7.1 assists and 2.5 steals  a game, and Redeemer sports averages of 17.8 points and 7.2 rebounds. Redstone  leads the team in rebounding with a 9.3 average and is fourth in scoring  (11.2).  </P> <P> UC Riverside advanced to the semifinals of the Division II tournament last  season and has four starters returning, including forward-center Chris Ceballos  (18.4 ppg, 6.1 rpg).  </P> <P> Also returning are three-point marksmen Mike Ritter (13.2 ppg) and Reggie  Howard (12.2 ppg). Ritter has made 35 of 64 (54.7%) three-point shots, and  Howard has hit 34 of 78 (43.6%) from beyond the three-point line.  </P> <P> Chapman (8-5) is led by sophomore forward-center Roger Middleton, the leading  scorer (22.1) and No. 2 rebounder (10.9) in the conference. Guard Robert  Barksdale (18.5 points, 5.2 assists) will power Dominguez Hills (4-9).  </P> <P> Cal State L. A. was 0-14 in conference play last season, but the Golden Eagles  (6-6) are vastly improved, led by forward-center LaVar Ball (16.9 points, 8.9  rebounds).  </P> <P> Center Terry Ross is averaging 20.7 points and a CCAA-leading 12.7 rebounds a  game for Cal Poly Pomona (6-7).  </P></p>

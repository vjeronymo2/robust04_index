			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) States not eligible for a preliminary award that do want to participate in this assistance program should provide BJA with a Notice of Intent to Apply, by letter or preliminary application, no later than April 30, 1995. Preliminary estimates of numbers of bed slots and costs and brief descriptive information such as described for the initial applications from the seven named States would be appreciated, as this will allow BJA to better plan for the final award process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) As soon as possible after all final applications are received, BJA will determine award amounts for each applying State, based upon the available funds and the costs incurred by the States, pursuant to &sect;82.5. For FY 1995, the final percentage will be applied to the full appropriation of $130,000,000 (less one percent administrative costs) made available for the fiscal year, and the amount of the preliminary awards to the States pursuant to &sect;82.6 will be subtracted from the final award to those States. Awards will be made as expeditiously as possible, dependant on the verification process as described herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) All State applicants must submit Standard Form 424 (Application for Federal Assistance), including all necessary assurances and certifications and a certified listing of incarcerated illegal criminal alien prisoners. Participants in this program will be required to provide: information on average number of aliens incarcerated, actual identifiers for these aliens, and average cost per bed space for the period for which assistance is being sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Each application must contain all the information discussed in this regulation. A certification form, available from BJA, will be used to provide the total numbers and average per bed costs upon which the final application for reimbursement is based. This certification does not relieve the applicant from providing sufficient narrative detail about its recordkeeping and cost calculation processes to support and justify the amount of assistance sought. The certification will be sent to all potential applicants who file a Notice of Intent to Apply with BJA as well as to the initial seven applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) In addition to certification of some information and description of the methods for calculations made, the applicant is expected to provide both hard copy and, if possible, electronically readable information on all aliens included in the one detailed listing pursuant to &sect;82.4(g) reimbursement counts. This unduplicated listing of all aliens identified must be certified by the head of the designated State agency or one of his or her authorized representatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) All applicants should be aware that the percentage used in making the preliminary awards to the seven States will not be the same as that determined after all States' applications are received, total requests based on final inmate counts and bed space calculations are made, and the BJA/INS verification process is concluded. At that point, the percentage upon which final distribution is made is expected to be significantly lower than 27%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;82.8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Verification of applicant information and monitoring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In reviewing the applications from the States, numbers and cost figures given, as documented by the State's procedures used to obtain that information, will be subject to verification and possible adjustment by BJA. BJA will consult with INS on cost calculations and on both overall counts of the average number of aliens and on adequacy of individual inmate identifiers. BJA will share both application information and inmate information with INS to allow INS to work directly with the applicant agencies to assure proper identification of criminal aliens and to begin deportation procedures, as appropriate. Award acceptance will be conditioned on the applicant's agreement to cooperate fully with INS in matters related to this assistance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) It is anticipated that INS field staff, with or independently of BJA staff, will undertake on-site reviews with selected applicant agencies, to assist in properly identifying aliens as defined in the regulations and statutes. Applicants will be expected to provide documentation on inmates counted whose status is questioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) It is unlikely that INS verification will be fully developed prior to the distribution of the preliminary awards pursuant to &sect;82.6. Rather, this will be an ongoing process in which developing better systems of alien identification and making individual verifications will be a major goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The application should contain an official designation from the chief executive officer of the State naming the applicant as the State agency to receive the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack A.

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Aircraft project decision criticised A government decision not to support the European Future Large Aircraft project could allow Germany to overtake the UK as the world leader in wing-design technology, says a study published yesterday. The project is the rival to the US Hercules C130J as the replacement for the RAF's Hercules transport fleet. The academic study, commissioned by the Western Development Partnership, an economic regeneration agency based in Avon, examined the significance of British Aerospace's 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus consortium. It said the UK government's failure to take up the 37.5 per cent stake originally on offer would, by 2010, have cost the country Pounds 18bn of business and thousands of jobs. BAe's design team, the study said, faced a wait of six years before the next generation of Airbus required major wing development. The FLA design would fill that gap and provide substantial work for other UK companies.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Billion-dollar changes for YPF - The oil group is undergoing a transformation YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, is to transform its domestic operations and back a cautious expansion into neighbouring markets with a Dollars 100m a month investment programme. The expansion of exploration and production and the revamping of its retail business is the company's largest investment programme, and the most evident sign of YPF's transformation from a corrupt, money-losing state corporation to a profit-oriented, private company. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, says he now has 'one firm commitment: profits. Our investors have become the most important part of our corporate life'. He claims YPF's investment plans are proof that this is no cheap corporate hype. More than Dollars 1bn is budgeted for next year and a further Dollars 1bn in 1996. Argentina's biggest company is now 20 per cent owned by the federal government, with the rest held by the employees and provincial governments. The government, which once owned the company outright, sold 45 per cent last June in a Dollars 3.04bn local and international initial public offering. Last year, YPF raised profits 176 per cent to Dollars 706m, despite lower oil prices and an increase of just 2 per cent in sales to Dollars 3.96bn. However, profits and revenues both declined in the first quarter as oil prices continued falling. YPF is to sink 720 new production wells this year, at a cost of Dollars 700m. Mr Estenssoro wants to raise output by one-fifth to 450,000 barrels per day by the end of 1995, and then maintain production at this level. 'Argentina's wells are small producers, so (we need to do) a lot of drilling,' he says. Mr Estenssoro wants to maintain YPF's oil reserves at the equivalent of 10 years' production through a big exploration effort. This year YPF is spending Dollars 300m to drill 180 exploration wells as part of a Dollars 3bn, 10-year exploration programme. Argentina is self-sufficient in oil, although it does not come close the volumes of Mexico or Venezuela, Latin America's big oil producers. But it does have considerable potential: Mr Estenssoro says only five of its 19 identified oil-bearing basins have been explored and are in production. The country does have much more natural gas than oil. YPF and joint-venture partners Ampolex of Australia and Petrobras of Brazil are investing Dollars 250m over four years to explore a potentially giant gas field in north western Argentina. Mr Estenssoro is spending a further Dollars 250m this year to upgrade YPF's downstream business, where profitability is low. In August 1990, when he took over at YPF, the downstream business lost Dollars 400m. It is now returning 5 per cent on assets, and Mr Estenssoro wants to double profitability by next year. In comparison, the upstream production business returns about 20 per cent a year. YPF has also started a Dollars 500m, five-year project to bring its operations - particularly its refineries - into line with world environmental standards. Finally, YPF is spending Dollars 300m between 1993-96 to renovate its retail network. The company has 2,800 petrol stations, many more than its competitors, but its stations are a byword for bad service. YPF is financing the investment programme with a mix of bank borrowing, retained earnings and overseas bond sales. Mr Estenssoro announced earlier this year a Dollars 350m Yankee bond issue and a Dollars 500m medium-term note issue. Analysts praise the company for reducing production and administrative costs to compensate for falling oil prices. Some, however, criticise Mr Estenssoro for not hedging oil prices and thus exposing YPF's growing exports to dwindling prices. Mr Estenssoro has continued cutting the work force - which stood at 51,000 when he took over and now numbers only 6,500 - leading to growing criticism from the unions. However, many former employees still work for the company as subcontractors, often on excessively generous terms, say some analysts. Competitors and economists also complain that YPF abuses its dominant market position. It produces over half Argentina's oil, has over half its refinery capacity and controls half the retail market. Mr Estenssoro rejects accusations that YPF plays dirty. 'The market works, it is very competitive and if YPF did not exist, or was not as big as it is, its market would be split among the multinationals,' he says. YPF, which has always focused on its domestic market, is gradually expanding into neighbouring countries. It has just opened a 270-mile pipeline over the Andes to Chile, allowing it to raise exports by Dollars 300m a year. Mr Estenssoro says: 'We are looking to our neighbours as a natural place to expand.' He has started small exploration projects in Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay and is negotiating exploration contracts in Chile and Peru. YPF may bid for the Peruvian and Bolivian state oil companies when they are offered for privatisation. It seems appropriate that YPF, the world's first state oil company and Latin America's first privatised oil company, should make a stab at becoming the region's first private oil multinational.</p>

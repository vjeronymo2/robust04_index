			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / National Savings goes to the Far Side NATIONAL SAVINGS has unveiled the latest weapon in its battle for the nation's wallets - Gary Larson. The Far Side cartoonist's work will head a campaign aimed at persuading private investors to help fund the UK's growing budget deficit. Larson's work will appear in animated version for the first time in a series of UK television adverts starting on Wednesday. British animators have adapted the US artist's cartoons, which mainly involve animals and are noted for their off-beat humour, with the creator's approval. Newspaper advertisements will also carry Larson's car-toons. National Savings says the campaign is aimed at attracting many investors, often in the 30 to 50-year-old range, who regard the government department's products as down-market and dull. The cartoons are designed to give the investment schemes a more up-to-date image. The campaign will be cheaper than the department's previous efforts which have involved actors and location filming. The National Savings department's success in attracting savers has been complained about recently by the building societies. Rates on National Savings products have been cut twice in an attempt to head off criticism. Finance and the family, Weekend II-V</p>

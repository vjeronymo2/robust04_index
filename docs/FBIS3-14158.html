It devotes part of the front page  and all of page 3 to detailed accounts of demonstrations and  sermons by Islamic leaders who condemn the "massacre," criticize  Arab leaders' weakness, and call for breaking off the  negotiations with Israel and for a jihad. The paper notes that  security authorities surrounded many of the places of worship  and took precautionary measures to guard against further  demonstrations in many governorates. Worshipers chanted slogans  against the Zionist entity and carried banners demanding revenge  against the "criminal Zionists." Islamists took part in  demonstrations protesting against the "Jewish delinquency" and  weakness of the Islamic rulers. At the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque  Square, Socialist Liberal Party [SLP] members and thousands of  worshipers chanted slogans against the Jews and demanded that  relations with the Zionists be severed. SLP members burned and  trampled over the Israeli flag with their shoes and distributed  a statement released by the Youths Federation on the "Jewish  criminality" and the government's weakness.    The Muslim Brothers organized demonstrations in Hulwan,  chanting revolutionary slogans against the Jews and their  agents. The paper reports that prayers were held in Upper Egypt  under the threat of weapons and that the Central Security Forces  surrounded the places of worship.    In an approximately 270-word report on page 3 about 'Id  al-Fitr prayers in Tanta, the paper says over 20,000 worshipers  packed the sports stadium in Tanta amid a strict security  blockade and that they were joined by women and children. In  his sermon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah Salamah, professor and dean of  the Koran interpretation branch at Umm-al-Qura University in  Mecca, Saudi Arabia, focused on the Jews' "treachery" and  "affirmed that America is the leader and protector of terrorism  in the entire world." He criticized the Security Council and  reviewed the tolerance of Islam and the prophet. Over 60,000  worshipers gathered at 'Abd-al-Halim Square, chanting the  slogans: "O Jerusalem, we are returning" and "Muhammad's army  will return."    In an approximately 190-word report on the same page on  events in Alexandria by 'Amir 'Id, the author says masses of  worshipers staged marches and chanted slogans denouncing the  "Zionist carnage," the "languor" of Arab and Islamic regimes,  and the Security Council's "collusion." In his sermon, Shaykh  Ahmad al-Mahallawi noted the need to apply the Islamic shari'ah  and involving Islam in the battle with the Jews. He said that  Islam is "inevitably coming" and it will lead the world,  provided that "we stick to the injunctions of God's book." He  strongly criticized the secularists' domination of intellect and  mass media, which make them smear "everything." In western  Alexandria, placards denounced the "Zionist massacre" and  criticized the government's stance on veiled women and  transferring them to desk jobs.    Muhammad Hilal files an approximately 240-word report on  page 3 on sermons in Kafr al-Shaykh. A mosque imam, Shaykh  Faraj Zaki Faraj, denounces the Arabs' "languor toward the  Muslim causes, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina and occupied  Palestine." The report says the imam asks every worshiper to  imagine he has a sister being raped in Bosnia and a brother  being killed in Palestine, as was the case in the Hebron  massacre, and that everyone should react accordingly.    An approximately 260-word report on events in al-Suways on  the same page says al-Suways inhabitants lived the night  preceding 'Id al-Fitr in a state of fear and panic as police  forces deployed in the streets in a provocative manner and that  policemen pointed the muzzles of their rifles at passersby. The  Hebron massacre was the main theme of 'Id al-Fitr sermons.  Islamic preacher Shaykh Hafiz Salamah said the massacre proved  that the Arab governments participating in the peace talks are  living in a state of "falseness and prevarication." The reports  adds: "Shaykh Salamah stressed that jihad is the only way to  liberate the Islamic land of Palestine, to establish its  independent state, and to avenge the blood of the martyrs who  fell as they kneeled before God while performing the dawn  prayer."    Another 200-word report on the same page from the Aswan  correspondent indicates that the security authorities flooded  public squares with water, forcing the 'Id al-Fitr speakers to  stay away from these squares.    In an approximately 1,500-word report on page 2, the paper  reports SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri's speech at the party's  conference on 28 Ramadan in which Shukri criticizes the Security  Council for being unable to take a stand denouncing the Hebron  killings. He criticizes the Egyptian Government, which  "trampled over al-Azhar with the feet of its security men who  threw bombs at its campus and arrested worshipers just because  they wanted to say prayers for the souls of their brother  martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque." He also criticizes the  government's ban on demonstrations and its "loyalty" to Israel.  Discussing domestic issues, Shukri also criticizes the  Constitution and government policies.  <H5>  ISRAELI MOSAD ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN MONASTERY ATTACK </H5>   In an approximately 760-word report on pages 1 and 7 on a  recent attack on a Coptic monastery in Upper Egypt, the 18 March  edition of AL-SHA'B cites "Asyut leaders" as denouncing the  attack and indicating that Israeli Mosad intelligence agency  personnel were involved in the incident to foment sectarian  feuds between Muslims and Copts.  <H5>  WRITER DENOUNCES MONASTERY ATTACK, ISRAEL, GOVERNMENT POLICY </H5>   In an approximately 1,000-word article on page 2, the  author,  Mahfuz 'Azzam, denounces a recent attack on a Coptic monastery  in Upper Egypt, discusses the Hebron killings and a recent  church bombing in Lebanon, and implicates Israel in the latter  incident, citing other writers on the subject.    Commenting on the attack on the monastery in Egypt, he says:  "In the name of every Muslim in this country, we announce our  condemnation of this heinous crime no matter who did it. We  emphasize the belief of the SLP and the entire Islamic  movement--and indeed all the Muslims in Egypt, parties and  groups--that any attack on a church or mosque is an aggression  against this nation. We vehemently reject any bigotry against  our brother Copts as we reject any bigotry against Muslims."    He says that the Israeli Government, "which is established  on  treachery, aggression, and usurpation of the Palestinian land"  has a genuine interest in distracting attention from the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque "massacre." He notes that while Israel is  engaged in oppression, murder, violence, and terrorism, the  president and officials in Egypt declare the need for  normalization, dialogue, and peace with Israel despite Israel's  countless crimes. This, he adds, takes place at a time when the  president and his government refuse the principle of dialogue  with the sons of this nation, whom they accused of violating the  law and committing violence and terrorism.   <H3>    IRAQI MINISTER SAYS ARABS, MUSLIMS TO BLAME FOR  SUFFERINGS </H3>   Page 4 of AL-SHA'B features an approximately 1,500-word  report filed by Salah Budaywi on the hardship of the Iraqi  people in light of UN sanctions, the high cost of living,  soaring prices, and the government's food rationing, citing the  views of many ordinary citizens.    The correspondent says the Security Council has authorized  each individual country in the world to do what it deems fit  about releasing Iraqi frozen assets for the purchase of food and  medicine and notes that the Arab and Islamic governments should  have responded to that resolution and released $4 billion in  Iraqi assets frozen at their banks. But, citing Iraqi Foreign  Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf in response to AL-SHA'B's  question, the correspondent says the Arab and Islamic  governments regrettably are still ignoring this situation. The  Iraqi foreign minister is quoted as saying: "Government  leaders, such as those in Spain, Switzerland, and two other  European countries, relented and released the Iraqi assets."  Therefore, the report continues, he [the Iraqi minister]  believes that the main cause of the continuation of the Iraqis'  suffering is currently an Arab-Islamic one.  <H5>  SLP OFFICIAL DENOUNCES GOVERNMENT POLICY, DEMANDS CHANGE </H5>   In an approximately 3,000-word article on page 5, SLP deputy  leader 'Adil Husayn deplores the Egyptian Government's  cooperation and "collusion" with the United States and Israel in  plots against the Somali and Sudanese peoples. In the  introduction, he says: "Rulers in most of the Arab and Islamic  countries, of course led by the rulers in Egypt, now publicly  and without shame violate the Koran's text. Through their  control of the modern media, especially the television, these  rulers seek to delude the nation into following their depravity  and forgetting God's commandments."    He discusses at length the Egyptian Government's contacts  and  cooperation with Sudanese opposition and the government's stance  against an Islamic regime in Sudan, citing the Sudanese  opposition's meetings in Cairo and the United States' and other  countries' plans to partition Sudan. He says: "We are  confident of God's support of the believers and know that the  accomplishments in Sudan under the banner of "No god but God"  have made Sudan secure in its food and necessary needs. What is  more important is that the spirit of jihad has covered the  Sudanese nation, which is now able to put up with its  affliction." He adds: "With the rush to martyrdom, the Army  and the popular defense, which include southerners, now have  full control over all the national soil. Therefore, the  Westerners have lost their cool and have raised their shrill  voice and threats in the past months to intervene directly to  partition the south and its surroundings, now that the rebellion  has failed to fulfill this mission and the rebellion leaders  have taken refuge abroad."    Generally he praises the Islamic regime in Sudan and  denounces the Egyptian Government's policies toward Somalia and  Sudan in collaboration with the United States and Israel.    After noting the Egyptian Government's role in Somalia in  implementation of "Washington's orders," he addresses that  government, saying: "What a bad deal, through which you will  lose this world and the world hereafter. But don't ever go near  Sudan and conclude a similar deal on it with the United States.  If you think you can do something of the sort, I refer you to  Almighty God's open commandment and prohibitions. If these  injunctions are not obligatory for you, they are binding to us.  In the name of these injunctions, our people will not agree to  fight Sudan to obey the Americans and the Jews because this  nation raises the banner of Islam with all its meanings of  piety, strength, and might. This nation will fight you if you  seek to embroil it."    At one point, he states that the Arabs have lost a great  deal  through their alliance with the United States in the war against  Iraq and that the Gulf States were the first losers.    Concluding, the author says that he has written the article  on Thursday morning before going to the State Security  Prosecution for investigation because, in his words, he is  charged with incitement against the government and with trying  to bring it down.    He says: "I hereby declare to the nation that our entire  party admits that it indeed encouraged and will continue to  encourage the changing of rulers because this is the only way to  improve the situation. There must be a strong and honest  government and we want a peaceful change through elections. Do  whatever you wish to us but we will continue to do our duty and  will not fear your threats. Sufficient unto us is God."  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DENOUNCES CLINTON'S REMARKS ON JERUSALEM </H5>   An approximately 140-word report on page 7 says that the  Muslim Brotherhood has issued a statement denouncing U.S.  President Clinton's remarks that Jerusalem will remain the  eternal capital of Israel, and emphasizing that Clinton's  statements represent a continuation of the "Zionist enemy's"  racist settlement policy.    The statement says: "The Islamic nations regard with extreme  anger the U.S. Administration's stances disparaging the Muslims'  right to Palestine and holy Jerusalem. The complete silence of  the Islamic world's governments, kings, and presidents is met  with bad and bitter responses from the Arab and Islamic peoples."    The Muslim Brotherhood, the report says, urged the Islamic  nation to denounce the U.S. stance on the Palestinian issue and  "show popular anger at that stance, which is partial to the  Zionist enemy."</p>

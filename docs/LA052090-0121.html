			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CORRUPTION, SEPARATISM ISSUES SWAMP INDIA FBI  </P> <P> India's version of the FBI, already swamped by corruption investigations, has  stretched itself thinner by joining the fight against separatist movements.  </P> <P> The Central Bureau of Investigation has been in the news most often for probing  deals made while Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was in office. Gandhi lost his job  in November's elections to anti-corruption candidate V. P. Singh.  </P> <P> Now the bureau also is handling routine murder cases in troubled Jammu-Kashmir  state, pursuing anti-terrorist investigations in violent Punjab and looking  into a tribal revolt in faraway Assam.  </P> <P> The man with his finger in the dike is Rajendra Shekhar, director general of  the bureau, a 55-year-old career police official from the western desert state  of Rajasthan.  </P> <P> "I'm losing weight," he said in an interview. "We're the busiest we've ever  been."  </P> <P> Shekhar looked worn out. These days he drinks jasmine tea with lime, which is  supposed to improve his appetite.  </P> <P> Faced with local police forces that are too busy, too frightened or too  partisan, Shekhar directed his agents to take over investigations in Kashmir.  At least 300 people have been killed in the northwestern state since the  government cracked down on a Muslim separatist movement in January.  </P> <P> Just south of Kashmir, bureau agents are investigating separatist violence by  Sikh extremists in Punjab state.  </P> <P> Many Punjab police are virtually confined to their barracks because they are  favorite targets of Sikh extremists, who have killed more than 5,800 people in  Punjab since 1987.  </P> <P> In Assam, a remote northeastern state, bureau agents are looking closely at the  Bodos, an animist tribe that believes spirits live in rocks and trees. The  Bodos want a separate state within India and have attacked Assamese Hindus.  </P> <P> The real work of Shekhar's agency, however, is fighting corruption.  </P> <P> India's British colonial rulers established the Central Bureau of Investigation  soon after World War II to investigate links between Indian businessmen and the  government. That work continued after independence in 1947.  </P> <P> Of the 1,200 cases filed by the bureau's 3,907 agents every year, about 1,000  are corruption-related, Shekhar said.  </P> <P> Corruption is the grease of South Asia's wheels.  </P> <P> Traffic cops routinely take "baksheesh," small cash payments, to ignore  violations. Businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks part of the job.  </P> <P> Shekhar said the problem has been growing.  </P> <P> Industrialization, inflation, development, unemployment -- all contribute to  it, he said, and "the facets that give impetus to corruption are getting more  and more pronounced."  </P> <P> Preliminary charges have been filed in three cases involving members of  Gandhi's government. Two concern alleged payment of bribes by Europe's Airbus  Industrie consortium and Hawaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a West German submarine  manufacturer.  </P> <P> A former high-level civil servant was charged in connection with a  $1.47-billion Airbus deal for 38 planes and a former defense secretary was  named in a case involving four West German submarines worth $334 million.  </P> <P> The agency also has filed preliminary charges related to a $1.4-billion  artillery contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. Bureau  investigators have charged Bofors with cheating India out of $37 million and  Indian government officials, not identified, with criminal misconduct.  </P> <P> Charges related to an alleged political dirty tricks campaign against the son  of Prime Minster Singh are expected soon.  </P> <P> Western diplomats say the growing scope of bureau responsibility is a sign  local police cannot cope with the level and complexity of crime in India.  </P> <P> It also indicates, they say, that the central government does not trust local  officials.  </P> <P> "Under these circumstances, it's easy for the law enforcement process to break  down," a diplomat said, on condition of anonymity. "The bureau is stretched too  thin. They don't have good relations with local police, and the crooks keep  committing crimes."  </P> <P> Critics say many of the bureau's investigations are politically motivated.  </P> <P> Charges of corruption haunted the Gandhi administration. Singh, formerly  Gandhi's finance minister, quit the government when his corruption  investigations were stymied.  </P> <P> Diplomats say there appears to be vindictiveness in the investigations, and  cite the one concerning the prime minister's son.  </P> <P> By forcing the bureau to concentrate on what many consider a minor case,  Singh's administration is using law enforcement to fight its political battles,  another Western diplomat said.  </P> <P> Shekhar denied that his bureau could be used for political purposes.  </P> <P> "Our work has nothing to with politics," he said. "If we think the case is  legitimate, we investigate."  </P> <P> Shekhar made his mark late in his career when he led the investigation of one  of India's biggest bank robberies, the theft of $3.35 million from the Punjab  National Bank in 1987.  </P> <P> Ten of the original 24 suspects wound up dead, but Shekhar says the police  didn't kill them.  </P> <P> Several others disappeared and only a few were convicted and jailed. In the  Indian context, the case was considered a success.  </P> <P> The director general looks at his current post in a similar light: Incremental  steps can be taken, but no major changes should be expected.  </P> <P> "If we can set an example with one or two corruption cases, I suppose we are  doing our job," Shekhar said. "But, then again, nobody could pay any  attention."  </P></p>

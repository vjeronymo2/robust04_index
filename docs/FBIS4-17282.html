			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Viewpoint"; materials prepared by the Public Opinion </F> Foundation, Viewpoint's sociological service, and the INTERFAX  News Agency]    [Excerpts] Almost every tenth city resident of Russia pins  hopes in terms of the country's overcoming the crisis, for the  army, the Interior and Security Ministries.    - Those who rely on power structures are against democracy  in  most cases.    - About one-fourth of the polled do not know who in Russia  now could be attributed to the "middle class".    - If in the United States more than 50 percent believe  that the state is becoming richer as the number of rich people  grows, in Russia more than 50 percent disagree with the thesis.    - If respondents can switch on Channel Four of the Russian  television, more than 50 percent of them prefer to watch NTV  programs and their number grows with every month.    - Even the emergence of computer games does not affect  women's preferences in toys: they still believe a doll is the  best toy.    - The young prefer to watch thrillers, the old ones  comedies and soap operas.  <H5>  RESPONDENTS SPEAK ABOUT RUSSIA'S OVERCOMING THE CRISIS </H5>   To the question: "Which bodies of power can help Russia to  overcome the crisis?" the answers were the following [in  percent]:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |With President Yeltsin                |17                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |With "power structures" (the army, th-|12                                    |  |e Interior and Security ministers)    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |With the Chernomyrdin government      |7                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |With the State Duma (lower house of p-|6                                     |  |arliament)                            |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |With Federation Council (upper house  |2                                     |  |of parliament)                        |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |With none of them                     |35                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                             |21                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Taking part in the poll held early in April, were 1040 city  residents of Russia. They were also asked another question:  "Does Russia need democracy?" [in percent]    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                                   |49                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                                    |24                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                             |27                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Those who pin their hopes on Yeltsin believing he may help  Russia to overcome the crisis, mostly believe that democracy is  needed (77 percent). Those who rely on power structures, are  mostly against democracy (44 percent).  <H5>  WHAT IS `MIDDLE CLASS'? </H5>   To the question: " Who, do you think, can be attributed to  the "middle class" in Russia?", the answers were the following:  [in percent]    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Those who have a comfortable flat, a  |36                                    |  |dacha and a car                       |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Those who have a comfortable flat (ho-|13                                    |  |use)                                  |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Those who have a car                  |8                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Those who have a dacha                |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other things                          |11                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I do not know                         |24                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                             |16                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      If U.S. residents were asked the same question, there would  be no undecided. The situation is different in Russia. Everyone  knows from the childhood what is the working class or the class  of capitalists. The notion "middle class" is new for the  Russians.    However, while politicians are discussing who could be  attributed to the middle class, and parties are being formed  which declare they uphold the interests of the middle class, a  considerable part of the population attributes to the middle  class the owners of cars. This means that people themselves try  to explain the notion. The poll was conducted simultaneously  with the above one and involved the same respondents.  <H5>  WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER 50 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS </H5> BELIEVE THAT THE STATE IS BECOMING RICHER AS THE NUMBER OF THE  RICH GROWS, IN RUSSIA OVER 50 PERCENT DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION    Residents of Russia and the United States were asked to  answer the question: "Do you agree that the state is getting  richer as the number of the rich people grows?" Here are the  answers:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Americans ()            |Russians()              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                      |62                       |29                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                       |32                       |52                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Undecided                |6                        |19                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Taking part in the poll were 1472 respondents in Russia. In  the United States the poll was conducted by the Gallup  Organization.  <H5>  WHAT TV CHANNEL RUSSIAN PEOPLE PREFER </H5>   To the question "What TV companies do you prefer?" the  respondents who can watch Channel four over their TV-sets,  answered in the following way:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |March ()                |April ()                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ostankino                |64                       |71                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia                   |54                       |55                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |NTV                      |53                       |62                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ViD                      |15                       |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2x2                      |11                       |6                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moskva                   |10                       |14                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |St Petersburg            |9                        |11                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TV-6                     |9                        |6                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The Russians watch the Ostankino Channel more often than  NTV,  which is being done by the force of habit, explain sociologists.  However, over the time that passed since the first poll, the  number of TV viewers, who believe that programs of NTV are more  interesting than of other channels, has almost doubled.    To the question: "Which TV channels do you prefer?" the  answers were the following:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |March ()                |April ()                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |NTV                      |38                       |61                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ostankino                |36                       |55                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia                   |33                       |40                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2x2                      |8                        |7                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moskva                   |8                        |14                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TV-6                     |6                        |6                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ViD                      |5                        |15                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      [passage omitted] Taking part in the poll in March were 999  inhabitants of the European Russia.</p>

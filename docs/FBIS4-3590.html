			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 21 (CNS) -- A Deng Xiaoping medal  officially produced and put on sale for the fist time has been  well received with its sale in the city exceeding 2,000 pieces  in just one month.    The obverse side of the copper medal portrays Deng's head  and  the characters "Our General Architect" while the converse side  shows a map of China and with the characters "Construct  socialism with Chinese characteristics" both in Chinese and in  English.    The medal selling at RMB 46 is produced by institutions in  Beijing to meet the demands of the public there and also as a  gift item on the occasion of the 90th birthday of Deng Xiaoping  on August 22 this year.    An observer here believed that production of the badge was  of  great significance not only for its intrinsic but also its  monetary value.</p>

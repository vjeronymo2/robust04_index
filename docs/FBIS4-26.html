			<p>SUMMARY:       In a number of recent press articles, several Japanese  academics and journalists offered assessments of the changing views  of the Japan-U.S. relationship within the Japanese bureaucracy.  All  of those surveyed agreed that Japan's new generation of bureaucrats  view the United States differently from their elders.  Several  writers asserted that the new generation of bureaucrats believes it  is time for Japan to move away from its close association with the  United States and toward closer ties with Asia.      Focusing on how negotiators from the ranks of Japan's bureaucracy  took the unprecedented step of saying "no" to the United States in  the recently-broken off U.S.-Japan framework talks, several  academics and journalists analyzed the changing views of these  bureaucrats toward Japan-U.S. relations.  None of the writers  expressed surprise over the reaction to the breakdown of the  framework talks by Japan's negotiators who, according to the 13  February MAINICHI SHIMBUN, showed "pride, confidence, and delight  that they had defeated [sic] the United States for the first time in  trade negotiations."      Bureaucrats' Reliance on Economic Theory - Writing in the 9  February ASAHI SHIMBUN, Motoshige Ito, a Tokyo University economics  professor, asserted that Japan's bureaucrats based their negative  response to U.S. demands on what he referred to as the  "internationally recognized economic theory" that numerical targets  will lead to managed rather than free trade.  He said that "the  contemporary mid-level bureaucrats who are responsible for working-  level negotiations" no longer ignore economic theory in trade  negotiations.  Unlike their predecessors, who, he claimed, believed  in strong government economic intervention, contemporary bureaucrats  understand and apply in their arguments "internationally recognized  economic theory, which they learned while studying in U.S. graduate  schools."  This change in the thinking of bureaucrats "will be an  important factor in Japan's trade negotiations over the long run,"  Ito observed.      Ito criticized the U.S. Government for allegedly not following  economic theory "that is prevalent in American universities."  Contrary to the above trend among Japanese Government officials, he  wrote, the U.S. Government "appears to be moving away from arguments  based on economic theory."  Ito cited numerical targets as one  example, claiming that "no authoritative economists" in the United  States support numerical targets.      Generational Change, Emergence of Multilateralism - Former  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official Yukio Okamoto, writing  in the 11 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, pointed to a "generational  change" among Japanese negotiators as one reason they could say "no"  to the United States.  He observed that the present generation of  bureaucrats "do not feel a debt to the United States" for its  postwar assistance to Japan.  This "diminished appreciation of past  favors," combined with "accumulated frustrations from many years of  dealing with what, in their view, has been an excessively demanding  United States," is a factor that is "small but impossible to  overlook" in the politics of negotiations.      Alongside younger bureaucrats "diminished appreciation" of the  United States, there is also reportedly a trend toward a more global  Japanese approach to diplomacy.  According to an article by Tokyo  University political science professor Takashi Inoguchi in the 22  February MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Japanese MOFA bureaucrats have been  steadily "globalizing" Japan's diplomacy since the collapse of the  Liberal Democratic Party government last year.  According to  Inoguchi, they are beginning to treat the Japan-U.S. relationship as  just "one element" in the overall "formation of global economic and  security rules."  Although the Japanese-U.S. relationship is still  "preeminent," Inoguchi observed, the relationship has "changed in  quality" and is likely to be handled from a "multilateral  perspective."      In a similar vein, ASAHI SHIMBUN economic reporter Kenji Takeuchi  in a 9 February article pointed to the emergence within the Japanese  bureaucracy of a "multilateralist faction," which maintains that  Japan should shift the focus of its trade policy from Japan-U.S.  bilateral trade to trade with other countries.  According to  Takeuchi, contemporary Japanese bureaucrats prefer multilateral  negotiations to bilateral talks with the United States because  multilateral talks are more "open" and based on "universal rules."      Younger Bureaucrats Influenced by Pan-Asianist Arguments -  Writing in the 15 March issue of EKONOMISUTO, Kenji Suzuki, a  MAINICHI SHIMBUN editorial staff writer, contended that the  breakdown of the framework talks was a "logical consequence" of the  views of young Japanese bureaucrats, who are "cool" toward the  United States and "inclined" toward Asia.  Suzuki went on to say  that the views of Kazuo Ogura, former director general of MOFA's  Economic Affairs Bureau, who is now ambassador-designate to Vietnam,  have provided the theoretical grounds for the emergence of "Pan-  Asianism, or nationalism under the name of Pan-Asianism," among  young bureaucrats.  He noted that, while Ogura carefully avoids the  term "kenbei" (dislike of the United States) and "openly emphasizes"  the desirability of cooperation with the United States, his writings  have "provoked nationalism" among young bureaucrats, "even though  they are not the mainstream views in MOFA."      Suzuki claimed that Ogura's articles have attracted young MOFA  bureaucrats chiefly because he focuses on the "cultural" aspects of  Japan's foreign relations rather than "technical" aspects of  security and economic relations, as many bureaucrats allegedly did  in the past.  He noted in particular that two of Ogura's articles-  -"Crack Between the Empire of Ideas and the Lost People" published  in the June 1991 GAIKO FORUM, and "For Restoration of the Rights of  Asia" published in the July 1993 CHUO KORON -- have influenced young  bureaucrats.  In the GAIKO FORUM article, Suzuki observed, Ogura  termed U.S. demands put forth in trade negotiations as an attempt to  make Japan its "mental colony" by forcing the Japanese to "have the  same sense of values as Americans."  In the CHUO KORON article,  Suzuki wrote, Ogura called for restoring the "tradition and spirit  of Asia," since "Western civilization--an endless pursuit of greed  and self-assertion--cannot resolve the world's problems."  Suzuki  also claimed that the best-selling book written by Ichiro Ozawa, co-  leader of the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), Blueprint For  Building a New Japan--"which has been enthusiastically read" by many  young bureaucrats--has been used by them as a source of "Pan-Asian"  inspiration.  To support his conclusion about the thrust of Ozawa's  book, Suzuki cited the passage in the book, in which Ozawa calls for  a shift from "Western to Oriental values."     Suzuki asserted that "most" young diplomats are "fed up with  negotiations with the United States, which give working-level  bureaucrats nothing but many troubles and pain" and are influenced  by the idea of "returning to Asia."  He noted that young diplomats  now want to be assigned to Asia, where they feel "much more  comfortable," rather than serve in the United States.  According to  Suzuki, this "inclination" is spreading to other ministries, such as  the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry.  He claimed that the young diplomats often say:  "If  things do not work with the United States, there is always Asia."  (Author:  Innes.

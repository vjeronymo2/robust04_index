National Retirement Concepts (NRC) has  developed a series of such programs, which provide vacations with plenty of  activities and a minimum of sales pitches.  </P> <P> NRC's tours are limited to U.S. destinations. Trips are offered to Arizona,  Arkansas and North Carolina. Later this spring NRC will add South Carolina and  two Florida trips, one to the East Coast and one to the west.  </P> <P> None of the trips are tied in with any retirement community, and at each  destination travelers are given tours of several such communities in order to  make comparisons while they enjoy sightseeing and area attractions.  </P> <P> The North Carolina tour offers eight days and seven nights of first-class  lodging, plus daily breakfast, three special-event dinners and deluxe motor  coach or mini-coach transportation throughout the visit.  </P> <P> The land portion of this trip, including all of the above plus all taxes, tips  and baggage handling, is $690 per person, double occupancy. Transportation to  and from the destination is extra, and on request will be arranged at current  available minimum cost by NRC.  </P> <P> The two other tours, also for eight days, include full daily breakfast, four  lunches and three special-event dinners, plus all of the features described  above. Arizona is priced at $655, and the other to Arkansas is $695, per  person, land portion only.  </P> <P> For free brochures that list available dates and complete tour descriptions  plus other information, call toll-free (800) 888-2312, or write to National  Retirement Concepts, 1454 N. Wineland Court, Chicago 60610.  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Arts: Caviare to the general - Television It is as much a waste of time to complain about the general vulgarity of television as to object to the average height of the population. Once you involve the profit motive (or, as Ben Elton kept saying on election night, the 'profit motif', unless it was 'Prophet Mo Teef') it is inevitable that a mass medium such as television will seek to maximise its audience. Experience suggests that this may be true even without the profit motive: the BBC has long felt the need to get big ratings some of the time in order to sustain its claim on the licence fee. The important consideration for the more demanding viewer is, what proportion of the output is vulgar nonsense, and, as television continues to expand, the extent to which bad is driving out good. For newspaper commentators to condemn programmes such as It's Bizarre] is hypocritical and pointless. Hypocritical because this new Saturday night 'infotainment' series on parts of the ITV network is remarkably similar in subject and tone to much of the popular press. True, Tit Bits and Weekend which relied on a similar collection of 'just fancy that' stories, no longer exist. But many of the items in the opening edition would have sat quite unremarkably in the pages of The Sun or Sunday People and, I suspect, in several instances have already done so. The woman 'married' to identical twins, the 'wolf boys', and the sex therapist who rented Norman Lamont's house, all seemed distinctly familiar, though the Welshman who eats live worms was certainly, er, novel. Co-presenter Linda Lusardi first came to public attention on Page 3 of The Sun where, of course, very large parts of her were on display. It might be argued that covering up her main assets before putting her on television was counter-productive, but presumably most people would regard her television appearance as less 'vulgar' than her newspaper appearance. Furthermore, in any contest for the sleaziest, not to say most ridiculous, excesses of the mass media, print would still beat television hands down. No broadcaster has yet come up with anything to compete with the US's National Enquirer or Britain's own Sunday Sport. There is even one instance at present where it could be argued that the bringing of vulgarity to the screen is something of a triumph. Benny Hill, having been banished thanks to the undue influence of a few feminists and right-on alternative comedians in the silliest example yet of 'political correctness' in British broadcasting, has been quietly reinstated on Tuesday evenings at peak time. Having banned Hill's shows from British screens, the people at ITV must have felt rather silly when commentators such as Anthony Burgess, John Mortimer and Michael Bentine began praising him as a classic clown, and newspapers revealed to the British public that the shows, sold of course by ITV, were being screened with extraordinary success in 100 countries overseas, including the US. As it happens, I find Hill's screen persona embarrassingly ingratiating and would not normally choose to watch him, but there is surely no more sense in campaigning against the vulgarity of his shows than in campaigning against the vulgarity of hamburgers. 'Vulgar' comes from 'vulgus', Latin for 'the great multitude of the people', and all it really implies is that something is popular. If the world is full of people who actually prefer hamburgers to whitebait or oxtail, never mind pate de foie gras, it scarcely seems worth wasting breath in trying to convert them; we must just kick aside the hamburger cartons as we walk to the wet fish shop and the family butcher. However, the time when we are surely entitled to start shouting is when the hamburger joints start putting the fish shops and butchers out of business. In television terms that means the time when, despite the growing number of channels and the increasing number of hours, it begins to look as though the number of high quality programmes is going down (although it should be going up if the proportions were being maintained) and vulgarity is creeping in even to places where it was once notably absent. Previously the BBC's Young Musician Of The Year contest was one of the most heartening events in the calendar, offering a showcase for talent and providing several programmes of unadulterated music. Humphrey Burton  - enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and highly professional  - was the presenter, and his brief interviews gave us a bit of background on the competitors. Burton did present the final this year, but the heats had been changed. They were presented by a young woman with a strong regional accent and a young black man with an exotic hairstyle, all of which would be unremarkable provided they had proved with their knowledge and professionalism that they had been selected as the best at the job and not for being politically correct. Unfortunately there was little sign of this. Worse, no sooner had one of the competitors started performing than the picture faded away, the music became 'background', and we found ourselves watching a contestant riding her horse or wandering along a canal gossiping about his hobbies. A unique series of occasions for music lovers had been turned into another set of chat shows. Why? Television is overloaded with shows which combine casual chat and musical interludes. In addition to six lots of Jonathan Ross and two lots of Wogan every week, we get Cilla Black's Surprise Surprise, Phillip Schofield with Television's Greatest Hits (which turns out to be a chat'n'clip show) and of course Aspel And Company which, this week, contained one of the stickiest confrontations in living memory. Aspel's questions were mostly longer than Cher's answers, of which one of the more informative was 'I don't know'. Friday saw the start of yet another music and chat series: Bruce's Guest Night on BBC1, in which Bruce Forsyth clowns and sings with pop stars and sportsmen. If that is what people want, let them have it, but why did Channel 4's programme on Sunday called Sue Farrow Plays Mozart have to go down the same road? No doubt you have to trick out a lot of modern pop music with laser shows and funny clothing since viewers would not stay tuned for the music on its own, but Mozart's Symphony No 40 is a very different kettle of fish. With the orchestra in white tie, it is ludicrous to bring on a conductor with a crew cut, black leather trousers, black leather waistcoat and open necked shirt. . . particularly when the conductor happens to be a woman. To surround her in a cone of laser beams, bathe the musicians in pink or orange light, and then insert more than 50 edits in the space of 60 seconds is plain daft: nobody could watch that sort of frenzy and properly appreciate the music. Up to now, the familiar British middle-class attitude of superciliousness towards television as a whole has been as nonsensical as a similar attitude towards the whole of print or food. Most of the material in all these spheres has always been aimed at mass taste. But, as the appalling Thatcher Broadcasting Act begins to have its effect, we had better watch more carefully than ever to see what is happening to that proportion of television which used to have higher ambitions because, if we are not careful, we may indeed end up with nothing but the vulgar.</p>

[Di Tella] The Foreign Ministry plays a marginal role in  this  issue because in some countries, not necessarily all neighboring  countries, there are possibilities of subversive infiltration.  We must follow political and socio-economic developments in  Latin America closely, since they were the factors that  triggered the crisis in Chiapas. Notwithstanding this, the  president and all his cabinet think that the socio-economic and  political situation in Mexico is totally different from  Argentina. Our country's cultural, political, and  socio-economic levels are more similar to those of Spain than to  those of Mexico.    [Santoro] How does the Foreign Ministry view the events that  took place in Chiapas? As a revolt organized by marginal  Indians or a return to guerrilla outbreaks in Latin America?    [Di Tella] We believe that, besides socio-economic problems,  the type of military organization and the hardware and weapons  used by the Zapatist Army bear no resemblance to the ones  illiterate and marginal people can manage to obtain. There is a  very substantive organization that was mounted on the basis of a  social problem.    [Santoro] According to confidential information that you  have  received, does this Mexican guerrilla group have any  international connections?    [Di Tella] It has links to drug trafficking, which financed  the purchase of those sophisticated weapons. The link between  subversive guerrillas and drug trafficking has already been seen  in Peru and Colombia. This may be a third case.    [Santoro] Sources close to the presidency have stated that  the government has a CIA report that contends that there are  allegedly Argentine guerrillas actively involved in Chiapas ...    [Di Tella] There is no CIA report. There was only an  exchange of diplomatic information with the U.S. Department of  State and other Latin American governments.    [Santoro] Has the Mexican Government reported about the  Argentines?    [Di Tella] No, it has not.    [Santoro] Well, then, what was the basis of the president's  public assertion that there are Argentines [involved in Chiapas]?    [Di Tella] (Silence). That was our first impression, but we  had no confirmation. I can neither confirm nor deny it.    [Santoro] Was that "impression" based on an intelligence  source ...?    [Di Tella] It was based on the fact that some people linked  to Argentine guerrilla groups have been living in Mexico for a  long time.    [Santoro] Are your referring to Montoneros?    [Di Tella] There are several groups that took refuge in  Mexico. It is alleged that they have some links. As far as  generic information, it is true, but we do not have precise  facts to say that it is so-and-so or such and such a group that  is operating there. The president has been concerned about the  existence of that generic link for some time.    [Santoro] Why for some time?    [Di Tella] Because he knew that guerrilla groups had sought  refuge in Mexico.    [Santoro] But that was in the 1970's and now the Montoneros  have broken up, unless we are talking about Enrique Gorraran  Merlo and the All for the Fatherland Movement ...    [Di Tella] I do not wish to discuss hypotheses.    [Santoro] At least you can make it clear whether you were  talking about current guerrilla groups or those that date back  to the 1970's ...    [Di Tella] To groups that operated in the 1970's. Many  former guerrillas have entered the mainstream of politics in  democracy, while others have not.    [Santoro] You were detained during the military regime. Are  you not afraid that stirring up "ghosts" of the past might spark  a "witch-hunt"?    [Di Tella] No, not in the least. Even though excesses were  committed in the past, that does not mean that we cannot  maintain order and security at present. Security forces can be  put to good or bad use. They have been used appropriately since  the reinstatement of democracy.</p>

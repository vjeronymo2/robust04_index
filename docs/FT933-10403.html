			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat sets date for annual meeting Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group which is in talks with its banks about refinancing its Pounds 1bn of debt, said yesterday it would hold its annual meeting on August 26. However, because it would be unable to prepare accounts by that date, the meeting would be adjourned after 'having considered such business as it is able to' and reconvened when the accounts were available. The group said recent valuation work showed 'a significant diminution' in its assets since December 31 which could result in a breach of its borrowing powers. A resolution to amend the borrowing powers would be put to the annual meeting.</p>

Not long ago, Henry Kissinger visited Beijing with a message  that he had been asked by Mrs Thatcher, at that time British  prime minister, to transmit verbally to the Chinese leadership:  "Mrs Thatcher indicated that it was not an idea of the British  Government that the H&amp;S Banking Corporation merge with the  British Lloyds Bank, but that it was a business decision of the  said bank itself, which thereby planned to extend its operations  to Europe. It is for that reason that they will move  headquarters to England, namely to London."    The fact is that the said bank took the mentioned merger as  a  pretext for its actually moving away, and this only confirms the  earlier opinion held by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Commission. At a conference discussing suitable countermeasures  -- a conference presided over by Ji Pengfei -- it was the  unanimous opinion that assent should be refused to the decision  of the H&amp;S Banking Corporation.    The State Council informed Kissinger of this and requested  him to transmit the information to Britain. The H&amp;S Banking  Corporation thereupon withdrew its decision to merge with the  Lloyds Bank, but merely bought a parcel of Lloyds Bank shares.    However, after the 4 June incident, the H&amp;S Banking  Corporation bought further shares of the Lloyds Bank,  transferred its headquarters to London, and thus, in the end,  did realized its intention of moving away. Since the H&amp;S  Banking  Corporation occupied a decisive position in financial circles,  its moving headquarters away from Hong Kong indicated a lack of  confidence in China's policies, and this has had an adverse  effect on the mood of Hong Kong residents. On the other hand, it  is impossible for the said bank to completely withdraw from  business dealings with Hong Kong and China. Its main profits  come from Hong Kong and from business with the interior of  China, a trade which has greatly developed following China's  reform and opening up to the outside world.    Before the H&amp;S Banking Corporation moved away, the  British  Government of Hong Kong had gradually transferred some of the  official central bank functions of the H&amp;S Banking  Corporation,  such as its monetary administrative functions, to be exercised  by another, separately established organization. This fact shows  that Britain had all along never ceased dispositions with regard  to the bank's withdrawal, and that it was only after the 4 June  incident that the H&amp;S Banking Corporation came out openly  with  its actual withdrawal.    Although views differed as to whether the H&amp;S Banking  Corporation could effect a withdrawal, the attitude of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Committee toward the said bank remained  one of close cooperation and active coordination, as a means of  strengthening the said bank's confidence in the situation.  Normal contacts were maintained with the two former presidents  Shelby and Purves, cooperating in the recovery at the Hong Kong  stock market and helping Hong Kong's medium-sized and small  Chinese banks in their difficulties. In the formulation of the  Basic Law it was also decided, so as to keep the H&amp;S Banking  Corporation from moving away, that the future government of the  special administrative region of Hong Kong would not set up a  central bank. The policies of allowing the H&amp;S Banking  Corporation, after 1997, to have certain central bank functions,  allowing it to issue banknotes, operating with participation of  the Bank of China, and other such policies, were to be  maintained.    After the H&amp;S Banking Corporation had entered the Inner  China  market, Purves once told me that they had certain bad debts in  the interior, which they could not recover, and he gave me some  details. As soon as I heard of it, I immediately agreed to help  them, asking to be informed of the particular items and  circumstances, and we did help them in their negotiations in the  interior. Later, certain problems were indeed resolved through  these negotiations, but some could not be resolved, and I  reported to him the circumstances of the negotiations, having  him understand and telling him not to be concerned. This work  had certainly shown some positive results for the H&amp;S Banking  Corporation.    Beijing did not completely agree with us in the perception  of  the situation, and some of their measures were hard to explain.  For instance, Li Peng (at that time vice chairman) did not  solicit our opinion, also did not keep us informed, when he gave  Rong Zhijian funds (Rong was in charge of the Hong Kong office  of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation; he  is the son of Rong Yiren [2837 3015 0088]), having him buy up in  Hong Kong the shares of the China Light and Power Company of  Hong Kong. When Rong was unable to do so, he bought the shares  of the Guotai Company instead. This process of buying up shares  had positive as well as negative effects. It may have a certain  positive effect from the standpoint of holding back British  capital. However, on the other hand, it will also create a  certain anxiety among Hong Kong's general public: Is it the  intention of Chinese capital with this "grandiose show of  capabilities" to effect nationalization of enterprises through  the buying-up of their shares? Will this buying up of shares not  indeed effect a "lian" [uniting], then by controlling the  shareholdings a "he" [merging], and finally the "guo" [nation]  as in nationalization, thus truly achieving a "lian he guo"  ["United Nations"]? Arousing this anxiety was detrimental to  efforts to keep British capital from moving away and detrimental  to creating a sense of stability that Chinese capital, Overseas  Chinese capital, and foreign capital desired.    Being supported by the their colonial government, the  British-owned financial groups in Hong Kong were not only of a  colonial character, but their character was also, to a certain  extent, monopolistic. This was most evident in the public  utilities and postal service, but also in telecommunications,  resources, electric power, and other such undertakings. In the  face of these facts it was our intention, in order to keep  British finance from moving away, to maintain an attitude that  did not altogether negate their monopolistic character, but to  rather adopt a policy of restricting further amplifications. The  problem of such restrictions was also not be solved by setting  up laws or policies, or by administrative measures of the  government, but rather by allowing the laws of the market to  gradually take effect.    When I once visited the Hongkong Telephone and Electric  Light  Company, they expressed to me their desire to invest in the  interior and expand their business operations. I thereupon  consulted the Chinese minister of posts and telecommunications  on whether that company should be permitted to go into the  interior to help improve the backward state of post and  telecommunications services. We truly needed help from abroad,  financially and technically. However, the minister would not  agree to my proposal, as a matter of principle. He indicated  that we already had four firms inside China, investing in  telecommunications. Hong Kong has invested in Shenzhen, and was  actively maneuvering to enter Jiangsu Province. He said his  ministry opposed this kind of activity because it would result  in a diversity of systems and great confusion, and he also  inclined to refuse all further developments in matters of  telecommunications investments. My efforts, thus, did not find  his support.    Generally speaking, efforts to keep British capital from  moving away have had a certain effect, but results were not  ideal.

On the announcement by China that it will  recover its sovereignty over Hong Kong, some Chinese capitalists  hurriedly moved their funds away, and the outflow of capital, as  also the emigration of people, became increasingly serious. In  the interest of Hong Kong's prosperity and of its economy, it  became therefore critically necessary to assure the Chinese  capitalists of the stability of the situation.    We worked on this problem from a political as well as from  an  economic angle. In political respects, we worked for a  broadening of the united patriotic front, and stressing the key  points, tried to persuade the major capitalists, assuring them  first of the stability of the situation, which in turn, we  hoped, would have an effect on the other Chinese capitalists,  and would achieve the objective of stabilizing a large sector or  even the entire situation. At the same time, we employed  economic means to support and help the Chinese capitalists, to  dispel their anxieties and build up their confidence.    Of course, it would not have been sufficient to rely merely  on our work in Hong Kong; it was very important to be able to  rely on China. China did persist in its policy of reforming and  opening up to the outside world, of rapid development of the  economy, and of making increasing use of Hong Kong. Of course,  the attraction of China proper for Hong Kong was also increasing  substantially. As a consequence, Chinese capitalists changed  their views on China, and confidence rapidly increased. That was  the general trend of the stabilization in Hong Kong.    There were quite a few Chinese capitalists who relied on  British support, since they had grown up with the support of  British banks, but some of them also relied on support from  China. China's support was political as well as --and that more  importantly -- commercial support, but the two kinds were  actually hard to separate from each other. Some capitalists were  no doubt guided by purely commercial considerations. However,  there were also those who were guided by political  considerations or by both political and commercial  considerations.    We asked the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China and  organizations with Chinese capital funds to more effectively  contribute to the work of stabilizing Chinese capital, and that  they should broaden their cooperation with the Chinese  capitalists and engage in business. We asked that they assist  the Chinese capitalists with regard to sources of supplies,  short-term loans, and that they also get the Chinese capitalists  to invest in China proper. This policy would have been of  benefit for both sides, as it would have meant profits for the  merchants and would also have been helpful for China's reform  and opening up by increasing exports, attracting capital funds,  and introducing new technologies and managerial experiences.    The arrival in Hong Kong of delegates from various Chinese  provincial and municipal departments and commissions has been an  important "resource" for stabilizing Chinese capital. Following  the change in foreign trade policy, the various ministries and  commissions of the central government, as well as the various  provinces and municipalities, have shown a desire to trade by  themselves in the products produced in their territories. They  were eager to contact by themselves markets abroad, and this  provided much opportunity for Chinese capital in Hong Kong, as  it brought them the opportunity to act as agents for the sale of  Chinese commodities, and to engage in either wholesale or retail  business, and also to undertake other types of cooperation. We  supported the move of various provinces and municipalities to  have their departments or commissions set up organizations in  Hong Kong and helped them by introducing connections.    To induce Hong Kong's Chinese capitalists to invest in China  proper, we organized several informatory trips by representative  personalities from Hong Kong industry and commerce to important  provinces and municipalities in China, so as to facilitate more  mutual contacts and mutual understanding, and also to increase  opportunities for mutual business relations. I personally led  several of these groups on visits to Jiangsu, Fujian, Shanghai,  and other places, where I requested leading cadres in these  places to personally receive the visitors. For instance, one  year in Jiangsu, it was provincial governor Gu Xiulian [7357  4423 5571] and in Shanghai Mayor Jiang Zemin [3068 3419 3046]  who personally received the visitors, informed them of the  situation and conditions, and replied to their questions.    In the middle and later years of the 1980's, few major Hong  Kong capitalists invested in China proper. Those who really went  in were medium-sized and small firms. In order to get large and  medium capitalists and shareholders to invest in China proper,  also to dispel their anxieties and increase their confidence, we  reorganized the stock ownership and functions of the "Hong Kong  and Macao International," allotting to it as main task: to bring  large and medium-sized capitalists from Hong Kong, Macao, and  also Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia to China to invest in  China. It might be done by adopting cooperative methods "to  build bridges for them and pave the way for them," or they might  also be helped in the resolution of their difficulties in their  own independent business operations. Because soon after the  reorganization the 4 June incident occurred, the reorganization  was of little effect.    We suggested that the Bank of China increase its business  dealings with large and medium-sized firms. The work style of  the Bank of China group in Hong Kong was staid and conservative.  Targets of their lending activities were mainly medium-sized and  small firms and industrial enterprises. Their work was quite  successful, but the drawback was that they had few dealings with  major firms. Considering the Bank of China group's development  by itself, and starting out from the needs of united front work,  everybody should expend greater effort and increase business  contacts with the large firms. Of course, risks involved would  be somewhat greater, but that should not stop the further  pursuit of the reform. Acting in this way will lead to new  developments in the business operations of the Bank of China,  will increase contacts with large and medium-sized firms, and  would, in the same manner as in the case of medium and small  firms, through these contacts gradually, in the economic sphere,  bring about a sense of stability also among these large- and  medium-sized firms.    The Sino-British Agreement stipulates that the use of land  in  Hong Kong must be approved by a land committee, and that  approval must not be given for the sale in excess of 50 hectares  per year. China established this principle on a directive from  Deng Xiaoping: Britain should not be allowed to sell off all  Hong Kong government land before 1997; there had to be a  restriction. To facilitate Sino-British negotiations and the  resolution of mutual problems, a special land committee was set  up, and it was furthermore stipulated that half of the income  from the sale of government land by the British Government of  Hong Kong must be left for the use of the future government of  the special administrative region.    Hong Kong's real estate firms, especially the major ones,  were very much in favor of this arrangement. They owned large  tracts of land, and restrictions on the sale of government land  would bring them, the real estate dealers, even higher profits  in their business transactions. In business contacts that we  have had with large real estate firms, some repeatedly requested  us: "Don't let the Land Committee approve more land deals."  Because there was this stipulation in the Sino-British  Agreement about not approving too many land sales, and also  since we really did not have any experience as to what effects  our action could have in other respects, we did act in those few  years essentially in accordance with the agreement. Although  some more than permissible land sales might have been approved,  the amount was small and has had some positive effect in  enhancing the sense of stability among the large real estate  firms.    However, we soon also discovered that a few large real  estate  firms gradually came to constitute a kind of monopoly in Hong  Kong's real estate market. I asked the Chinese members of the  Land Committee, and also asked its investigation and research  office, to study this problem and to determine what after all  would be the desirable amount of land for which sales could be  approved, particularly also in the coming years, because if too  many land sales would be approved, it would depress land prices,  while the approval of too few land sales would have the effect  of demand exceeding supplies, and thereby causing steep rises in  real estate prices. This task of assessing the proper limits was  proposed by me after 1987, but I did not get to know the  conclusions from this investigation.

When people started to loose confidence in the  situation, some of the major shareholders of the Bank of East  Asia wanted to withdraw their capital. This caused a dispute  among the shareholders, and a French bank tried to take  advantage of the situation and buy up the shares of the Bank of  East Asia, which was thereby in great danger. It was then that  the chairman of the board of directors, Li Guobao, sought help  from the Bank of China. He approached the Hong Kong branch of  the Bank of China and also approached me in the NEW CHINA NEWS  AGENCY. After a study by the economic leading group of the Hong  Kong Affairs Committee, it was decided to support the Bank of  East Asia, and that the Bank of China should come forward to  render assistance. Shares of the Bank of East Asia, held by the  Bank of China, were not to be sold, and more of these shares  should be acquired, to get Li Guobao out from his dangerous  position.    In the course of supporting Chinese capitalists by means of  economic measures, it also happened that such action caused  losses. The most serious case of this nature was the case of the  Kangli Company. Shortly after I had come to Hong Kong, Cao  Weilian [2580 1218 1670], deputy director of XINHUA SHE, in  charge of economic affairs (a former vice minister in the  Ministry of Machine Building and Electronics, a person with  close links to Jiang Zemin) informed me that the Kangli Company  was a large electronics enterprise in Hong Kong, and that its  manager, Ke Junwen [2688 0193 2429], was a highly esteemed  person with high ideals and great competence in business  affairs. Ke himself also boasted that he will become Hong Kong's  Konosuke Matsushita (the founder of the Matsushita enterprise in  Japan, revered as the "God of Business"). Cao Weilian had hoped  that Ke Junwen would visit China proper and place investments  there, and Cao personally accompanied Ke on a visit to Fujian,  Jiangsu, Beijing, and other places, and also introduced him to  leading cadres in the central government; Gu Mu [6253 3668], a  state counselor, also met him. Ke, then, proposed cooperation  with Chinese capital, and after we studied his proposals, we  also agreed with him, and would have three parties in Hong Kong,  the Bank of China, Huarun, and China Merchants, jointly raise  capital and cooperate with him. After all the capital was  invested, Ke Junwen ran away. We investigated and found that he  had also used the name of yet another company for large-scale  transfers of Kangli capital and movable property. This was a  serious lesson indeed. Later, experts from China assessed the  value of Kangli's real estate and equipment and stated that its  equipment was still very good, some of it even not yet available  in China, so that the economic loss, fortunately, was not too  serious. However, the continuous losses in business operations  will be a burden for many years to come.    Supporting Chinese capitalists in the development of their  undertakings is also an important aspect. In 1986, Hu Yingxiang  and Li Jiacheng [2621 0857 6134] came together to see me with a  plan for the development of a stretch of ocean west of Hong Kong  island and of Lantau Island, there to build a second airport. As  one location being considered for the project was Chek Lap Kok  Island, another was the area between Lantau Island and Hong Kong  island. They were also planning to reclaim land from the sea  between Lantau Island and Hong Kong and build a new harbor, a  residential area, and a commercial area there, also submarine  tunnels between Lantau Island and Hong Kong, and also between  Lantau Island and Kowloon, and an express highway from Lantau  Island to the new border port of Luomazhou.    After listening to their plan, I fully concurred with them,  convinced that this plan would not only satisfy Hong Kong's  needs for sea, land, and air transportation in the 1990's, but  also those of the first part of the 20th century, and that it  would further enhance Hong Kong's function of import-export base  in South China. I said: "This is a very good plan, it has to be  reported to Beijing; I can be responsible to do that." I asked  them: "Have you talked to the Hong Kong government? Better first  talk to them and get their support." My concern was that since  Hong Kong was still administered by the British Hong Kong  Government, it stands to reason that so huge an engineering  project would only be possible if it had that government's  consent and support. I also suggested that they should not  divulge the plan to outsiders before having clarified the  position of the British Hong Kong government. Li Jiacheng asked  Hu Yingxiang: "Do the reporters know about it?" Hu said he had  already made arrangements to meet the press. I suggested not to  do that, and Li Jiacheng agreed with me, but Hu persisted in  doing it. As a consequence, after publicizing the plan to the  press, there was no response at all from the British Hong Kong  government, who apparently shelved the matter.    After the 4 June incident, the British Hong Kong government  came out with its own plan for building a new airport. I think  things would have been quite different if Li and Hu had first  solicited an opinion from the British Hong Kong government.

Foreign capital  uses Hong Kong mainly to expand activities into Southeast Asia,  especially into China. Since China's reform and opening up to  the outside world, especially after the signing of the  Sino-British Joint Statement, the position of Hong Kong as an  intermediary, and as a springboard and bridge, has foreign  capital increasingly recognize its usefulness and has foreign  capital find Hong Kong increasingly attractive.    Under these circumstances, the opportunity must not be lost  for extensive and close contacts with the diplomatic agencies  and commercial institutions in Hong Kong, stationed there by the  various countries and territories, and we must assist them in  gaining an understanding of China's policies and to resolve  whatever difficulties they may have. That is one of the major  tasks of the branch office of NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY.    With this in mind, the said branch office instituted an  internal division of labor: Main responsibility of the external  affairs department was to maintain broadest contacts with the  diplomatic organizations in Hong Kong, stationed there by the  various countries and territories. The economics department had  mainly to contact the commercial organizations of the various  countries and some mass organizations, as for instance, the  American General Chamber of Commerce. I myself had frequently  accepted their invitations to meet with them, and, at their  requests, had answered some of their questions. Foreign capital  was at that time generally concerned about two problems: One was  whether there could be a political change in China's Hong Kong  policy, and, secondly, they resented the monopolistic position  of British capital in Hong Kong, a situation which they hoped  would be changed.    For instance, bankers from other countries than Britain,  stationed in Hong Kong, resented very much that the H&amp;S  Banking  Corporation would enjoy many privileges of a central bank, but  would not have the obligations of a central bank. Especially  American and French banks expressed their criticism to the Hong  Kong branch of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY and to the Chinese  Government, and also expressed the hope that when China will  formulate the Basic Law, it will include restrictions on Britain  in the future monetary policy of what will be the government of  the special administrative region.    I was pondering how to take care as much as possible of the  interests of foreign capital and how to satisfy their demands as  far as possible without unduly offending the British Government  and harming the interests of British capital. Some  foreign-financed banks in Hong Kong are pressing for the right  to issue banknotes. I positively suggested to Ji Pengfei and  Zhao Ziyang [6392 4793 7122] to consider allowing American,  Japanese, and French banks to participate to a limited amount in  the issuing of banknotes, so as to give the Hong Kong currency a  more international character. Later, the Basic Law included a  provision of a decisive character, as it stipulated: "The right  of issuing Hong Kong currency shall be a right of the Government  of the Special Administrative Region. ... The Government of the  Special Administrative Region...may confer the right to  specially designated banks within legally prescribed  limitations, which banks then may issue, or continue to issue,  Hong Kong currency." Bankers of other nationalities stationed in  Hong Kong have been quite satisfied with this arrangement. The  basic law consultative committee had admitted as members and  advisors several foreign capitalists and bankers, giving them a  chance to state their opinions.    As the economy of Hong Kong has developed, foreign capital  has become increasingly active in Hong Kong, and it has become  an absolutely indispensable matter, in the interests of Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity, to effectively deal with  foreign capital.    We had attached the greatest importance to our dealings with  the capital funds held in Hong Kong by Overseas Chinese. Apart  from devoting myself personally much effort to contacts with  them on a broad scale, work was also done through relevant  departments in China and organizations of Chinese capital in  Hong Kong. The aim was to dispel their doubts and anxieties,  affirm their resolve to make use of Hong Kong and to enter Hong  Kong, to provide them with facilities, to cooperate with them,  and to render service to them.    Capital of Overseas Chinese refers mainly to the capital  held  in Hong Kong by the overseas Chinese of Southeast Asia. Some of  the major overseas Chinese capitalists of Southeast Asia, such  as Lin Shaoliang [2651 4801 5328] of Indonesia, Guo Henian [6753  7729 1628] of Malaysia, and Xie Guomin [6200 0948 3046] of  Thailand, all have considerable investments in Hong Kong. That  is so because, on the one hand, Hong Kong itself has its  particular attractiveness, and, on the other hand, because of  political considerations. For instance, Lin Shaoliang has close  relations with Indonesia's president Soeharto, and at one time,  when Soeharto's position had become shaky, Lin Shaoliang  regarded Hong Kong as a safe haven for his capital. When the  Malaysian Government for a time behaved anti-Chinese, the  Chinese in Malaysia also often used Hong Kong as safe haven for  their capital. Since China's reform and opening up, Overseas  Chinese capital flowed through Hong Kong on its way to China  proper; the Overseas Chinese had always attached great  importance to the useful function of Hong Kong.

"Statements by Mikhail Gorbachev about his possible  participation in presidential elections in 1996 are completely  groundless. He has no social basis", Viktor Mironov, deputy  chairman of the Duma Committee on Security told TASS on Monday.    "With all my respect to the former Soviet president, I  believe he has exhausted his resources of a head of state", he  added.</p>

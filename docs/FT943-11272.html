			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Terrorist targets identified last year A security report identifying London's 'embassy row', which includes the Israeli embassy, as a prime potential target for a car-bomb attack was given to the royal household and to the Metropolitan Police at the end of last year. The 100-page risk analysis, which detailed the resurging threat of fundamentalist groups opposed to peace moves in the Middle East, was prepared by one of Britain's leading anti-terrorist experts. It was commissioned by officials working for the royal family as part of a security review of the state departments of Kensington Palace, which is situated near the Israeli embassy. The report's author, Major John Wyatt, was a serving officer in Ulster. His private company, Search Training International, has advised businesses on protection against terrorism and on security for the Crown Jewels. Maj Wyatt said this week that he had been concerned about security being relaxed prior to Tuesday's bomb at the Israeli embassy. However he added that in his view 'no degree of risk analysis' could have prevented the attack. Nevertheless news of the report's existence will be an embarrassment to security officials who have been criticised by the Israeli government for ignoring requests for additional security after the July 18 bomb attack on the central Jewish community building in Buenos Aires which killed at least 96 people. Scotland Yard would not comment on the report but a police official expressed surprise that a risk analysis for Kensington Palace on such a sensitive subject should have been commissioned from a private consultancy and not from the police or the intelligence agencies. The report does not specifically refer to the Israeli embassy. However it identifies the growing threat of terrorism by Iran and by fundamentalist groups opposed to the Middle East peace moves. According to the analysis, the threat had shifted from the US to Europe following the bomb attack on New York's World Trade Centre. Predictions of an upsurge in fundamentalist terrorism do not appear to have been shared by MI5 and MI6, the intelligence agencies. Both appear to have focused their attention on the threat posed by the IRA.</p>

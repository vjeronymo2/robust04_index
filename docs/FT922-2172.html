			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (9): A way to generate larger sales - Freephone services herald intelligent network era FREEPHONE services, still in their infancy in Europe, have spawned a telemarketing industry worth about Dollars 8bn annually in the US. As with hamburgers, blue jeans and credit cards, analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the mass freephone habit crosses the water. The term 'freephone' is something of a misnomer. In fact, organisations receiving 0800-type calls foot the bill for the service in return for the greater volume of customer contacts which result from callers not having to pay to make inquiries or place orders. Two variations on the theme are long-distance calls to corporate sales or service centres in which callers are charged only local rates and the recipient picks up whatever the telephone company deems to be the difference, and country-to-country 0800 calling. Either way, freephone is seen as a cost-effective way for companies to generate large volumes of new sales leads or service an existing customer base. 'One of the reasons that a lot of these services have taken off in the US is that corporate customers have realised they offer a real competitive advantage,' says Mr Tony Cobbe, group director for GPT's telecommunications systems group, along with its partner Siemens, a main supplier of freephone equipment. Freephone calls exploit what the telecommunications industry dubs 'Intelligent Network' (IN) technology. Put simply, an IN involves the addition of computer intelligence to the telephone network to allow a number of permutations on the traditional function of connecting one wireline subscriber to another and charging the call originator for the privilege. As well as reversing normal charging procedures, computer intelligence facilitates the introduction of a whole range of new services. Included are offerings such as virtual private networks, in which unused public network capacity is partitioned off for private company use; credit card calling; calls to and from personal numbers regardless of an individual's physical location in the network; the display of incoming caller numbers; automatic re-routing of calls around a network to accommodate traffic surges following televised appeals or disasters; and pay-per-use telephone information services which encompass anything from weather reports to so-called 'sex lines'. Cellular telephony is itself a species of IN service. Initial IN offerings such as freephone were built to be accessed nationwide but, to reduce operator costs, used a small number of large centralised data bases which were interrogated over a special transmission network as the need arose. Future implementations are likely to be more specialised both in terms of content and geographic availability. This has increased network design options to include smaller and more widely distributed intelligent nodes. 'None of the operators are going to want to put in huge amounts of extra transmission capability just to haul stuff to central or regional nodes if some of the services are more economically deployed more locally,' says Mr Cobbe. Telephone operators worldwide are investing in IN systems because they generate new revenues with much higher margins than conventional telephony. They are also a way of responding to competition, where this is permitted, and provide better tools for the overall management and control of networks and services. Adding to its attractions, the IN can provide access to new global service markets. However, public telecommunications operators do not have the field to themselves. In the case of 'value added' services such as recorded pop music or sports results, revenues are split with the information providers. How big the European IN value-added sector will become depends to some extent on the interpretation of Open Network Provision (ONP) legislation being prepared by the European Commission. ONP defines the conditions under which public networks can be accessed by private sector service providers and the trick for the EC will be to balance the ideal of equal access with the need to preserve the integrity of the network. Because some IN services imply that operators relinquish a degree of network control to their customers, developments on the ONP front will also be relevant to some corporate users of IN services. 'I don't think that anywhere in the world yet there's been enough experience of operating with a significant amount of user control,' says Mr Cobbe. 'We don't know whether there are, or are not, any network risks which arise from that.' Like the operators, telecommunications vendors such as Alcatel, AT&amp;T NSI, Ericsson, Fujitsu, GPT, NEC, Nokia, Northern Telecom and Siemens are keen supporters of IN. Manufacturers view it both as a parallel market opportunity for their established exchange systems and, because the technology is becoming switch-independent, as a possible means of entering new national markets. 'If you're big in the industry, you're big in intelligent networks,' says Mr Jim Cochrane, director of the switching business unit at AT&amp;T NSI. Just as IN services are not the sole preserve of the operators, so IN system supply is not an activity exclusive to telecommunication vendors. Some of the spoils of the new market have already gone to the data processing sector. Although AT&amp;T does not yet have a leading partnership in the IN sector with a computer system company, other telecommunications vendors have deemed it appropriate to work closely with the likes of IBM, DEC and Tandem. It is a moot point whether data processing (DP) vendors will eventually dominate the IN sector. According to IBM Europe 'The product focus in the period 1995 to 2000 will be the service management environment, where the DP technology strengths take place.' Mr Cochrane believes the computer companies still have some way to go to adapt to the stricter reliability disciplines of the telecommunications business: 'The computer industry has not emphasised fault-tolerance to a great degree and they've not introduced non-stop fault tolerance at all. It's just beginning to be a factor in their equations nowadays.' Whatever the truth of this, it is clear that the gathering momentum of IN will present opportunities and challenges to service operators, system suppliers and users alike. 'It will dominate the telecommunications market in the first part of the 21st century', says Mr Steven Timms, principal consultant at the UK's Ovum consultancy. 'At a conservative estimate, IN services will account for 22 per cent of US telco revenues and 10 per cent of European revenue by 2000.' The author is the editor of Telephony Magazine.</p>

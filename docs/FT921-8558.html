			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (8): Belated attempt to remedy matters - Investment THE low level of domestic savings and of local and foreign investment in the Philippines is one of the fundamental causes of the country's poor economic performance in relation to its south east Asian neighbours over the past decade. In a belated attempt to remedy matters, new foreign investment legislation was brought into force last year, but even its supporters acknowledge that it is only a first step towards improving the whole investment climate. Between 1981 and 1990, gross domestic investment averaged 20 per cent of gross domestic product, compared to 42 per cent for Singapore, 27 per cent for Thailand and more than 30 per cent for Indonesia and Malaysia, according to the Asian Development Bank. The Philippines has also been lagging well behind its rivals in attracting foreign investments. 'The Philippines was left behind by Thailand,' says Mr Enrique Esteban of the Centre for Research and Communication, an economic think-tank. 'It remained protectionist; anti-investment. We were very inward-looking in practically everything. We continued with an import substitution philosophy and we relied on American goodwill.' Even the most alluring investment regulations would not have been enough to inspire cautious foreign companies during the 1980s. The overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos and the coming to power of President Corazon Aquino in 1986 were followed by a series of right-wing coup attempts. In the 1989 attempt, the most recent and most damaging, more than 100 people were killed. The kidnapping of Mr Michael Barnes, the American vice-president of Philippine Geothermal Inc, on January 17 this year, is hardly likely to encourage western investors already contemplating the election campaign with trepidation. It was not known at the time of writing whether he was seized by left-wingers, right-wingers or criminals. Americans, furthermore, have been discouraged by the Philippine Senate's rejection of the 10-year bases treaty negotiated by the US and Filipino governments. Although existing investors, particularly Filipino Chinese, have learned to make the best of the arduous local conditions, potential newcomers are understandably deterred by the poor state of the country's infrastructure - electricity, for example, is sometimes in short supply because of delays in building new power stations - by the litigious nature of the society, and by bureaucracy which can condemn even the most respectable bankers to a nine-month wait for their work permits. Unhealthy rivalry between different islands or different regions has been known to delay a new project, but the inadequacies of the central government have, on the other hand, prompted some local authorities - in Cebu and Cavite, for example - to promote themselves to Japanese, American, Taiwanese, Korean and other investors with considerable success. Regardless of the laws in place, the crucial question is whether Filipino governments will put aside their nationalistic distrust of foreign participation in the economy and actually greet foreign investment with enthusiasm. One congressman went so far as to challenge the new foreign investment act as unconstitutional, although he lost his case in the Supreme Court. The new law allows investors not seeking special incentives to take a 100 per cent stake in any business, provided it does not appear on a 'negative list' of restricted activities. Broadly, the law simplifies investment procedures and means that foreign investors seeking full ownership of a company need not necessarily be located in an export processing zone or engaged in a 'pioneer' priority industry. Stockbrokers, however, say they are unclear as to how the law applies to listed companies - shares are divided into A and B shares, and only the B shares, making up a maximum of 40 per cent of the company, can be bought by foreigners. A more important aspect of the legislation is that it demonstrates a change in the government's investment philosophy. Before, it was assumed that foreign investment was banned or restricted unless certain conditions were met. Today, it is assumed that the investment is acceptable, provided it falls within official guidelines. Mr Margarito Teves, chairman of the House of Representatives committee on economic affairs and a prominent supporter of economic liberalisation, says the law 'will not be the panacea to our problems', and he is proposing a number of complementary measures. 'This is merely the starting point,' he says. 'The others address important concerns that are of interest to investors.' He is backing proposals to allow accelerated depreciation of assets for tax purposes, to improve security of land tenure for foreign investors, and to make it easier for foreign banks to operate. Another concern is the existing labour legislation, which discourages foreign investors by setting minimum wages without substantially helping the workers, who are often underpaid by local employers in any case. 'We have to rely less on foreign loans and more on foreign direct investment,' says Mr Teves. 'If we encourage and convince our bureaucracy to be more responsive, and find ways to cut the process to the barest minimum, maybe we can attract more investment to the Philippines.'</p>

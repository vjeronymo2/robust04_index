Tajik banks have stopped accepting deposits from  the population as of today. The circulation of old 10-rouble  banknotes was stopped the day before.    ITAR-TASS has learned from sources close to the Tajik  government that Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the Tajik Supreme  Soviet, had optimistically assessed at a meeting of a special  state commission on Monday evening the preliminary results of  the first stage's implementation. He stressed that this  important undertaking, in spite of several organisational  difficulties, was carried out with less social losses than  predicted by sceptics. On the whole, more than 120 billion old  roubles were withdrawn from circulation. The population got  wages and various allowances amounting to 10 billion new  roubles. The head of the Tajik state noted in particular that  honest people had not suffered from the republic's phased  accession to Russia's rouble zone. However, he ordered Tajik  law enforcement bodies to look into cases when individual  enterprises and commercial structures had turned in to banks  scores of millions of old roubles.    It was stressed during the commission's meeting that the  heads of corresponding ministries and departments were  confronted with the tasks of supplying the market with enough  goods, primarily food products, exercising strict control over  the state commercial system, and preventing the leakage of new  Russian roubles to other countries.    In the meantime, the situation in the state retail trade  network and on the local markets is deplorable. Food stores are  empty as before. Nothing has changed for the better at Dushanbe  markets. Owners of commercial kiosks have not reduced prices.</p>

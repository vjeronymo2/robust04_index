			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESERT SCULPTURES  </P> <P> by Henry J. Morro  </P> <P> We go back to the desert  </P> <P> and I lay my head on my mother's stomach  </P> <P> and listen to the place  </P> <P> where I began,  </P> <P> when she carried me on legs that opened  </P> <P> and burned rocks in the desert,  </P> <P> legs balanced on swollen feet  </P> <P> across a cracked earth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I listen to the water beneath those feet,  </P> <P> the water lost by bareback mothers,  </P> <P> the water slashed from yucca roots.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I split a cactus  </P> <P> and pour the juice on my mother's feet.  </P> <P> As she curls up in the sand,  </P> <P> together  </P> <P> we watch our skin perspire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> We become darker,  </P> <P> our bellies soft like lizards,  </P> <P> our fingers digging into the sand,  </P> <P> waiting for the sun to go down.  </P> <P> </P> <P> We lie in pools of sweat,  </P> <P> our water returning to the desert  </P> <P> beginning the erosion of another canyon,  </P> <P> our sweat  </P> <P> carving the earth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Michelle T. Clinton, Sesshu Foster, Naomi Quinonez, editors "Invocation  LA.: Urban Multicultural Poetry" (West End Press, Box 27334, Albuquerque, N.M.  87125: $8.95, paper; 129 pp.). Henry J.

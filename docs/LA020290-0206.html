			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BRONCOS' PERRY GETS JAIL TIME  </P> <P> A Denver County Court referee today ordered Denver Broncos tackle Gerald Perry  to serve 15 days in jail, perform 100 hours of community service and pay $269  in fines and court costs for soliciting a prostitute.  </P> <P> Perry will serve the 15 days concurrently with a 15-day Aurora jail term he is  scheduled to begin serving Monday for a similar charge.  </P> <P> Denver court referee Jim Scott sentenced Perry to 120 days in jail but  suspended all but 15 on condition Perry has no additional violations for a  year.  </P> <P> Perry had been convicted on the Denver charge in August but was given deferred  judgment, meaning the case would have been dropped had he stayed out of  trouble. It was reviewed after Perry was convicted of solicitation for  prostitution in Aurora.  </P> <P> The Aurora case against the 300-pound linebacker stemmed from his arrest there  Sept. 7, three weeks after his conviction in Denver.  </P></p>

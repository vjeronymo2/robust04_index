			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Northwest Border District Commander Vladimir Isayevich </F> Vyunov and Northwest Cossack District Ataman Boris  Aleksandrovich Almazov discuss Cossack border outposts:  "Dialogues on the Border: `Lyubo' Cossack Outpost"]    [Text]  At an outpost, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Isayevich  Vyunov, commander of the Northwest Border District, and Boris  Aleksandrovich Almazov, ataman of the Northwest District of the  Russian Cossacks Union, held an in-depth discussion on the  current state of the Russian Cossack movement, the outlook for  Cossack service in general, and the creation of Cossack border  units.    [Vyunov] I have been to many outposts during my military  career, but this is my first visit to a Cossack outpost, and one  called "Lyubo" at that (he laughs). But we are military men, so  let's get right down to business. If you don't have any  objections, Boris Aleksandrovich, I will begin with a question.  The Russian defense minister and the commander in chief of the  Border Troops, in accordance with a Russian presidential edict,  have drawn up a list of units and subunits that, beginning this  spring, will be manned primarily by Cossacks. In addition, we  now know the results of the experiment in creating army  formations in areas where Cossacks have traditionally lived,  such as the Transbaykal region and the country's south. Our  northwest region has certain special features. There are no  Cossack settlements here, am I correct? Aren't we in danger of  failing the attempt to create and man Cossack formations, Boris  Aleksandrovich?    [Almazov] Vladimir Isayevich, such concerns are unnecessary.  Let me begin by saying that there is no shortage of young and  old ethnic Cossacks in our region. There are tens of thousands  of them here on the territory of the five oblasts and Karelia.  That the region has no areas in which Cossacks are densely  concentrated, with the exception of St. Petersburg itself, is  another matter. There is no question that it is harder for us to  revive the Cossack traditions and way of life here than in areas  where there are Cossack associations and where Cossacks populate  entire villages to this day. But I don't think one should  dramatize the situation.    The Russian President has issued an edict on state support  for the Cossack movement, and we intend to implement it. For  example, the Cossack Administrative Commission that I head (the  Commission is a part of the St. Petersburg city administration),  in conjunction with the City Military Commissariat, has devised  a procedure for registering Cossacks who live in the city. Since  serving in Cossack units is a purely voluntary affair, we  decided that conscripts and reservists, on reporting to a  Military Commissariat, have to declare that they are Cossacks  and state that they would like to serve in the Cossack subunits  now being set up. Accordingly, Military Commissariat officials  are required to make a notation in the conscript's or  reservist's documents. Then the Military Commissariats, working  with the city administration's Cossack office, decide his fatec  -- whether to send him to a Cossack unit or not. We hope that  after this selection process the troop and border units will, in  terms of their training and morale, soon make themselves known  as the cream of the crop in the Russian Army and its Border  Troops.    [Vyunov] Well, God willing, as they say. But we border  troops  also have another interest when it comes to the Cossack  movement. I have had occasion to review the draft charter of the  Russian Cossack movement. It says that only a Russian citizen  who, on completing his compulsory or contractual service like  everyone else, registers as a member of a Cossack village  community, takes an oath, and begins Cossack irregular service  will be considered a Cossack. As we know, that service differs  from traditional army service in that a Cossack has his own  parcel of land, private farm, or other equivalent farm. It would  be good if a Cossack and his family, after completing his  service at a border post, for example, could receive such a  parcel near the state border. For us it would be very important  to thus acquire a second line of border defense. This is because  our current border zone is at best made up of neglected villages  or unpopulated altogether. It is very difficult to serve under  these conditions.    [Almazov] I wholeheartedly support your proposal. That is  precisely how we see the continuation of Cossack service upon  the completion of compulsory or contractual service in army or  border units. The draft charter stipulates that Cossacks who  live near the border are responsible for defending it. They must  have the right, if required by the situation, to detain  intruders and to turn them over to the Border Troops. For  Cossacks performing irregular border service are militarily  subordinate to the border district and under the civil  jurisdiction of the ataman board of his Cossack community. But  to make this possible, the state and the Border Troops command  must provide Cossacks with weapons, equipment, and ammunition  and grant them certain rights in addition to their  responsibilities.    [Vyunov] I agree. And this is why it is essential to lay a  legislative foundation for all this as soon as possible. I don't  think the technical and organizational side of the matter is  going to pose any special difficulty for us. We are prepared to  hold training sessions with such contingents and to help them  maintain equipment. And that's not all, we'll also help Cossacks  bring in their harvests. Again, I think this will benefit both  sides. For example, why should Cossacks have to haul their  products hundreds of kilometers away to a city when we ourselves  can buy them for our border outpost personnel and the families  of officers and people serving under contract?    [Almazov] As regards the legislative foundation, you  yourself  know how hard it was just to push through the presidential edict  on state support for the Cossack movement. But even after taking  effect, it does not solve all our problems. There has to be  clear-cut regulation of relations between regional  administrations and Cossack missions at the local level. And it  is especially important to achieve this in border regions. We  and the Border Troops command must work together to uphold  Cossacks' right of priority with respect to settling in border  areas. These days, with people in the ex-Soviet republics  leaving their familiar spots (and there are many Cossacks among  them), it will not be very hard to do this. And let's not rule  out the possibility of creating such settlements among our  regional Cossacks as well.    Not very long ago I read in a newspaper that Cossacks are  already prepared to try on green caps. I think they look good in  the caps, and not just green ones. We will like all border  service. After all, the Cossacks have safeguarded Russia's  borders since olden times. And we are prepared to rear our young  generation, your young people, military personnel, and new  recruits in this spirit.    [Vyunov] That's great! Let's create a working group to  coordinate efforts to enlist Cossacks for border service and to  create Cossack settlements along the borders. And in order to  ensure that this work continues, I think that we have to look to  not only Cossacks of conscription age but also adolescents.  Incidentally, you yourself have this in mind. Let's go about  this in such a way that a brother goes to an outpost to relieve  a brother. You select the kids, and we'll help you organize  study groups and young border guard clubs. We'll work together  to set up training camps during summer vacation that will be  sure to capture the youngsters' imagination with the romanticism  of serving on the border.    [Almazov] Great! We don't need to put any of this off. We  have a lot of work to do in the time that remains until the  spring conscription. Most importantly, we need to carry out our  first conscription in a very organized fashion. This will be the  starting point for the establishment of Cossack border service  in our region. Right?    It's not enough to say that we are Cossacks, we have to  prove  in deed that, like our forefathers, we remain faithful to our  main calling in life -- to serve the Fatherland wholeheartedly!  And that's what we will do!</p>

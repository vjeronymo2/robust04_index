			<p>BFN     [Text] In Hanoi on 9 April, the Ministry of Finance held a  news conference on Vietnam's financial situation in the first  quarter of 1994, with Minister Ho Te chairing.    In the first quarter of this year, gross collection of state  revenues was 17.3 percent of the year's plan or a 34 percent  increase when compared with the corresponding period last year;  while expenditure was 17 percent of the set target, or an  increase of 33 percent when compared to the same period last  year. It is expected that 23.6 percent of this year's revenues  will be collected in the second quarter.    To fulfill the set targets in the second quarter and the  first half of this year, the Ministry of Finance is supervising  various units to help issue guiding documents for localities to  improve their collection of state revenues, management of local  budgets, and settlement of capital depreciation. The ministry  called for efforts to quickly perfect the law on transfer of  rights to land use, the law on state budget, regulations on land  and house taxes, and regulations on income taxes. It also urged  agencies concerned to formulate plans to mobilize capital at  home and abroad to offset the budget deficit, improve and  perfect the tax collection system, and design measures to oppose  waste and prevent losses of state capital.</p>

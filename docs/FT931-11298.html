			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs could top Pounds 1bn - Size of contractors' provisions may undermine recovery financing BRITAIN'S 10 biggest construction companies are expected to announce provisions of between Pounds 650m and Pounds 700m when they publish annual results later this year, according to latest City forecasts. Warburg Securities and Barclays de Zoete Bevan say the scale of the provisions, following substantial write-downs last year and in 1990, could seriously undermine the ability of some companies to raise capital to finance a recovery. Total provisions from the sector may top Pounds 1bn when write-downs from small and medium housebuilders and construction companies are included. The biggest provision, totalling Pounds 250m, is expected to be made by Tarmac's construction, property and housing operations. Wimpey, following warnings issued by the company last month, is expected to make provisions of Pounds 120m. Taylor Woodrow is expected by both brokers to make write-downs of about Pounds 65m. Costain, Amec and Trafalgar House are also forecast to make sizeable provisions. The findings provide further bad news for banks which lent large sums in the late 1980s to finance commercial property and housing developments which in some cases have fallen below the value of the original loan. Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst for Warburg, said: 'The bulk of the provisions this time are likely to be against commercial property developments. This compares with previous years when companies mainly were writing down housing developments.' He estimated that the top 20 builders in the four years between 1989 and 1992 between them wrote-off Pounds 800m from the book value of housing land and developments. Mr Amarjit Chhina, construction analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The provisions will make already damaged balance sheets even weaker. It will make plans for any refinancing even more difficult.' Construction companies, he says, will need cash to replenish housing stocks and land banks as the housing market starts to pick up. Banks, however, may be reluctant to lend more to operations which have already seen their book value reduced by many millions of pounds as property and housing prices have fallen sharply. Shareholders, for the same reason, may be reluctant to support a rights issue particularly for those construction companies which had issues in 1991, ostensibly to finance a recovery. In many cases this money has been used to offset cash losses and reduce borrowings. Construction companies will also find it difficult to use their contracting operations to generate cash with UK construction output forecast to fall by a further 2 per cent this year following falls of 6 per cent and 9 per cent in the two previous years.</p>

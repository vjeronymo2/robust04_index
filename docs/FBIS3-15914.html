Judging from what is going on, a scandal is brewing.    [Unidentified correspondent] It seems that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy has not been able to prevent a split in his party.  Today Viktor Kobelev, the chief of staff of the LDPR's Central  Committee, in an interview to our program, announced his  definitive break with the head of the party. We remind you that  almost a month ago, Viktor Kobelev tried to leave the faction  but the LDPR leader persuaded him not to do it, while telling  the press that the party's second man's attempt to leave was a  planned action necessary to expose special service agents in the  ranks of the party.    According to Kobelev, this claim is absolutely groundless.  Moreover, as became clear today, the chief of staff, together  with his deputy, Aleksandr Pronin, left the faction at their  first attempt, having concluded a certain truce with  Zhirinovskiy, which the latter has recently violated by  insisting on an amendment to the law on the status of deputies.  This amendment would allow Duma leaders to recall deputies who  are members of their factions at their own volition. Kobelev is  now in a determined and definite frame of mind.    [Begin Kobelev recording] I chose my credo very clearly -- I  am outside the faction while Zhirinovskiy is the leader of the  faction. [end recording]    [Correspondent] According to the chief of staff, after he,  Pronin, and Anatoliy Kashpirovskiy leave, the majority of  Liberal Democrats are ready to leave the faction, but at the  moment are frightened that Zhirinivoskiy might be able to  influence their deputy places. Incidentally, the position of  the head of the LDPR himself in the Duma is a bit shaky today,  since the Shchelkov Rayon court deemed his deputy mandate  invalid. Viktor Kobelev is ready to take the vacant place of  the faction leader, that is, if that is the decision of the  party. But even if this does not happen, the former chief of  staff, who knows all the secrets of the party's money, is the  most dangerous figure today for the LDPR head; he is capable of  heading a powerful internal party opposition.    [Begin Kobelev recording] I will save -- I am not afraid of  that word -- or at least I will try to save Russia from  unpredictable politicians. [end recording]</p>

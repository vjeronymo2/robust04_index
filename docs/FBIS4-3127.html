			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa has stressed that President Husni Mubarak's  visit to China between April 21 and 23 derives its importance  from the role China has been playing in Asia and other parts of  the world.    Today's Egyptian newspaper "AL-AKHBAR" reported the foreign  minister's remark.    'Amr Moussa said that President Mubarak will hold talks with  senior Chinese officials on political and economic issues as  well as the Sino-Egyptian bilateral relations.    He added that the talks will cover coordination of the  Chinese and Egyptian stances toward international issues and  promotion of Sino-Egyptian economic cooperation.    Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for the Asian affairs  Esmail al-Adawi [spelling of name as received] said that Egypt  has good relations with China as it is one of the first  countries which recognized the People's Republic of China in  1956.    President Mubarak is also scheduled to visit China's major  experimental zone for science and technology development during  his trip.</p>

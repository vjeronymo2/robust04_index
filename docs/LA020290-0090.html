			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MY LEFT FOOT' IS TOUGH-MINDED, UNSENTIMENTAL AND BRILLIANT;  </P> <P> FILM: DANIEL DAY-LEWIS SEIZES THE ROLE OF HANDICAPPED WRITER, POET AND PAINTER  CHRISTY BROWN, MAKING VIEWERS LOOK BEYOND HIS WHEELCHAIR AND INTO HIS SOUL.  </P> <P> Who goes to the movies for moral uplift? You want moral uplift, go to the Ice  Capades. So don't think that seeing "My Left Foot" (at Horton Plaza) wins you  some kind of spiritual merit badge. This one you see for the pure love of great  movie making. Its tough-minded, unsentimental writing and ferociously brilliant  acting -- across the board and especially at the top -- manage to give a pretty  good idea of what Christy Brown, the Dublin-born writer, poet and painter, was  all about.  </P> <P> As Brown began the autobiography he called "My Left Foot," in honor of the only  limb he could control enough to write with: "There were nine children before me  and 12 after me. Of this total of 22, 13 lived." None, however, quite like  Christy. This son of an impoverished bricklayer was born with cerebral palsy  and, in the fashion of the day in 1932, was called a "dunce" and a "poor  half-wit" for the first nine years of his life. Out of his mother's earshot.  </P> <P> Probably because co-writer and director Jim Sheridan, a Dubliner, is from a  huge and poor family himself, the film sneers at heart-tugging exactly the way  Christy would, and with very nearly his same blunt Anglo-Saxonisms. Neither  poverty nor Christy's condition is the subject here; they are the givens.  </P> <P> Instead, 13-year-old Hugh O'Conor, who plays young Christy, and Daniel  Day-Lewis, who picks up at Christy's 17th birthday, meld to create an  extraordinary portrait of a wild, difficult, far-ranging mind, a man unsparing  of himself and of others, full of rage and despair, for years full of untapped  sexuality, who at last achieves some modicum of heart's ease. It is a  spellbinding journey.  </P> <P> In his first film, director Sheridan frames the story with a fund-raising  ceremony outside Dublin on the estate of Lord Castlewell and (the splendid  Cyril Cusack), at which 21-year-old Christy is being honored after publication  of his autobiography.  </P> <P> The wheelchair-bound, black-bearded writer is put into a drawing room with a  nurse to look after him, until his appearance. Drinking his whiskey from a  straw-and-flask arrangement in his tuxedo jacket, Christy casts a satyr's eye  over this lively, open woman, Mary Carr (Ruth McCabe) and begins his assault,  using his book as an opening wedge. And as she starts to read, raptly, and to  see his paintings illustrating its pages, we move into his childhood.  </P> <P> O'Conor's young Christy has the baleful look, the fierceness, the clamped-down  mouth that Day-Lewis will have; it seems entirely likely that one could grow up  into the other. But O'Conor's performance is nearly all mime and sound, the boy  is like a furious projectile. Speech will come later, painstakingly.  </P> <P> Sheridan (and co-writer Shane Connaughton) tips us off to what is boiling  inside this wild-eyed boy two years before the family sees it. When the  breakthrough finally comes, the scene is a real killer. As O'Conor lies,  exhausted, after spelling his first word in chalk with his foot, the energy  he's used to do this seems to pour off him in waves. (The scene is framed as a  visual reference to another later on, as father and son lie beside each other,  close as these opposites will ever be.)  </P> <P> The older Christy will be reached through a crop-haired, luminous-eyed teacher,  Dr. Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). He is now Day-Lewis, a late teen-ager and young  man, torn by his sexuality, his loneliness, the depths of what he needs to say.  Speech therapy will help him say it; particularly some of his crisper  Anglo-Saxonisms (the reason for the film's R rating). This is a portrait of the  hero as a socially almost-impossible young man: randy, uncontrollable, barely  redeemed by the swiftness of his wit.  </P> <P> Day-Lewis seizes the role, and almost immediately gets us to look beyond the  man in the chair to the soul inside. It's a performance with a fantastic  trajectory; he is sly, funny, as swift as he can be with these squash-shaped  syllables, wicked, mordant and openly romantic. And wait until you seem him as  goalie in a street scrimmage.  </P> <P> But he's not all charm. Cross him or, as it happens, let him fall in love and  be left, and his rages are horrible. This is the tyrannical side of Christy's  disablement, and the film makers don't avert their eyes to its unpleasantness.  </P> <P> They also don't avert their eyes to the realities of poor Irish life, but it's  treated as throwaway stuff, details too familiar to single out, like the single  stunning fact of 22 children in one woman's lifetime. There's the meanness of  this poverty; the children four in a bed upstairs, even when they are in their  late teens and one in that bed is the uncontrollable Christy.  </P> <P> There's also the enveloping warmth, always; an unspoken family-first unity,  even when it means rallying around a bullying, empty shell of a father (the  late Ray McAnally in a fine, last performance). And there's the pure, boundless  love that radiates from the magnificent Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother.  </P> <P> She plays her like the rock she must have been, without a jot of martyrdom or a  flicker of complaint and without an actressy moment. And in keeping with her  self-effacing power, Sheridan keeps his ensemble up and together, so that even  Day-Lewis' incandescence never runs away with the film. It can't have been  easy, since this is one of film's definitive performances, with a subtlety and  physicality of almost eerie accomplishment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UKRINFORM report on "Statement by the Ukrainian </F> Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press Service"]    [Text] The pre-election marathon is entering its final  stage. Hence the obvious tension in the struggle for  parliamentary seats among candidates for people's deputies.  However, during the debates in the mass media and meetings with  the electorate, some candidates are resorting to stirring up  unhealthy passions against the Ukrainian president.    In particular, rumors to the effect that Leonid Kravchuk has  a summer house in Switzerland are being spread actively and  deliberately. The goal of these insinuations is clear: By  "exposing," in this manner, the president, who was elected as a  result of nationwide elections, they are trying to picture  themselves as champions of the interests of the working people.    The Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press  Service states this: This theme is not new. It already  surfaced during difficult periods in the history of independent  Ukraine. The Ukrainian president and the mass media were even  earlier approached by people seeking explanations about the  gossip on the so-called "dacha issues."    Both the president and the mass media have also repeatedly  stated that Leonid Kravchuk does not have and has no intention  of having any property outside our state. As Ukrainian  president, he adheres to norms specified for the head of state  by the relevant Supreme Council decision.    The Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press  Service has been authorized to state that, also at present, such  "revelations" regarding the Swiss dacha are nothing more than  unseemly and provocative fabrications on the part of those who  would like to acquire political capital by dishonest methods.    This becomes even more obvious if one realizes that there  are  very simple and effective ways to check such information. For  this, it is necessary simply to turn to the competent Swiss  bodies either in Ukraine (the Swiss Embassy) or abroad and, in  accordance with Swiss laws, obtain the necessary information.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Objectivity and less rhetoric Sir, 'Europe looms small in UK voters' eyes' (June 8) is a worthy article headline but I really must take issue with some of the rhetoric used. 'Mr Major's dismal domestic record', 'a painfully slow economic recovery' and 'the largest tax increases in recent memory' are more in tune with the Daily Mirror. Since the first comment is non-specific one should concentrate on the latter two. Over the past 18 months all successive forecasts of economic growth have been revised upwards and the latest industrial output data, released on June 8, indicate something akin to a boom. Unemployment has been falling for most of the past 15 months and nobody predicted that. Not, I would respectfully suggest, circumstances synonymous with painfully slow economic growth. On personal taxation, fiscal policy has indeed been unexpectedly tightened and the media has certainly concentrated the public's minds on that. But why no mention of the monetary loosening and who at the time of the last election would have predicted base rates at 5.25 per cent two years hence? A little more objective reporting, please.

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FORMER VAN NUYS GUARD UNITS HEAD FOR SAUDI SUPPLY DUTY;  </P> <P> BUILDUP: NINETY-THREE VOLUNTEERS AND THREE CARGO PLANES DEPART THE 146TH  TACTICAL AIRLIFT WING'S NEW OXNARD BASE FOR 'AIR BRIDGE' BASED IN GERMANY.  </P> <P> The California Air National Guard unit based until recently at Van Nuys Airport  joined the Saudi Arabian military buildup with aircraft and crews this week.  </P> <P> Four of the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing's 16 cargo planes and 93 volunteers  left for Frankfurt, Germany, to become part of the "air bridge" ferrying troops  and supplies from the United States to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Capt. Vince Cocca of Lake View Terrace was in the pilot's seat of one of the  three C-130s that left Thursday from the Channel Islands Air National Guard  Base near Oxnard, the unit's home since last spring.  </P> <P> The three planes, carrying 71 volunteers, were headed for a first stop at Goose  Bay in Newfoundland, Canada.  </P> <P> "It's 30 degrees in Goose Bay, a warm day for them," Cocca, a TWA flight  engineer in civilian life, told his colleagues in a preflight briefing.  </P> <P> The four-engine C-130s were to meet a fourth plane from the Oxnard base that  left Tuesday for the Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt. The planes and crew  members will be based there, transporting supplies, equipment and personnel  across Europe and possibly to the Middle East, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Earlier, the 146th had dispatched about 50 cargo handlers and medical  technicians to Saudi Arabia. But this week marked the first time that the wing  sent flight crew members and cargo planes overseas to help with the buildup of  troops and weaponry in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The wing and its predecessors had been based at Van Nuys Airport since the  early 1950s and its ranks include many men and women from the San Fernando  Valley and throughout the Los Angeles area. The wing moved to its new home near  Oxnard because the Van Nuys Airport air guard installation, a former World War  II Air Force base, closed in April due to congested flying conditions and the  rising fees charged by the city of Los Angeles, which owns the airport.  </P> <P> So far, wing members sent overseas have been volunteers. But officials said  they probably will be asked to activate at least some of the wing's 1,400  reservists to help meet the call-up of an additional 72,500 National Guard and  reserve troops authorized this week by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.  </P> <P> At the Air National Guard base Thursday, the volunteer flight crews and  mechanics arrived before dawn to prepare for the initial nine-hour leg of their  flight to Europe.  </P> <P> The volunteers were issued new identification cards and made sure that their  military paychecks would be electronically deposited into checking accounts.  </P> <P> For some of the citizen-soldiers, it was an emotional parting from family  members worried about war erupting in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Clutching a double handful of junk food for the long flight, Sgt. Angela  Bateman said she had not realized the risk of flying into a potential war zone.  </P> <P> "Logically, I know this could be something serious, but emotionally it hasn't  sunk in yet," said Bateman, a Camarillo resident. "We all have a lot of mixed  emotions."  </P> <P> Before departure, many of the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing members joked around  on the Tarmac. There was a mixture of excitement about the adventure and a  gallows humor about making it home alive. "It is something that you can't help  but think about," Sgt. Robert Bonino of Ventura said.  </P> <P> "I'm not as excited as some of the younger guys," said Tech. Sgt. Ray C.  Perkins of Simi Valley. "I've been to Vietnam, so I know what war is all about.  I've been to hot spots before."  </P> <P> Before departure, each reservist went through a last-minute briefing on how to  handle live bombs, missiles or other ordnance, including chemical weapons.  </P> <P> "If it is a real low charge, it is probably a chemical agent," warned Capt.  Rick Gibson, the mission's operations officer who led the briefing.  </P> <P> Gibson instructed all the reservists to make sure that they replace the  training filters in their gas masks with new filters to be issued before they  enter Saudi Arabia. "I don't have to stress how important this is before going  'in country,' " Gibson said.  </P> <P> He emphasized the need to carry identification at all times, on and off the  base. "Right now, the biggest threat we have over there is terrorism," Gibson  said. "They will be checking ID at the hotel, on base and just about anywhere  you go."  </P> <P> "I just thought he was going to Germany, but he's not," said Leslie Zuniga,  wife of Sgt. Jerry Zuniga, an airplane mechanic. "He is going to fly back and  forth to Saudi Arabia. He won't be fighting; he'll be carrying supplies. You  wonder if they'll want to knock out the supply planes."  </P> <P> Jerry Zuniga tried to comfort his wife as he worked his way through the  processing line with his son, Andrew, 7, seated on his shoulders. "She's not  used to this," Zuniga said. "This is the first time I've deployed since I've  been married."  </P> <P> Zuniga predicted that he would be home before Christmas.  </P> <P> "Of course, if someone pulls a trigger, we'll be over there a year."  </P></p>

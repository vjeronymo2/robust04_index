			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Army Higher Military Council met at the  headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense today. A faxed  communique from the Higher Military Council of the Romanian Army  stresses that the meeting examined the attacks contained in the  press communiques of the leadership of the Greater Romania Party  [PRM] and in the slanderous and insulting articles published in  the magazines owned by Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor -- ROMANIA MARE  and POLITICA -- against generals and high-ranking officers in  the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense, including  the minister of defense. The speakers reported on the real  situation in various spheres of military activity, about which  these publications made denigrating allegations. The Higher  Military Council considers those accusations totally groundless  and an unprecedented act of political pressure aimed at  hampering the implementation of the principles of reform in the  military as well as the development of normal activities in the  army.    The Higher Military Council also expresses its trust in the  ministry's leadership and in the military cadres unjustly  insulted and accused, the communique mentions among other things.    The Army Higher Military Council assures Romania's  president,  the other democratic institutions of the state, and the  country's citizens that the army will remain an element of  stability and support for the democratic progress of Romanian  society, while persisting in continuing its own process of  restructuring and modernization, despite all the inherent or  artificially created hardships because of irresponsible actions  -- the faxed communique from the Army Higher Military Council  points out in conclusion.</p>

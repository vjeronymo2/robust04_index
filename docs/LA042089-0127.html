			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAD OF NEW ETHICS PANEL BELIEVES IN THE CAUSE  </P> <P> Geoffrey Cowan, the former California Common Cause chairman drafted by Mayor  Tom Bradley last week to captain a new City Hall ethics commission, wants to  define a new era of propriety in state and local government.  </P> <P> But Bradley's critics say Cowan's hastily created panel may be nothing more  than a face-saving mechanism for a mayor dogged by conflict-of-interest  questions over fees he collected from local financial institutions.  </P> <P> "Bradley is very well known for . . . anytime there's a problem, he appoints a  committee. Much later, the committee acts, with recommendations. And that's the  extent of it," said City Council President John Ferraro.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UCLA Lecturer  </P> <P> Cowan, a 46-year-old public interest lawyer, UCLA lecturer and author who is  well connected to the city's liberal elite, is undeterred. He insisted that his  panel will be independent and, even before the seven members have met, he  ticked off an array of ideas he thinks should be embodied in the panel's  proposed ethics code for elected and top officials.  </P> <P> Cowan wants the panel to look at reforms that Common Cause has fought for  unsuccessfully at the congressional level, including a ban on outside earnings,  speaking honorariums and most gifts.  </P> <P> He would like to tighten up the so-called "revolving door" practice by which  city employees, politicians or their aides move into private-sector or lobbying  jobs related to city business.  </P> <P> And he wants the panel to recommend the creation of a new city investigative  board that would have subpoena power and the authority to impose penalties and  to enforce the new ethics regulations. Almost everyone agrees that the current  30-year-old code is toothless.  </P> <P> "I think often opportunities for reform come out of crisis," Cowan said. "We  have here a unique opportunity in the recent history of Los Angeles to do  something about . . . a serious problem. Maybe not as serious as it is in New  York and Chicago, but it's serious.  </P> <P> "I want whatever we do here . . . to be absolutely the standard by which every  other community (in the nation) will be judged," Cowan said.  </P> <P> Cowan is clear about the controversy that precipitated his appointment:  Bradley's acceptance of tens of thousands of dollars from a local bank and a  savings and loan that had dealings with the city. "He should not have done it,"  Cowan said. "I'm absolutely clear in my mind that he should not have done it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confidence of Others  </P> <P> Cowan's agenda may sound very ambitious, but those know him think he might just  pull it off.  </P> <P> "I think he is a tremendous choice as someone to try," said Fred Wertheimer,  Washington-based president of National Common Cause, a nonpartisan political  watchdog group. "I think the climate is right . . . (and) politics in America  travels from west to east. (Los Angeles) could be the model for cities across  the country."  </P> <P> Cowan's name is not well known. "I have a passion for privacy," he said. But he  is no newcomer to the political trenches. He has contributed to Bradley's  campaigns and was part of a losing group of bidders a few years ago in one of  City Hall's great lobbying battles over the awarding of a lucrative San  Fernando Valley cable-television franchise.  </P> <P> Ranked first by a team of evaluators, his firm was passed over amid a final,  intense lobbying drive when the matter went to a vote at the City Council. "I  think what I saw there makes me vastly more sensitive" to how City Hall works,  he said.  </P> <P> Cowan moves among the high circles of liberal Democratic politics and  entertainment. For fun a few years back, he and several friends, including  Democratic activist-lawyer-lobbyist Mickey Kantor, Los Angeles County Dist.  Atty. Ira Reiner and Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals, bought a minor league baseball team, the Stockton Ports.  </P> <P> The praise that Cowan's name evokes in liberal circles is effusive. "I'd like a  buck for every time I've called Geoff Cowan for an opinion, especially on  matters of judgment," said producer Norman Lear, a longtime friend. "He's like  a walking neon that says: 'Decent. Decent. Decent.' "  </P> <P> "I can't think of anyone of higher moral integrity," Kantor said.  </P> <P> Cowan is a genteel, scholarly, graying man with young children and a  politically active wife, Aileen Adams, a Bradley appointee to the city Fire  Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Background in Ethics  </P> <P> He brings to his sensitive City Hall assignment a wide background in political  and media ethics.  </P> <P> It was an interest forged early in life. When he a was high school senior back  East, Cowan's family was rocked by the television quiz show scandals.  </P> <P> Cowan's father, Louis G. Cowan, had once been a producer of "The $64,000  Question." When the scandal broke, his father was president of CBS, but no  longer directly associated with the show. Though his father was never  implicated in wrongdoing, Cowan said, he was forced to resign.  </P> <P> "CBS felt that it was uncomfortable for them to have him as their president. .  . . They made it untenable," he said. His father, deeply wounded, according to  his son, left television and became a professor at Columbia University's  Graduate School of Journalism, where he helped found the Columbia Journalism  Review, a watchdog publication for the mass media.  </P> <P> "My father's experience emphasized to me that, while I have . . . a very strong  commitment to ethics . . . I'm also very concerned about unfair charges," Cowan  said.  </P> <P> Cowan went to Harvard and then to Yale Law School, inheriting from his parents  a sense of political activism and public duty, and enough money to freely  fulfill it.  </P> <P> He was a freedom rider in the civil rights movement. He helped draft the  landmark Democratic Party reforms in the late 1960s that opened up the  presidential nominating process and reduced the influence of party bosses. He  co-founded the nation's first public interest law firm in Washington and later  became the first director of the UCLA Communications Law Program and practiced  public interest law in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> As state chairman of Common Cause for the last four years, he pushed the  organization's statewide campaign finance ballot initiative. He remains on the  National Common Cause board, where he has been working on proposals for new  ethics codes for state and local governments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Writing Second Book  </P> <P> He continues to lecture part time at UCLA on media issues and is writing his  second book, set in Los Angeles' Progressive political reform movement of the  early 1900s. Later this year, he hopes to produce his play about the ethical  dilemmas faced by key participants in the Pentagon Papers case.  </P> <P> Cowan will take time out from writing his book. Writing the ethics code will be  challenge enough, given City Hall's contentious politics and the myriad gray  areas between officials' public responsibilities and personal interests.  </P> <P> "Geoff will find it is easier to set the principle than establish the rule,"  said Common Cause Executive Director Walter Zelman. "When you start defining  every single circumstance, you start having problems."  </P> <P> Cowan himself is not certain about how far to go in restricting officials'  outside investments. For example, questions have been raised about a Riverside  County land deal in which Bradley is a partner with a woman who runs a  city-funded trade group.  </P> <P> Blind trusts could be a solution, Cowan said. "Those are dilemmas that you've  got to struggle with . . . (but) you can't pauperize people (who) take jobs in  public service," he said.  </P> <P> His greatest task may be building bridges to the City Council, which he hopes  will ultimately adopt his panel's recommendations.  </P> <P> "This (ethics panel) could be construed as a deflection of the real issue,"  said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, referring to the mayor's troubles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Woo's Agenda  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo, whose committee will soon delve into ethics issues,  stressed that the effort by the Bradley-appointed panel "is independent of what  the council does." He said his committee will not only consider how to  strengthen the city's largely ignored ethics code, but will keep the pressure  on the city attorney for a thorough investigation of the questions about  Bradley's dealings.  </P> <P> Notably, both Woo and Ferraro questioned the need for a ban on outside earned  income for council members, noting that few have received the kind of fees that  the mayor accepted. Financial disclosure records show that is true. However,  many council members do have investment income, some accept honorariums and  several report receiving thousands of dollars in dinners and gifts from  lobbyists, developers, amusement parks, sports teams and others.  </P> <P> Cowan said he hopes to reach some common ground with the council. "We don't  want to be confrontational," he said.  </P> <P> But he also carries a stick.  </P> <P> His panel's recommendations, expected to be completed in a matter of months,  could become a ballot initiative, he said, and Bradley has indicated that he  would back such a measure, if necessary.  </P></p>

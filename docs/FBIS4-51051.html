			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by dissident Wei Jingsheng written in Xiaoxitian, </F> Beijing, on 29 December 1993: "How To Invest in China -- To  Ensure Their Economic Interests, Foreigners Should Make  Political Investments First"]    [Text] Normally, whoever plans to do business should  accumulate experiences, learn the knack from others, and, when  he has some certainty of success, then proceed to risk his or  someone else's money. Few people do business by following  professors' guidance, and still fewer businessmen consult  politicians. This is because what professors can tell you and  what politicians can help you with are already guaranteed and  relatively fixed things in this society or economic environment;  that is, the constants and invariable factors in economic  activity. What really requires the talent and wisdom of  entrepreneurs or, in other words, what contains both risks and  opportunities are the variables that are relatively unfixed and  that do not have or cannot have any element of security.    All talented entrepreneurs attain major successes by giving  play to their foresight and judgment in the elusive fields, or  by a fluke. To put this issue in a different light, the more  security the economic system (not just the market) and the legal  system of a country or society can offer, the fewer domains of  risk and the smaller the risks. Such an environment gives more  security not only to the income of wage earners, but also to the  benefits of entrepreneurs and businessmen, because entrepreneurs  and businessmen can concentrate their time and energy on a  relatively small number of variable fields; their efficiency can  certainly increase in direct proportion; and their luck will  also improve in direct proportions, though not everybody will  have good luck.    The development history of the developed countries  illustrates this point very well. By lateral comparison, it  might be hard to draw a simple, clear, and revealing conclusion  due to obscuring factors, such as culture, traditions, history,  geography, resources, and varying population quality of  different countries. Some professors like to describe things in  the most complicated way and take the least lucid approach, as  it helps them publish voluminous monographs and reduce the  number of critics (through making the readers confused and  disorientated by lengthy and dull academic writings and  therefore unable to make head or tail of what the critics are  talking about). However, to avoid letting opportunities slip  by, businessmen and those who administer a country must solve  problems in the most lucid way and must take the simplest and  clearest approach. Therefore, I just want to make this simple  point on this issue: By longitudinal comparison, only when the  authority and fairness of each country's legal system keeps  improving can the rights and interests of the people (including  businessmen) have increasing levels of security and can the  people's business performance improve in direct proportion. I  have always maintained that businessmen have varying talents  which are not in direct proportion to their level of education,  because those who have higher academic scores are not  necessarily winners in the business world.    A review of how some countries became prosperous clearly  indicates that economic environment and legal security are  indispensable for each country or society to improve its  economic performance and are also the first issue to consider  for private investors. Whoever does not believe this can review  or read the history of his own country's process of reaching  prosperity again or can consult veteran businessmen who have  gone through such a history. Most of them will agree with the  simple conclusion I have drawn. But never consult professors  who have voluminous academic publications to their credit. I am  afraid that will not help you come to a correct conclusion,  because not everybody can avoid being confused and disorientated  by lengthy and dull reasoning like professors can.    China's investment environment happens to be related to our  conclusion mentioned above: This is the very reason why China,  a country with rich business experience, has failed to bring  forth large numbers of entrepreneurs or successful businessmen,  because China lacks the constants in its economic environment  that Western countries possess and lacks an effective and fair  legal environment -- not because the Chinese lack the talent for  doing business or do not want to become rich.    Some Western businessmen arrogantly claim: "China does not  protect its people's property from being violated, but does  protect the property rights of us foreigners." Some canvassers  for the Chinese Government (not just Chinese) would pledge to  everybody by saying something like "though China's economic and  legal environments are not good, the Chinese Government will  give the most favorable conditions to the foreign businessmen."    I think those who say such things are all liars or at least  lack judgment and foresight. If you risk your money or others'  money according to their prediction which reflects a lack  judgment, the risk will certainly be many times greater than  that in your own country. Because ordinary people are used to  judging situations by referring to the experience they have  gained in their own countries, there are always people who will  be duped, just like someone accustomed to the wealthy life-style  in a Western country finds it hard to imagine how a Chinese  person can live on an annual income of a few dozen U.S. dollars  or a businessman who is used to operating in a Western society  with legal security finds it hard to imagine what kind of risk  is involved in a country like China, which has no legal  security. In fact, if I am to give a list of risks that you may  encounter, it will be as lengthy as a professor's monograph. I  can only tell you this in the simple manner that we are  accustomed to: When you have security, it is easy for you to  know what kind of security exists; when you have no security,  generally speaking, it is impossible for you to realize all the  risks that will come up.    Moreover, by common sense reasoning, one can easily see  that,  for a government that is not prepared to create a good economic  environment for its own people, the favors it extends to  foreigners means unfair treatment for its own people. Even if  this policy truly can ensure the materialization of this kind of  favor over a long period of time, the people of this country  will not be able to tolerate such unfair treatment for a very  long time. They will use all possible means to change such  unfair treatment. As is well known, past history tells us that,  whenever there is a major change in society, many extremely  unfair things will turn to the other extreme. In other words,  unfairness will transfer from the country's own people to  foreigners. Many facts that have emerged since the beginning of  this century have proved this, especially when foreigners  participated in the exploitation and oppression of the country's  own people and especially when this oppression and exploitation  went so far as to cause the majority's hatred to override  reason. Even the greatest politician had to give in to this  widespread and profound retaliatory sentiment.    Though the Chinese are a very reasonable people, they  require  others to be equally reasonable. Furthermore, the Chinese have  always despised businessmen who are solely bent on making  profits or who are even rich and cruel. Therefore, the main  issue in the context of investing in China is the imperious need  to make political investment first. Helping the Chinese and  creating a good economic environment for foreign businessmen  themselves is the only way to provide security for everybody's  economic interests. China's enormous market potential is very  appealing, but if investors do not invest in helping China's  most reasonable democratic reform forces, but instead allow  reactionary autocratic forces or other forces that are hard to  identify in advance determine China's future, it will be  disadvantageous not only to the Chinese, but also to foreign  businessmen investing in the Chinese market. This is because,  no matter what passport you hold, you become a member of the  Chinese economic system once you start operating in China, and  passports mean nothing in the market. Naturally, however, if  you want to follow the example of many individual business  operators in China and "make a fortune and slink off before the  communists wake up to it," you can indeed make quite a lot of  money against your conscience. But I want to warn you: You  better get out in time, or you may land in a mire from which you  will not be able to pull out your legs.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Liberty Liberty's argument for not enfranchising its non-voting shareholders looks circular. True, the three-to-one proportion of voting to non-voting shares means that a scrip issue for the voters by way of compensation would lead to a much higher dividend bill. Great Universal Stores did not face that problem because only 2 per cent of its shares carried voting rights. Since the current payout is only just covered by earnings, Liberty has pragmatic reasons for waiting for profits to recover before taking the plunge. But the longer an earnings recovery is delayed, the more Liberty will need an infusion of new blood. Even allowing that family interests would control the majority of the votes after enfranchisement, pressure from outside shareholders might encourage change. Mr Patrick Austen, the new chief executive, deserves a fair crack of the whip. If there is no sign of progress next year, though, the case for enfranchisement will be compelling  -even if that means cutting the dividend. Companies which maintain non-voting shares and are making decent profits have no excuse for stalling. For non-voting shareholders, there is always a trade-off between dilution and the benefits of full democracy. When profits are rising enfranchisement might not seem worth the cost, but the ability to influence management matters most on the downswing. When it moves to modern standards of disclosure next year, Schroders will have an opportunity to overhaul its capital structure too.</p>

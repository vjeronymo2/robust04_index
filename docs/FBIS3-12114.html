			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Salvador de Jujuy, 29 Mar (NA) -- Eleven injured  people, including seven policemen, one of whom is in serious  condition, and four arrested individuals are the consequences of  the incidents that took place today at the Jujuy government  house, following a demonstration by 1,500 public workers and  teachers who were demanding a wage increase.    The serious crisis caused, a few hours afterward, the sudden  "irreversible" resignation of Minister of Government Antonio  Paleari, who had harshly criticized provincial Justicialist  Party deputies, and had questioned the national government for  adopting a "discriminatory" attitude toward Jujuy in comparison  with other provinces.    Meanwhile, the front of public workers unions decided  tonight  to continue the measures of force tomorrow, including a strike  that will be observed in different ways depending on the unions.    For example, high school teachers will not attend classes,  primary school teachers will work normally, and workers from the  rest of the unions will cease activities at their workplaces and  hold assemblies.    The incidents began taking place today at noon, when about  150 demonstrators out of the 1,500 who were participating in the  protest stoned the government house, broke its windows, and  hurled several Molotov cocktails and noise bombs.    The acts of violence forced the police to disperse the  rioters with tear gas and rubber bullets, with the support of  cavalrymen.    Soon after, a group of about 50 people headed for the  private  home of Governor Jose Carlos Ficoseco, which they stoned, and  where they broke the windows of his Chevrolet pickup truck and a  Renault car that was parked there.    After normalcy returned, and a little before resigning,  Minister of Government Paleari blamed the SEOM [expansion  unknown] and ATE [Association of State Workers] unions, headed  by Carlos "Perro" Santillan and Fernando Acosta, for the  outrages.    Paleari said that "one of the injured policemen, whose last  name is Chauqui, is in serious condition as a consequence of the  explosion in his face of a noise bomb, which made him lose his  hearing on his left side, while he is in serious danger of  losing the sight in his left eye."    The minister of government also denied that the police who  had dissolved the demonstration had used live ammunition,  although he admitted they had used "rubber bullets" besides the  tear gas.    According to Paleari, the civilians who were wounded had  slight injuries, one of them having received a rubber bullet in  one of his buttocks.    He added that a policewoman was also wounded. Among the four  arrested individuals, from whom the police confiscated  "pamphlets with the picture of `Che' Guevara inciting people to  violence, two of them were totally drunk."    The serious situation in this capital today caused "concern"  in the national government, and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf  analyzed the problem with his aides, although it was said that  "they never considered putting the province into trusteeship."    Governor Ficoseco decided to send a draft bill to the  provincial legislature restructuring the public workers' wages,  which for the lowest paid workers would represent a 50 percent  increase.    The incidents began happening today at noon, about an hour  after CTERA [Confederation of Educational Workers of the  Argentine Republic] workers, headed by their national leader  Mary Sanchez, began gathering. The CTERA column carried an  approximately 400 meter long Argentine flag.    The rioters hurled inside the government house "at least  four  Molotov cocktails" nearly causing a fire that was immediately  put out, while several other noise bombs exploded.    A little after that, the provincial police and cavalrymen  dissolved the rioters by hurling tear gas and shooting rubber  bullets, after which calmness returned to downtown San Salvador  de Jujuy.    "If national intervention in the province is done to solve  our problems, let it be welcome," former Minister Paleari told  NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, after saying that so far "Ruckauf said  these were only rumors, and that there is no reason" for  intervention.    Paleari, who at no moment indicated that he would resign,  said that the "SEOM and ATE unions were the only two public  unions that rejected an 80 peso wage increase as of April plus  20 additional pesos in 120 days," and he accused them of  originating the incidents.    Paleari acknowledged that "since 1991 the salaries" of the  provincial public workers "have been frozen," and he confirmed  that "some workers earn 123 pesos per month."    After reporting on the violent incidents, Paleari officially  announced at 1930 that he had tendered his "irreversible  resignation" and that Governor Ficoseco had accepted it, by  which his post is being temporarily held by Government Secretary  Alfredo Frias.    Provincial government spokesmen believe that "Paleari's  replacement will be defined tomorrow," adding that "Governor  Ficoseco plans to travel within the next few hours to the  federal capital to analyze with national government officials  the problem" in Jujuy Province.</p>

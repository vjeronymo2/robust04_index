			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Overseas sales behind 11% rise at Spirax SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the steam equipment specialist, reported an 11 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.5m while saying there was still no sign of any improvement in trading conditions in its world markets. The Cheltenham-based group, which makes 80 per cent of its steam-related sales outside the UK, said the effect of the recent sterling devaluation was difficult to predict, but could benefit next year's results. The group said turnover in the six months to June 30 increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 81.4m, including a good contribution from new products. Trading profit increased by 4.6 per cent to to Pounds 11.3m, with margins slightly lower at 13.8 per cent. The pre-tax profits figure was flattered by a drop in interest payable from Pounds 1.3m to to Pounds 798,000, although the benefit is unlikely to be as marked in the second half. Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said that in the group's principal steam speciality business, the UK market remained depressed, but a wider range of products had helped to achieve real growth in turnover and trading profits. In continental Europe overall volume reduced, mainly due to a drop in capital expenditure by customers in France. However, orders from former eastern bloc countries increased business in Germany, and helped maintain European trading profits. Growth in the Far East was slower than in previous years, although the company said good growth was achieved in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and New Zealand. Business levels remained depressed in North America, although cost controls maintained trading profits. In Argentina the company enjoyed a good increase in business but economic uncertainty reduced demand at the group's Brazilian subsidiary. The tax charge of 42 per cent reflected the overseas contributions to profits and for the first time included Pounds 450,000 of potentially unrecoverable advance corporation tax. Mr Tappin said positive cash flow was achieved while investment was maintained at Pounds 10m. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 25.6m), reducing gearing from 38 to 22 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 7.8p (7.4p) and the interim dividend is held at 2.7p.</p>

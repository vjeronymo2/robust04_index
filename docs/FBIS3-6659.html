Alejandro Solorzano, chairman of the Diplomatic Committee of  the National Assembly of Nicaragua, pointed out that Japan is  shipping in a huge amount of plutonium. "The nuclear armament  stepped up by Japan is a big stumbling-block in the way of the  denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula," he said.    He urged Japan to give up the foolish desire to become a  nuclear power.    The Swedish paper SEVENSKA DAGBLADET said Japan is possessed  of all that are needed for the production of nuclear weapons  such as plutonium, electronic destructive device and technical  personnel and has already manufactured nuclear warheads which  only need appropriate amount of plutonium.    "Japan is not only capable of reprocessing plutonium but  also  has signed contracts with Britain and France for the purchase of  plutonium. And it is possessed of space satellite technology  with which it can establish a system of nuclear-tipped medium  and long-range missiles, the paper said.    The Japanese magazine BUNGEI SHUNSHU said Japan has  stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium far surpassing the amount needed  for peaceful purposes.    The Tanzanian paper DAILY NEWS said the production capacity  of the reprocessing plant of Japan is 800 tons topping the world  list and Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line.    While stepping up its own nuclear armament, Japan is joining  the United States and South Korea in crying over "nuclear  suspicion" against North Korea, added the paper.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement said  that Japan is feverishly promoting its nuclear armament, taking  advantage of the situation that has got strained over the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of Korea, and called for an immediate  halt to it.</p>

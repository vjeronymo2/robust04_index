			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Mountleigh receivership deals blow to lenders: Barclays among banks owed Pounds 400m by property group RECEIVERS were called in yesterday at Mountleigh, one of the UK's biggest property groups and owner of Spain's second biggest store chain, Galerias Preciados. Mountleigh, one of the UK's most ambitious companies in the 1980s, owes Pounds 147m to bondholders and about Pounds 400m to banks, led by Barclays of the UK and Citicorp of the US. Receivers and bankers could not quantify yesterday the losses likely to be suffered by the company's creditors. However, its receivership has dealt another severe blow to banks operating in the UK, which expect to lose billions of pounds this year on their exposure to the UK property market. Mountleigh's receivership comes after months of attempts by the company and its banks to prop it up. The receivership was triggered by the collapse of attempts to raise funds by selling Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, in the West Midlands, in order to make substantial payment to holders of Swiss bonds. It was due to repay SFr150m (Pounds 56m) tomorrow. Interest payments on another bond issue were missed last week. Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, were appointed yesterday to the main UK holding company. The decision to appoint them followed the breakdown of talks with bank creditors on a planned financial restructuring for the group. A meeting of directors on Saturday decided the company could no longer fulfil its debt obligations and the main bank creditors, led by Barclays and Citicorp, were invited to appoint receivers. Other principal bankers are thought to include Bankers Trust of the US, Credit Lyonnais of France, Switzerland's Credit Suisse, Unibank from Denmark and three UK banks, Lloyds, National Westminster and Royal Bank of Scotland. All the bank debt is secured on the assets. The receivers said Mountleigh's property portfolio was worth at least Pounds 400m. Mr James said he expected Mountleigh's UK subsidiaries to follow the parent into receivership. But receivers will probably not be appointed to Galerias Preciados. Bankers flew to Spain at the weekend to reassure the subsidiary it would continue to receive their financial support. Mr Hayward, in Madrid, said the chain would have to be sold. A potential buyer has already made an offer for the group, which last year had sales of Dollars 980m (Pounds 554m). In the UK, the company is best known for the Merry Hill shopping development, a shopping centre in Camberley, Surrey, and its half share in the Criterion centre in London's Piccadilly. It also owns properties across continental Europe, which are unaffected by the UK receivership. Notices appeared yesterday in Swiss financial newspapers calling a meeting of bondholders on June 10. Mountleigh was planning to ask investors to defer all interest and principle repayments until July 31, when it had hoped to be able to present a full debt restructuring plan. However, the failure to reach agreement with secured bank creditors, which rank above bondholders in the event of winding up, meant that a full restructuring could not be achieved. Mr James said the receivers would examine the assets of the company and would 'consider an orderly disposal programme' so that creditors can be repaid. In the past three months, Olympia &amp; York, developer of Canary Wharf; Heron International, a property and trading group; Speyhawk, a UK developer; and Randsworth, a property investor, have run into serious financial trouble. Citicorp and Barclays have big exposures to several of these companies. In the 1980s, Mountleigh was transformed from a small wool maker into a property company with a market value so high it felt able to bid Pounds 2bn for Storehouse in 1987.

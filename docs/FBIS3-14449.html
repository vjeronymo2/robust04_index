			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F> unidentified correspondents in Beirut on 25 March--recorded]    [Text] [Samahah] Before anything else, I wish to welcome  you all. At the beginning of this news conference, before we  delve into details and issues, I would like to ask you to  demonstrate your full professionalism at every stage we are  going through in this country. That is, you need to always  report the situation or the news item in full. Lebanese and  Arab brothers in Lebanon who report on Lebanon, as well as the  foreign correspondents who are here to report on developments,  we beg of you to take into consideration the fact that this is a  homeland whose people have suffered a great deal. It deserves  your full professionalism on the one hand, and your help in  reporting and commenting on events here on the other hand. You  should do this to fortify its unity and help it emerge from the  remnants of past events so that no foreign scheme to return it  to its previous condition can slip into the country.    After that introduction to my meeting with you, I thank you  for your work and all you are doing. Specifically, I address  your professional duties in this homeland under these  circumstances. To start off with -- I would prefer to dedicate  more time to questions and answers -- but I would like to say  that the circumstances Lebanon is experiencing and the  repercussions of all events in the region, in particular the  negotiations, have caused us to experience security events and  actions during the recent stages that prompted the cabinet two  days ago to take the measures that it took. These are  extraordinary measures because the situation in Lebanon at this  stage is extraordinary and sensitive.    We are not claiming that the situation is dangerous. No.  But so that the situation does not reach the danger point one  day, we need to handle extraordinary situations with  extraordinary measures that bolster the unity of the homeland --  land, people, and institutions -- and fortify the Lebanese  national decision internally and in the negotiations taking  place in Washington within the framework of the peace talks  which started in Madrid.    I would now like to allow an opportunity for questions and  answers.    [Correspondent] From what I hear you say, I infer that the  decision to prevent the private media from broadcasting  newscasts and political programs was demanded by negotiations  [as heard], in an indirect manner, that is, and that the  suspension will be for a long time. What can you say about that?    [Samahah] This inference is wrong and out of place. To be  precise, the measure is exceptional and temporary. The Council  of Ministers linked it to the audiovisual media law, which the  cabinet will conclude on Tuesday. It will be available to the  Chamber of Deputies as of Wednesday. It is absolutely not  connected to negotiations or to what goes on during them. It is  linked to security and the psychological experience the country  has undergone. The decision does not condemn audiovisual media  in Lebanon. This decision is not a condemnation; it prepares  for the restoration of normalcy in the general atmosphere in the  country at the sensitive stage we are going through. The future  of these mass media, their circulation of news and their very  existence, will depend on the new law. That is why we ordered  the suspension of newscasts and did not close private radio and  television stations, out of a desire to respect the  Constitution, the nature of our people, and our system's  observation of freedoms. The legalization of audiovisual mass  media will be achieved through the new law.    As explained in the recent cabinet statement, all that is  happening in Lebanon today -- starting with the negative  security incidents caused primarily by the heated situation in  the south as a result of the Israeli occupation of our land and  our people's resistance of this occupation and also by the  assault against Lebanon's geographic, human, and personal  identity as represented by the Sayyidat al-Najat explosion -- is  linked to our conflict with Israel in its various aspects and  the ongoing negotiations with Israel. There is evidence in this  connection. If anyone thinks that negotiations with Israel will  dictate to us any position on suspending freedoms and preventing  our people from expressing their views on this issue, this is  out of the question completely. All freedoms, particularly in  this field, are protected, not only by government decision or  action, but by the actual practice of the Chamber of Deputies  and daily practice. We exempted written media -- newspapers and  magazines -- which are subject to the publication law. No  measure, directive, or guidance has been issued to these media.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency, the Lebanese Government  has adopted measures against the media.    [Samahah] Not all the media. No measures were adopted  against the media. An information measure was adopted which  fully respects and appreciates the role of the private media.  Our objective behind this measure is to ensure a stronger  commitment by everyone to the law and to the ongoing efforts to  boost the national decision and services.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct].    [Samahah] I want to speak clearly. Over the past four  months, many things have happened in Lebanon. These include  rumors and minor bombings of some holy places and certain  educational centers and schools. They also include attacks on  religious sites in several areas and attacks on the cemeteries  of various sects. Furthermore, leaflets were distributed during  the night inciting religious sedition, particularly during the  holiday periods [words indistinct] spiritual families in  Lebanon. Then came the bombing of the church in Zuq Mikha'il.  This was followed by rumors. However, the source and motives of  the rumors were known. [words indistinct].    What the security services and judicial authority have done  is quite important to our homeland. It is an extraordinary  measure. The information that was made available when the  Council of Ministers adopted its decision demonstrated to us  that Lebanon's unity, the Lebanese legitimate institutions, the  unity of the Lebanese, and coexistence in Lebanon were the  targets.    This is an extraordinary matter as far as we are concerned.  What we experienced of events in the sixties, seventies,  eighties, and early nineties made the government, as a result of  the facts and information available to it, adopt extraordinary  measures and stands that it announced after the recent session  of the Council of Ministers.    This, therefore, is not a state of emergency; had it been  so, we would have simply announced it. This is an extraordinary  case that could be handled only by the extraordinary decisions  and measures that the government took to stabilize the  situation, to bolster the decision, and to protect Lebanon's  most important foundations: the unity of the land, the  institutions, and the citizens. The measures were also meant to  remove the specter of the dark years that our citizens have  experienced, remove it from their (?daily) life and their  aspirations for a better future.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Samahah] I am not concerned [words indistinct] from all  private audio, visual, and even printed media. There is no  discrimination before the law [words indistinct]. All are equal  before the law. When officials apply this to themselves, they  become equal to nonofficials and to those who are outside the  decision centers in the government; both refrain from expressing  their opinions in their media. This is a national measure taken  in the context of national decisions at the level of the  homeland. There was a need to ease the situation, remove the  tension, and entrench stability. The decision was not meant to  condemn the media or to evaluate them. Along with the other  decisions, it was made out of concern for the citizens'  psychological stability and national immunity. And because this  is an extraordinary situation and the ban is an extraordinary,  temporary move, the decision was basically related to the  application of the Lebanese law, through the law on audio and  visual media, to the existing media, which will continue to  exist. This is not a restriction on freedoms, about which we  are much concerned; this is an extraordinary case to bolster all  elements of the homeland at a stage in which a new kind of  confrontation is imposed on us by the Israeli enemy.    Regarding the first question -- the deployment of the  Lebanese Army in Saydun -- I cannot say anything because nothing  has yet been said officially concerning the dead men. If they  belonged to the Lebanese Army, then the Army Command will make  an announcement, and if not, [words indistinct] if the  resistance carried out an operation against elements  collaborating with Israel inside our occupied territory and the  operation succeeded.    Regarding the second question, any media establishment on  Lebanese territory that does not conform to the cabinet's  decision to stop newscasts and direct or indirect political  programs will be considered to have violated this decision. If  that is the case, the necessary measures will be taken against  it. There can be no vacillation or hesitation in this regard.  The cabinet's decisions were made to be implemented and there  can be no bargaining in this respect.    There is a special situation in southern Lebanon where the  citizens are influenced by the media services in the occupied  Lebanese territory. These citizens are the target of  psychological warfare waged by the radio of the collaborators  with Israel [Kafr Killa Voice of the South] and by Israel's  radio. We are currently studying how to confront this situation  through Lebanon's state radio and television. The state radio  reaches several areas and state television covers most parts of  the south. In the next 24 hours we will boost transmission to  that area. All this is within the framework of implementing the  cabinet's decision. No one [word indistinct] in Lebanon has  violated this decision.    [Correspondent] First, do you believe gallows will be set up  in Beirut [words indistinct]? Second, do you believe the  investigation [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] There is no person in Lebanon, be he Lebanese or  non-Lebanese, who does not come under the jurisdiction of  Lebanese law. The Lebanese law is above everyone, regardless of  his capacity, responsibility, and position. The death sentence  is the jurisdiction of the Lebanese judiciary. The government  cannot anticipate the verdicts of the specialized courts on who  will be sentenced to death or what the sentences will be. The  Lebanese Government can affirm and I can affirm on behalf of the  president that if the courts issue death sentences, these  sentences will be carried out where the crimes took place. If  the law or the investigation involves big and small fish, there  are no small and big fish; there are citizens or residents on  Lebanese territory. If they are convicted, accused, or arrest  warrants are issued against them, the law will be applied and  they will be brought to investigation. They will be equally  treated and their full rights will be safeguarded, such as  having a defense attorney present during the interrogation and  to defend them in public trials that are held in accordance with  the procedures for Lebanese trials.    [Correspondent] Could we go back to [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] What is the question?    [Correspondent] The question is will the fate of [words  indistinct]?    [Samahah] [Words indistinct].    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] I will start by answering the latter part, because  the answer to the latter part makes answering the second and  first parts of the questions easier. All the circumstances that  have been created in the past in Christian society, or in the  Christian street as you called it, took various forms to pave  the way for what was supposed to take place in the Christian  street as a result of the death of over 100 people in the  Phalangist Party headquarters explosion and over 100 people in  the Zuq Mikha'il Church bomb.    We heard some voices programmed to make statements at the  same time as the explosion, on the night it happened and the  days following it, targeting the unity of Lebanon by calling for  self-security and federalism. Thus, whoever wanted to frustrate  the Christian street was planting the seeds through which he  could reap Lebanon's fragmentation. He was building on the  frustration and absence of relations with the authorities, the  regime, and the legitimate institutions that unite the homeland.  Through this gap, he would then demand international  protection, to go along with talk we have recently heard about  requests for international protection, as an after-effect of the  massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque or the international  protection that has been demanded for Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Lebanon is a different case altogether. Lebanon is not  territory occupied by another power as is the case in the  occupied Arab territories in Palestine which makes the  Palestinians demand international protection. The same case as  the Palestinian one also applies to the struggle in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, for one party in the struggle to demand  international protection from an oppressor party. Lebanon is  united in its territory and people; there is coexistence among  the spiritual families. Lebanon is also united in its  institutions and authorities. Therefore, the objective of all  attempts that started a long time ago to plant frustration in  the minds of some people in the Christian street was to move  from this condition to another condition which would be the  result of programmed explosions. Reactions to these programmed  explosions were also programmed to demand the fragmentation of  the country.    Consequently, one cannot be frustrated if one believes in  the ideals of the spiritual families, believes in the homeland,  has a democratic political pattern in the political work inside  the country, and believes in his land. This frustration  represents an evil desire that seeks to dismember the homeland.  What is required is that we pass these tests. Thank God, our  people and their leaders have shown cohesion in confronting the  aftermath of the church bombing and the Phalangist Party  headquarters bombing. We must rally more around the state's  establishments, around the unity of the homeland, and around the  citizens' unity.    I now come to the subject of freedoms, and consequently the  subject of the television and radio media law. [words  indistinct] It is natural that this law should take its course  [words indistinct]. The cabinet has now received this law. At  its last meeting, the cabinet adopted a decision to discuss this  law definitively at an extraordinary meeting to be held  especially for this purpose on Tuesday [29 March]. [words  indistinct] The decision is that we should study and approve  this law at a meeting on Tuesday even if the meeting is a long  one. I hope that even if the meeting takes a long time we will  be able to finalize it and refer it [to parliament] on  Wednesday. I am confident that with the new willpower of the  cabinet [words indistinct] the law will reach the phase of final  study and final approval at the next meeting. [words indistinct]    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, some newspaper reports claim  that the United States [words indistinct] knew about the Council  of Ministers' decision before they were issued [words  indistinct]. Is this true?    [Samahah] This is certainly not true. The way I read this  report in some newspapers, it was published as though it was a  confirmed report. In order to make these decisions -- and you  can testify to what I am saying -- the recent session of the  Council of Ministers started at 1700 and ended at 2230 in the  evening. In other words, these decisions were discussed at  length and in depth. They were decided by the session. No one  can have prior information before a session begins about  decisions that are made during that session through a consensus  of the Council of Ministers and that are formulated during the  session. Anyone who suggests such an idea, is wrong. The  Lebanese Government's decisions are made by the Lebanese  Government itself during its meetings. The Government is not  affected by any necessity to inform some other party before it  makes these decisions [words indistinct]. No. Many of the  decisions were proposed during the [Council of Ministers]  session and their proposition, discussion, and approval were  dictated by the facts that were available to the Council of  Ministers during the session.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. Minister [words  indistinct] an attempt to [words indistinct] change the Lebanese  society, and [words indistinct]. Could one say that the  measures taken by the Council of Ministers are an attempt to  [word indistinct] the media [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] You are talking about the decisions dealing with  the media?    [Correspondent] Yes, the media and [word indistinct]  preparing Lebanese society [words indistinct]? Can you comment  on the [word indistinct] negotiations?    [Samahah] The decisions that we have made are not linked in  any way to the contents of the peace negotiations nor to any  possible evaluations we might have about the results of these  negotiations. The decisions we adopted were made as a result of  the information available to us. They are an indivisible whole.  The decisions we made concern the media, the political  situation, security, and a host of issues on handling the  extraordinary circumstances, situation, and reality the country  is going through.    The temporary nature of the decision regarding the  audio-visual media is linked to this reality and nothing else.  It has no background in, or relationship to the results of the  negotiations on the one hand, nor to the actual contents of the  law on audio and visual media to be issued. Had we wanted to  restrict freedoms, or had there been ulterior motives to  restrict freedoms, the decision would have also included the  print media and press. Our decision does not include these two  areas, because they are covered by a separate law, which exists  within its own framework. The Cabinet decision was made under  extraordinary circumstances for specific purposes and for a  limited period of time. I sincerely hope that it will not last  too long.    The law includes the audio and visual media only, for the  reasons I explained at the beginning of our meeting. There is  nothing else behind these reasons and they are not linked to the  negotiations or their results.    The country's security situation [words indistinct]  negotiations. When Israel threatens at the negotiations to  change the course of these negotiations by disrupting security,  we should be wary in interpreting this threat and linking it  with the security incident that targets political  decision-making through [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] some [word indistinct]  the  dissolution of the Lebanese Forces Party [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] The decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces Party  at the Cabinet meeting upon the interior minister's proposal was  not made merely for judicial considerations. The Cabinet does  not (?depend) on the judicial authorities' investigation. The  Cabinet had no knowledge of the investigation and it has no  access to the investigation before a judge makes an indictment.    In its decision, the cabinet relied on security and  political  considerations and on a number of incidents and factors in the  context of its eagerness to enhance the domestic situation.    On the other hand, we in the government are concerned with  Dr. Samir Ja'ja's case as much as we are concerned about any  Lebanese citizen. As for what Dr. Ja'ja' decides to do, he is  free to do what he likes. Whether or not he is implicated -- as  your question might suggest -- this has to be decided by the  judiciary in light of the evidence they have and the conviction  of the investigating judge, who alone has the right to act  according to his convictions. We cannot predict or jump to  conclusions on this issue.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah] According to the Cabinet's information, we do not  believe that for four years Lebanon has witnessed such progress  in consolidating stability and national unity and institutions  as it has in the past three or four weeks. Besides, no  conditions as serious and delicate as those which prevailed  recently have ever existed in Lebanon before.    The Cabinet's recent assessment of the general course of  domestic events required us to adopt this kind of important,  bold, and extraordinary decisions to protect the unity of the  land and the people and the country's security and stability,  all of which was at stake.    Our aim was to dispel the fear that held the nation in  thrall and that was blamed, we were told, on frustration. Bombs  were planted, leaflets were distributed, places of worship were  attacked, and rumors were spread, creating an extraordinary  situation, one which the Cabinet was mindful of when it made its  decisions at this specific point in time.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the media that supports  or  opposes the Government?    [Samahah] Private media cannot be easily classified as  progovernment or antigovernment. Those who support the  Government and those who oppose it, as well as those who make up  their minds as they go all work for various media organs. Means  of expression are still available in Lebanon. We still have  newspapers. The press is still free. We still have Lebanese  Television, Radio Lebanon, and the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY.    The private media, by their very nature, were not in the  habit of printing all statements in full. Your objection,  although valid, is not the only consideration that dictates  everything that should be published. The official media do not  carry the full statements of the information minister, just the  highlights. The situation will be dealt with gradually. The  official media will be as open to the Government as to the  opposition. They will reflect the country's political life to  the fullest extent.    The measure that has been taken is an extraordinary and  temporary one, if I may repeat. We are not making excuses.  This is an extraordinary situation and, whether you are  Lebanese or foreign, you must be aware of that from the  experience of the past few weeks, for you have been in close  touch with events.    Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures.  These measures will not last for long, because we want the  situation to go back to normal.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what is it that is  frightening you about the radio and television stations? Is  there something specific [preceding word in English] about what  these radio and television stations did? You have 50, 60, or  100 radio and television stations [words indistinct]. What  precisely frightened you?    [Samahah] In what you have watched and heard on those  television and radio stations, were there not broadcasts that  largely contributed to the spread of anxiety or sought to  encourage resentment in the ranks of certain sects or groups,  thus possibly serving the same aims as the recent bombings? I  am not saying everyone did this; only some and perhaps only a  few. After carefully observing these broadcasts, we judged that  in addition to the positive and helpful atmosphere provided by  some television and radio stations, some others created certain  atmospheres that were amenable to Israeli-influenced plans.  Were these stations doing this innocently or maliciously? In  view of our exceptional circumstances, it was necessary for us  to make not only this exceptional decision, but a large number  of exceptional decisions. Furthermore, we made this decision  because, for the first time ever, we had uncovered schemes to  disrupt the country's security; we discovered their planners and  those who carried out the schemes. We also came into possession  of security information apart from the data that is purely  judicial. We acted preemptively in order to protect our  resolutions during these exceptional circumstances.    This will not last long. Soon these audiovisual media will  be governed by law, as in other countries. I do not wish to  draw a comparison between Lebanon, in its current circumstances,  and those very few countries that have no new laws governing the  media.    We must keep in mind that no one else has passed through 20  dark years as we did. No one else is going through a period of  domestic recuperation while living in regional circumstances  like ours and negotiating at the same time. We are not taking  anyone to task, as I said at the beginning. I am saying exactly  what I mean. I was careful in choosing my words when I  discussed the subject. We are not taking anyone to task. The  measure we implemented was precautionary, not disciplinary. We  are not trying to suppress these media. Had we wanted to do  this, we would have closed them down. We simply adopted a  protective measure, pending the issuance of the media law and  the results of our ongoing communications with the people in  charge of those media.    [Correspondent] What guarantee is there, Mr. Minister,  that [words indistinct] the media law for a period [words  indistinct]?    [Samahah] Thank you for that question. The guarantee is the  Lebanese system. The nature of the Lebanese system and the  existence of the democratic institutions in the Lebanese system,  particularly the existence of the Chamber of Deputies, is our  guarantee that no one will misuse his authority. I think that  as a minister in the Government I know that the Government does  not want and will not misuse its authority. If, God forbid, the  authority has been misused, there is the Chamber of Deputies to  monitor the misuse of authority.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the issuance of the law  by the Council of Ministers on Tuesday?    [Samahah] Yes. You arrived late. These questions were  asked before your arrival.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the decision to dissolve  the Lebanese Forces was adopted after the judicial authorities'  decision. The judicial authorities issued a tentative  indictment [words indistinct] regarding a certain political  party, but no measures were adopted against it. Why?    [Samahah] The tentative indictment was issued yesterday. A  Council of Ministers meeting will be held on Tuesday. Wait for  the Council of Ministers' decisions on Tuesday.    [Correspondent] In the wake of the Zuq Mikha'il explosion,  [words indistinct] arrest warrants were issued [words  indistinct] the Lebanese Forces. [Words indistinct] involved  certain areas only?    [Samahah] They covered all areas, and successive ...    [Correspondent, interrupting] ...did not go beyond a  specific area?    [Samahah] Measures are being adopted in all the Lebanese  Army's deployment areas. Statements are being issued by the  Lebanese Army regarding all the confiscations that are taking  place. There is no discrimination. All Lebanese are equal under  the law and according to security measures. There is no  autonomous security in Lebanon.    [Correspondent] When will it take up its new (?positions)?    [Samahah] It will take its new positions in its present  deployment areas, in the areas where it has the ability to do  so, and in the areas where the Syrian Army, which complements  the Lebanese security forces, is deployed. The same measures  are being adopted in all Lebanese territory and covers all  Lebanese citizens.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, my question is about the  operations area of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon. [Words  indistinct] the deployment of the Lebanese Army, will it leave  the area or [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] This involves another very careful consideration  related to the Israeli occupation and the confrontation with  Israeli occupation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did the Council of Ministers  consider [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] These measures have been adopted and will be  implemented. The Lebanese authorities are working to maintain  security according to Government policy. Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASS-ACTION SUIT CONTENDS 7 U.S. AIRLINES FIXED PRICES  </P> <P> A federal judge in Atlanta will hear a consolidated lawsuit alleging collusion  and price fixing by some of the nation's major airlines and their computerized  fare network.  </P> <P> Thirty-one claims filed nationwide were consolidated Friday in the court of  U.S. District Judge Marvin H. Shoob.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that the airlines use computers to signal fare changes to  each other, agree on price increases and threaten fare cuts.  </P> <P> As a result of the alleged collusion, the suit charges that passengers are  forced to pay artificially high ticket prices.  </P> <P> The defendants are USAir, Northwest, Delta, Continental, United, TWA and  American airlines and a Washington-based computer clearinghouse, Airline Tariff  Publishing Co.  </P> <P> A panel of federal judges decided that Atlanta was most accessible to all  parties in the suit.  </P> <P> If Shoob certifies the suit as a class action, a decision expected early next  year, the plaintiffs could number in the millions. Customers who purchased a  plane ticket since 1987 could potentially be a party to the suit.  </P> <P> "In 1988, 150 million tickets were sold, so that would give you a rough idea of  the possible magnitude of this case," said W. Pitts Carr, the Atlanta attorney  who filed the first suit here last July. "There are literally tens of millions  of people or companies who are potential class members."  </P> <P> The defendants deny the charges.  </P> <P> "Delta denies totally the allegations . . . concerning our participation in any  conspiracy to fix prices," said Edward B. Krugman, one of the airline's  attorneys.  </P> <P> The suit seeks undetermined damages that could be tripled under federal  antitrust laws. It also asks that the airlines be restrained from further  violation of antitrust laws and that the computer network be "restructured so  as to discourage future collusion among airlines."  </P></p>

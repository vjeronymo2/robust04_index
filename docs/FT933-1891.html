			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Ekostahl subsidy could hit EC plan THE European Commission's controversial restructuring plan for the steel industry could fail if Germany insists on subsidising new capacity at Ekostahl in eastern Germany, warned Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, in Brussels yesterday. Mr Bangemann was speaking after a meeting of EC industry ministers in which the future of the east German plant emerged as the key remaining obstacle to a resolution of the subsidies issue - which would clear the way for restructuring to go ahead. Mr Bangemann said the Commission hoped to be able to propose a 'reasonable' solution in the next two to three weeks for Ilva, the state-owned Italian producer. 'We have already found a solution to the Spanish case,' said Mr Bangemann, referring to the restructuring plan for the main Basque plants agreed by the Commission, Madrid and the Basque government in recent weeks. 'It depends on the attitude of the German government as to whether we can complete the package.' Industry ministers need to approve settlements of all the three main subsidy issues - Ilva, Ekostahl and CSI in Spain - before the private sector steelmakers come forward with their own offers of capacity cuts. The European Commission said it had opened an inquiry into a planned venture between Germany's Mannesmann, Valtubes, a unit of France's Vallourec, and Dalmine, a subsidiary of Italy's state steelmaker Ilva, to see whether competition in the market would be badly damaged by the alliance, Reuter reports from Brussels. German steelmakers yesterday said they would appeal in the US Court of International Trade against the US government's decision to impose stiff dumping duties on steel products from 19 countries, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.</p>

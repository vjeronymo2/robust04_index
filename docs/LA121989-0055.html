			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASNER TAKES STAND AGAINST MONTOYA;  </P> <P> CORRUPTION TRIAL: FORMER SCREEN ACTORS GUILD PRESIDENT TESTIFIES THAT STATE  SENATOR WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE GUILD WAS GOING TO DO FOR HIM.  </P> <P> Actor Ed Asner, a former president of the Screen Actors Guild, testified Monday  that state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya once asked for support in exchange for a vote  on legislation affecting actors and recording artists.  </P> <P> "He wanted to know what we were going to do for him," Asner told a federal jury  during Montoya's political corruption trial. "I thought he was asking for a  quid pro quo. . . . We do something for him and he'd do something for us, such  as vote on the bill."  </P> <P> Later in the day, former Montoya aide Karen Frick testified that the  50-year-old lawmaker once put a "price tag" of $5,000 to carry two bills that  would help foreign medical schools and their graduates seeking licenses in  California.  </P> <P> And veteran lobbyist Dennis Carpenter, who once was a senator from Orange  County, told the court that Montoya repeatedly asked him to obtain an  honorarium from a recycling company that was affected by a Montoya bill.  </P> <P> Asner, who had come to the state Capitol to lobby against a bill, said he was  "angry and shocked" by Montoya's request for support during a private meeting  in the senator's office.  </P> <P> But on cross-examination, Asner acknowledged that Montoya never used the word  "money" in asking for assistance. And the actor said his recollection of many  of the details of his conversation with Montoya is now "fuzzy."  </P> <P> In an attempt to undercut Asner's testimony, the defense produced a photograph  of a smiling Asner and Montoya with their arms draped over each other's  shoulders. Asner agreed that the picture was taken immediately after his  meeting with Montoya.  </P> <P> Asner's account of the meeting, however, was corroborated by George Miller, a  lobbyist for the Assn. of Talent Agents, who also was present. Miller told the  jury he recalled Montoya saying, "You guys haven't done anything for me, why  should I do anything for you?"  </P> <P> Asner, star of television's "Lou Grant" and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show,"  testified that he came to Sacramento in May, 1985, to speak against legislation  designed to extend the maximum length of contracts between recording companies  and artists to 10 years. The Screen Actors Guild, which includes many  performing artists among its members, opposed the bill, arguing that the  10-year period was too long.  </P> <P> Miller, who was advising Asner on the bill, had identified Montoya as a swing  vote at an upcoming hearing of the Senate Industrial Relations Committee.  </P> <P> On the morning of the hearing, Asner and Miller went to see Montoya in the  senator's office. As the actor attempted to explain the guild's position, he  testified, Montoya began asking what backing he had received from the actors'  union.  </P> <P> "The Screen Actors Guild had never done anything for him, what were they going  to do for him," Asner recalled the senator saying. "He seemed to be somewhat  agitated that we had never done anything for him."  </P> <P> Both Asner and Miller testified that they interpreted Montoya's statement as a  request for money and the conversation quickly grew heated.  </P> <P> Miller, who took the witness stand after Asner, testified that the veteran  actor "made a timeout gesture and said, 'You mean I have to pay for a vote?' "  </P> <P> At one point in the conversation, Miller said, "I remember Mr. Asner commenting  on the (legislative) system. As I remember, he said it stunk."  </P> <P> Asner explained that he agreed to the impromptu photo session in the hope it  might win Montoya's support for the guild's position. "Perhaps out of the  goodness of his heart, my making a picture with someone would sway his vote,"  Asner told the jury.  </P> <P> Montoya, however, voted for the bill and against Asner. The measure by Sen.  Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) later passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Gov.  George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Under cross-examination by defense attorney Bruce Kelton, Asner acknowledged he  had difficulty remembering some details of the meeting but clearly recalled how  angry he was at Montoya's request.  </P> <P> "Functions, dates, people are all fuzzy," Asner said. "I only remember  emotions."  </P> <P> "I'm sure you remember your lines," Kelton responded.  </P> <P> "Only when I have too," Asner said.  </P> <P> Kelton also questioned whether Montoya had explained that he was forced to vote  for the bill because it had the backing of powerful Democratic leaders.  </P> <P> But Asner said he did not recall Montoya ever making such a statement. " 'What  was the guild going to do for him' seemed to be the exact language," Asner  said. " 'What's the guild going to do for me?' "  </P> <P> Miller testified that once they arrived at the committee meeting room, Montoya  handed Asner a business card with the handwritten message, "Ed, hope there's no  hard feelings. Love you, Joe."  </P> <P> Former Senate aide Frick said the committee Montoya chaired had a reputation as  "a juice committee" -- one that generated large campaign contributions for its  members.  </P> <P> Frick said she and another consultant to Montoya's Senate Business and  Professions Committee were approached by a lobbyist representing foreign  medical schools. The lobbyist wanted Montoya to sponsor bills making it easier  for foreign graduates to be licensed to practice in California, she said.  </P> <P> When the aides took the request to Montoya, according to Frick, "he said he  would do that but that there was a price to pay for the bills. . . . I recall a  $5,000 figure." Frick testified that Montoya emphasized that she and the other  aide were expected to convey the request to the medical schools' lobbyist.  </P> <P> Frick said that on 10 or more occasions she remembered Montoya saying that  "people have to pay their dues" or "pay up" if they expected his support in the  Legislature.  </P> <P> After working for Montoya for two years, Frick said, she was fired. Her job was  taken by Amiel A. Jaramillo, who had earlier made it clear to her that "he was  going to be taking an aggressive role in raising campaign contributions." She  said Jaramillo -- who has been charged with four counts of political corruption  in a related case -- urged the staff to "kick ass and get people to pay their  dues to Joe."  </P> <P> Lobbyist Carpenter said he had urged his client, Allan Co., not to pay  honorariums to legislators. But Carpenter said that Montoya raised the issue  "five or six times" in a matter of only a few weeks. Finally, when Allan Co.  executives agreed to pay Montoya $2,000 for speaking to a recycling  organization, Carpenter said it was "all right with me."  </P> <P> But Carpenter said the speech was canceled in August, 1988, when the FBI raided  the offices of several legislators, including Montoya, and the senator never  received the $2,000.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Moldovan Vice-Premier Ion Gutu told a news  conference in Kishinev [Chisinau] on Wednesday [8 June] that in  1994 through 1997 the priorities of the new cabinet will be the  strengthening of the economy, reforms, social security and the  expansion of foreign trade. He also said that the government  program of action will be discussed by parliamentary committees  and then by a plenary session of parliament.    Gutu said the country has made certain financial  achievements: in May the inflation rate was only 4 percent.    Falling production remains the main problem. In the first  five months industrial production amounted to 71 percent of last  year's level. The number of employed in industry dropped by a  third. Many factories are sending their workers on unpaid leave.    Gutu said the government wants to suggest to parliament  making urban land an article of trade, which in his opinion  could attract foreign investments in the Moldovan economy.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Investment banks take stock after telecoms battle: After nearly four years of courtship, Deutsche Telekom rings Goldman Sachs' bell For executives of the world's top investment banks, last weekend must have been one of the most relaxing for some time. Those not celebrating their success, after Friday's announcement from the German government of which banks would play leading roles in the Deutsche Telekom share issue, could at least enjoy an end to months of tension. When Goldman Sachs was named as the foreign bank in the global consortium for the equity sale - which at some DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) is the biggest ever in Germany and one of the world's largest - it was finally confirmed that the US bank's assiduous courtship of the German telecommunications concern and its chairman Helmut Ricke, had paid off. The global consortium takes responsibility for the co-ordination of demand and placement in consultation with regional lead-managers. Along with Deutsche Telekom and the German government it will also decide on allocation of shares between the domestic German market and the four other regions. The international group acts as intermediary between regional leaders and the company. The choice of a US bank was virtually certain. Deutsche Telekom's decision to seek a US listing to tap as many American institutional and private investors as possible meant a US bank would inevitably have a head start, joining Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank at the top of the global consortium. Although the decision was taken last Monday at a meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was alert to the political implications of the choice of lead banks, it was kept quiet at first. This was to give the government time to work out final details and avoid the news clashing with the presentation of the newly re-elected government's legislative programme. Keeping banks and the media on tenterhooks was 'a deliberate diversionary tactic', said one government official. Even Deutsche Bank only knew of the definite choice of Goldman Sachs on Thursday night. Deutsche, too, received a boost on Friday with its appointment as spokesman for the global consortium, also responsible for the overall bookbuilding process in which investor interest is assessed before the share price is fixed. This was seen as a political attempt to help Deutsche, Germany's biggest bank, after its image problems over the Metallgesellschaft and the Schneider property debacles. Dresdner Bank had earlier looked like taking the top German prize after its success with the recent Lufthansa privatisation. In the event, it shares the leadership of the German sub-consortium - likely to account for more than half the share sales - with Deutsche, while the latter is a joint manager (with Merrill and Goldman) in the American placing, and co-leader for the UK tranche (headed by Warburg) and for Asia (led by Daiwa). France's Paribas heads the consortium for the rest of Europe, with Dresdner as co-manager. The whole issuing structure is finely balanced and designed to put the top banks in geographical areas at the head of the regional consortia. From the start, Goldman always looked most likely to fare best in this overall share-out. It had courted the German company for nearly four years, having first called on its executives in February 1991, well before the Bonn government announced plans to raise capital for the state-owned company through the international markets. Other leading investment banks also spent years cultivating Deutsche Telekom. One US investment banker said: 'Anybody who hadn't been all over this should be fired. If somebody rolled up a year ago without investing time I think they were a little optimistic.' But Goldman Sachs was particularly determined. Mr Scott Mead, a managing director of the communications and technology group within the investment banking division, and one of a core team of six executives involved in the deal, said it was a 'a top priority for a large number of our senior management' - a formidable claim for a bank known for its relentless pursuit of business. In its initial contacts, Goldman Sachs explained its views about the global telecommunications industry which it believes was poised to expand rapidly. 'There was nothing tangible at the time, but we were firmly convinced that a commercial and corporate structure was the best way forward for telecommunications companies,' explained Mr Robert Morris, a managing director of Goldman's global equities research. 'Whether it was 1991 or 1995, our belief was that you would have privatisation throughout Europe and the rest of the world. In a sense we thought it was inevitable.' Early in 1992, Goldman held a series of meetings with the group in connection with roadshows designed to introduce German government bodies to the international capital markets. 'This was an unofficial exercise designed to help them know what they would confront when privatisation came,' said Mr Mead. 'We organised the meetings to help explain the equity story.' In spring 1993, Goldman worked with the international arm of Deutsche Telekom on its bid for a stake in Matav, the Hungarian telecommunications concern. Deutsche Telekom eventually bought a 30 per cent stake in Matav for Dollars 875m. DT was always the favourite but Mr Morris claimed: 'They won even though they were not the highest bidder. So it was obviously satisfactory.' In 1994, Goldman worked closely with DT and France Telecom when the two European companies invested some Dollars 4.2bn in Sprint, the US telecommunications concern. Between these deals, Goldman's executives worked hard to cultivate the relationship. For at least six - and usually 10 - executives based in Frankfurt and London, the DT deal was a priority. Goldman even moved Mr Morris, its pre-eminent telecoms analyst, from the US to London last year in order to help with the Telekom campaign. The bank used every opportunity to strengthen its ties with DT, keeping the company informed about the progress of other international privatisation deals in which it has been involved. 'We filled them in on our views on the evolution of technology and the background to privatisation, said Mr Morris. Goldman was heavily involved in the sale of Singapore Telecom in 1993, and this year has been in three large deals. It was a book-runner in the sale of Tele Danmark, the Danish company, Thailand Telephone &amp; Communications and Indosat, the Indonesian long distance telecommunications company. While the fees to be earned by the various banks from the Deutsche Telekom deal are clearly attractive at DM400m or more, Goldman says the real value of the deal is strategic. 'This is a deal which every institution we talk to will be interested in. And for our German office and our telecommunications business it is of extraordinary importance,' insisted Mr Mead. 'A relationship with Telekom has a pay-back you can't measure in terms of fees,' he added. Rightly or wrongly, said Mr Morris, 'there is a perception in the marketplace that if you have passed the test in Germany you have passed German engineering standards in relation to telecommunications flotations. It shows that the doors fit snugly and the wheels are tight.'  --------------------------------------------------------------           DEUTSCHE TELEKOM - DISTRIBUTING THE SPOILS  --------------------------------------------------------------                     INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM                           Deutsche Bank                 Dresdner Bank      Goldman Sachs  --------------------------------------------------------------      TELEKOM'S ADVISER                GOVERNMENT'S ADVISER        NM Rothschild                    CS First Boston  -------------------------------------------------------------- GERMANY                       UK                   AMERICAS Dresdner Bank             SG Warburg            Goldman Sachs Deutsche Bank                                   Deutsche Bank                                                 Merrill Lynch DG - Bank               Kleinwort Benson        Morgan Stanley Westdeutsche          National Westminister    Salomon Brothers Landesbank                Deutsche Bank Bayerische Landesbank Commerzbank              OTHER EUROPE                ASIA Bayerische Hypotheken      Paribas                   Daiwa und Wechselbank              UBS               Nomura Securities Bayerische Vereinsbank   Dresdner Bank         Lehman Brothers Hessische Landesbank                           Deutsche Bank Norddeutsche Landesbank  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

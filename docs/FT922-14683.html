			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Architects' optimism on work prospects proves short-lived GLOOM has descended again on the architecture profession after a small outbreak of optimism at the beginning of the year, according to quarterly figures published yesterday. Architects are becoming 'ever more pessimistic' about their future workloads during the recession, the Royal Institute of British Architects says. While the institute's previous figures showed that architects were becoming, on balance, fairly optimistic about future workloads, the latest show that only the largest practices are now even slightly optimistic. Only one in 100 large practices expects a rise while smaller firms still expect a big fall in new commissions. The institute says it is downgrading its predictions as recovery of the UK economy appears to have been postponed for about two quarters. 'Our view is that workloads will remain fairly static during the next 12 months, although there should be an upturn by the end of the year.' The institute's sectoral figures disclose sharp falls in industrial and retail commissions, while new commissions in the office and leisure sectors continue drifting downwards. Only public-sector and housing commissions show rises compared with the previous quarter. The institute says public-sector commissions are expected to rise further when spending proposed in the chancellor's Autumn Statement comes on stream in the new financial year.

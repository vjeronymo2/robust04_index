Addressing the Socialist International Africa Committee in  Johannesburg on Saturday, Mr Mbeki said the ANC had always  strived for an inclusive political settlement so that the  outcome of South Africa's first democratic election could be  accepted as legitimate. "We salute leaders of these political  formations for their sense of patriotism."    AVF Directorate Chairman Gen Constand Viljoen provisionally  registered the Freedom Front to contest the elections. The IFP  has also registered provisionally to contest the elections,  provided their constitutional demands were settled by  international mediation.    The ANC sincerely hopes the registration of these parties  would indeed lead to their participation in the elections, he  added. "The ANC was of the view that it was important that the  negotiated resolution of the South African conflict should be an  inclusive process, with the participation all political parties  irrespective of size."    He said the multiparty negotiations had produced an interim  constitution, which the majority of South Africans could claim  as their own, which was important to achieve legitimacy and  stability of the political settlement. "We have bee very  concerned that the elections should be accepted by all South  Africans, as a legitimate instrument to bring the country to a  democratic settlement," Mr Mbeki said.    "The greatest danger to the holding of free and fair  election  is political violence. The parties which registered on Friday  night had been saying openly, that not only would they boycott  the elections, but would in fact disrupt the elections. The  effect of their registration hopefully helps to address that  matter to some degree, to the extent that they would then not  disrupt the elections."    The ANC believes that amendments to the interim constitution  addressed the concerns of the IFP, but the organisation would  continue with further negotiations with the party, he added.  "We are prepared to enter into an agreement which the ANC would  consider to be binding on itself."    The ANC was also committed to further discussion with the  Afrikaner rightwing around their demand for a "volkstaat"  [homeland], provided their self-determination did not contradict  the principle of non-racial democracy. "In the process of  considering the issue of an Afrikaner volkstaat we have to be  bound by principles of non-racialism and democracy."    Mr Mbeki thanked the Socialist International and its member  parties for the supported they had given to the ANC and the  struggle to overthrow apartheid.</p>

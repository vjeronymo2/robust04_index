			<p>BFN     [Text] Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] spokesman  Terusuke Terada issued a statement on 15 April supporting the  South Korean policy which was announced by Yi Yong-tok, deputy  prime minister and concurrently chief of the National  Unification Board, on the same day in connection with North  Korea's (DPRK's) suspected nuclear weapon development. In  announcing the policy, Deputy Prime Minister Yi stated that  South Korea would not seek the exchange of special envoys  between South Korea and North Korea any more, and called for  South-North dialogue to pave the way for implementing mutual  inspections of their military facilities.    In his statement, spokesman Terada said: "We highly  appreciate the policy because it aims at promoting dialogue  between South and North and seeking a solution to the situation  through such dialogue, in line with a presidential statement  issued by the UN Security Council."</p>

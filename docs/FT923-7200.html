			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocooned market under threat - Japanese import restrictions may have to go A CENTURY ago, the humble silkworm led Japan on its march to becoming an economic superpower. Silk farmers have since been protected by import restrictions and soaring subsidies. But they are now wondering how much longer they can survive, reports Reuter from Tokyo. Their numbers are declining as finished goods flood in from China and South Korea, while the Uruguay Round of trade talks is opposed to continued protection of Japanese farm goods. A recent study by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestries and Fisheries found that the number of cocoon growers had dropped from 248,000 to 44,000 in the 16 years to 1991. Japan's raw silk production was down from 236,000 bales (60 kg each) in 1981 to 90,000 bales last year and over the same period cocoon output fell from 65,000 tonnes to 21,000 tonnes, the study showed. But ministry officials remain defiant. 'Perhaps we cannot stop the drop in silk farmers, but our job is to protect the regional economies and the people who can grow only cocoons,' said one. 'As long as the kimono exists as our national dress, we can expect strong demand for Japanese silk and people will realise the quality of Japanese silk,' he added. Japanese silk is longer-fibred and stronger than foreign silk, making it suitable for the kimono, the traditional long gown now used mainly for weddings and ceremonial occasions. But economics seem to contradict the ministry view. On July 29, August silk contracts on the Yokohama futures market fell to Y10,400 (Pounds 43) a kilogram, the lowest since December 1987, despite the fact that domestic demand for silk had steadily risen to 310,700 bales in 1991, equal to 30 per cent of the world market. Mr Iwao Iwamoto, an industry analyst at Commodity Market Research Institute Company, said the time had come for the government to abandon its import monopoly. In 1952, Japan introduced its silk price stabilising system under which the ministry decides on a price high and low every year as a standard on which to base market intervention. Since 1974 only the semi-government Silk Agency has been allowed to import raw silk and dried cocoons. From 1952 to 1987, Japan spent millions of yen a year to keep domestic prices high. The precise figure has not been published. In 1987, the Silk Agency had a cumulative deficit of Y120bn from its market operations. Since 1987 and the rise of the yen, the lucrative Japanese market has been flooded with foreign silk goods, such as thread, textiles and secondary products, mainly from China and South Korea. 'Japanese weavers have to pay twice as much as international prices for raw silk, so it is impossible for them to compete in the market,' said Mr Iwamoto. 'They really suffer, since they receive neither protection nor subsidies.' Cocoon farmers and raw silk producers are bitterly opposed to liberalisation of the domestic market. 'As soon as we open our silk market, prices will drop to the the international price of Y7,800 per kilogram,' said an official of the Japan Silk Manufacturers Association. The current price for domestic silk is about Y10,700 a kilogram. But pressure for liberalisation is building up from the international community. If General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade proposals to turn protection for farm goods into tariffs are accepted, silk and cocoons are likely to be the next target for attack on Japan.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (14): More workers will be flexible - Joia Shillingford on how new technology is likely to change employment practices MOBILE COMPUTING and communications are helping to fuel the boom in flexible working. Ms Amanda Lavery of Ovum, the technology research company, estimates that by the year 2000, the number of company-employed flexible workers (commonly called 'teleworkers') will increase 20-fold - from the current 600,000 to 12m in the US and Europe. She defines flexible working as 'any work carried out using a computer and/or telecoms, outside company-owned premises by a company's employees'. In a new report, Ovum estimates that the value of the market generated by flexible working in Europe and the US (including hardware and software sales, datacoms equipment and annual data traffic) will increase 30 times from Dollars 1.1bn today to Dollars 33.4bn by 2000. These projections may seem wildly optimistic but a number of factors are driving the trend: the desire to bring sales and service closer to the customer; falling computer, software and telecoms costs; and the availability of new products which make it easier for mobile workers to keep in touch with the office. These products include: Wireless access to in-house electronic mail. Using new Microsoft software, users need only plug a Mobitex radio modem into their portable PC to exchange messages with other Microsoft Mail users on their office local-area network. Data is transmitted over the RAM Mobile Data wireless network. Computerised fax systems which allow remote access. For example, a system from Vienna-based Topcall enables users to go to any fax machine outside the office, dial in a 3-digit PIN number and get all their faxes for that day forwarded to them. Personal communicators/personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as those from Apple, Sharp and Amstrad. These videocassette-sized computers can be used in conjunction with an optional modem to send or collect information from the company network. Apple (UK) is believed to be planning a link between its Newton PDA and the Rabbit network (not currently approved for data), which would provide a form of wireless data communications. Devices for linking ordinary modems to mobile phones, so that portable computer users can send or receive data without going to a conventional phone. TeleAdapt, a UK-based company specialising in helping mobile workers communicate, has introduced a device that will connect any modem to the base of either an NEC P3 or OKI 900-series cellular phone. The US-manufactured device, called Axcell Cellular, works by making the modem believe it is connected to the standard telephone network. Answering services connected to pagers. BT has launched Response Master, a telephone answering service linked to a pager. The user is given two phone numbers: one made available to callers which acts as an answerphone; the other which allows access to stored messages. The user's pager bleeps when a message is left, but he or she can retrieve it at a convenient moment. BT expects the service (which costs 54p a day including a simple pager) to be used by maintenance engineers. It saves engineers from having to break off a job to take a call, but the pager will bleep every two minutes until a new message is retrieved. The number of products designed for flexible working is increasing as computer and telecoms companies realise the huge sales opportunity that has been created. A whole host of lighter, cheaper, more powerful and more energy-efficient portable computers has come to market, some allowing handwritten input via a 'pen' stylus. In addition, some suppliers are actively encouraging the spread of flexible working by supporting teleworking init- iatives, such as the one-year Connected Community project. Backed by BT, Apple, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Rural Development Commission, this involves equipping a 'tele- centre' in the small agric- ultural town of Kington, in Hereford and Worcester, with the latest technology, and studying its impact on the community. But the trend towards flexible working is not being driven by technology alone. Ms Lavery says there is now a body of experience showing the kind of benefits teleworking can bring; as a result many large companies are actively looking at this area. Some want greater organisational flexibility to respond to positive changes (such as an increase in new business) or negative changes (such as flood, fire or terrorist attacks on company premises). Mr Peter Thompson, co-author of Henley Management College's Future Work Forum survey, says: 'The recent bombs in the City have highlighted the vulnerability of organisations that are all located in one place'. Concern about the environment is also helping to generate interest in flexible working. Thirty-five per cent of respondents to the Henley survey cited environmental issues (eg, reducing traffic congestion and pollution) as a driver for change. Benefits. Some employers are deterred by the cost of equipping potential flexible workers with adequate hardware and software. But for those who are willing to make the investment, the benefits include: Cost savings in the long term. Hewlett-Packard was able to save Dollars 300,000 annually by equipping its maintenance engineers with flexible solutions. Improved accuracy. In California, police have been given pen computers which they can use to produce traffic citations. The software prompts the user with a checklist of questions such as 'At what speed was he/she driving?' and 'On which road?'. Then, by checking the information against the central police mainframe, the software decides whether the driver has broken the law and, if so, what the fine should be. Increased sales. Drinks company Martini &amp; Rossi increased its sales by 5-10% when its sales force could make on-the-spot quotations, using Poqet notebook computers and mobile printers. Staff retention and space savings. A scheme which allows any employee to work from home has helped the Trading Standards department at Oxfordshire County Council to cope with a 100 per cent increase in its workforce despite limited office space. It has also helped the department to hold on to its trading standards officers who, because of their specialist knowledge are in demand from employers, such as large supermarkets. Efficiency and customer satisfaction. At 'white goods' supplier Seeboard, field service engineers have been given NEC briefcase faxes (which plug into portable phones) so that they can order spare parts in front of the customer or get call-out details without going into the office. The company expects increased levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction. Nevertheless, a number of obstacles remain. According to Henley, the biggest of these are human factors. Half the respondents to its survey of 200 senior UK executives felt that middle management saw difficulty in controlling workers based outside the office. However, Mr Keith Butterfield, manager of a teleworking pilot at ITSA (a UK government agency) believes good managers have nothing to fear. Based on his visits to US schemes he believes: 'Good managers will manage teleworking well, but poor managers will need training and support to succeed. Henley Management College has set up a Future Work Forum for companies interested in flexible working. More information on 0491 571454.

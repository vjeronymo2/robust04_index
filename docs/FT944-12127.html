			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Anglo-German panel questions EU regulations A panel of British and German businessmen yesterday took aim at European Union employment rules in a joint drive to eliminate unnecessary Brussels regulations. A 10-man Anglo-German deregulation group, set up by the London and Bonn governments, drew up a 'substantive list' of Brussels measures seen as unhelpful to business, according to Mr Francis Maude, who led the UK delegation. Mr Maude, a former financial secretary to the UK Treasury, who now works for the US bank Morgan Stanley, said the businessmen on the panel agreed that proposed new EU employment legislation was 'immensely damaging'. This view was backed by Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary at the Bonn economics ministry, who led the German delegation. He said proposed Brussels rules on working-time and part-time working were 'not flexible enough.' The panel, which examined measures affecting in particular the chemicals, transport and food production sectors, will send its findings to the two governments, which will then pass them on to Brussels. The UK businessmen included representatives from the Asda supermarket group and brewers Youngers, while the German side fielded senior figures from chemicals company BASF and car group Mercedes-Benz. Mr Eekhoff said there was particular concern that undue Brussels bureaucracy could spur European companies to transfer activities outside the EU. Along with planned Brussels rules on working-time and part-time working  - neither of which have yet passed into law - Mr Maude said the panel also criticised proposed tightening of legislation on transport of hazardous substances. Mr Eekhoff - whose ministry is traditionally the most active proponent of free-market ideas in the Bonn government - congratulated Britain on being 'more successful than we are on deregulation and privatisation.' This was music to the ears of Mr Maude, who deregulated himself in 1992  - after losing his parliamentary seat - and now is in charge of international privatisation operations at Morgan Stanley.</p>

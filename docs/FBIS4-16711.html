			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Text] Sakhalin Oblast Duma has held its first session and  discussed organizational issues. Our Sakhalin correspondent  Lyudmila Filippova shares her impressions of this session.    [Begin Recording] [Filippova] A session of deputies was held  in the smaller hall of the oblast administration. Both the  deputies of our oblast duma and their guests had plenty of space  to themselves. This is hardly surprising, because there were  only 12 deputies at the first session, just like the disciples  of Christ -- 11 men and one woman. The first session of the  first oblast duma was opened by Nikolay Svetkin, who is the  director of Aleksandrovskiy pedagogical institute. He invited  Viktor Kleptsov, chairman of the oblast election commission, to  report on the results of elections to the oblast duma, which we  actually already knew about -- the elections in election  district No.1 in central Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk were announced void.  In other words, there was no one to represent a significant  number of voters from the center at the first session. You can  see for yourself who sat at the duma session: Sergey Osimov from  the Korsakov base of ocean fishing; Viktor Kudryavtsev who is  also a fisherman -- director of Korsakov cannery; (Kim Pak  Toki), chairman of Korsakov (Renbok Ltd.) joint stock company;  Fedor Sidorenko, mayor of Dolinsk; Igor Revin, economist of  Kholmsk Commercial Bank; Leonid Osipov, mayor of the town of  Shakhtersk; Lyubov Shubina from Nevelsk, who temporarily does  not work; Ivan Zhdakayev, whom we know through his activity as a  deputy during the Soviet era, and who is now deputy director of  the innovative Sakhalin Foundation and still lives in the  Pervomayskiy settlement in Smirnykhovskiy Rayon; Nikolay  Dochilov, a doctor from Uglegorsk; Yuriy Kuts, deputy director  of Sakhalineftestroy company from Okha; and Valiula Maksutov,  chief of exploration drilling from the Val settlement in  Noglikskiy rayon. They all represent voters of Kholmskiy,  Korsakov and, furthest of all, Tymovskiy electoral districts.  Until reelection in election district No.1 which, as Kleptsov  announced, will be taking place on 30 October -- although I  think the deputies will consider this and might either speed up  or delay the elections -- the deputies will decide on issues  connected with legislative initiatives in our oblast.    A representative of the oblast administration, namely Vice  Governor Vladimir Shopoval, also came to congratulate the  deputies. He remarked that the duma would be working under  difficult conditions, with people tired from battles between the  branches of power, and with worsening living standards as the  background. I certainly agree with this, with the part about  living standards. Only recently I saw an old woman in oblast  center in Lenin Street. She leaned against a kiosk -- blackened  mouth, haggard face -- and when she looked at me I thought this  is how hunger looks; it is still hiding but it exists and quite  possible may take to the streets. Therefore, it is still the  ordinary citizens who suffer the most, and not everyone can take  the adversity offered by the Russian leaders.    Anatoliy Aksenov, former chairman of Oblast Soviet, also  congratulated the deputies. He remarked that the Oblast Soviet  deputies started with much fanfare four years ago, but ended  rather sadly. However, the duma deputies enter their term  modestly and under difficult conditions, so they might end up  better too.    The oblast administration has already prepared the mechanism  for fruitful work. Boris Tretyak, member of the State Duma who  recently arrived in Sakhalin, commented that he hoped for  efficient cooperation between the State Duma and Sakhalin Oblast  Duma. Only then will joint productive solutions to problems  troubling the Sakhalin residents become possible.    After presenting deputies' certificates and uttering  plaudits, the duma went for a break. I approached Deputy  Valiula Maksutov from the settlement of Val of the Noglikskiy  Rayon. Could you share with us your ideas about the duma? What  will it be able to do?    [Maksutov] We came here to work, and our only goal is  influencing the existing situation so as not only to liberalize  it but to give it the chance to develop, and give the producers  a chance to work.    [Filippova] Will you work on a professional basis?    [Maksutov] I can not say yet.    [Filippova] You have not decided this for yourself yet?    [Maksutov] It is not that I have not decided for myself. I  represent the interests of northern regions; we will discuss it  and act in a way that will benefit all voters whom we represent.  In other words, we will discuss this question among ourselves.    [Filippova] Is it a normal phenomenon that all issues  pertaining to the oblast are decided by representatives of the  outlying regions?    [Maksutov] We have expressed the opinion that elections  should be held earlier, maybe even in June. But I think we will  have to take into consideration the lack of deputies from  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.    [Filippova] Our province has always felt discriminated  against as compared to the oblast center in terms of finance,  but today no one can influence your opinion. I think you are  fairly independent now. This is a unique situation.    [Maksutov] This is a normal situation, and it might even be  good. What is bad is the fact that elections in the election  district No.1 failed. Let me repeat that we have no intentions  whatsoever of infringing upon the interests of those not present  here today.

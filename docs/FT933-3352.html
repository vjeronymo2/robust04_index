			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: US investors seen to focus on privatisations AMERICAN institutional investors who want to increase their international equity holdings are expected to focus more closely on the global offerings of state-owned enterprises, according to a recent survey*, writes Antonia Sharpe. Around 40 per cent of the survey's 40 participants, who collectively manage over Dollars 500bn in assets, said that prospects for investments in privatised French companies were good. Over 60 per cent of respondents felt that the investment outlook for France was very positive. Some 45 per cent said investment prospects were good in Italy, which is also about to launch a privatisation programme. However, they indicated that they would be reluctant to invest in Italy without tangible evidence of its regulatory and economic reform. While 75 per cent said their investment in privatisation issues over the past few years had met or exceeded their expectations, they were disappointed with the investor communication programmes of the companies concerned. Over 90 per cent of respondents said non-US companies would gain more acceptance on Wall Street and suffer less flowback of stock if they conducted active investor relations programmes. *International Investment Trends, Broadgate Consultants Inc, Suite 200, 375 Hudson Street, New York.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 25 May (EFE) -- Peruvian military planes have  intercepted two small Colombian planes in the department of  Ucayali, in the Peruvian jungle, forcing them to land, police  sources reported today.    The two small planes, which were intercepted by Peruvian Air  Force planes, landed at an illegal airstrip in the Boca Apua  zone and were set on fire by the crew, after which the alleged  drug traffickers escaped into the jungle.    Military troops and two judges later went to the illegal  airstrip and destroyed it [as received], the sources said.    The illegal airstrips in the Peruvian jungle are used for  the  landing and takeoff of light planes from the Colombian drug  "cartels," which pick up cocaine base shipments produced by  Peruvian drug trafficking gangs.</p>

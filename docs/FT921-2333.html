			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Observer: PVC peels off Whatever Cable and Wireless may pretend, the loss of Peter van Cuylenburg is a blow. True, 'PVC' will be easier to replace in his role as group director of C and W's OECD businesses than if he had still been running Mercury. But he gave the group style and vision that will be hard to reproduce. He is off to a smaller job  - albeit probably much better paid  - at Next Computer in California, and is both philosophical and complimentary about his new boss, Steve Jobs. The founder of both Apple Computer and Next, and the enfant terrible of the US computer industry, Jobs has never been easy to work with. John Scully, imported to give Apple strategic direction and management weight, solved the problem by taking control of the company himself. Is a similar coup likely at Next, an innovative computer company that has never fulfilled its promise? Van Cuylenburg says Jobs has matured, and thinks his persistence in a tough market admirable. But how far is PVC's move a reaction to being passed over for the top job at Cand W? Not at all, he says, adding that the chance to work with an imaginative computer software company is an unrepeatable opportunity. It will be a meeting of old Texas Instruments minds. Robb Wilmot, ex-head of TI in Britain and once ICL's managing director, recruited van Cuylenburg. Next week, the two of them plus Jobs will lunch in California to discuss Wilmot's possible contribution to Next's strategic planning.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / British Gas poised for clash with watchdog BRITISH GAS and Ofgas, the industry regulator, last night appeared to be heading for a confrontation over the rate of return the company should earn on its gas transportation business. Under an agreement with the Office of Fair Trading, British Gas is obliged to hive off its pipeline and storage business into a stand-alone company. British Gas insists the pipeline business should earn a rate of return of 10.8 per cent on new investment and 6.7 per cent on existing assets. Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas director-general, has several times made clear that he believes the current rate of return of 4.5 per cent should be sufficient for the new business, although Ofgas has not yet set an official figure. British Gas retorts that the 4.5 per cent rate was adopted as a short-term measure to encourage competition when the transportation business was opened to third party gas suppliers in 1989. When British Gas Transportation is separate, British Gas argues, it will operate as a unit with no cross-subsidies so that a higher rate will be necessary. British Gas yesterday submitted to Ofgas a study by Oxford Economic Research Associates and J Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank. It said the necessary rate of return was 6.7 per cent on existing assets, and 10.8 per cent on new investment. The study said that the rate was essential to: Enable British Gas to sustain the gas transmission and storage network. Ensure the company earns sufficient return on new investment to expand the network and invest in additional capacity. Create the incentive for an efficient system which provides gas transportation at the lowest cost. Establish a fair system for customers and shareholders with non-discriminatory prices and no cross-subsidies. Sir James was unavailable for comment yesterday. Ofgas said it had not reached any conclusions on an appropriate rate of return and would consider British Gas's submission together with its own research. Mr Philip Rogerson, managing director of group finance at British Gas, said: 'The key consideration is investment. If the reward were not great enough, we would not be able to make the investment required.' Outside analysts have also warned of the potentially damaging effect of setting too low a rate of return. However, analysts warn that British Gas's submission was 'unrealistic' compared with regulated rates of return for other utilities, which range between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.</p>

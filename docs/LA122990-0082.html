			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD ARRESTS SUGGEST IMMIGRATION TREND SHIFT  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents here arrested record numbers of undocumented  immigrants in the late fall and early winter, a trend that points to a shift  toward more year-round immigration, experts say.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have long viewed November and December as a relatively slow  period for illegal immigration. That period after the agricultural harvests is  a time when many undocumented foreign-born residents head south to visit  families left behind in Mexico and Central America.  </P> <P> But border guards in the San Diego area now record almost 1,000 arrests per day  -- a record pace for December.  </P> <P> The brisk pace comes after San Diego-based agents recorded 33,687 arrests in  November, an increase of 22% over November, 1989.  </P> <P> Officials trace the current winter upswing to a variety of factors, including  economic problems in Mexico and the increasing tendency of immigrants to  relocate permanently in the United States -- not just to work for a few months  and then return home in the classic migratory pattern.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're seeing as much of the so-called 'seasonal' immigration as  we used to see," said Ted Swofford, supervisory Border Patrol agent in San  Diego, the busiest site for legal and illegal traffic along the nearly  2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. "We're finding that people are coming 12 months  a year."  </P> <P> Agricultural laborers, whose treks to the United States tend to be seasonal,  now account for only about 15% of illicit border crossers, a much smaller  number than a decade ago, according to research at the UC San Diego Center for  U.S.-Mexican Studies and elsewhere. Immigrants now find work in a wide variety  of settings, from the fields to factories to construction sites.  </P> <P> Academic researchers on both sides of the border also have found that women and  children are increasingly making the voyage north, underlining the intention of  many new immigrants to remain in the United States permanently.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, everyone said they would come to the north for six or eight  months and then return to Mexico," said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, who heads an  immigration study center in Tijuana. "But now, the idea is to stay. People see  no economic alternative in Mexico. The Mexican government has done nothing to  provide them with alternatives."  </P></p>

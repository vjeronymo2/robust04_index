			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pfizer equity tumbles 7% as growth in sales slows Pfizer shares tumbled by more than 7 per cent yesterday as the US drugs group reported a sharp slowdown in sales growth in the final three months of 1993. Other pharmaceuticals stocks fell as investors anticipated a fall in sales. Pfizer, which had been growing faster than many other drugs groups as a result of successful drug launches, said sales in its core pharmaceuticals business rose by 6 per cent in the final quarter. In the previous three-month period, drug sales had achieved year-on-year growth of 13 per cent. The shares fell Dollars 5 to close at Dollars 62 7/8 . While some new drugs continued to grow fast, sales of Procardia XL, the hypertension treatment that is Pfizer's biggest-selling product, were 11 per cent lower than a year before, at Dollars 272m. Total sales for Procardia for the year were up 11 per cent at Dollars 1.18bn, while sales of all drugs rose 13 per cent in 1993 to Dollars 5.13bn. Pfizer said the slowdown reflected a move by drugs wholesalers to cut inventory levels, causing a one-off dip in sales. It also pointed to the 'timing of consumer health care trade promotions' during the latest period. These were one-off factors which would not dent sales growth in future, and prescription demand for its drugs remained strong, Pfizer said. Other areas saw a fall in income. Hospital products sales fell 4 per cent, while consumer healthcare products fell 2 per cent. While group sales for the quarter were only 2 per cent ahead, at Dollars 1.98bn, research and development spending rose 16 per cent to Dollars 286m. compared with a year before. As a result, operating income was just Dollars 5m higher, at Dollars 406m (before one-off items in 1992). Net income for the period rose to Dollars 289m, or 90 cents a share, from Dollars 279m, or 83 cents a year earlier. Full-year net income was Dollars 658m, or Dollars 2.05, after the effects of a Dollars 575m post-tax restructuring charge announced in the third quarter, compared with Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.25, before accounting changes in 1992.</p>

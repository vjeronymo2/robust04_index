			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Major admits Britain may miss Maastricht target date BRITAIN launched its six-month presidency of the European Community yesterday with a show of unity and co-operation between Mr John Major and Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. But a reminder of the political obstacles facing the Community emerged when Mr Major conceded for the first time that the UK may not complete ratification of the Maastricht treaty by the target date of the new year. At a joint Westminster news conference with Mr Delors, Mr Major pledged that Britain was determined to press ahead with the process after taking stock of the situation in the autumn. Then he added: 'It would be desirable to finish it by the end of the year, but it is not essential.' Mr Major's tacit admission of the risks posed by domestic political opposition came after a plenary meeting between the UK cabinet and the 17 EC Commissioners in London. It was followed by a series of bilateral meetings, including a private session between Mr Major and Mr Delors, focusing on the central problem of Denmark's rejection of the treaty. Underlining the spirit of conciliation, both Mr Major and Mr Delors confirmed their agreement that Denmark would succeed Britain, as scheduled, in the presidency in January, brushing aside suggestions that it was no longer eligible. Mr Delors, who refused to rise to the recent criticism from his old opponent, Lady Thatcher, said the Commission and the UK presidency were 'on the same side, with the same purpose to make progress and succeed'. At last weekend's Lisbon summit, the UK had tried unsuccessfully to avoid the ratification of Maastricht being made a formal precondition for the opening of enlargement talks with European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries. The compromise was that 'preparatory' talks could be held before ratification, but that 'official negotiations' could only begin afterwards. Yesterday, Mr Delors said there would be little difference in practice between 'preparatory' and 'official' talks with the Efta countries. He added that the Commission would soon deliver its formal opinions on the EC candidacy of Sweden, Finland and Switzerland, having already given a positive verdict on Austrian membership. Both Mr Major and Mr Delors emphasised the need for subsidiarity, or taking decisions in the EC at the lowest appropriate level. Mr Major said it should be 'enshrined as a natural part of the Community's instincts rather than as something to be wheeled out from time to time when it is convenient'. He conceded the potential conflict between the Community's two goals of forging a single, barrier-free market without national distortions and of giving national governments more say in the implementation of EC laws. Each issue, Mr Major said, would have to be examined to see 'whether the balance of advantage lay wholly with an unreconstructed single market or whether subsidiarity would have to take precedence'.

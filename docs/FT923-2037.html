			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Miyazawa backs use of public funds MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday insisted that public funds could be used to assist the troubled banking system, contradicting the Ministry of Finance, which says public funds will not be used. Meanwhile, the National Tax Administration Agency announced the relaxation of rules on the writing-off of bad loans. Banks will be able to claim as a loss any loans on which payments have not been made for a year, down from two years. Public support for ailing banks is a controversial issue, as previous suggestions that public funds would be used have prompted widespread complaints from ordinary Japanese, who argue that banks should take responsibility for their non-performing loans. Mr Miyazawa's open support for the use of public funds contrasts sharply with the policy statements of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, who has insisted that public funds will not be used in supporting the banking system. The government has been reviewing tax breaks and loan disclosure regulations relating to banks, as yesterday's announcement by the tax agency shows. Mr Hata has said a more detailed disclosure of non-performing loans will help to restore confidence in the banking system. In spite of the minister's statements, the finance ministry is studying overseas cases of support for troubled financial institutions, but ministry officals hint that a detailed public support programme will only be announced if the health of the banking system worsens in coming months.</p>

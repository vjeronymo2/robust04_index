			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Bitten by the bug - Why UK businesses are finding the BS 5750 quality standard increasingly catching It is something a biologist would recognise immediately: the highly effective strategy of the virus and the chain letter. Both have an in-built mechanism to make sure that whoever is at the receiving end of the 'message' passes it on to at least another five or six unfortunate souls. That way it spreads through the population at maximum speed. Tucked away in the quality assurance standard BS 5750, or BS EN ISO 9000 to give it its new official title, is a similar masterstroke: the requirement that every company seeking quality accreditation must have a purchasing procedure which examines the quality policies of its suppliers. As a result, a July poll by the Small Business Research Trust (SBRT) recorded a rapid rise in small business BS 5750 registrations. One in 10 had already registered and a further 31 per cent were planning to. Most of the companies registered because the business concerned felt under pressure to do so. As Reginald Shaughnessy, chairman of the committee responsible for ISO 9000 at the International Organisation for Standardisation, admits: 'Eighty-five per cent of the use of the standard is primarily for third-party supplier registration rather than a self-imposed internal system for quality effectiveness and continuous improvement.' That, complains David Martin, head of the trade and industry committee of the UK Federation of Small Businesses, means 'BS 5750 has almost become a licence to trade'. Viruses breed resistance, and this one is no exception. Criticisms among small businesses of BS 5750 are familiar. The charges include that it is too costly in terms of consultants' fees, management time and bureaucracy; it is unnecessary for smaller organisations where there are flatter lines of communication; it is manufacturing-based and not relevant to services; it is merely being used as a marketing tool; it is more of a consistency standard than a quality standard; it encourages an obsession with processes instead of customer focus. 'The whole approach of BS 5750 has a tendency to make you inward-looking. Using it you can produce lousy products very efficiently,' says Martin. 'A lot of our members say it is an absolute con-trick to force them to pay a hell of a lot of money to consultants.' These criticisms are by no means unanimous. According to the SBRT survey only firms with up to four employees are strongly against BS 5750, while 56 per cent of businesses employing 20-43 staff feel it is appropriate. In addition, a growing number of small to medium-sized service companies are discovering benefits. Peter Brown, operations director at market research company Harris, says BS 5750 helped the company cut rather than add to paperwork, while Jerry Wright, managing director at recruitment consultancy Michael Page, found that seeking accreditation forced him to improve the structure of job interviews. Likewise, Yorkshire-based advertising agency The Charles Walls Group discovered it needed to tighten up its training procedures. John Oldfield, group managing director, says: 'BS 5750 focuses the mind on processes that everybody takes for granted - and interprets differently. Anybody who says it is onerous is not running their business properly.' Criticisms are at last being slowly addressed. Since April the British Standards Institution has been applying a streamlined accreditation system for smaller companies which it claims is 'proving very successful'. More significantly, there are moves to change both the content and context within which BS EN ISO 9000 operates. ISO has embarked on a review - due in the next few years - which it says is far wider in scope. On its agenda is what Shaughnessy calls the 'flaw in application' where the accreditation badge is seen as more important than the commitment to total quality. Meanwhile, a European Commission paper called 'Elements of Quality Policy' is seeking to put ISO 9000 'back in perspective' as just a small part of TQM. In addition, a small but fast-growing band of blue chip companies, including parts of Exxon, Kodak, Unisys, Du Pont, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Southern Electric, have sought accreditation for an officially recognised extension to BS 5750 covering marketing, sales and customer service - an extension which its originator claims fills many of the gaps left by the current standard. At present, while BS 5750 has limited procedures for responding to customer complaints and aspects of sales, it does not force the business to answer fundamental marketing questions, says Ian Griffith, joint managing director of Marketing Quality Assurance, the recognised BS 5750 accreditor which developed the extension. The questions include how the company identifies customer needs; how it integrates these needs into a business plan; how that in turn is manifested in a marketing strategy; the procedures used to implement that strategy and the methods used to measure its success, including a measure of customer satisfaction. Griffith, who advised the DTI on its recent marketing initiative, says his experience of accrediting companies' marketing, sales and customer service functions reveals that small and large organisations share common failings, such as a lack of rigour in the gathering of customer information and feeding it into internal decision-making; a lack of agreed procedures for segmenting markets and products, and poor internal communications between marketers and other functions. A few smaller companies such as Michael Page and Yorkshire-based window fixings and fastenings firm WMS Group have already gained accreditation for their marketing and sales. Griffith is now working on creating specific guidelines for individual industry sectors, such as car dealers. However, whether the combined effect of such initiatives will succeed in winning the critics round remains a moot point, if only because experience of implementing BS 5750 varies so widely. As David Kent, WMS group chief executive and a self-proclaimed enthusiast of third-party accreditation schemes, says: 'It's very difficult to put financial numbers on it. It's like religion. You either believe in it, or you don't'</p>

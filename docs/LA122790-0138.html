			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RECOGNITION FOR MEALS PROGRAM  </P> <P> I feel that I need to clarify one point in the article on Project Understanding  (Dec. 5). The article made a passing reference to a meals program.  </P> <P> The program, which serves five meals each week, is called Family to Family.  </P> <P> It is staffed by volunteers and is supported by donations from these volunteers  and from the churches and groups which these volunteers represent. While  Project Understanding has worked closely with Family to Family since its  beginnings, it was not started by Project Understanding. Family to Family was  well established by the time it came under Project Understanding's umbrella in  1983.  </P> <P> I thought that, in fairness to the thousands of volunteers who have made Family  to Family the highly successful and efficient program that it is, this  clarification needed to be made.  </P> <P> RICK PEARSON  </P> <P> Executive Director,  </P> <P> Project Understanding  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Asia should pressure US to impose gun control"] </F>   [Text] As the Marrakech talks on the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) approach, developing countries are  becoming increasingly anxious. Many of their governments,  including Thailand's, fear the negotiations and the planned  creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) will be used to  pressure them into adopting labour, human rights and  environmental standards they consider inappropriate.    Their main fear is that any such move will damage their  economic competitiveness. Businesses in developing countries  often depend on cheap labour and lax environmental and labour  standards to keep their costs down, and their products cheap.  They see the move by the West to impose higher standards as a  sneaky way to protect its own industries.    They have a point. Protectionism is on the rise in the  developed world. But this is not the entire story.  <H5>  National sovereignty </H5>   Many consumers in the West are genuinely concerned that they  are purchasing products made at the expense of the environment  or the health of indigenous people (although they like cheap  products, too). In their own countries, they may have some say  over how such matters are protected, but the origin of imported  goods is usually a mystery. Hence another reason to push for  stricter enforcement of regulations abroad.    Governments in developing countries have responded by  complaining that their national sovereignty is being impinged.  But such talk will no longer do. "Free" trade is not really  free, it comes with a price.    Businesses appear eager to have their cake and eat it, too.  They want easy access to lucrative markets abroad but don't  want to face up to the realities which closer trade links  entail. Breaking down economic barriers inevitably means  breaking down political and social ones, too.    The European Union has recognized this. Its leaders realize  that economic union cannot be carried out without some kind of  political union. Nor would the North American Free Trade  Agreement have passed in the US without the side agreements on  labour and the environment.    With this in mind, we must all pay very close attention to  how the World Trade Organization develops. As Gatt expands and  deepens, the WTO could well form the beginnings of a kind of  world government, one which could conceivably gain greater  powers than the United Nations.    As it stands, the WTO is not terribly accountable. Its  representatives are appointed by governments and bureaucrats.  It should be democratized, perhaps by creating a sister  organization whose members are elected directly by the people,  as with the European Parliament.    Our government should certainly continue defending our right  to make our own decisions. But sooner or later, all the  countries which sign the Gatt -- or any free trade agreement,  including Afta [ASEAN Free Trade Area] -- will have to realize  that acceding to the treaty will mean sacrificing national  sovereignty on some issues. If we don't like it, then we  shouldn't sign.    Of course, compromise must cut both ways. The US may well be  justified in demanding, say, that Japan and Norway halt their  whaling activities or that China stop using prison labour. But  we in Asia also have a right to examine America's internal  affairs.    One point which stands out is the widespread availability of  guns in the US. Many Americans seem to believe they have a  God-given, or at least a constitutionally ordained, right to own  a deadly weapon. Some might say this is their own business. But  it affects us in Asia, too.  <H5>  Japanese students </H5>   The latest instance was the case of two Japanese students  gunned down in a Los Angeles [LA] parking lot. The incident  created a public uproar in Japan, so much so the US ambassador  felt the need to officially apologize on behalf of the United  States government. The Japanese should consider themselves  lucky; the US government rarely apologizes to governments of  other foreigners gunned down in the States -- although it did  express regret when Thai monks were murdered in Arizona several  years ago -- much less to its own people for allowing weapons to  be so easily available.    This is not the only way in which America's gun policy, or  lack thereof, has affected foreigners. The gun used to  assassinate Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio  was traced back to LA. Who knows how many guns are bought in  the States and then exported for murder abroad? Defenders of  the United States' liberal gun laws say that gun control won't  work, that it will only affect law-abiding citizens. But that's  because it has barely been tried. The US government is too  easily swayed by powerful anti-gun-control lobbies. Asian  countries would be doing Americans and the world a favour by  pushing for stronger weapons laws in the States.    This is just one example to show that many issues are no  longer simply national in scope, but made international with the  advent of ever freer trade. Rather than fighting the trend  towards greater regulatory cooperation, we should try to work  with it.</p>

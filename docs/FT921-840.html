			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown 'would give more to poor' LIBERAL DEMOCRAT Budget plans would 'give' far more to the poorest members of society than the Labour or Conservative proposals, but at the expense of middle-income earners, the Institute for Fiscal Studies reported yesterday. The independent research body said virtually all families with incomes of less than Pounds 50 a week would gain between Pounds 8 and Pounds 9 a week if the Liberal Democrat plans became law. This would compare with additional spending power of between Pounds 3 and Pounds 4 a week for this income group under Labour, and gains averaging just Pounds 1 under the Tories. However, at income levels of more than Pounds 100 a week the majority of UK families would start to lose under a Liberal Democrat chancellor, while most families with incomes up to Pounds 500 a week would gain under Labour. At the very top income levels - above Pounds 1,000 a week - the losses from the Liberal Democrat plan would be smaller than under Labour's shadow Budget. The IFS said the bias in the Liberal Democrat package towards low incomes reflects the party's generous plans for pensioners and single under-25-year-olds on income support. The Liberal Democrats plan to spend Pounds 4.4bn more on state pensions, against Pounds 2.3bn under Labour, on average making married pensioners Pounds 11 a week better off and giving single pensioners Pounds 6 more a week. Under Labour, the equivalent figures would be Pounds 7 and Pounds 5 a week, while the government in its March 10 Budget announced increases of Pounds 3 and Pounds 2 for couples and single pensioners on income support.

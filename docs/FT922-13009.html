			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: GWR coal offshoots file for Chapter 11 GREAT WESTERN Resources, the beleaguered oil and gas group in litigation with its once-largest coal customer, yesterday announced that its coal subsidiaries had filed for protection under the Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The application will allow GWR to shift the jurisdiction on its legal battle from South Carolina, where it is in dispute with South Carolina Public Services Authority, the state public utility, to its home state of Texas. Mr Howard Wolf, chairman of GWR, said the decision to file for Chapter 11 would speed up the outcome of a battle which has already lasted 18 months. SCPSA, commonly known as Santee Cooper, disputes the validity of contracts with Great Western's coal companies, and is claiming Dollars 60m (Pounds 35m) in damages. It has already had Dollars 33m in coal payments to GWR attached by South Carolina courts. Under US law, the Houston bankruptcy courts will now take over the legal proceedings, and decide whether the Dollars 60m claim is appropriate. Mr Wolf said a ruling on the amount of the Santee Cooper claim was expected 'within months . . . We will use the amount that the bankruptcy court assigns as a key element of our reorganisation plans'. Mr Wolf said the company had not made contingency plans in case the ruling was in favour of Santee Cooper's Dollars 60m claim. 'It is like planning for the planet Earth to be struck by a meteorite,' he said. 'It is so unlikely to come to pass that we haven't devoted any significant time to deal with it.' The company expected to present the court with its reorganisation schedule for the coal companies within the next 60 to 90 days. Mr Wolf said the decision to move the subsidiary into Chapter 11 had been taken after extensive consultation with the parent company's creditors who are owed a total of about Dollars 70m.</p>

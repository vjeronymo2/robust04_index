			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: BCH drops 19.5% halfway Banco Central Hispano (BCH), the Spanish banking group, posted a 19.5 per cent first-half fall in its net consolidated profits, to Pta29.3bn (Dollars 225.8m). However, it claimed it was strengthening its balance sheet and improving the core banking business. In contrast, Argentaria, the partially-privatised state-controlled banking group which rivals BCH in terms of assets, raised its net income by 10.1 per cent, to Pta47.4bn, against the first half of 1993. It attributed the rise to lowered provisions and a 25.9 per cent increase, to Pta30.5bn, in revenue from fees and commissions. In common with other banks, both suffered from the impact of the sharp drop in interest rates and a resulting squeeze on margins. Argentaria raised its net interest income by 1.6 per cent, to Pta115.9bn, while BCH's interest income remained flat at Pta153.1bn. BCH, which has the largest domestic branch network, still has to develop the cross-selling techniques which have allowed Argentaria and other banks to raise operating profits. Income from fees and commissions at BCH fell 2.8 per cent to Pta40.6bn, although increased income from its equity portfolio, and tight cost controls, helped raise the operating profit by 3.3 per cent to Pta63.8bn. Argentaria's operating profit was up by 14.1 per cent to Pta65.4bn. The net profit total gained further from a 4.9 per cent fall, to Pta44.7bn, in provisioning allocations. BCH, which has had its asset quality questioned by rating agencies since the begining of this year, was, however, forced to put aside Pta81.7bn in provisions, 42.9 per cent more than in the first half of last year. These allocations raised the group's coverage for bad and doubtful debts from 58 per cent to 62 per cent. The provisions came in spite of the fact it realised Pta27.5bn through the recovery of non-performing loans. This indicates the incipient domestic recovery is raising the quality of its assets. Argentaria's results could prompt the government, which sold 50 per cent of the equity last year, to reduce its stake further. The bank's continuing strength is also likely to fuel speculation that it will acquire a medium-sized domestic bank to bolster its comparatively small branch network.</p>

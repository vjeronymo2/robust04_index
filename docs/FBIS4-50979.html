			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186): "Why the </F> `Foreign Moon' Is No Longer Round--An Analysis of  Foreign-Invested Enterprises' Losses"]    [Text] The "Foreign Moon" Is Not Completely Round    Several days ago, a friend told me that a joint-venture  cosmetics company in Shanghai had incurred a serious loss. I  was indeed astonished to hear this. The pride of Shanghai's  joint-venture enterprises, this company manufactures products  that sell very quickly; why has it fallen into such a  predicament?    This is not the only example. A medical equipment company in  southern China, about which foreign businessmen had been  optimistic, recently incurred a loss. Everyone was baffled upon  hearing the news.    The first joint-venture enterprise emerged in China in 1980,  and there are more than 100,000 foreign-invested enterprises in  the country. The direct introduction of foreign capital totals  tens of billions of U.S. dollars, presenting a scene of rivalry  for supremacy and playing an important role in China's economic  life. Statistics show that the per capita output value, per  capita profit and tax, as well as the labor productivity of  foreign-invested enterprises are higher than those of  Chinese-funded enterprises. Foreign-invested enterprises have  introduced capital, technology, and advanced management methods  and operational forms. This is why the people in many  state-owned enterprises say: The "moon" imported from abroad is  indeed rounder than our "moon"!    But it is hard to understand that, following the increase in  investments, the "foreign moon" is no longer "round": Some  foreign-invested enterprises have incurred losses each year and  seem to have an uncertain future.  <H5>  Are They Really Incurring Losses or Are They Pretending To </H5> Suffer From Losses?    The losses incurred by foreign-invested enterprises can be  classified as follows:    The first are normal losses. Over the last few years, a  large number of foreign-invested enterprises have started their  business in China, accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the total  number of enterprises in operation. These enterprises have just  started operation (such as running hotels), so they are still in  a debt repayment and trial production period. In addition, some  foreign investors have had ambitions that were too great when  they arrived in China, like a "tiger wanting to eat the sky,"  and their mistakes in finding markets has also affected the  development and sales of their products. These enterprises  account for about half of the loss-incurring enterprises, a case  similar to that in developed countries.    The second is abnormal losses, which are mainly as follows:    Losses in accounting. Some people say: "State-owned  enterprises have purposely reduced their losses, whereas  foreign-invested enterprises have purposely exaggerated their  losses." These remarks are not unreasonable. Last year only 25  percent of the foreign-invested enterprises in Beijing incurred  losses, but they exaggerated it to 50 percent. To fully take  advantage of the preferential policy of "two exemptions, three  reductions," some foreign-invested enterprises have regarded the  profit-making year as a loss-incurring year to evade taxes. A  strange situation has even emerged in which some enterprises  have registered consecutive losses or zero profits, but, in  pooling capital, they keep increasing their investment and  recruiting more employees. In 1987 a Xiamen joint-venture  company's investment was $900,000, and its current assets amount  to 100 million yuan, but the company has been infamous for its  longstanding "losses."    Losses caused by profit transfers. Wholly-owned  foreign-invested enterprises account for about 20 percent of the  total number of foreign-invested enterprises. Some wholly-owned  foreign-invested enterprises (mostly Hong Kong and Taiwan  invested enterprises) have made tacit agreements with  enterprises outside the country by taking advantage of their  imports and exports. When importing raw materials and  equipment, they raise the prices on the import declaration  forms; when exporting finished products, they reduce the prices  on the export declaration forms, and sell the products outside  the country at high prices. This transfers the profits to  regions outside the country. Foreign businessmen in some  joint-venture enterprises also resort to this "clandestine"  method of transferring profits which should have been shared by  both sides, leaving losses for the joint-venture enterprises.  Foreign businessmen in some joint-venture enterprises introduce  obsolete or poor-quality equipment at high prices, so that, the  higher the prices, the more percentage of shares they hold, and  the higher profits they enjoy. Moreover, high-priced equipment  has caused an increase in the enterprises' production costs and  a decrease in their profits. This also constitutes a loss.    Losses due to operation and management. Quite a number of  small and medium joint-venture enterprises do not have clear  management responsibility or duties. Only when there is a  purchase order will the director of the foreign side appear; on  ordinary occasions, he will not. So some enterprises cannot  even hold board of directors meetings, and only temporary  measures are applied to daily operations, thus causing  operational confusion and a decline in economic returns. Some  foreign investors in China have merged their offices with the  joint-venture enterprises, causing large-scale operations and  low output. In this case, these enterprises have inevitably  incurred losses. Some representatives of the Chinese side let  the joint-venture enterprises take charge of the workers'  welfare, but personnel from outside the country working in these  enterprises have major expenses. Such a person in a Shanghai or  Guangzhou joint-venture enterprise requires at least $150,000 a  year for his salary and daily expenses. Some foreign investors  force the joint-venture enterprises to pay the expenses of their  mother companies.    Furthermore, some foreign-invested enterprises have rushed  to  start their operations with obsolete equipment and inadequate  funds. It is difficult for them to carry out technical  transformation or update the equipment, and this has resulted in  delays in their production and operations and has finally caused  losses.  <H5>  The "Foreign Moon" Is Also a Moon </H5>   Foreign-invested enterprises constitute a vital force in the  national economy and whether they incur losses or make profits  affects the entire process of utilizing foreign capital. On the  whole, though some foreign-invested enterprises are incurring  losses, they are not as serious as some people imagine. Some of  these enterprises are improving, and we should soberly  understand and appraise this situation. Press reports over the  last few days indicate that 80 percent of the 4,000-odd  foreign-invested enterprises operating in Shanghai are making  profits.    As a matter of fact, there are complicated factors causing  the foreign-invested enterprises to incur losses. "Paying  learning fees" in the course of introducing foreign capital is  inevitable. Most of the foreign investors in China are abiding  by the principle of "mutual benefit," but some of them are  playing tricks to make exorbitant profits by taking advantage of  the Chinese side's eagerness to introduce foreign capital and  its lack of experience in international economic cooperation.  The most important thing is that we should acknowledge this  fact: The "foreign moon" is also a moon. When providing a  preferential policy, we should be bold in "closing the  loopholes" in all areas. Only thus will both sides make common  development and will enterprises thrive.    Tax evasion generally exists in the world (particularly in  transnational corporations). Tax evasion bears a strong nature  of concealment and "rationality." Tax reductions or evasions  can be achieved by filing false reports on "losses." Raising  the prices of low-price raw materials imported from abroad and  transferring profits are common commercial methods. How should  we fully utilize foreign capital and ensure the state's and  enterprises' profits?    An expert has pointed out that, on one hand, we should  improve the relevant foreign-related policies and tax laws so  that there no loopholes; on the other, we should improve the  quality of the Chinese side's personnel, gather information on  the international market situation (such as the buying and  selling prices of commodities) and customers (such as conducting  inquiries, surveys, or asset appraisals), establish intelligence  or information networks with Chinese organizations stationed  abroad or accounting offices which have business relations with  China, to promptly close loopholes and reduce losses. In  particular, qualified accountant offices or other authoritative  organizations should be invited to appraise the material  invested as stock by foreign businessmen, to avoid being led by  the nose by foreign businessmen.    The management and operation of foreign-invested enterprises  should be gradually standardized, with a focus on the cautious  selection of construction projects to be carried out, to prevent  errors and mistakes. The introduction of unmarketable products  or equipment should not be approved. We should not be  overanxious for quick results in enterprises whose conditions  are not yet mature. We should factually determine the  expenditure standards for managerial personnel, establish a  supervisory system, and train a number of foreign sales  professionals and accountants for the Chinese side. In the  course of operation, we should strictly practice the principle  of "jointly undertaking risks and commonly enjoying profits" and  prevent enterprises from "incurring losses without cause."    Of course, cooperation in all fields is necessary to change  the situation of losses in foreign-invested enterprises.</p>

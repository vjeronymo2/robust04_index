			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Venables given deadline on costs THE HIGH COURT yesterday gave Mr Terry Venables three weeks to put up Pounds 300,000 'security for costs' as a condition of being allowed to proceed with his legal attempt to seize control of Tottenham Hotspur from chairman Mr Alan Sugar. If Mr Venables fails to pay the money by August 19 his pending plea for the right to buy out Mr Sugar's shareholding will be halted. Continued failure to pay after that deadline would allow Mr Sugar's lawyers to apply to have the action dismissed. Yesterday's order was won by Mr Sugar, his holding company Amshold and Tottenham Hotspur, who claimed that the financial state of Edennote, Mr Venables's company, was such that it would not be able to meet their costs in the event of their winning the case.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Observer: Tongue-tied Meanwhile there's a certain reflection of Oscar Wilde in yesterday's report on improving the EC's public image. It was Wilde, of course, who depicted foxhunters as 'the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable'. Besides criticising the European Commission for using obscure language, the report advises against trying to explain the Maastricht treaty to the populace because 'treaty decisions are far too technical and too removed from daily life for people to understand'. A case of 'the incomprehensible in retreat from the inexplicable'.</p>

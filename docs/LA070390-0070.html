			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: BRUSSELS;  </P> <P> MORE AID FOR EASTERN EUROPE  </P> <P> Foreign ministers of 24 of the world's richest nations are expected to expand  their program of economic aid for the democratizing regimes of eastern Europe  during a meeting on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Originally, the so-called Group of 24 -- including the nations of Western  Europe plus Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, and the United States --  planned to assist only Hungary and Poland. But now Czechoslovakia almost  certainly will be added to the list, and Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia may  also get help.  </P> <P> East Germany, now under Bonn's economic wing, will not figure in the talks. But  Western aid for Moscow -- advocated by France and West Germany while so far  opposed in Washington -- may come up.  </P></p>

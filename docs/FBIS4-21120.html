			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Attack Launched Against Drug Use"] </F>   [Text] Chiefs of law enforcement agencies in  Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast have long warned of the fact that the  region is becoming a raw material base for drug addicts and  traffickers from both Ukraine and the CIS. The number of people  using drugs (primarily youths) or entering the narcotics  business is increasing. The directive "On the Program of  Combating Drug Abuse and Illegal Circulation of Drugs in the  Oblast for 1994-1997" issued by Vasyl Pavlyk, the president's  representative in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, is intended to counter  this vice.    In particular, the program provides for the regular holding  of prevention operations code-named "Poppy" and "Doping," which  are designed to detect and stem channels through which drugs and  psychotropic substances are entering illegal circulation.    Considerable attention is being attached to procedures to  prevent young people from getting involved with narcotics. In  addition to awareness programs, it is also planned to ensure  proper opportunities for young people to utilize their leisure  time. The question of returning education and training  facilities rented to private enterprises and organizations will  be considered.    It is also expected that the sore problem of isolating drug  addicts will be resolved. A specialized facility will be  established this year in Ivano-Frankovsk, and it will have  separate wards for compulsory confinement of drug addicts and  minors using drugs.</p>

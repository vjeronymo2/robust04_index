			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of a written interview with Japanese Prime </F> Minister Tsutomu Hata by TONG-A ILBO reporter Pae In-chun on 8  June]    [Text] [Pae In-chun] In relation to Japan's security  policy, what changes have there been in the interpretation of  the so-called peace constitution?    [Tsutomu Hata] I have no intention of changing the present  constitutional interpretation of security policy. Regarding the  issue of collective right to self defense, for example, as long  as Japan is a sovereign state, it is reasonable for Japan to  have the collective right to self-defense according to  international law. However, exercising the right to self defense  as stipulated in Article 9 of the constitution (giving up war,  not bearing arms, and rescinding the right to aggression) must  be carried out within the limits of at least defending Japan.  Since exercising collective self-defense exceeds this limit,  the government thus concluded that from the standpoint of the  constitution, it was not allowed.    [Pae] What is Japan's basic position on its international  role?    [Hata] Currently, Japan has emerged as a country exercising  great influence in international society. To establish a new  peace order, it is inevitable for Japan to carry out its role  and responsibilities commensurate with it. From this point of  view, I feel that Japan must carry out various international  contributions such as making efforts to solve environmental  issues, resolving regional disputes, managing arms, promoting  disarmament, and taking part in UN peacekeeping activities.  Furthermore, we must also carry out sufficient organizational  work to successfully accomplish these works.    [Pae] What is the basic position of Japan's diplomacy toward  the ROK?    [Hata] Promoting friendly relations with the ROK is one of  the most important pillars of Japan's diplomatic policy. To  further develop ROK-Japan relations under this kind of  understanding, I believe that it is important to establish a  future-oriented relationship by facing the facts of history. To  achieve this, exchange among figures from various circles of  both countries must be promoted so as to enhance mutual  understanding and promote cooperation in the international  society.    [Pae] How do you plan on concluding the issues related to  our past?    [Hata] We must newly recognize that our country's past act  of aggression and colonial rule brought about great suffering  and unhappiness to the people and convey this to our next  generations. We must deeply reflect on the past, and I hope that  based on this, we will be able to create peace and build a  bright future in the Asia-Pacific region. The issue concerning  the right to claim assets between our peoples and countries was  completely and ultimately resolved through the economic  cooperation agreement on the right to claims. However, in  consideration of the character of the issue, the comfort women  issue is currently being examined for achieving the quickest  solution to this issue.    [Pae] What is Japan's position regarding U.S.-Japan  relations?    [Hata] U.S.-Japan relations are most important for both  countries. The two countries have played a core role in  securing peace and prosperity in the world since the end of the  Cold War. From the political and security point of view, we will  continue to adhere to the U.S.-Japan security treaty based on  the U.S.-Japan allied relationship and make further efforts to  operate it more smoothly. In coordinating various important  diplomatic issues including the issue of developing nuclear  weapons by North Korea, and issues in the Asia-Pacific region,  we will work to closely exchange views. We will carry out  courageous economic reform with sovereignty in expanding the  opening of the market and significantly curtailing the current  account surplus.</p>

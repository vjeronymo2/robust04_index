			<p>BFN     [Text] Teplice nad Becvou, north Moravia, May 6 (CTK) --  The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would continue its effort to  cut the number of members in local representative bodies by  one-third to one-half and to apply the proportional system in  local elections, spokeswoman Jana Petrova said today. Speaking  after a session of the ODS Executive Council, she said: "We are  afraid that our deputies' group will be one of the few to be  asserting the system because it is not advantageous for small  parties." Local elections are to take place in November.    Petrova said that the working principles of the ODS election  program had been drafted. The party will turn to the  independent candidates who are famous personalities in  particular communities because independents' participation in  politics was "beneficial," she added. "Presently we are  selecting an agency for local elections because good candidates  having a good program must be sold well," Petrova said.    The ODS is the strongest parliamentary party with 66 out of  a  total of 200 seats. Its chairman is Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It is likely that Japan will send only Labor  Minister Chikara Sakaguchi to the ministerial talks on  employment (the job summit) of seven industrialized nations  including Japan, the United States, and Europe. The ostensible  reason given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura is  that the summit will be held during the House of  Representatives' Budget Committee session, and "we cannot delay  deliberations on the budget by sending three or four people to  it." But it appears that ministries and agencies are actually  reluctant to send their ministers because they think the summit  might turn into an arena for Japan-bashing by other nations  because of Japan's huge trade surplus.    The job summit will be held in Detroit 14-15 March to  discuss  ways to deal with the seven nations' common problem of  unemployment. From the United States, which is the host nation,  seven cabinet members including President Bill Clinton and Vice  President Alvin Gore will attend the summit. The six nations  other than Japan have decided to send their finance ministers  and labor ministers. Initially, the Japanese Government thought  about sending its finance minister, labor minister,  international trade and industry minister, and director general  of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. It is now feared  (according to a source in the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry [MITI]) that because Japan is the country with the  lowest unemployment rate among the participating summit nations,  it is likely the other nations will levy demands on Japan like  those for market liberalization and expanded domestic demand.  Furthermore, since the venue of the summit is the auto industry  town of Detroit, "The United States will try to put pressure on  Japan in connection with the suspended Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks," according to these views.    This means that if the MITI minister, who is in charge of  negotiations in the auto sector, wants to participate in the  summit, he must have something to offer. But MITI is in the  process of hurriedly working on measures, and the minister  cannot present something which is only half complete. The frank  position of MITI is that its minister should not go there, if  possible.    The EPA, on the other hand, is worried that, "although our  basic position is that we want to send our minister, if the MITI  minister does not participate, then our minister will become the  target of criticism instead." The Ministry of Finance has no  intention of sending either its finance minister or deputy vice  minister, and will send only a deputy chief of the International  Finance Bureau.    But there are also concerns (in the Foreign Ministry and the  Labor Ministry) that if Japan does not send ministers to the  summit, "it will only incite criticism against Japan." On 8  March, officials of the Labor Ministry were close to obtaining  support from the Liberal Democratic Party [as published] on  sending the labor minister to the United States. The Foreign  Ministry itself says "there has been no final decision made,"  but it appears the best that will happen is to send one minister  -- the labor minister.</p>

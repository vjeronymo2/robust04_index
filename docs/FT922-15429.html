			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / W Midlands sees some recovery A GROWING proportion of manufacturing companies in the West Midlands have reported an increase in both home and export orders for the fourth quarter in succession, a survey by the region's chambers of commerce shows. The same is true for service companies on the domestic market, but the proportion experiencing a rise in export orders fell in the first quarter of this year after three successive quarterly increases. The survey covered the performance of almost 450 companies, split nearly evenly between the manufacturing and service sectors. Membership is strongly weighted towards small and medium-sized companies.</p>

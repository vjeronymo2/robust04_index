			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Telefonica of Argentina thrives TELEFONICA de Argentina, Argentina's largest privatised telephone company, has almost doubled its profits, according to Mr Jose Bustamante, the company's president. He said preliminary figures showed an 88 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 222m for the year to September, against Dollars 118m in 1991. He added that sales rose more slowly, to Dollars 1.63bn against Dollars 1.037bn last year. Telefonica, which is managed by Telefonica Internacional, an arm of Spain's state-owned telephone company, was privatised in November 1991. It has a monopoly on services to the southern region of Argentina, including half of Buenos Aires, for at least seven years. Profits have climbed due to indexation of rates and an exchange rate that further magnifies profits. However, the 1991 figures are slightly understated because they cover an 11-month accounting period. Telefonica, like Telecom Argentina, the smaller privatised company which covers the northern half of the country, has also raised profits by tightening up management, sacking employees and rapidly installing more lines. But, despite high charges and aggressive investment policies, service remains mediocre. Telecom, which has not made any preliminary statement on its 1992 performance, is expected to report an even stronger rise in net income. Telecom's profits rose to Dollars 117.3m in the first three quarters of the year on sales of Dollars 862m, against Dollars 53.3m in the 11 months to September 1991 on sales of Dollars 880m.</p>

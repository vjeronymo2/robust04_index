			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Khartoum, 22 May (SUNA) -- The government  delegation to peace talks in Nairobi with the rebel factions  arrived in Khartoum on Sunday [22 May] morning. Mr. Muhammad  al-Amin Khalifah, speaker of the Transitional National Assembly  [TNA] and head of the delegation to the peace talks, confirmed  that the government is seriously committed to achieving a just  and long-lasting peace with the rebel movement at the next round  of talks, scheduled to be held on 18 July.    Mr. Khalifah told reporters upon arrival at Khartoum airport  that the current round of talks was designed to discuss basic  issues of the conflict, but the delay by three days of the  arrival of the rebel factions prevented a detailed examination  of these issues. [passage omitted] Mr. Khalifah stressed the  need for contacts to continue between the government and the  rebel movement, as that is the way to consolidate confidence  between the two sides.

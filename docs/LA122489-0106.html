			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR TRAIN DEPOT  </P> <P> Don't save the Del Mar station is my answer to Mr. Paul Frankel ("Limited  Service Makes Sense for Del Mar Depot," Dec. 11).  </P> <P> It seemed as though your city fathers let you all down when they took the stand  against any new station being built in Del Mar.  </P> <P> The technical advisory committee I was on offered five locations, none of which  was to their liking. Now they are singing the "Blues in the Night" on how the  station's loss would create a hardship on your fair city. Maybe it's a time for  a change of those at the helm.  </P> <P> Incidentally, the new Solana Beach station will be closer to the race track  than the old one is. Also, the new station will serve Rancho Santa Fe, Solana  Beach and Del Mar more efficiently. The commuter rail system is designed to  help eliminate some of the congestion on our highways and byways, reduce some  of our smaze (smoke and haze) that comes from slow drivers in small towns and  idling cars on the freeways.  </P> <P> And did you know that Oceanside's rail station is only one block from the  beautiful, sparkling Pacific Ocean, with the longest pier on the coast? We are  all for the new rail system and the new station in Solana Beach.  </P> <P> LYNN GARDENER  </P> <P> Oceanside representative  </P> <P> Technical Advisory Committee, Commuter Rail  </P></p>

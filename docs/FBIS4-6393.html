			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- More than 100 university  students protesting U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's  visit stormed into the Defense Ministry compound on Wednesday.  The protest occurred around 1:20 PM, when Perry entered a  second-floor conference room in the main building for talks with  his Korean counterpart, Yi Pyong-tae, after reviewing an honor  guard in the ministry compound.    Perry arrived here Tuesday to discuss problems related to  beefing up Seoul's defense against possible North Korean attack  with South Korean Government leaders.    The students, shouting anti-American slogans, demonstrated  in  front of the ministry's main building for about 30 minutes  before they were forcibly dispersed by riot police.    It was the first time that student protesters have entered  the Defense Ministry compound. Military police guarding were  unable to stop the students when they moved into the compound  through the vehicle gate, witnesses said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Response to ANPR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the ANPR, the Commission received more than 2,100 written comments from individuals, firms, and organizations. Comments were received from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and from United States citizens living abroad (3), (6). More than 95 percent of these comments favored modification of the standards to exempt some or all children's sleepwear garments from their requirements. More than one-third of all comments received in response to the ANPR were in the form of prepared letters with space for the commenter's name, or letters that were identical in their wording (3), (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The significant issues raised by those comments and the Commission's assessment of those issues is set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Should Consumers Be Able To Purchase Non-Complying Sleepwear Garments if They Desire?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments express the view that consumers should be able to purchase children's sleepwear which does not meet the flammability requirements of the children's sleepwear standards_ specifically, children's sleepwear made from untreated 100 percent cotton_rather than garments which are manufactured to comply with the children's sleepwear standards if they choose to do so. Many of these comments state that parents are the parties with primary responsibility for their children's safety. A large number of comments from consumers stated that parents prefer to dress their children in cotton garments for sleeping. Reasons given for preferring untreated 100 percent cotton sleepwear include lower price, increased comfort to the wearer, and the avoidance of skin irritation or unpleasant odors which some comments assert are associated with certain man-made fabrics or fabrics with flame-retardant treatment. Some of these comments express the view that both children's sleepwear standards should be revoked in their entirety (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments express the view that the government has a duty to establish mandatory safety requirements to protect children from risks of death and serious injury, and that consumer preference must yield to mandatory requirements needed to protect children from serious burn hazards (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some comments urge the Commission to extend the flammability requirements of the children's sleepwear standards to cover other children's garments_specifically garments made from light-weight fabrics and long underwear (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission observes that section 4 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1193) authorizes the agency to issue or amend mandatory requirements for the flammability of wearing apparel only when such requirements are `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> needed to adequately protect the public  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> unreasonable risk of the occurrence of fire  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> leading to death, injury, or significant property damage.'' (Emphasis added.) If a flammability standard has been issued under the FFA to address an unreasonable risk of fire deaths or injuries associated with a particular type or class of garments, that standard cannot be amended or revoked solely to accommodate consumer preference for noncomplying garments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, section 4 of the FFA further requires that in order to issue or amend a standard, the Commission must find, among other things, that the standard or amendment is ``limited'' to include only those garments which have been determined to present an ``unreasonable risk'' of burn deaths or injuries, or significant property damage. Consequently, if the coverage of the children's sleepwear standards currently includes garments which do not present an unreasonable risk of fire leading to death, injury, or significant property damage, the Commission concludes that the scope of the standards could be narrowed to remove those garments from the coverage of the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the same reasons, a flammability standard cannot be broadened to include other types of garments unless the Commission finds that those other types of garments present an ``unreasonable risk'' of fire resulting in death, injury, or significant property damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the course of this rulemaking proceeding, the Commission has reviewed information about burn injuries and deaths associated with children's sleepwear garments and other types of children's clothing since 1980. On average, each year about four children younger than fifteen years of age died from fires associated with clothing of all types (10).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

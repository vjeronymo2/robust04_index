			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen opposition, which understands that  Chechnya's leadership will not voluntarily refuse from power,  does not rule out that coercive methods can be used to solve the  conflict, the headquarters of the opposition situated in the  republic's Nadterechny region reported to Interfax Tuesday.  They made it clear that the political forces opposing President  Dzhokhar Dudayev would resort to coercive measures only in case  that the official formations in Groznyy are the first to use  arms.    A representative of the headquarters who preferred to stay  anonymous declared that last Sunday the opposition manage to  conduct its congress in the regional center of Znamenskoe. As  many as 2500 delegates were present at the congress.    However, as Groznyy reports, the opposition's congress was  disrupted because the majority of those invited to the congress  boycotted it.    Meanwhile, the congress' delegate Ruslan Martagov told our  Interfax correspondent that the congress took place despite a  tough confrontation on the part of Groznyy.    In his words, the congress urged that Chechen President  Dzhokhar Dudayev and Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev should  immediately resign and the republic's parliament should pass a  decision on democratic elections. According to the opposition,  this decision should be adopted before June 15 and then the  parliament should announce about its self-disbandment.    As the opposition believes, new elections should be held not  later than August 1994. The authorities should release all  political prisoners and transfer all authorities to the  Temporary Council of the Chechen Republic being created by the  opposition.    The resolution adopted by the congress underlines that the  Temporary Council created in winter 1994 takes all the functions  of the representative power until the time of the new elections.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG MIX  </P> <P> We recognize the complaints against cultural institutions, which sometimes  frustrate rather than encourage working artists ("A Theater of Cultural  Diversity?" by Victor Valle). But our experience with Plaza de la Raza has been  positive. As an emerging comedy troupe, we asked for Plaza's support; it found  merit in our work and gave us access to their fine rehearsal facilities.  </P> <P> LUISA LESCHIN, ARMANDO MOLINA, RICK NAJERA, DIANE RODRIGUEZ  </P> <P> Latins Anonymous  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

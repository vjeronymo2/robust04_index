			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah </F> by unidentified WAKALAT AL-ANBA' AL-DUWALIYAH correspondent;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] There is a  political aspect to the Lebanese Forces' open security file and  their political line. Do you have any comment?    [Nasrallah] We adopted many clear stances immediately after  the government's measures, with official statements and on other  occasions. We expressed more than a little satisfaction with  the security measures taken against the Lebanese Forces. I  remember it was said at the time that the action to purge  Lebanon of the Israeli groups should have been taken long ago.  This is so because the presence of any Israeli political group  in Lebanon is a threat to Lebanon, its unity, security, and  stability, and to the coexistence of its various sects and  factions.    We know that the Israeli plan in Lebanon and the region  seeks  sedition and division as a prelude to Israel's control of all  the region's resources. Our view on this is clear. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] What is the political picture in view of the  negotiations? What is wanted is the head of the Resistance as a  primary condition for ending Israel's occupation of Lebanon.    [Nasrallah] We discussed negotiations often. We said we do  not believe these negotiations will produce results, at least  not in the foreseeable future. All the optimism that prevailed  after the Geneva summit between President al-Asad and Clinton  diminished as the days passed. We even noticed in the past  weeks that the daily political commentaries carried by Syrian  newspapers and Damascus radio and television, as well as  statements by Syrian officials, were very clear in accusing the  U.S. Administration of abandoning many of its obligations  undertaken at the Geneva summit.    Obviously the United States cannot be an impartial mediator  in the settlement process. Obviously the Israeli enemy is not  willing to give even the minimum in convincing concessions to  the Syrian side.    In the negotiating process, there is a very big difference  between a man like Yasir 'Arafat and one like President al-Asad.  'Arafat is ready to make concessions unconditionally and he does  this every day. As for President al-Asad, he is a different  person. From the beginning he defined and adhered to a series of  principles despite difficult world and regional pressures and  circumstances.    Israel's intransigence over imposing a truce and settlement  fully compatible with its conditions and the complete U.S.  support for and protection of Israel on every level mean that we  should not expect a result or progress in the foreseeable future.    We used to hear statements that a settlement would be  effected in late 1993. It did not even happen in the spring of  1994. Every recent U.S. statement has said: "We will work  toward making some kind of progress on the various tracks in  1994." This means that the atmosphere is not one of settlement.    [Correspondent] Do you expect anything to come out of  Christopher's current visit?    [Nasrallah] He said his visit was routine.    [Correspondent] Israel recently attacked Sidon and areas in  the heart of Lebanon, which was regarded as a message to  influence the Lebanese Government because its positive stance on  the Resistance was not firm.    [Nasrallah] The government's main responsibility is not only  to support the Resistance. The Resistance men are often told  that the official stance supports the Resistance. There is a  debate now on the theme: "Is resistance to occupation the  responsibility of the government or the people?"    It is the responsibility of the state and the people to  fight the enemy and drive them away from our country. It is not  enough for the state to tell the people that they have the right  to resist. This is a shortcoming of the state. It is incumbent  upon the state to support the resistance--and not just verbally  and politically. The state must support the steadfastness of  the southerners and implement its pledges them.    The escalation of the Israeli attacks dictates that the  Government provide the Resistance with all means to enable it  deter and prevent these attacks. We should never fear the  Israeli attacks or allow them to forcibly alter our official  stand on the Resistance and on steadfastness.    The Government's stand on the massacres in al-Nabatiyah and  Sidon demonstrates its impotence and indifference at times.  This is a major weak point in the Lebanese Government's  performance and politics.    [Correspondent] Some people believe that the Government's  support for the southern people should be expressed in a  political stand or financial support. Are you hopeful that this  will improve?    [Nasrallah] I doubt it. In the past when the south was  attacked, the Government used to lodge a complaint with the UN  Security Council. But now it is different: the Government no  longer lodges any complaints. This means that the Government is  not giving serious consideration to this. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] It is said that Hizballah is with the regime  but against the law.    [Nasrallah] We may discuss some details, but not the issue  of  resistance. We support everything that bolsters peace in  Lebanon. We are against any show of force. What happened in  Ba'labakk on Al-Quds Day was exaggerated by the media and  political bodies, and it was exploited by several parties.  Nevertheless, it was a hasty action by some brothers, who used  to celebrate similar occasions with the same way in the past.  But is had no political connotations. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] How do you coordinate between your  military-security capability and maintaining domestic peace at a  time when Islamists in other countries have failed in this?  While maintaining domestic peace and engaging in quarrels with  the regime, if political or other developments occur in the  region and the Resistance's role ends, would you fail to  maintain domestic peace?    [Nasrallah] First I would like to explain one fact. The  Islamic movements or the Islamists may converge--or naturally  should converge--in their goals. It is also natural for them to  have different programs and means to achieve these goals,  considering the characteristics of each country and society.    Lebanon is different from Algeria, Egypt, and many other  Arab  countries. Moreover these countries themselves or the Islamic  countries all have different characteristics; each society has  its own structure, which the Islamic movement should take into  consideration. The special characters, circumstances, and  events do not change the goals, but dictate to the wise man to  deal with them and take them into consideration in his own  methods and programs. [passage omitted]    We might disagree with the Islamist brothers in Algeria on  some details concerning this policemen or that soldier.  Personally I do not believe the allegations that Islamists  prepare a booby-trapped car here or place an explosive charge  there to kill civilians, not in Algeria or in Egypt.    I accuse the regimes of violence. I read a report in an  Egyptian opposition newspaper that the baby girl killed in the  [attempted] assassination of the prime minister some time ago  was not killed by the explosion but by the bullets of the prime  minister's guards, but the Islamists were accused of killing the  girl.    In any case, whether in Algeria or in Egypt, it is the  regime  which insists on using violence and repression. This regime has  declared war on the Islamists. So far, the Islamists have not  been allowed to form legal parties. The regime there [Egypt]  even prevents the Islamists from carrying out any political  activity and expressing their opinion. It uses repression  against them, jails, tortures, and kills them on the streets  under the cover of the Emergency Law. [passage omitted]    As for Lebanon, our military power was established in 1982  simply on the basis of resisting the occupation--which still  continues--not to show off or make domestic political gains.    The continuing jihad operations over the past years,  especially in recent years, confirm that we have only used force  in a real, serious confrontation, and not for propaganda,  one-upmanship, to show off, or for political gains. The Israeli  enemy acknowledges that the 1992 operations were more violent  and fierce than those of 1991. They said the same thing at the  end of 1993 and, God willing, will say the same at the end of  1994. Since early 1994, the operations escalated significantly,  especially recently. Most of the agents killed were not  ordinary soldiers but security and military leaders working for  agent Lahd's army. As I said, this is a military power which we  should not fear. Every one agrees that resistance is a  legitimate right and duty and anyone who fails to perform this  duty is neglectful at the religious, national, pan- Arab, moral,  and humane levels. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What about the party called Hizballah  Palestine?    [Nasrallah] This party no longer exists. There was a group  of Palestinian mujahidin who called themselves Hizballah  Palestine for a certain period. But it ceased to exist after a  short period. Currently, there is no Palestinian group bearing  this name. But statements are sometimes issued inside Palestine  by mujahidin who have no organizational affiliation. They might  use the name due to its morale and jihad value. But there is no  any organization called Hizballah Palestine.    [Correspondent] What is your comment on the Government's  decision to turn down any request by any party or sect to own  any information media establishment?    [Nasrallah] Generally speaking, we are awaiting the  Government's laws. The Government must honor its promise and  present a bill on the audio/visual law. This bill will be  submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion. We have a  parliamentary bloc that will participate in this discussion. At  any rate, the Government can do whatever it wants, but the  Chamber of Deputies has the final say. We believe that all  political parties must enjoy freedom, particularly the freedom  of expression. No sect has its own media. [passage omitted]  Preventing the parties from expressing their own views  represents an unjustified violation of freedoms. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Many figures want to join the Cabinet in the  event of any reshuffle or change. Do you have the same attitude?    [Nasrallah] We are not enthusiastic about participating in  the Cabinet, nor do we have any desire to join the  establishment. Our participation in the Government is  contingent on the political program and the extent of the  Government's honesty and sincerity about implementing a  persuasive and logical political program that would serve the  interests of our Lebanese people.    [Correspondent] As a rule, the Government is formed first  and  then the policy statement is prepared.    [Nasrallah] Governments in the advanced countries are  usually  formed as a result of alliances and coalitions. As far as I  know, they agree on a political program and then the government  is formed. This is followed by the policy statement, which  normally puts forth a selected political program. Therefore,  whoever wants to participate just for the sake of participation  will accept anything..    [Correspondent] Does this mean that you will not take part  in  the event of a cabinet reshuffle?    [Nasrallah] I said that this question cannot be answered  either yes or no. It depends on the program to be implemented  by the Government. It also depends on the Government's  seriousness and honesty in implementing this kind of program.    [Correspondent] Has any main party in Lebanon been raided  and  have weapons been confiscated?    [Nasrallah] There are no weapons in the [Southern] Suburb.  Hizballah fighters have weapons only to fight the Israeli enemy.  It is logical to distinguish between the Resistance's weapons  and those used to serve the enemy in some way or another.</p>

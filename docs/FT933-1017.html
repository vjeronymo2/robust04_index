			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (5): A French connection on the waterfront - Audrey Powell has been touring France and discovering holiday homes to suit nearly every pocket / International WITH A near 2,000 mile stretch of coastline, France offers the homebuyer who has designs on living by the water three choices: the Channel, the Atlantic or the Mediterranean. A variety of property styles and climate to go with the three expanses of water are also on offer. For those living in south-east England the spring opening of the Channel tunnel will make a weekend home on the northern French coast a more inviting and easily-obtainable prospect. The French tourist board stresses the virtues of the Opal coast - 55 miles of beaches, dunes and cliffs between Calais and Berck. It will be possible to reach the resort of Le Touquet and lesser-known Hardelot (founded by Englishman John Whitley at the beginning of the century) in three hours from London. Hardelot is a resort with many activities to amuse all the family. It has two of the Opal coast's eight golf courses, a sizeable equestrian centre, a tennis club and 10 miles of broad beach (much used for horse-riding and sand-yachting) stretched before a pine forest. Then there is a compact town, with boutiques and restaurants, to interest all shoppers. Lesur Promotion has a choice of property in the resort to suit most buyers - apartments, seafront or in more secluded areas, from Pounds 48,000. A family looking for a weekend home may prefer to have a house built. Different sized plots can be bought from Pounds 60,000 either on a golf course or tucked away in pine woods. A three- to five-bedroom villa is standard, as is the steep roof. This would cost Pounds 80,000 upwards on top of the plot price. Other prospective buyers might prefer an individually-designed property. (Information from Lesur Promotion Hardelot 21 91 91 00). Earlier this year a group of established British-based estate agents offering property in France combined to form Groupe France, which collectively almost covers the country. Each company continues to specialise in a defined area, but when one does not have a particular type of property sought after, the applicant's name is passed on to a fellow agent. One member of the group, Rutherfords (071-386-7240), extolls the virtues of west coast France - bracing air, beaches cleaned by the Atlantic ocean. It suggests resales at Port Bourgemay, near Les Sables d'Olonne, could be useful buys. A typical studio starts from Pounds 24,500, a furnished two-bedroom apartment from Pounds 43,000. Port Bourgemay has a sandy beach, golf course, tennis and other resort facilities. Up to 100,000 Britons are selling their property in France, says Frank Rutherford. Indeed Britons buying resales at Port Bourgemay will likely be buying from fellow countrymen, saving time and trouble. On the south coast of France the choice of property is immense, with a price tag to match. Residence Atoll Beach, at Port Saint-Laurent is a new eye-catching block of apartments, built in a series of horizontal lines. It took the development company, Atoll Beach, seven years to obtain permission for the project, which involved relocating the nearby road to enable the apartments a situation next to the sea. The completed, crescent-shaped building, on six floors, comprises 109 one to four-bedroom apartments, with shops at ground level and a hotel with swimming pool. Prices range from Pounds 150,000 for a large studio with terrace and sea view, to Pounds 1.24m for a four-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment, with basement garaging. (London agent is David de Lara &amp; Partners, 081-742-0708). For those who prefer something with more privacy, a recently-restored 1920s house on the water, with private mooring, beach and cove, is available on the Cote de l'Esterel, west of Cannes. Each of the villa's three bedrooms has a balcony overlooking the sea. The owner, a member of a rock group, is seeking Pounds 1.6m, through London agent Barbers (071-381-0112). Canalside houses at Port Grimaud, the 'lagoon city' in the Gulf of St Tropez are as near the water as is possible. The resort has grown to 2,500 homes. On a summer evening a procession of boats can be seen - their owners returning them to the end-of-the-garden moorings. Building began at the resort in 1966 and was due to be completed by now, but the final section has not yet been built. This will comprise 40 apartments and 55 houses - reservations are awaited. Meantime there are a few other new properties available and some resales. (Sales office Port Grimaud 94 36 21 82 or UK contact 0243-572001). The architect, Francois Spoerry, now aged over 80, has a home there, which he designed he says, with a smuggled pencil while a prisoner of war. His commissions have been worldwide but he now concentrates mostly on France. One current project involves a hotel at Beauvallon, St Maxime, with additional development, for the American Disney group - its first hotel in France. Interesting to watch develop will be a project further east along the coast at the old port at Frejus. Spoerry's practice has been brought in to oversee the second phase, which will mirror Port Grimaud, with its canal side pastel-shaded houses and slightly taller apartments. But here the development is cut inland, rather than being built outwards like Grimaud, and the canal will meander beneath bridges leading to a lake. Several builders will be working on different sections that will be carefully co-ordinated. A few properties from the first phase are still available and those in the next phase will start coming on the market next year. Prices are expected to be lower than at Port Grimaud. (Information from the developer, La Semaf, at Frejus 94 82 63 00. Or those whose French is rusty might prefer to contact Caroline Jenkins at the Frejus Notaries' Office, 94 51 00 05). Waterside France is not limited to the coast. David Kay, of Waterside Properties International (0892-750011) points out: 'There are over 33,000 communes in France and 25,000 of them have water features - lakes, tarns, rivers, canals.' His agency has dozens of inland properties with what he calls 'water-related opportunities', on its books. There are lock-keepers' cottages, canalside houses, watermills, restored and unrestored. Prices range from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 1.5m. A former windmill, now a two-bedroom house, has views over the bay of Mont St Michel. A small hotel in a tourist village is 'just a few yards from a large lake'. A terrace of four cottages is 'ideally situated for gites' and a five-bedroom watermill close to a lake is just an hour of Paris. Different again is the 'waterside France' bordering the Alpine lakes. Whatever the market, someone has it - Alpine Apartments Agency (0544-388234) specialises in this sort of property. Seekers of a waterside holiday home are reminded that while a town like Annecy has popular appeal with its cobbled streets and arcades, prices are high, even for a one-bedroom apartment. 'Lakeside houses with a mooring at the bottom of the garden are rare and can command Pounds 950,000.' A somewhat old-fashioned three-bedroom house looking over the lake at Menthon is Pounds 255,000. Close to the Swiss border on Lake Geneva and on the water's edge, is The Sanctuary, at Meillerie, a phased development of apartments. Prices for two-bedroom designs are from Pounds 105,000. A rental-income and letting service, is available. Building starts on the second phase this month.</p>

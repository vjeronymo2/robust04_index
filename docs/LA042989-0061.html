			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLIGHTS OF 'STEALTH' PLANES SPOTTED IN DESERT  </P> <P> Sharp-eyed observers have spotted flocks of the Air Force's most secret fighter  jets flying over Southern California in recent weeks, providing the first  in-flight glimpses of an aircraft that has remained shrouded in mystery for  more than 10 years, according to an authoritative defense industry magazine.  </P> <P> Groups of 10 F-117 "stealth" fighter jets have been seen during daylight hours  streaking over Mojave, a small town outside Edwards Air Force Base about 90  miles north of Los Angeles, Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its  May 1 issue.  </P> <P> After flying the F-117 for five years, the Air Force last November unveiled the  aircraft to the public for the first time. The plane uses special designs and  materials to elude detection by radar.  </P> <P> At that time, the service said it wanted to begin daytime flights of the  bat-like warplane and acknowledged that such training flights would lead to  sightings by civilians. Until recently, the Air Force had been flying the  aircraft under cover of night in an effort to keep details of the plane a  secret.  </P> <P> The Air Force, which has remained secretive about most details of the plane,  said Friday that it would not discuss operational matters regarding the  program.  </P> <P> While the nation's 52-plane force of the stealth fighters is based at Tonopah  Test Range Airfield in Nevada, the latest round of training flights appears to  be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base and nearby test ranges in the Mojave  Desert.  </P> <P> Aviation Week noted that Edwards Air Force Base traditionally has been used as  a flying range for experimental planes, rather than as a training site for  planes already in the force. Practice runs involving 10 aircraft, such as those  observed on April 12 and 18, are rare in that area.  </P> <P> Overflights of the aircraft have revealed to area residents one its most  distinctive characteristics -- the faint, high-pitched whine of two engines as  the jet passes overhead at speeds just below the speed of sound. "This sound  was definitely different," one observer told the magazine. "There was no doubt  this was something we hadn't heard before. It even set the dogs off before we  heard it."  </P> <P> Lockheed Corp. is to build a total of 59 F-117s at its experimental "skunk  works" facility in Palmdale.  </P></p>

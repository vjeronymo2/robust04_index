			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: ADT hit by absence of exceptional income ADT, the security and vehicle auctions group which recently completed a Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 830m) restructuring, yesterday reported a 9 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to Dollars 68.7 on net sales marginally higher at Dollars 678.8m. The decline over the six months to end-June was largely due to the absence of exceptional gains which had flattered 1992's profits by Dollars 15.5m. At the operating level, ADT reported a 9 per cent increase to Dollars 97.6m. Net income fell by 20 per cent to Dollars 58.4m, after an Pounds 8m rise in the tax charge to Dollars 10.3m. Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, said the successful conclusion of the refinancing earlier this month meant the group now had 'a stable long-term financial structure which will allow the group to continue to develop its two businesses'. The security services division showed a 7 per cent increase in operating income to Dollars 69.9m on sales 2 per cent higher at Dollars 452.9m. The strongest advance was made in the residential business, with sales 38 per cent ahead of the previous year. Profits from the vehicle auctions division rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 42.1m on sales 2 per cent higher at Dollars 182.2m. Mr Ashcroft said vehicle sales had risen in both the UK and US in the second quarter. In the US, sales were 4 per cent higher. In the UK, higher prices due to a supply shortage left volumes 6 per cent up. Primary earnings per share fell from 57 cents to 45 cents. ADT also announced yesterday that it intended to redeem its outstanding exchangeable redeemable preference shares at the end of next month. More than 90 per cent of the total had already been exchanged for BAA shares, the group said. The redemption value of the preference shares was Dollars 10.6m. If exchanged into BAA shares, the stock would be worth approximately Dollars 19m.</p>

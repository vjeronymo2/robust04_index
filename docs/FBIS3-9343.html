Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Laszlo Kovacs (Hungarian  Socialist Party) said after the meeting that MPs were unified on  full membership being of fundamental importance for Hungary.  There was also agreement on Hungary's wish that countries in  Central Europe be treated individually for application.    Kovacs said that the new Hungarian Government to be formed  after the elections will have to try to help minorities outside  Hungary with better bilateral relations with the countries  concerned. The socialists also agree that international forums  should be used to create an effective minority protection system.    Committee Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Csoti (Hungarian Democratic  Forum) said his party feels the rights of Hungarians living  beyond the borders should be ensured as the first step, as good  neighbourly relations are inconceivable without this. Still,  the HDF believes in constant dialogue with neighbours. They  agree with the socialists that guarantees that cannot be  elaborated on bilateral bases should be given to minorities  internationally.    Over relations with NATO, the views of the two parties  differ. According to the HSP, NATO would best serve stability  were the countries of the region to receive identical security  guarantees. These might or might not be linked to membership.  The HSP considers the peace partnership programme as a  compromise which does not exclude one single country.    The HDF believes all countries of the region should receive  security guarantees at the same time, and in their view, the  peace partnership embodies this. The HDF expects NATO to define  a clear system of criteria by which countries of the region can  win membership in the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-B&hyph;1. General Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each institution conducting or sponsoring recombinant DNA research which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the NIH Guidelines is responsible for ensuring that the research is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in full conformity with the provisions of the NIH Guidelines. In order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill this responsibility, the institution shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-a. Establish and implement policies that provide for the safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct of recombinant DNA research and that ensure compliance with the NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines. As part of its general responsibilities for implementing the NIH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidelines, the institution may establish additional procedures, as deemed necessary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to govern the institution and its components in the discharge of its responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the NIH Guidelines. Such procedures may include: (i) Statements formulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the institution for the general implementation of the NIH Guidelines, and (ii) any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional precautionary steps the institution deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-b. Establish an Institutional Biosafety Committee that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements set forth in Section IV-B&hyph;2-a and carries out the functions detailed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-c. Appoint a Biological Safety Officer (who is also a member of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutional Biosafety Committee) if the institution: (i) Conducts recombinant DNA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research at Biosafety Level (BL) 3 or BL4, or (ii) engages in large scale (greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 10 liters) research. The Biological Safety Officer carries out the duties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in Section IV-B&hyph;3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-d. Assist and ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Principal Investigators conducting research at the institution as specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-e. Ensure appropriate training for the Institutional Biosafety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee Chair and members, Biological Safety Officer (when applicable),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Principal Investigators, and laboratory staff regarding laboratory safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the NIH Guidelines. The Institutional Biosafety Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chair is responsible for ensuring that Institutional Biosafety Committee members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are appropriately trained. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory staff are appropriately trained. The institution is responsible for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Principal Investigator has sufficient training; however, this responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be delegated to the Institutional Biosafety Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-f. Determine the necessity for health surveillance of personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved in connection with individual recombinant DNA projects; and if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, conduct a health surveillance program for such projects. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance program for personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in large scale research or production activities involving viable organisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing recombinant DNA molecules which require BL3 containment at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory scale. The institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for personnel engaged in animal research involving viable recombinant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA-containing microorganisms that require BL3 or greater containment in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Monograph discusses various components of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a program (e.g., records of agents handled, active investigation of relevant illnesses,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the maintenance of serial serum samples for monitoring serologic changes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may result from the employees' work experience). Certain medical conditions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place a laboratory worker at increased risk in any endeavor where infectious agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are handled. Examples cited in the Laboratory Safety Monograph include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gastrointestinal disorders and treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antibiotics. Workers with such disorders or treatment should be evaluated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether they should be engaged in research with potentially hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organisms during their treatment or illness. Copies of the Laboratory Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monograph are available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;1-g.

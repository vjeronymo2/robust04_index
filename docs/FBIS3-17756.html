It states that the USA will  resist attempts by the Russian Federation to intimidate, to use  military force, or economic pressure to create a sphere of  influence in the former republics of the USSR and also in the  countries of central and Eastern Europe. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs and the Ministry of Defense of Russia responded urgently  to this decision today, by issuing a joint statement. It says  that Russia is not setting its efforts against anyone at all and  is not demanding special status or an exclusive role for itself.</p>

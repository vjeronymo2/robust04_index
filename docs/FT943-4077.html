			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Shock leaves brokers scrambling to unload The shock delivered to currency and bond markets by the US PPI figures reverberated through the continent's equity bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. Brokers in Madrid, unhealthily sensitive to stimuli recently, may have been glad that bourse was closed for a holiday. FRANKFURT ignored a weak bond market during the session to close the Dax index 12.78 higher at 2,185.15, just 0.9 per cent down on the week; after the US PPI news, traders scrambled to unload positions ahead of the weekend and the Ibis-indicated Dax dropped to 2,155.58, 2.7 per cent lower than it was seven days earlier. The afternoon's big falls came in the senior, most liquid blue chips: Allianz ended at DM2,428 after a session rise of DM23 to DM2,480; Deutsche Bank, at DM719.50 after DM9.20 to DM732; and Daimler, at DM825.10 after DM840, up DM7. There were similar performances from Siemens and Volkswagen. Variations on the theme included; Metallgesellschaft, weak on the session on a newspaper report that restructuring costs had eroded part of its capital, matching its year's low of DM175 in the post-bourse before ending at DM179; Lufthansa, losing its pre-privatisation support on the session to close DM9 lower at DM197, but actually recovering to DM200 after hours; and SAP, the computer software group, soon to be traded on Ibis, up DM23 to DM803 on the session on the strength of this but, fortunately, not traded in yesterday's post-bourse. PARIS peaked at 1,993.47 and when the CAC 40 index dropped an initial 1.5 per cent in mid-afternoon on the US data, the French market still tried to run its winners. However, the CAC 40 carried on down, closing 2.2 per cent off its peak and 34.57 down on the day at 1,948.83, 3.5 per cent lower on the week; and the general run of its outperformers lost their early enthusiasm. Retailers still had some steam in them. Docks de France, which had a flurry 10 days ago on renewed rumours of a takeover bid by Sainsbury, the UK supermarketeer, climbed another FFr20 to FFr797 after a block trade took 300,000 shares, or 2.5 per cent of its capital, through the market at FFr800. What dealers described as an upbeat outlook for the retailing sector also lifted Comptoirs Modernes by FFr35 to FFr1,475; after hours, it produced half year results which seemed more or less as expected. Turnover was FFr4.1bn. Of the CAC 40 stocks, 39 fell and one was unchanged. One of the biggest losers was Schneider, the electrical group, which added the Belgian legal tribulations of its chairman to the general malaise and dropped FFr12.10 to FFr387.40. AMSTERDAM turned lower as worries about higher inflation and interest rates were revived. The AEX index fell 2.65 to 413.19, for a 1.8 per cent fall on the week. Heineken, the brewer, jumped Fl 7, or 2.9 per cent, to Fl 244.50 after its first half figures came in above expectations and the group forecast higher full year profits. However, analysts noted that the rise was exaggerated by a shortage of sellers. HBG, the construction group, added Fl 4.50 to Fl 300.00 after reporting higher first half net profits. Royal Dutch fell Fl 2.70 to Fl 194.90, dragged down by the lower dollar, while Akzo, the chemical group, lost Fl 4.40 to Fl 212.70. ZURICH turned back after a firmer start in growing turnover with investors anxious to square positions ahead of a long holiday weekend. The SMI index lost 22.0 to 2,642.1, for a 1.1 per cent fall on the week. Roche certificates gave up SFr140, or 2.2 per cent, to SFr6,185 after their firm performance earlier in the week, and Ciba was marked SFr14 lower to SFr790. Nestle, which is to buy Unilever's German ice cream business, lost SFr12 to SFr1,217. Against the trend, Ascom bearers built on Thursday's 5.3 per cent jump, in the wake of results, with a further SFr55 or 3.5 per cent rise to SFr1,645. MILAN saw early gains erased as the market took its cue from other bourses, and with the absence of the prime minister from the day's cabinet meeting adding to worries over the cabinet's cohesion, and its ability to act decisively to cut the budget deficit. The Comit index fell 2.63 to 662.53, for a 3.3 per cent fall on the week; but the real-time Mibtel index, reflecting the market's late weakness, fell 1.8 per cent to 10,447 after a day's high of 10,700. Olivetti group shares were under pressure after news that police had seized documents from the treasury ministry relating to a bid made by the company for the supply of computers. Olivetti was L81, or 3.9 per cent, lower at L2,006 and Cir, the holding company, gave up L58 to L1,983. Insurers contained losses on expectations that they will benefit from government plans to reform pensions. Ras was L258 lower at L23,843 and Generali was L431 down at L40,796. BRUSSELS saw strong first half figures from Union Miniere and the polyurethane foam maker, Recticel, and the broad market fared better than most. The Bel-20 index ended down 5.66 at 1,453.99, above its low of 1,449.28 and down 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of about BFr1.20bn.

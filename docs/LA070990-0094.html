			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ICE CARVER HAS A NO-SWEAT JOB;  </P> <P> ART: JAMES LUFF SPENDS SUMMER DAYS HOLED UP IN A WALK-IN FREEZER SCULPTING  PARTY CENTERPIECES FROM A MATERIAL MORE COMMONLY SEEN IN PARTY DRINKS.  </P> <P> As the mercury crept into the 80s one day last week, James Luff bundled up in a  heavy jacket, rain pants, two pairs of gloves and insulated boots to perform  what may be Orange County's coolest summer job: ice sculpting.  </P> <P> "It's definitely a way to escape the heat," said Luff, who has been a  professional ice sculptor for the past 10 years.  </P> <P> While others flocked to the beaches to bask in the summer sun, Luff closed  himself inside his freezer-studio and went to work on a 300-pound ice cube.  </P> <P> As the temperature hovered at 16 degrees, Luff first used a lightweight chain  saw to gently outline the figure he wanted to sculpt. ("I can look at (a block  of ice) and see what I want to carve inside it," Luff said.)  </P> <P> Then with sweeping strokes of the saw, he chopped away large chunks of ice, and  a pair of wings and the long neck of a swan soon began to emerge. Gradually,  the swipes of the saw gave way to precision strokes as Luff defined the slope  of the breast, the curve of the neck.  </P> <P> For the final touches, Luff employed a pruning saw and a large fork to smooth  away the rough edges and detail the feathers of his three-foot-tall swan. After  several hours of work -- and one or two breaks outdoors to warm his hands and  feet -- Luff's latest creation was ready to stand as the sparkling centerpiece  to a party, where it would immediately begin to melt away.  </P> <P> Luff professes not to mind the ephemeral nature of his art. "I don't feel bad  seeing it melt. I enjoy watching the people's reactions, the oohs and aahs . .  . ," he said. "It's like cooking a good meal for someone. They enjoy it. Then  it's gone."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Luff has been dabbling in wood carvings recently. "It would be  nice to have something a little more permanent," he said.  </P> <P> Luff, 37, is one of few ice sculptors to make his own ice.  </P> <P> Most carvers buy their ice from manufacturers who typically use a freezing  system that produces blocks with a cloudy white core.  </P> <P> Luff utilizes a specially designed system that creates blocks of ice as clear  as crystal.  </P> <P> "It takes three days to make a block of ice, but it's worth the wait," said  Luff, who also sells his 40-inch-by-20-inch-by-10-inch blocks to other ice  sculptors.  </P> <P> Luff said he got hooked on ice carving when he was working as a cook in  Vancouver, Wash., and saw a chef carving a block of ice for a buffet-table  centerpiece. "He showed me the tools . . . how to use them and told me to go to  it," he said. "That was my first lesson. After that, I knew ice carving was  what I wanted to do."  </P> <P> His works have graced the tables of parties, movie sets, business functions and  wedding receptions. He created the swan centerpiece in "Beverly Hills Cop" and  the mermaid in "Dragnet." He even sculpted a pair of lungs that were featured  on the cover of a medical journal.  </P> <P> By far the largest sculpture he has ever done was a replica of the Egyptian  Sphinx that required 90 blocks of ice. The entire project cost about $18,000.  </P> <P> In an average month, Luff carves between 30 and 40 sculptures. Most sell for a  couple hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on their  complexity and size.  </P> <P> After completing his swan last week, Luff looked outside at the midday sun and  admitted that the frigid environs of his studio are not always the place to be  in summer.  </P> <P> "Getting away from the heat is nice, but it also would be nice to enjoy the  sunny days sometimes," he said with a smile.  </P></p>

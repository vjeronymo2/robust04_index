			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] </F>   [Text] Currently, domestic oil and gas are basically  extracted in Ukraine's two large regions, one in East Ukraine  (62 and 77 per cent of the total figures, respectively) and the  other in West Ukraine (36 and 22 per cent), respectively, of  Ukraine's total domestic oil and gas extraction).    As experts maintain, to comprehensively survey and prospect  Ukraine's oil and gas promising regions (the Dnieper-Donetsk  caldera, Transcarpathian arch, shelves of the Black Sea and the  Sea of Azov), at least three to four seismic stations, three  specialized stations with 10 vibration generators and other  sophisticated equipment will be necessary to lay out the fields  and pinpoint their deposits of carbohydrates. These will help to  increase the discovery coefficient from its present 0.3 to 0.5  value, which means that five in every 10 surveyed structures  must be carbohydrate-bearing.    As B. Gotski, superintendent of the agency for oil and gas  resources of the State Committee for oil and gas, disclosed to  UKRINFORM, the State Committee is considering application of  comprehensive extraction technologies (including the cycling  process) involving 10 newly developed fields and exploited  fields in Ukraine.    Besides additional expenditures, this will require  application of the so-called 3D seismic equipment, which is not  available in Ukraine. Hard currency shortages do not allow the  State Committee for oil and gas and State Committee for geology  to finance purchases of such equipment units, though prices for  them are not too exorbitant and range from 25 to 35 million  dollars apiece. According to B. Gotski, the Volyn-Podol lowland  region is virtually unprospected, though it may contain  carbohydrate deposits, too.    Presently, about 127.8 million tons (or 83.5 per cent) of  prospected liquid carbohydrate deposits are exploited, according  to the State Committee for oil and gas. The remainder is either  surveyed or has been conserved. About 87.8 million tons of  liquid carbohydrate deposits (or 57 per cent of the total  amount) belong to the category of hard to extract ones.    In accordance with the National Program for oil and gas  extraction in Ukraine, which extends to the year 2010, primary  emphasis will be placed on development and exploitation of the  Black Sea and the Sea of Azov shelves, which have been surveyed  by meager 3 per cent by now. So, domestic and foreign capital  investments for survey, prospecting, offshore deep drilling will  focus on precisely this promising shelf region.</p>

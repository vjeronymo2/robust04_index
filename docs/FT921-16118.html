			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Bush faces a tough finale on Asian tour: Concerns over US security role likely to have been allayed US President George Bush embarked on the more politically sensitive part of his Asian tour yesterday with his arrival in South Korea, to be followed tomorrow by a visit to Japan. The president needs to convince voters at home that he is effectively seeking broader markets for US goods while at the same time cementing relationships with America's key north Asian allies. Concerns in Asia about continued US commitment to its 'balancing wheel' role in regional security will have been allayed by Mr Bush's visit to Singapore, where he won approval in principle for relocating a US Navy logistics command from the Philippines. In Seoul, Mr Bush is expected to reaffirm that the US would not withdraw more troops from South Korea until a dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme was fully resolved. Washington has withdrawn battlefield nuclear weapons and 6,000 troops in recent months. But the withdrawal of about 6,000 more of the 39,000 troops remaining is on hold. However, greater attention is likely to be focused on trade issues, even though South Korea has economic problems, including a widening current account deficit. Mr Bush was expected to urge South Korea to open its markets more to US goods. 'With a growth rate of 6.7 per cent, our pitch is they're becoming a very mature economy,' one US official was quoted as saying yesterday. However, Korean officials said the most explosive political issue in South Korea  - opening its rice market to US imports  - would be sidestepped. The highest expectations in the US are focused on the Japanese leg of the tour, following inclusion in the president's entourage of 21 leading businessmen. His mission is seen as securing commitments from Tokyo to take concrete measures to reduce the Dollars 41bn (Pounds 22.5bn) US trade deficit with Japan. Mr Beverly Dolan, chairman of Textron, the aerospace group, said: 'It would seem to me that the Japanese would recognise that this isn't going to go on forever, and it would surely be in their best interest to suggest ways to cure the trade imbalance, rather than the US to mandate it. 'The thrust of this trip is to try to enlighten them to change their direction themselves, of their own free will,' he said. Mr Bush told a news conference on Saturday that he was not going to Japan in an aggressive frame of mind and pointed out that security and other issues would also be topics of discussion. Mr Robert Galvin, chairman of the executive committee of Motorola, the US electronics group, said he believed Mr Bush needed to obtain Japanese agreement on a set of steps to accelerate balancing the trade deficit. 'I think we're going to set new directions and new paces,' Mr Galvin said.</p>

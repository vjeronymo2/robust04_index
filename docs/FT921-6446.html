			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Accountancy Column: Misunderstandings that can lead to share fluctuations IT BEGAN with the first public reprimands from the Financial Reporting Review Panel in late January. It continued with circulars on accounting matters from a growing number of city stockbrokers. It may soon affect a company near you. None of the events of the last few weeks has involved the revelation of new financial information. Yet they have triggered fluctuations in the share prices of many of the companies concerned. That raises interesting questions about the way the stock market reacts to accounting-related information. On January 28 this year the review panel publicly criticised Williams Holdings for transgressing accounting standards by excluding exceptional items from its earnings per share calculation. The share price fell 20p, before recovering slightly to close down 11p on the day. A few days later, a circular was issued by Williams de Broe called 'Bringing the engineers to account', which dealt with the accounting practices of five companies in the engineering sector. The comment appears to have helped depress the share price of TI Group, the most heavily criticised of the companies, which was dubbed 'fundamentally overvalued'. The shares fell by 11p to 597p on the day, and by a further 17p the following Monday. The next day, County NatWest issued a response entitled 'All above board' which declared that the company's accounting policies did, in fact, 'stand comparison with its peers'. TI's share price climbed 19p to 599p. Attention soon switched elsewhere. On February 6, details of a draft report prepared by Barclays de Zoete Wedd leaked to the media. The BZW report discussed the work programme of new accounting standards being prepared by the Accounting Standards Board. It argued that the changes would most affect companies with: cash absorption; substantial profits from acquisitions and disposals; large non-recurring costs; the presence of hybrid capital instruments on the balance sheet under equity or minorities; significant off-balance sheet finance; creative acquisition accounting; large amounts of unprovided deferred tax; and substantial losses from foreign currency translation taken through reserves. The BZW report also analysed the effects of the changes on five companies: British Airways, P&amp;O, Cable &amp; Wireless, Fisons and Ladbroke. It stressed that the companies were obeying existing accounting standards, but that their results would be shown in a less favourable light under the new standards. The short-term effect was clearly evident. Shares in P&amp;O fell by 1p, in British Airways by 4p, and in Fisons by 6p. They slumped 13p in Cable &amp; Wireless. Only Ladbroke's shares closed unchanged. Irate phone calls and letters soon followed from some of the finance directors of the companies named. BZW was forced to recall drafts of the report and have them shredded. The next week, it made a public announcement that the report was to be withdrawn following 'misinterpretation' of its contents. An anaemic 'legitimate son' of the draft report was released at the start of this week. Every reference to examples of real companies had been stripped out. It even substituted the phrase 'characteristics sensitive to the proposed changes' for the original 'companies with the following characteristics are likely to be vulnerable' to preface the list given above. It would be dangerous to argue that all these share price movements were driven by the accounting-related events described. The true reasons for fluctuations are probably never entirely explicable. In fact, the fall in the Cable &amp; Wireless share price was at least partly due to a profits downgrading issued by BZW on the same day as reports of the leaked draft appeared. (It insisted the downgrading was unconnected with the draft.) The accounting analysis itself may not always be the central issue. Market rumours about the BZW report gave the impression that it was going to criticise the existing earnings of the companies named, and not simply make hypothetical projections. The effect on the share prices of the companies concerned has since dissipated. Other factors have helped change the price, and most have risen again. It is unclear what the longer term effect of the accounting events has been. Nevertheless, it would seem that the market is adjusting to information that it ought to have already known. BZW and Williams de Broe took figures which are readily available in the annual reports of the companies concerned, and simply re-arranged them. County NatWest added nothing new. Williams Holdings was criticised by the review panel for its treatment of exceptional items. But the divergence from accounting standards was clearly flagged in its accounts, and the alternative method stipulated was published directly underneath. 'In many ways the (share price) moves are surprising,' says Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board. 'The information is there already.' Some suggest that whenever accounting is mentioned in public at the moment, it is a word tainted with scandal and suspicion. Others argue that the markets are always unpredictable in the short-term, particularly with the current political and economic uncertainties of the UK. In either case, the instinctive reaction of many market makers may be to mark the stock down first when there is accounting-related news, and then look at the information in more detail later. If the news is then judged irrelevant or less critical than anticipated, the share price will bounce back again. However, these movements do seem to call into doubt the so-called 'efficient market theory', for which there is considerable academic support. It argues that any information once publicly available will be rapidly reflected in the share price of a company. Hence any rearrangement of existing accounting information should have no effect. Goldman Sachs produced some research last May which put forward tentative evidence for an alternative approach, known as the 'functional fixation theory'. Decision makers, it seems, are fixated by reported earnings figures. They associate any changes in a company's earnings with differences in its economic performance, even when it is solely brought about by changes in accounting practice. There is one other possible and unpleasant factor which observers will concede in private, shaking their heads sadly: that the quality of analysis conducted by many of the 'City scribblers' employed by stockbrokers is not, ahem, as good as it might be. 'You're putting me a bit in a corner,' says Mr Michael Garner, finance director of TI. 'I have always been brought up never to criticise the market.' Professor Paul Marsh from the London Business School admits he is a little puzzled by these recent share price movements, but maintains that most evidence still points to the efficient market theory. He argues that as long as one or two analysts fully understand the accounts, that ought to be reflected in the share price. But he adds: 'Maybe the notes to the accounts have a readership of six. It makes you worry.'</p>

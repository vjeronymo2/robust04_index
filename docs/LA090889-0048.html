			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> IRISH SOLDIERS SPEAK THE POETRY OF INJUSTICE IN 'A FLAG TO FLY'  </P> <P> During the war between Mexico and the United States in 1846-48, a U.S.  battalion that was made up mostly of Irish immigrants jumped to the Mexican  side. Of those soldiers of St. Patrick who were captured, most were whipped 50  times and branded with a D for deserter on their cheeks -- but 50 of them were  sentenced to hang.  </P> <P> "A Flag to Fly," Chris Matthews' stunning hourlong drama at the Celtic Arts  Center about seven of those awaiting the gallows, is a testament to a belief in  right and justice that is as pertinent as today's headlines in its condemnation  of jingoistic brutality.  </P> <P> Lincoln called the U.S.-Mexican conflict "the sheerest deception," and U.S.  Grant referred to it as "the most unjust war." The Irish-American battalion,  the San Patricios, was made up mostly of men who fled Ireland to escape the  famine and religious persecution, but they soon realized the inequity of the  American presence in Mexico, which resulted in the annexation of half of Mexico  into the United States.  </P> <P> If the play has a flaw, it is brevity. Another half hour would give Matthews  the time to provide further details in the Matthew Brady-like snapshots he has  taken of his seven prisoners. His program notes say that this is "a very  stylized version of the full production, without Yankee soldiers, subsets and  crowd scenes."  </P> <P> While these seven soldiers are enough to make his point without slipping into  pageantry, we would just like to spend a little more time with them and feel a  little more of the pain of their 4 1/2-hour wait in their nooses watching the  final battle of Chapultepec and the raising of the American flag that signaled  their doom. Johnny, we hardly knew ye.  </P> <P> Matthews also directs with passion and compassion a fine cast, including Mike  Vaughn, William Brochtrup, Patrick Thornton, Pete Gallatin, Neal Eastman, Chris  Campbell and Martin Maguire. Elda Maria Lopez appears briefly as a Mexican  woman who sends her Irish lover off to defend her country. It is ensemble work  of intricacy and richness and an understanding of the humor and poetry in the  Irish soul.  </P> <P> Maybe it's that humor and poetry that sets "A Flag to Fly" apart. In recent  wars there have been no poets to sing of the brutality and injustice, to make  us feel deeply about the unknown soldiers we forget too soon. Lately we only  have windows on the bloodshed and destruction, journalism instead of heartbeat.  It's the poetry in the hearts of these seven that makes them memorable.  </P> <P> Peter Strauss' intricate lighting, Evan McGraph's realistic sound and Tera Dawn  Oppenheimer's authentically battered costumes all help to bring this moment of  heroism into focus.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  At 5651 Hollywood Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 3  p.m., through Sept. 17. Tickets: $10; (213) 462-6844.  </P></p>

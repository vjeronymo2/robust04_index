			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: UK telecoms Oftel's consultative document may contain few hard conclusions, but it does have a clear philosophy - that the UK telecoms market should eventually be less intensively regulated. Such a philosophy should be good for the market's growth. BT, in particular, has finally woken up to the fact that marketing can expand the use of telecoms services. Deregulation will give BT and its competitors greater freedom to set prices. Further stimulation of the market should follow. That said, the details of what is finally decided will have a big impact on the relative positions of the main operators. At present, it looks as if Mercury Communications will gain in the short term but BT will benefit in the longer run. Oftel seems intent on reforming and then abolishing the ungainly system of 'access deficit contributions'. This should mean Mercury will pay BT lower fees for shunting calls over its network. But the likely quid pro quo is that BT will receive freedom to rebalance its tariffs, by raising standing charges but cutting call prices. Such rebalancing will not occur overnight, if only because BT will want to avoid the resultant flak. But, over time, falling call charges will keep a squeeze on Mercury, making this week's cost-cutting doubly important. The winners will be the cable television industry. As BT puts up standing charges, the cable companies will raise theirs too.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature:reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] Russia still possesses the means to exercise  influence in the former Yugoslavia and will go on trying to make  the Serbs stop fire, said the Russian president's official  spokesman.    Vyacheslav Kostikov told a news briefing in Moscow on  Thursday that President Boris Yeltsin insisted that  highest-level consultations on the Yugoslav issue between  Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United  Nations take no more than one month, developments in the  embattled Balkan country being too fast.    Kostikov denied media reports that the latest events in  Bosnia's Gorazde area had made Russia change its position.  Moscow still wants a nonviolent settlement, he said.    Russia is taking no sides in the conflict, the spokesman  said. Yeltsin thinks not all nonviolent means have as yet been  tried, Kostikov said. He said he had had a meeting with Yeltsin  before the briefing, at which the president repeated his  objection to air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces.    Kostikov denied that a rift had appeared between Russia and  America. "There are undoubtedly natural contradictions between  states in their national interests, in economics and politics,  but Boris Yeltsin believes the main principle underlying the  policies of the two countries, namely their intention to develop  cooperation and strengthen the path of democratic development  has not been changed," he said.    He quoted Yeltsin as saying that attempts to "drive a wedge  between Russia and the United States and between him and  President Bill Clinton are doomed to failure."</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of New Broadcast and Communication Media (1): The audiences are spoilt for choice - Raymond Snoddy finds that the convergence between entertainment, computing and telecommunications is at last beginning to happen Last month, after years of planning DirecTV finally completed a television satellite system with the power to broadcast 150 channels of entertainment over the entire American continent. The broadcaster, part of the Hughes Aircraft Company, launched the first 60 channels in June and then moved on September 19 to 150 channels after the successful launch of a second RCA satellite. Suddenly for those in rural areas without a cable television service, or even without television at all, the choice ranges from the Arts and Entertainment Network, Bloomberg Direct and Cartoon Network to the Turner Classic Movies, The Weather Channel and USA Network, with more on the way. There are seven themed movie channels and 28 digital audio channels, not to mention the pay-per-view service offering up to 50 channels of movies, sports and special events, with Hollywood films starting as often as every 30 minutes. DirecTV declines to say how many subscribers the system has so far, but it claims that the Dollars 700 decoders, complete with 18-inch dishes, 'are flying off the shelves'. The system indicates how the revolution in communications and entertainment is gathering pace throughout the developed and even the not-so-developed world. Mr Rupert Murdoch's Hong Kong-based Star TV will next year launch a satellite system also with a capacity of up to 150 channels, using digital compression technology, developed in conjunction with NTL, the privatised engineering division of the IBA, that can squeeze 10 channels of television into the space now occupied by one. The initial plan is to run up to 40 channels, many in Asian languages. SES, the Luxembourg company that operates the Astra satellites, plans to launch its fourth 16-channel satellite at the end of this month, followed by two digital satellites, the first next year and the second in 1996. If all goes well, Europe too will have its 150-channel system, and to the now established range of thematic channels, catering for sports enthusiasts and children, will be added pay-per-view movies in some form or another. Almost every day, new channels are being launched to boost the multi-channel revolution. Over the past 10 days FilmNet, the Belgian-based pay television service, has started up subscription channels in Greece and Poland and in the UK five new satellite services have come on stream, including a British version of the American music channel VH-1, a mature version of MTV. MTV, which claims to be the largest television network in the world, reaching 250m homes in 63 countries, is at work on two new Asian channels. One 24-hour channel will be in Mandarin and aimed at China, Taiwan and Singapore. The other will be an English language service with some Hindi programming for India and south-east Asia. However, the extra choice goes far beyond entertainment as both news and business news channels expand. The BBC, encouraged by the government to play a commercial role abroad in addition to its public service responsibilities at home, is increasingly taking its World Television News service around the globe in competition with Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network. Early next year the corporation, in a partnership with Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, plans to launch two satellite channels in Europe - one devoted to news and the other to entertainment. In the summer the BBC also began, under contract, a 24-hour television news service in Arabic for the Middle East. The choice of business news is expanding dramatically - apart from regular business coverage from CNN. The CNBC business channel is already successful in the US. Now NBC SuperChannel is about to give it much greater business focus with the launch next year of the European Money Wheel segment of programming in the morning and the relay of CNBC in the afternoons. Early next year Dow Jones, publishers of the Wall Street Journal, and Flextech will launch European News. They are backing a similar service in Asia, and both Dow Jones in the US and Reuters, the international news and information group, are providing a subscription service direct to the computer screens of market professionals. When it makes little differ- ence whether business news is obtained from a computer screen or a TV screen, it is clear that the importance of the new media goes far beyond extra channels of entertain- ment. There are frequent signs that the long-predicted convergence between enter- tainment, computing and tele- communications is at last hap- pening, even though the elec- tronic superhighway probably excites politicians more than consumers at the moment. Cable, satellite and video cassettes will have a growing number of rivals to communicate words, pictures and ideas. The Internet has come from almost nowhere to become a significant medium of communication. According to some estimates, by the end of last year more than 7,000 CD-Rom titles were available. By the end of this year over 10m CD-Rom drives are expected to have been installed. New uses are being developed for old networks. British Telecom has already completed trials for digital video-on-demand services, using ordinary telephone lines. A full commercial trial, taking in about 2,500 homes, is due to get under way early next year. In the UK the cable industry argues that, while others only talk, it is at work laying the superhighway, encouraged by the fact that British cable companies can offer business and residential telecommunications as well as extra television channels. Already more than Pounds 1.5bn (out of a planned Pounds 10bn) has been invested in cable networks with the three largest players, TeleWest, a joint venture between US West and TCI; Nynex, the New York telephone company; and Bell Cablemedia owning franchises covering 7m homes. The penetration rates for cable television - the ratio between those who can subscribe and those who actually do - has stayed stubbornly low at about 21.5 per cent. But the speed at which new networks are being built means that even if the average penetration rate does not rise, the number of cable subscribers in the UK is likely to exceed the 1m mark by the turn of the year. Apart from developing telecommunications services, the cable companies are encouraging the growth of more cable exclusive programming to try to boost penetration rates. Channel One, a 24 hours a day television news channel to be launched by Associated Newspapers at the end of next month, will be available on the London Interconnect that links all the cable franchises in London. It should then spread to similar groupings of franchises in the Midlands and in the north of England. Last month the Mirror Group, publisher of the Daily Mirror, announced that it too would launch a cable channel, Live TV, based on entertainment and live events. While cable is growing in the UK, British Sky Broadcasting is also expanding and plans to launch its first video-on-demand services next year. In August BSkyB announced operating profits of Pounds 170m for the year to June and said then that its total number of paying subscribers was 3.45m, of which satellite dishes accounted for 74 per cent. There have been disputes about the size of the BSkyB audience but the latest figures from GfK, the marketing group, which excludes cable from its figures, suggest there were 2.716m satellite dishes in the UK at the end of August. Yet, despite the growing excitement about superhighways and new television channels, what is remarkable is how resilient many of the traditional broadcasters are. In the US, for instance, both Time Warner and Paramount, now owned by Viacom, are interested in starting their own networks. And NBC and CBS are considered attractive takeover targets again, partly because the rules preventing the networks owning both their own shows and the syndication rights have been lifted. In the UK, even though the number of channels has more than doubled, the new channels rarely get more than a third of the viewing in cable and satellite homes. The latest figures for the week ending September 18 show a 31.7 per cent share for the new channels, with the seven Sky channels taking 17.4 per cent. Indeed, as more and more entertainment choices became available, European cinema enjoyed what Screen Digest recently called 'a boom of almost unprecedented proportions' in 1993 - its best year at the box office since 1954.</p>

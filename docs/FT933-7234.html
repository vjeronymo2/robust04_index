			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Mine's a conglomerate How 68-year-old Colin Draper, former boss of Thomas Tilling in the US, got involved with his latest venture is one of those tales which will be better understood in the bar of the local golf club than in the City of London. Draper, who was awarded a CBE for his work in improving Anglo-American commercial links, wanted to return to England after 17 years in the US. At the same time an old colleague, Arthur Slater who once ran Tilcon, had a problem. He and a group of wealthy Britons owned a country club in the Portuguese Algarve which they wanted to develop. If only the project could be linked to their other private interests with strong cash flows, they would have a bankable project. A few dry sherries later and they had a conglomerate with interests ranging from a 50 per cent stake in a Siberian coal venture, to a hand gun manufacturer and the rights, in perpetuity, to stage the European Open golf championship. All that was lacking was management and a share quote. Enter Draper, followed by Ross Perot henchman Richard Poulden, 42, and Barbara Cartland's son Ian McCorquodale, 55, who is chairman of Debrett's Peerage. They will run the show after the European investors have injected their Dollars 250m of assets into Colorado's Caspen Oil in return for 175m shares. The headquarters will move to London and, hey presto, a tiny, loss-making oil company will be transformed into an acquisitive international conglomerate. A lot will depend on Caspen's projected strong cash flow living up to expectations. But the promoters have high hopes for their Russian venture, in particular. When the five coal washers have been bought and installed, Caspen has been guaranteed total profits of Dollars 21m a year for five years. It sounds like the sort of idea that Lord White, Hanson's 70-year-old US chief, might have thought up before he joined the establishment. Even so, it seems a jolly complicated way of financing a golf club in Portugal.</p>

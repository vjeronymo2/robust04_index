Military sources in Calabar,  the capital of Nigeria's Cross River State on Sunday [6 March],  said the "routine" visit was to Army units in the state,  including the disputed oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula. Informed  sources said the Army chief was in the area to reassure the  troops about Nigeria's diplomatic efforts to resolve the dipsute  peacefully.    According to reports in Calabar on Sunday, the situation in  the disputed territory was calm after reported skirmishes on 18  and 19 February. Nigeria has denied a Cameroonian report that  there was a clash in the area saying that its own troops were  fired on by Camerooninan gendarmes, but did not return fire.    Cameroon has taken the case to the United Nations and  informed the International Court of Justice at The Hague and the  Organisation of African Unity (OAU).    Nigeria has also intensified diplomatic efforts after it  accused France of introducing "an elemement of war" by sending  its paratroopers, a frigate and arms to Cameroon under their  defence pact. France last week sent a diplomatic mission to  Cameroon and Nigeria, while Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema  also met the leaders of the two countries in another diplomatic  move to avert hostilities.</p>

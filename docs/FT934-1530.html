			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Planning fee law to be changed The government announced yesterday that it intends to legislate to allow local authorities to set their own fees for planning applications. Fees will increase by 15 per cent from January 13 and a further 15 per cent from January 1995. Mr David Curry, planning minister, said the increases 'represent another important step towards applicants meeting the full costs incurred by local planning authorities in determining planning applications'. He said council tax payers should not have to pay for this service. The 15 per cent increase comes after rises of 20 per cent and 10 per cent last year and this year.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Gardening: Farewell to a gardener of rare vision - A woman whose skills spanned two societies Gardens are wonderfully ahead of schedule and, like those of you who are starting out on a new site, I find myself beginning with plants up walls. Unlike you, I find myself thrown back on old memories. Climbers are needing attention in this early season but, first, mine must pay a tribute to one of their great exponents. Last weekend, British gardening lost a special person when Alvilde Lees-Milne died in her 84th year. She was the wife of architectural historian James Lees-Milne; co-editor of the best-selling Englishwoman's Garden; and herself the maker of two post-war gardens of rare distinction. Neither a climber nor a rambler, Alvilde had spanned two different societies, southern France and post-war Gloucestershire. Nowadays, expatriate English export their own taste to their enclaves in France, but Alvilde stood for a subtle and opposite approach. She absorbed French style and formality, not merely in gardens but also in fashion, and tempered it to her later life in the western Cotswolds. Her mental vision of a garden was unusually Anglo-French. I remember our first encounter, from which I inferred (wrongly) that this old rose was waiting to show its prickles. Are you the young man who likes tree lupins but does not like herb gardens, she asked me. You should learn to like herb gardens and dislike tree lupins. Several of us were standing round over cocktails, having just won prizes for writing books, and I had no idea that my apt deflator was herself the owner of Britain's most stylish herb garden and had stood her ground aesthetically in many exchanges with Vita Sackville-West, with whom she had been an intimate friend. The Sissinghurst which you like so much, Alvilde told me firmly, is no longer Sissinghurst: these days, it is much too tidy. This was in the mid-1970s and she was planning to move from her big garden at Alderley Grange to something smaller, colder and much more limited. She found it at Essex House in Badminton, Gloucestershire, where she made her superb second garden far more quickly than I, meanwhile, made my first. Not only did she have a marvellous eye for climbing roses and vertical plants but that eye also valued a strong, formal framework, clipped in box hedging and topiary patterns long before Sir Roy Strong championed this style from a vantage point even further west. Only within this firmly-controlled framework did she let plants have their way, the English aspect to her Anglo-French aesthetic. At Sissinghurst, the female eye was more Oriental and romantic, whereas the firm framework came from the male half of the partnership. In Gloucestershire, Alvilde was every bit a match for her architectural partner; she did not want an unstructured feminine paradise and, on subsequent meetings, I came to realise that what had first sounded like coldness or even sharpness was, instead, a shy and exact reflection of this formal sense which showed in her view of a garden. She never relented on tree lupins, though. From Alvilde, I learnt to spread wall shrubs and young climbers on to a fan of long bamboo canes set against a wall, one for each young shoot. The stems will then grow apart without criss-crossing and will give you an open, well-furnished spread. Against her principles, however, I have also learned to bring back untidiness by never planting one climber when two will do. This weekend, when you buy the best of all climbing roses, the pale pink New Dawn, or agitate about the elusive white rose Sombreuil (which, Alvilde said, was neglected unjustly in England), remember to buy a later-flowering clematis and plant it beside each rose. The blue Perle D'Azur, or the small-flowered Viticellas or Texensis varieties - even The President, which comes earlier - will grow up through the roses and give you the further season which most books ignore. I have been slow to recognise the possibilities here, but they go beyond clematis and roses. I now have a climbing solanum scrambling through my favourite evergreen on walls: the cream-variegated Rhamnus, which also was a Lees-Milne favourite. The scarlet Eccremocarpus will scramble up through a climbing hydrangea. I have late-flowering clematis through the spring-flowering evergreen clematis Armandii. And I now mix wild sweet peas into the lower reaches of the yellow-flowered clematis Bill Mackenzie, a star turn on a sunny wall (which you can cut back this weekend to within 3ft of its base). Double up: break the rules and extend the season. Even rose Sombreuil is an admirable host for the vigorous clematis Jackmandii if you do not prune the clematis too hard, so encouraging it to reach above the rose and flower over its head. Once you begin these combinations, you will find that you double the scope of your house wall. My vision of the next 10 years is one of gardens in smallish spaces, planted in great (but selective) profusion, which break out from a slight framework of green hedging and edging; Sissinghurst, perhaps, as Alvilde knew it in its owners' later phase. She might have wished for a clearer continental outline; but then, I still like those tree lupins - and I have to say that I have never liked any herb garden except for hers.</p>

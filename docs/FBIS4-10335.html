			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Apr (NA) -- Raul Alfonsin, head of  the UCR [Radical Civic Union] executive board, made it clear  that despite the poor results achieved by the UCR, he "would  again sign" the so-called Olivos Pact. He stressed that he will  not "take a single backward step, or step aside" as party leader.    Shortly after 1930, Alfonsin conceded defeat in the  Constituent Assembly elections for the district of Buenos Aires  at the hands of the PJ [Justicialist Party]. He admitted that  this situation will force him "to ponder" before making a  decision on his next step.    The former president believes that the ticket headed by  [Buenos Aires Province] Governor Eduardo Duhalde won because  "the people voted based on government actions rather than on  constitutional issues." He denied that the Grand Front [FG]  victory in the federal capital had been prompted by a rejection  of the [Olivos] Pact. It was rather prompted by "a rejection of  government actions," he said.    In a news conference at the UCR executive board headquarters  last night, the former president said the numbers achieved by  the UCR "do not represent" the party's "greatest defeat in  history." He stressed that, quite to the contrary, "it  represents a victory, because the political peace has been  saved."    Alfonsin emphasized: "It was not the worst elections, and I  am very satisfied with our position because we managed to  enhance institutional democracy."    Alfonsin also confirmed that he trusts that the points  agreed  upon in the Olivos Pact that he signed with President Carlos  Menem "will be absolutely observed." He made it clear that "no  meeting has been scheduled" with the president within the next  few days.    Asked about the possibility of resigning as UCR executive  board head, Alfonsin stressed that he does not plan on taking a  single step aside, or backward step" because he is the UCR's  rightful leader. He emphasized that he feels "strongly  supported by half of the party" even though he is not supported  by Federico Storani's and Juan Manuel Casella's Convergence  Faction and metropolitan UCR leader Fernando De la Rua.    Nevertheless, the former president said that if the  executive  board plenary, which is scheduled to meet late this month, asks  him "such a thing," he would have to leave the UCR leadership,  even though he predicted that "this will not happen."    Alfonsin finally said that a national convention will be  called in September to establish the bases of an electoral  platform for the 1995 elections. He believes that the UCR  presidential ticket will be established "in October or November."</p>

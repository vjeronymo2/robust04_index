			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's private farms still a rare breed - Removing state control from farming is proving a slow process SIX MONTHS ago Mr Anatoly Chibatkov, a 52-year-old state farm director from Russia's grain-growing region of Volgograd , decided to leave the state farm and set himself up as a private farmer. So he bought himself a shiny, red tractor, applied for a plot of land - and then plunged into a conflict that has not only split his village of Gorodizhe, 30km outside Volgograd city, but is dogging many of Russia's farming regions. 'The situation here is like an agricultural battle,' said Mr Chibatkov, as he bumped along in a battered jeep over the land that he has now finally wrested from state control. By all accounts it is a battle that is being fought across much of Russia's vast terrain, as the republic attempts to introduce market economics into its huge and inefficient agricultural sector. In the two years since Russia embarked on its programme of agricultural reform its farming community has been deluged with new legislation and directives. These have had three main prongs. First, a drive to distribute former state land to new small, private farmers; second, an attempt to reorganise the huge state farms that have dominated Russian agriculture since collectivisation in the 1930s; and third, an attempt to break down the monopoly of the state distribution networks that supply farms with inputs and sell their produce. Seen from the Moscow offices of the Russian agriculture ministry, the statistics, so far, have been significant. In the past 18 months the number of private farmers in Russia has risen from a few hundred to nearly 250,000 and is predicted to reach a third of a million by the end of the year. At the same time, some 23,000 of the 26,000 state farms have officially reorganised themselves into shareholding companies or co-operatives. And though statistical information on the agricultural distribution networks is sparse, the appearance of new grain exchanges and small private shops across Russia suggests that, in some areas at least, the old state monopolies are being whittled away. Meanwhile, with the 1992 net grain harvest some 10 per cent higher than in 1991, most agricultural officials are now confident that the decline in Russian agriculture has been halted, if not yet reversed. 'Reforming the agricultural sector in Russia is harder than any other industrial sector, because it has traditionally been very conservative,' says Mr Valentin Denisov, head of agrarian policy at the agriculture ministry. He believes that, in spite of 'many existing political conflicts', market reforms are here to stay. But out on the farms scattered across Russia, the message is rather more mixed. Although the move to private farming has been the initiative that has so far attracted the most attention from the media and the West, private farmers still control only a tiny proportion of farming land and produce a mere 3 per cent of the overall commercial agricultural produce. Meanwhile, in the sector where reform will ultimately be most crucial - the huge state farming sector - 'reorganisation' has sometimes been little more than a renaming exercise. And although it is hoped that competition from private farmers might eventually infect the state farms with some entrepreneurial zeal, many state farms have become distinctly anti-market in their outlook as their brightest and most energetic specialists have left to set up their own private farms The story of Mr Chibatkov would seem to be a case in point. Eighteen months ago he decided to turn his 7,000 hectare (17,000-acre) grain and livestock farm into a joint stock company. So the state property was 'given' to the farm, shares distributed to all the farm workers - together with guarantees of future dividends - and attempts made to reverse declining production. at the farm. But within a year his workers were in revolt. Fed up with the new working regime and paper 'shares' that had failed to provide the promised dividend, they voted to oust Mr Chibatkov and turn themselves into a co-operative. In practice, this meant running the state farm much as before - although each of the 2,000 villagers was given 'rights' in a piece of land, the farm director continued to manage the land. 'We are trying to make the workers' brigades become financially self-accounting, but this has been difficult,' explains Mrs Tatiana Chuchmanova, the farm accountant. At this point Mr Chibatkov, together with two dozen of the youngest and most energetic villagers, used their new 'legal rights' to apply for land and machinery from the farm. The farm, reluctant to recognise this new 'law', refused to give them equipment - but after a long battle finally gave them 21 ha of land each, ready for the the winter ploughing. Barring any political turnabouts, they should now survive to the end of the year. Although the plots of land they received were too small to be viable as independent farms, they persuaded some of the other villagers to lease their state farm land and now have 90 ha. 'Ideally we would need three times more,' Mr Chibatkov says. At the same time, by setting up an equipment pool with five other farmers and using the contacts and know-how he gained as state farm director, Mr Chibatkov has acquired seed, credit and equipment. The local factories in Volgograd have sold his pool four tractors and two trucks, the local bank has given them a five-year loan, and the local agricultural research institute has provided them with some 100 tonnes of seed. But by all accounts Mr Chibatkov has been one of the luckier ones. Over in the agricultural Russian republic of Mordovia, for example, the picture for the republic's private farmers is considerably bleaker, not least because the local government is now locked in conflict between a reformist government, which supports land reform, and a conservative parliament, which is opposed to it. Mr Ivan Zavetkin, a farmer in the Mordovian village of Chamsinka, for example, set himself up as a private dairy and grain farmer several months before Mr Chibatkov. But with no tractor factory in Mordovia and no powerful contacts in the local government, he is still struggling to get access to the equipment he needs. The local agricultural bank says it has not received enough cash from Moscow to provide credit. The local state farm is insisting that it will only sell him grain seed if he sells most of his harvest back to the farm at reduced prices. And Mr Zavetkin's attempts to set up an equipment pool with the other farmers have failed, because their land is too widely scattered. For the moment Mr Zavetkin and his colleagues insist they have enough pigs and cows to survive, even if they are unable to sow their grain. But the dairy operation also labours under special difficulties. 'Private farmers have to sell their unpasteurised milk themselves in the market, or sell it to the state farm at very low prices,' explains Mrs Tamara Tureneva, Mordovian welfare minister. She says her attempts to set up a private milk factory have been foiled by local state farm 'Mafia'. For the moment, farmers like Mr Chibatkov remain fairly optimistic. 'We have our land, our seed and our tractors - we are ready for the market,' he says cheerfully. But the next - and ultimately most important - struggle will be persuading the local state farm that it should get ready for the market too.</p>

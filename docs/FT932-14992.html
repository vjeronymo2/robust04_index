			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Party puts policies before perks: Emiko Terazono on the group trying to clean up Japanese politics ON THE MAIN street of Nagata-cho, Japan's political centre, a group of middle-aged women climb into a tour bus to complete a day of politics and sightseeing with a boat ride around the Tokyo Bay and an evening variety show with the compliments of their local MP. Mr Yoshio Terasawa, a member of the Japan New Party, is still shocked at such sights. 'These practices have to go,' he says. As revelations of political corruption have heightened discontent towards the ruling Liberal Democratic party and existing opposition parties, the JNP has presented itself as the party which can clean up politics. He also points a finger at Japanese voters. 'Japanese politics has deteriorated because people choose politicians who give out the best perks,' says Mr Terasawa, ex-vice president of Nomura Securities and former executive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. The party is quickly winning support. According to a poll by the Nikkei Shimbun 6.7 per cent of 10,000 registered voters supported the JNP, up from 0.7 per cent last June, and 2.8 per cent in December, pushing it to the third most popular party. The tax evasion scandal involving Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former kingmaker of the LDP, has given impetus to public support for the party, which calls for a more transparent political system. It also calls for free trade, including the opening up of rice markets, and advocates curbing powers of the bureacracy. However, in spite of its different outlook on politics, the JNP faces the same problems as other parties - lack of funds. The JNP is at a disadvantage since it lacks of connections with corporations and labour unions which exisisting parties have. Donations from companies and individuals, which constitute over 50 per cent of revenues for the LDP, are also sparse for the newest opposition party. Companies are reluctant to provide funds due to falling profits. The JNP has raised Y300m by selling party hankies and T-shirts, but will have to market a lot more if it is going to support at least 60 candidates in the next general election slated for the second half of the year. Mr Terasawa is now trying to woo wealthy individuals and owners of small companies for donations. A single LDP candidate would need about Y300m, paying for flashy campaign cars, posters and payouts. 'It's shocking but it happens,' says Mr Terasawa, describing a case where Y10,000 notes, were distributed hidden in onigiri - Japanese rice ball snacks. But Japanese politics is slowly changing, says the 62 year old Mr Terasawa. 'We have the wind behind us, and we must not miss it,' he says. He adds attitudes of younger people are slowly changing old ways. However, some old ways die hard. Some voters still expect favours from a candidate. 'In the provinces, a good politician is someone who can build the extra bridge or a bullet train station,' says Mr Terasawa.</p>

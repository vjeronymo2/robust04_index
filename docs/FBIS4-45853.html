			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dominic Nathan] </F>   [Excerpts] Dengue fever is on the rise again and the  present spell of rain is making it more difficult to control its  spread.    The Environment Ministry (ENV) on Wednesday called for extra  public vigilance as the number of houses found breeding the  dengue-spreading Aedes mosquito doubled from 372 in February to  728 last month.    To date, a total of 260 cases of dengue fever have been  reported this year, with no deaths recorded so far.    In the last four weeks alone, 57 cases were reported,  compared with 12 for the same period last year.    An Environment Ministry spokesman said that the number of  breedings indoors in water-bearing containers such as pails,  jars, basins, tanks, vases and flower-pot plates had nearly  tripled over the last month.    Outdoor checks had similar findings, he added.    Most of the breedings were found in unwanted water-bearing  receptacles, gully traps, canvas or plastic sheets, and drains.  [Passage omitted]    Another mosquito-borne threat, malaria, has also been on the  rise, with 81 cases having been reported since the start of the  year, compared with 50 cases for the same period last year.    All, except five, of this year's cases were contracted  overseas.    The Environment Ministry reports that the incidence of  imported malaria among foreign workers has been increasing. In  1989, there were 25 cases. Last year's figure was 116. [Passage  omitted]</p>

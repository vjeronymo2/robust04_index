			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Bus company in administration Darlington Transport Company, a council-owned bus operator, went into administration yesterday in the wake of fierce competition between rival operators in the County Durham town. Mr Nick Wallis, chairman of the council's transport committee, said: 'The financial viability of DTC has been smashed beyond repair.' The Labour-controlled council blamed the government's deregulation policy and the sales process it has imposed on council-owned bus companies for the collapse of the 90-year-old business, which faces liquidation. But it also blamed Stagecoach, the Perth-based company which this week started offering free travel for five weeks in Darlington, largely on the same routes as DTC. Stagecoach has registered to run services in the town from December 12. The company, which obtained a Stock Exchange listing last year, has often clashed with the competition authorities. Fierce competition erupted between bus companies in many cities when the 1985 Transport Act became law. It swept away many restrictions and allowed new operators to compete for business. In July, when DTC had an annual turnover of Pounds 2.6m, net assets of Pounds 400,000, 60 buses and 140 employees, the council offered it for sale by open competitive tender. Of 10 indicative offers it selected three companies - Badgerline, Stagecoach subsidiary Busways and Yorkshire Traction. Last month Yorkshire Traction, which submitted the highest price, was chosen as preferred bidder. But, the council says, Stagecoach then acquired Cleveland Transit, a move which emphasised its acquisition strategy. Busways then started recruiting DTC drivers to work in Darlington, offering a Pounds 1,000 bonus, higher basic rates of pay and three years' job guarantee. By last Friday about 70 DTC employees had resigned. Last week Yorkshire Traction and Badgerline withdrew their bids for DTC. Stagecoach refused to comment yesterday.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading TURNOVER in stock index futures fell sharply as leading securities houses remained on the sidelines for most of the session with little in the way of economic features on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the March contract opened at 2,566, which proved to be the low of the day, with sizeable two-way business conducted mainly by independent dealers. Light selling was seen at midsession, but the positive showing on Wall Street following a slow start, boosted by better than anticipated US durable goods figures for January, generated buying interest for March from a number of leading securities houses. This developed into a squeeze late in the session, sending the contract forward to reach 2,587, the high of the day, before light selling in the dying minutes saw it rel-inquish some of the gain. Turnover reached a poor 3,365 contracts, with March ending at 2,584, some 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Dealers reported a more lively session in traded options, where turnover rose to 30,827 lots. Barclays, which released figures, was the busiest stock option, trading 1,869 contracts with the September 360 calls particularly active.</p>

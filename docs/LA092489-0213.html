			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN PULLS OUT A 31-28 VICTORY OVER CENTRAL STATE  </P> <P> Chalk up another statistic for the circular file.  </P> <P> Up until two weeks ago, Central (Okla.) State had a 59-7-1 record over a  12-season span when leading at the half.  </P> <P> That record is now 59-9-1. And 0-1 in the past day during games in which it led  in the final 1:20.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge drove 59 yards for the game-winning touchdown in the final  minute Saturday for a 31-28 victory over Central State before a crowd of 3,050  at North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> Sherdrick Bonner, CSUN's quarterback who spent much of the game either on his  back or scrambling for his life, hit Anthony Harris with a 17-yard scoring pass  with 15 seconds left to pull out the win for the Matadors (2-2).  </P> <P> Just following directions, he said afterward.  </P> <P> "(Harris) signaled to me to run a fade route and I caught his signal," Bonner  said.  </P> <P> Indeed, the final drive was a minute-long Bonner-at-the-Improv.  </P> <P> CSUN's winning march started at its own 41 with only 80 seconds remaining.  Bonner passed to Albert Fann for six yards, then scrambled for six more and a  first down at the Central State 47.  </P> <P> But after a nine-yard loss on a sack and an imcomplete pass, the Matadors were  facing third and 19 at their own 44.  </P> <P> No problem for Bonner, as the cool junior found Tony Young over the middle for  a 29-yard gain.  </P> <P> After another incomplete pass, Bonner scrambled for three yards, then hit Young  for five more on the Central State 19.  </P> <P> That set up a fourth and two and Bonner again called his own number, diving for  a first down.  </P> <P> On the next play, he found Harris in the right corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> Abo Velasco, who made three field goals and was perfect after touchdowns, added  the extra point for the final margin.  </P> <P> "They have a helluva team," said Fann, CSUN's tailback who emerged battered and  bruised after rushing for a game-high 137 yards in 25 carries. "They're the  fastest team we've played against."  </P> <P> The Bronchos led at the half, 21-10, but lost that advantage in the third  quarter when CSUN rallied to tie. They fell behind with less than four minutes  remaining, then went ahead on a 40-yard pass from Ben Morrison to Glen Braxton  with 1:25 left.  </P> <P> Fann's second touchdown of the game, a three-yard run, tied the score, 21-21,  with 3:24 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> It was set up by a spectacular interception by Preston Hayslette, who pulled in  a pass that was deflected by Clayton Bamberg, CSUN's safety, at the Central  State 38.  </P> <P> Terry West, the Bronchos' tight end, sustained what later was diagnosed as a  broken neck on the play. He and teammate James Caldwell both went for  Morrison's pass, along with Bamberg, causing a collision.  </P> <P> West was taken off the field by ambulance and driven to Northridge Medical  Center.  </P> <P> The interception was one of five Central State turnovers.  </P> <P> CSUN's play was also sloppy. The Matadors fumbled three times -- all in the  first half -- and were penalized 11 times for 85 yards.  </P> <P> Central State converted two fumbles into touchdowns in a span of 1:16 during  the second quarter.  </P></p>

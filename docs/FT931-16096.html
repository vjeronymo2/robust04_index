			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses halved before the close THE Bundesbank kept the London stock market guessing yesterday, failing to cut its key lending rates but then reducing money market repurchase rates. UK blue chip stocks, down by 20 points on the FT-SE 100 scale just before noon, halved their losses before the end of the session. Second tier stocks continued to move steadily higher as investors bought the smaller capital goods and consumer issues, which are expected to show the first benefits from recovery in the domestic economy. Retail trading volume, which shows the degree of investor activity in equities, remained high, recording a money value of Pounds 1.33bn on Wednesday; daily retail totals have begun to move above the levels recorded in the final quarter of 1992, themselves significantly better than earlier in the year. At the final reading the FT-SE Index was down 9.5 at 2,816.5, having touched 2,805.5 earlier in the day. The initial selling bout was strengthened by technical selling of Footsie stocks by securities houses arbitraging against the March contract on the FT-SE Index. At least three sizeable trad-ing programmes went through the stock market as arbitrage positions were unwound. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, never looked back after a firm opening and ended the session 21 points ahead at a new all-time high of 2,940.3. The wits remarked that the Mid 250 Index was benefiting at present from the absence of a futures contract - Smith New Court, the UK marketmaker, intends to plug this gap but its new Mid 250 future made a very quiet debut yesterday. UK traders refused to be upset by international developments, largely ignoring increasing tensions over Iraq. The cut in German repo rates was seen as a move in the right direction and lower rates in the Netherlands and Switzerland also encouraged London expectations that interest rates are headed downwards. The doubling of overnight lending rates in Ireland came well after the close of the UK stock market. Seaq volume increased to 755.7m shares from the 701m of the previous session, reflecting both the arbitrage trading programmes in Footsie stocks and the continued demand for the second tier issues. The absence so far of the much-rumoured rights issues helped sentiment, and underlying buoyancy was also reflected in renewed bid speculation, albeit among some well-known takeover favourites. In banks, TSB resumed its place as target for a range of rumoured bid predators. Optimism for recovery in the economy was encouraged by a trading report from Kwik Save, a leading retail discount group, and by reports of good Christmas trading by leading stores in the US. Many analysts believe that the shakeout in UK equities is little more than an expected bout of profit-taking in a stock market set on a bullish course. At Nomura Research Institute, Mr Nicholas Knight, one of the most bullish strategists, rejected suggestions that the market was over-bought. He sees sterling's strength and developments in German rates as raising the probability of a further decline in UK base rates. A firm pound will also reduce fears that overseas investors will back away from the expected flood of UK government funding and equity rights issues.</p>

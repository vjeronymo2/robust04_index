Pries: "Rebuff"] </F>   [Text] "Disrespect of laws," "impertinence," "deeply  disappointed," "most concerned" -- it is a long time since words  like these were last heard in U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations.  Christopher went to Beijing to request respect for "The  Universal Declaration on Human Rights," a respect to which Bill  Clinton wants to link the most-favored-nation status for Chinese  exports to the United States. However, the guest was coolly  told that China had "a concept of its own" regarding human  rights and -- if Washington could afford it at all -- Beijing  could, if necessary, even do without that particular favor.    True, by the standards of the complacent West, one will  hardly be able to approve of the way in which China treats  political opponents. Whether such standards are applicable for  the huge Middle Kingdom, however, remains dubious. In a  nutshell, "China's concept" of human rights consists in  guaranteeing an improvement of the living conditions for the  more than 1 billion Chinese. A great deal remains to be done in  this connection and Beijing will be measured by the Chinese  themselves if and when it fulfills the promise. Experience has  shown that no one can force a different concept on the Chinese  leadership from the outside. Even less so if the advocates of  "universal human rights" prove to be hypocritical. Did the  United States care for human rights at all when the "Chinese  card" could still be played as a trump against Moscow? And how  would it want to guarantee the most primitive human rights if  China were to experience catastrophes like the current ones in  the crumbling Soviet State and in the Balkans?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A high-ranking NATO officer has confirmed that the  AWACS planes patrolling in Hungary's airspace contributed to the  shooting down two weeks ago of four Serb aircraft that had  violated the UN air exclusion zone over Bosnia.    The NATO European Command's deputy chief of staff  responsible  for operations said that NATO was not surprised when Budapest  asked that no AWACS planes should be in Hungarian airspace at a  time of a potential NATO air strikes in Bosnia. However, in  order to have effective intelligence it was necessary for NATO  to obtain data from the AWACS planes located over Hungary.    The general also said that NATO was in constant radio  contact  with Hungarian Government organs and the Hungarian military air  defense leadership.</p>

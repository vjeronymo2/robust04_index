			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Swedes go to ground while summer days are long: Where is everybody? Hugh Carnegy finds them returning from their holidays IF YOU have been wondering when your Swedish client will reply to your fax, the chances are that next week will bring an answer. All over the country, families will spend the weekend packing up the country cottage, mooring the boat and heading reluctantly back to the city at the end of another long annual break that is a traditional feature of Sweden's short summer. Despite the toughest recession for 50 years, which has seen the economy shrink for three years in a row, and an almost incessant national debate about how to sustain the country's cherished position as an industrial force, the four- to five-week summer holiday remains entrenched. Many companies still shut down production for the duration and government offices are maintained on skeleton staffs. Tourists visiting Stockholm find to their irritation that many restaurants close. It was not uncommon in July for calls to senior executives and officials to be answered by a recorded message or a security officer saying 'Ring back on August 9.' Given that a large part of Sweden's problem has been a lack of industrial competitiveness, the long holiday might seem an indulgence it can no longer afford. But it does not appear to be under great threat. 'I don't think this is a problem that should be exaggerated,' says an economist at SAF, the employers' federation. 'After all, we can't have our holidays in August instead of July, the Swedish climate doesn't function like that.' Many Swedes also argue that the country has in any case been making striking gains in competitiveness without abandoning the summer holiday. The strong devaluation of the krona last August has helped produce a 20 per cent improvement in Sweden's competitive position this year. Wage agreements have also come down sharply. Absenteeism has been curbed by cuts in government sick pay schemes. Tax reforms have seen basic corporate tax fall from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. Some holiday schedules have been altered. Trade unions at Saab, the car maker, agreed to split this year's five-week break into three to avoid disrupting the start of production of the company's new 900 model. At Volvo, the four-week holiday was put back a week to overlap for at least one week with holidays at Renault, its French partner. According to SAF figures, Swedish hourly labour costs have fallen from ranking second only to Germany last year to seventh this year in a comparison with 13 western industrial countries. Sweden is now cheaper than the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark, though 15 per cent more expensive than France, about 20 per cent more expensive than Japan and the US and over 30 per cent more expensive than the UK. Without the currency effect, the surviving features of the 'Swedish model' would be more obvious. The overall tax burden in Sweden, for example, is almost 60 per cent of GDP, compared with an EC average of just over 40 per cent. Employers' contributions have been cut, but are still 31 per cent of salary. Wage differentials remain narrow, making employment of young or low-skilled people comparatively expensive. There is much debate over the high cost of the country's generous child care and maternity/paternity allowances. Currently, however, employers must allow couples a total of one year off between them for the birth of a new child. And then there are holidays. The basic statutory annual holiday entitlement is about to be cut from 27 to 25 working days, on top of public holidays. In practice, many people receive more. According to the Finance Ministry, government workers get between 30 and 36 days, depending on their age. Most is taken in July, before the days shorten again. Some officials and businessmen say that if Sweden joins the EC, as it intends, holidays may have to shift back to mesh more closely with the European pattern of August holidays. For now, though, July is still for enjoying the precious long days, never mind the recession.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Private View: English thoroughbred shows his class - Top trainer Henry Cecil can be flippant about himself but never about horseflesh. As Derby day draws near, he is looking like the front runner SPRING IS cantering into summer and it is time to get in form for the greatest popular festival of the English season, the Epsom Derby on June 2. Where better to start than Warren Place, Newmarket? Name: Henry Cecil. Age 50. Form: first outing 1969. Nine times champion trainer, twice Derby winner. Wayward as a colt but has trained on well. A stayer. Has first three ante-post Derby favourites, Tenby, Commander in Chief, Armiger (all owned by Khaled Abdulla, a Saudi prince). Conformation: over 18 hands, long legs, small rump, easy gait. Pedigree: direct descendant of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, chancellor to Queen Elizabeth I of England. Twin son of the Hon. Henry Cecil (killed in action in North Africa, aged 28) and Elizabeth Rohays Burnett, daughter of 13th baronet of Leys (Crathes Castle). Schooled: at Newmarket by trainer stepfather ('Uncle Cecil') Boyd-Rochfort. Sunningdale Prep (failed Eton entrance), crammer and Canford, Dorset. Nine O levels. Nearest university Cambridge (14 miles). First wife Julie is daughter of famed trainer Sir Noel Murless. Outlook: soulful eye, Mephistophelean smile, the 'Cecil nose'. Bold, rakish, eccentric. Jilly Cooper-style hero. Looks genuine. * * * There were two Porsches in the drive when I drew up at Henry Cecil's house, a riot of flowers around the satellite dish on the front lawn and a kitsch nude arching backwards on the coffee table. Cecil can be flippant about himself but never about horseflesh. I asked him which he preferred. 'On the whole I find horses probably easier. I like people, but they can be disappointing. I think horses are very noble by comparison.' What does it mean to say that a horse is noble? 'If you know horses it's rather like a dog. I mean, if you've got a mean and miserable dog you would probably get the feeling it's miserable. You can tell a lot about a horse from his outlook - the way he looks and whether he's got a sort of good clean eye.' Outlook? 'People have a good face or a bad face. Do you trust a person with his eyes too close together? Ears are important in a person. There are people who use themselves properly when they walk and people who don't; people have good feet and bad feet, good limbs and bad limbs.' He added: 'I never buy a horse with small ears because it's always ungenuine.' Meaning? 'They don't try.' Why should a horse with small ears not be a tryer? 'You tell me. It's a fact.' Do other people agree with you? 'I haven't asked them. But I've had a lot of horses with small ears and they've never been any good - wouldn't try. Arkle had very long ears, and Mill Reef. Conformation is very important.' You once said you judge a horse from behind, to see if it has the swagger of a beautiful girl, I prompted him. 'Yeh, a swagger . . . means they're putting their hocks underneath them. A lot of power comes from the hock.' Cecil speaks in small bursts, each ending on an interrogatory note with a barely audible 'mmm?' or 'yeh?'. He wants you to agree. I said: I suppose you're not enough of a chauvinist to compare fillies to women, are you? 'Probably very similar. Very similar. They've all got a lot of character. They just a take a little bit of understanding. When you have a good one they're very genuine. You can't beat a good filly, But you know, you can't push. If you've had a bad winter, cold spring, you might find they just don't come. You've just got to sit and wait and when the weather changes suddenly they sort of open up like flowers. If you force the pace they just go backwards.' The horticultural analogy is not an accident. Cecil loves his garden, specialising in old-fashioned roses which derive, like him, from Scottish briar. He can rhapsodise about a rare blue flower he found on the nearby Devil's Dyke. Do successful trainers have green fingers, like gardeners? 'I can't judge other people. But I know a lot of my work is just instinct. I just sort of have a feeling about things.' In my limited experience horses are either stupid or neurotic. Cecil would have none of it. 'Some can be highly-strung. Depends entirely how they're treated. If you treat them with respect and get their confidence you can eliminate a lot of that. They're not stupid. They never forget.' Are there any delinquents? 'It's amazing how they can come round. Now and again you get the odd horse which is bad-tempered. But I might have one out of 160 every two or three years. There are three things you need: patience, patience and patience.' Do you talk to your horses? 'I do in a sort of silly language like you do to a dog . . . I talk to my dogs in a ridiculous way. I crawl all over the floor with a Bonio in my mouth. Horses like attention. Really good horses love attention. And they know when they're good, too.' Cecil's handling of horses is a matter of record. I asked him what he was like with people. 'I'm not a snob. I don't find I have any difficulty in socially mixing with anybody. I can deal with people. I've had to deal with them. I know what you can ask them, what to expect.' Are you good at man-management? 'I like to think I am, yeh. I have a staff here which very seldom anybody leaves: all work well together, nobody's cracking a whip. I employ people for maybe seven, eight hours a day and after that their life's their own. We've all got to work, so let's enjoy it.' Are you a convert to the work ethic, I asked. You had a riotous youth. 'Yeh. I was quite wild. My father was quite wild, from what I hear. I'm much more settled now. I mean, leopards don't change their spots, do they? I do like a little bit of fun, I like the funny side of things. But I'm not a very social person.' You're more grown-up now? 'I don't think I'll ever grow up. I've always got a wild streak in me. I don't want to grow up really. I rather like being sort of . . . village idiot now and again. I like people taking the mickey out of me actually. I like to be the slight buffoon, yeh? Another thing: I think it's an advantage in a lot of ways. You can sort of give that impression but underneath . . . if you get them to relax then you're on a very good wicket, you're holding the cards. I thought of the nine O levels. Are you much brighter than you let on? 'I'm not a sort of intellectual, but I wouldn't say I'm stupid.' Though born with a silver-plated spoon this Henry is no Hooray. 'I hate that sort of boring facade,' he said. 'I find it pathetic and uninteresting - characterless - the cavalry twills and club ties. I used to go racing in purple and yellow check trousers and white shoes, to Goodwood. I like more conservative clothes now, blues, greys, herring-bone jackets.' Cecil has an enormous wardrobe (last estimate 150 shirts, 100 pairs of shoes, especially Gucci). He does not feel middle-aged. 'No, I'm still very juvenile in that sort of way. Not altered very much. Probably one's work . . . one doesn't fool around or play as much as one used to because with one's business and work it's harder. I've got responsibility now. Got to go on working. I was divorced . . . Quite expensive.' Cecil's divorce from Julie, a trainer in her own right whose father owned Warren Place, was the talk of Newmarket and cost him a number of friends. He asked me not to repeat his thoughts on it. He is married again, to the much younger Nathalie Payne. We talked about the changing sociology of English racing. Was old money easier to work with than new? 'Not really. I'm lucky. I train for some very nice people. Some very good new owners have come in in the last few years.' Is racing more egalitarian? 'Yes, you've got syndicates and partnerships and firms owning horses and every sort of thing, and it's one big club. I mean, everybody plays their part in the thing, whether it be the butcher, the candlestick-maker or whether it be Lord Howard de Walden or our friends from the Middle East. 'There's opportunity for everybody. You don't have to be a very rich man, you don't have to have thousands of horses to be successful. There is always that marvellous element of luck. A lot of good horses have been bought very very cheaply - we're talking about Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 10,000, yeh?' If stables were schools, what school would yours be? 'Well, I suppose it would definitely be an Eton or a Harrow, wouldn't it? With the inmates, the quality of horses. But it wouldn't be run on those lines.' However, Cecil admitted that, like a successful headmaster, he can afford to tell owners to take their horses away if they are not passing their exams. But the business is becoming ever more competitive. Newmarket, like the City of London, may lose out to equine centres abroad, Cecil said, particularly if the government did not stop 'bleeding and bleeding the racing industry' through VAT and betting tax. 'They're very shortsighted. I mean, I'm a Conservative. I don't know why. I really don't. A Labour government would probably be better for racing.' The languid Cecil became animated. 'I always think if you can't do anything in life, be a politician. I mean some of them are so stupid, aren't they? Aren't they? You go into the House of Commons, the House of Lords at six o'clock at night and they're all plastered, aren't they? Tripping over each other.' The mention of drink reminded me. Are you a teetotaller now? I asked him. 'I don't drink very much. I drink beer. I don't drink spirits. I'm not very good when I drink a lot, so I'm careful.' Champagne? 'I'm not very keen on champagne.' You have to believe a man - especially one with the ears of a Derby winner.</p>

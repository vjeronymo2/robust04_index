			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Social housing programme in Croydon MJ GLEESON GROUP's southern construction division has won a Pounds 9.14m contract for a mixed development of social housing, associated facilities and infrastructure on 12 acres of former railway sidings at Davidson Road, Croydon. For a six-strong consortium led by South London Family Housing Association, the scheme will take 21 months to complete. Gleeson will design and build 216 two,three and four-bedroom houses - five of which will have wheelchair units - together with seven one and two-person flats. Some 70 per cent of these will provide rented accommmodation, with the remainder offered for shared ownership. As part of the development, Gleeson will also design and build two hostels and a shop. Each hostel will have six independent units of bedroom and kitchen, as well as communual dining, lounge and play rooms. Additionally, to alleviate flooding that occurs regularly in the area, Gleeson will pipejack a 1.7 metre diameter flood relief sewer underneath the nearby railway line. The other members of the consortium are Croydon Churches, Tower, Croydon Peoples and Crystal Palace Housing Associations, and London &amp; Quadrant Housing Trust.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Manuel Gonzalez and Jose Garrido report: "`Cost Cutting </F> Through Dismissals a Mistake'"]    [Excerpts] Madrid -- Following his reelection for a fourth  term as leader of the employers' organization, CEOE [Spanish  Confederation of Employers Organizations] Chairman Jose Maria  Cuevas showed himself self-critical yesterday in stating that  "we employers have harmed ourselves in adjusting the labor cost  by reducing personnel and not by freezing or reducing wage  increases."    In his speech, Jose Maria Cuevas advised CEOE members to  surmount the crisis by reducing wages and preserving jobs, and  explained that "by cutting personnel we immediately create  increases in social benefits that we ourselves must then meet,  since employers pay 49 percent of the total revenue of the  public administrations as a whole." [passage omitted]    In his speech to the CEOE electoral assembly, Cuevas  outlined  the main guidelines for the next four years, which involve a  commitment to change in various spheres, such as openness, the  environment, training, innovation and technological development,  enterprises' external promotion, reinvestment of profits, the  promotion of careers in business, and so forth.    The CEOE electoral assembly reelected Jose Maria Cuevas for  a  fourth term by approximately 80 percent of the votes and elected  the new Executive Council, comprising 90 members, 42 of whom are  new, and the Executive Committee, with six deputy chairmanships.  [passage omitted]    Cuevas avoided assessing the new General Workers Union  Confederal Executive Committee, but called on the trade unions  to negotiate, dwelt on his message that an in-depth review of  the pensions system must be conducted, and backed better fiscal  treatment for complementary systems.    Last, the CEOE chairman referred to the international  situation and expressed his concern that the European Union is  losing ground to other large areas of the developed world. "The  reasons for these losses are wages and contributions, the  reduction of investments that are going to other areas, the  weight of the public sector, and the fact that every private  sector employee must keep two people, including pensioners,  officials, and so forth."    He advocated a reduction of the state's weight in the  economy: "All enterprises that are viable in the private sector  must be returned to the market, regulations and useless  administrative burdens must be reduced, and insofar as the state  adjusts to its role, it will be possible to reduce taxes and  social charges."

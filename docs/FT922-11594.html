			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Good news and bad about charges - Unit Trusts / Murray Johnstone's decision to reduce the front-end load may increase competition COMPETITION HAS shown its face in the unit trust industry during the past quarter. Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund management group, cut the initial charges on its trusts to 1 per cent, substantially reducing the cost of investing. This was not the first time in the industry that initial charges had been reduced. Lazards does not have so-called 'front end loads' on its trusts; but the minimum investment for its funds is Pounds 5,000, whereas the Murray Johnstone funds require a minimum of just Pounds 500. Initial charges are included within the 'bid-offer spread' that unitholders pay. Investors pay the offer price, but on selling receive the bid price, which in the average trust is 6 per cent lower. In other words, the fund in which the unitholder invests must grow by 6 per cent before he breaks even. On the Murray Johnstone trusts, spreads will vary between 1.78 and 4.22 per cent. This means that investors in its funds will have a head start: their investments will have to grow by only between 2 and 4 per cent before they earn their money back. But the news is not all good. Murray Johnstone is clawing back some of this gain by increasing its annual management charge from 1 to 1.5 per cent. A higher management fee will act as a drag on performance over a long period; however, there are plenty of other management groups which already charge a 1.5 per cent annual fee on top of a 5 per cent-plus initial charge. Other fund managers will doubtless claim that they can produce better investment performance than Murray Johnstone, which has a moderate long-term record (although its funds did well in 1991). But the change may prompt other fund management groups to follow suit, and thus create greater competition in the industry. In the US, 'no load' mutual funds are common, as are 'low load' funds, such as Murray Johnstone's, where initial charges are below average. In the UK, the industry has been held back by the fact that most unit trusts are sold by tied agents and independent financial advisers. For such people, the incentive to sell is a 3 per cent commission, which the management company reclaims from the unitholder via the initial charge. Without an initial charge, therefore, the management company cannot pay an initial commission, and thus may find that its products are not sold. Murray Johnstone hopes to get round the problem in three ways. Some advisers already charge fees, or rebate commission, and so may not be put off by Murray's charging structure. Some investors will buy direct from the company. The third route is that Murray Johnstone will use its extra 0.5 per cent annual management fee to pay 'renewal commission' to those advisers who keep client money in its trusts for a year. It will be a while before Murray Johnstone's move can be properly judged. But if its funds move up the performance tables over the next year, then, under 'best advice' rules, more advisers may be forced to recommend them. A boost for Peps THE BUDGET change in personal equity plan rules released unit trusts from the shackles that had previously chained them. At last, investors can place a full Pounds 6,000 in a unit trust Pep. Unit trust managers M&amp;G and Fidelity had both moved into the investment trust market during 1991-92, to take advantage of the fact that investment trust new issues qualified for the Pounds 6,000 limit. Now they can concentrate their marketing firepower on promoting their existing unit trust ranges. Fidelity, for example, is offering nine Peps, eight of which are linked to the following trusts: UK Growth, Special Situations, Recovery, Growth &amp; Income, Income Plus, European, 1992 European Opportunities and the International Pep. The ninth is linked to its European Values Investment Trust. The change is likely to mean a decline in the old top-up Peps, in which a selection of blue-chip shares was added to a Pounds 3,000 unit trust investment to make up the full Pounds 6,000. Now companies will simply offer a unit trust covering the full Pep allowance. Another possibility is that the ability to attract Pounds 6,000 into a Pep will allow unit trust managers to reduce costs to investors. Someone who can put in the full allowance may be able to negotiate a reduced initial charge. Either way, the change in the rules is likely to be good news for both managers and investors. The former will have a bigger slice of the savings market; the latter will be able to get a larger diversified portfolio, at what will probably be a reduced cost. Exeter breaks new ground THERE ARE more than 1,400 unit trusts, so it is rare to find one launched in a truly new area. But it did happen in the first quarter of 1992, with the launch of the first trust to be based on investment trust warrants. Exeter Fund Managers, which specialises in the split-capital investment trust sector, was behind the trust, and now has a complete range of split-capital funds - with trusts based on capital, income and zero shares as well. Warrants, which give the buyer the right to buy shares at a set price, are highly speculative instruments, and thus the risks involved in such a trust could be high. But Exeter is building in a safeguard by putting 40 per cent of the portfolio into zero preference shares, which should produce steady capital growth. Minimum investment in the fund is Pounds 1,000, with an initial charge of 6 per cent and an annual management fee of 1 per cent.</p>

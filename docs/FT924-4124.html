			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Norway expects upturn NORWAY'S central bank said yesterday it expected a moderate upswing in the economy in the period to 1996, with low inflation and a continued rise in the current account surplus, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The bank warned the upturn would be insufficient to reduce unemployment unless wage growth is restrained. Unemployment is currently 7.9 per cent, a post-war record. The central bank calculates that if wage growth can be restrained to 2 per cent below Norway's main trading partners, there could be a modest decline in unemployment up to 1996, followed by stronger falls. Norway's GDP growth rate is expected to slow markedly in 1993 to 0.6 per cent from 2.6 per cent this year, and 1.1 per cent in 1991.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dyson ahead but interim reduced Despite a sharp fall in interest receivable, J&amp;J Dyson, the Sheffield-based refractories group with interests in trailers and builders' merchanting, lifted first half profits by 18 per cent but cut its interim dividend as margins remained under 'the most severe pressure'. Mr Richard Field, chairman, said the pre-tax increase for the six months to end-September - from Pounds 340,574 to Pounds 401,340 - was spread across all group businesses 'but very little of the improvement may be attributed to any general increase in economic activity.' Net interest receivable dropped from Pounds 124,708 to Pounds 16,963. Turnover was flat at Pounds 20.9m. The reduced interim distribution of 1.5p (2p) is payable from earnings of 2.03p (1.65p) per share.</p>

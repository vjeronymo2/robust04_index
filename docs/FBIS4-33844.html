			<p>BFN     [Text] Very important negotiations will be conducted in  Montevideo, Uruguay, by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who,  along with a distinguished entourage, left at noon today.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording, in progress] ... will  sign notes on the opening of specifications for dredging the  Martin Garcia channel. This is extremely important for smooth  navigation on the Parana River upstream and especially up to  Asuncion.    An issue that surely will be discussed involves the filling  of the Yacyreta Dam, which has caused many conflicts in the past  few days. This filling has been postponed and points of  agreement have been reached. It has been confirmed that these  points of agreement will be discussed with Argentine President  Carlos Saul Menem.    As we said earlier, Wasmosy, Menem, and the president of  Uruguay will sign these treaties on the dredging of the Martin  Garcia channel. [end recording]</p>

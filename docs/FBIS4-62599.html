			<p>BFN     [Text] A coup is planned in Crimea with all-round support  from the Russian Federation. This statement was made in a  Monday [16 May] interview with INTERFAX-UKRAINE by the leader of  the Ukrainian RUKh (Movement) Vyacheslav Chornovil. According  to him, on 20 May the Crimean parliament intends to return to  the question of restoring the 1992 Crimean constitution which  actually proclaims Crimea an independent state.    Chornovil thinks that after deciding on dual citizenship all  key posts and control over processes in Crimea would be given  over to Russian teams. He was also alarmed by the fact that  high-ranking officials from Russia are taking part in the work  of the Crimean parliament.    He stressed that in their speeches at plenary sessions of  the  Crimean parliament the head of the CIS committee of the Russian  State Duma Konstantin Zatulin and a member of the Russian  presidential council Andronik Migranian supported the idea of  the new Crimean constitution and even promised all-round  assistance in drafting it by several Russian MP's. Chornovil  claimed that Russia has set up a constitutional development  foundation which is involved in drafting the new Crimean  constitution.    According to the RUKh leader, Russian high-ranking officials  are prompting to Crimean leaders the idea of Crimean membership  in the CIS and joint command as an independent member and  suggesting that Crimea raise the question of the withdrawal of  Ukrainian armed forces from its territory.    Chornovil said RUKh is planning to appeal to the UN Security  Council, the CSCE as well as the president, parliament and  Supreme Court of Ukraine to take immediate resolute steps  following the attempts of the Crimean leadership to violate  Helsinki accords.</p>

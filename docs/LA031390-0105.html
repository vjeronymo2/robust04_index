			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL MEETINGS;  </P> <P> TAGLIABUE'S PLEA HELPS SAVE INSTANT REPLAY  </P> <P> Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's impassioned plea to the NFL's club owners to keep  instant replay officiating saved it Monday, owners said afterward.  </P> <P> "Most of us went into the meeting to vote it down," Ed McCaskey, board chairman  of the Chicago Bears, said. "And our club voted against it as planned. But  Paul's sensational pitch changed the minds of about 15 others.  </P> <P> "There'll be instant replay again this year thanks to Paul and (New Orleans  General Manager) Jim Finks, who both said just the right things."  </P> <P> Considered dead 24 hours earlier when five of the seven members of the  competition committee voted against it, replay officiating was authorized for  another season after six hours of debate at the NFL's annual convention.  </P> <P> Needing 21 votes, it won, 21-7. The votes against came from Cincinnati,  Buffalo, Phoenix, Chicago, Tampa Bay, Kansas City and the New York Giants.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't have passed without the two-minute amendment," Finks said,  referring to a stipulation that, this year, the replay official must reverse a  call within two minutes or let it stand.  </P> <P> Said Tagliabue: "This countered one of the big objections -- a perception that  (replay officiating) takes too much time. Actually, replays added an average of  only 1 minute 55 seconds to last year's games."  </P> <P> The league is considering plans to install a two-minute clock in each stadium  to keep fans informed. It would be the fourth clock in most stadiums -- added  to the 60-minute clock, the 45-second clock and the one that tells the time of  day.  </P> <P> Tagliabue said that in urging continued replay officiating, he pointed out  that, nationwide, it ends controversy over four or five calls each week.  </P> <P> "There are enough disputes as it is," he said. "It's got to help the league to  get rid of four or five admittedly wrong calls every Sunday."  </P> <P> That logic didn't work on the Giants. "Replay (officiating) is still a bad  idea," said Wellington Mara, Giant president.  </P> <P> But Tagliabue ended the debate on several other clubs -- those on which the  coach and owner were on opposite sides.  </P> <P> At Seattle, for instance, President Tom Flores, a new member of the competition  committee, urged a no vote. Coach Chuck Knox is for it. The Tagliabue speech  swung Flores into the yes column.  </P> <P> "Instant replay isn't perfect, but it helps," Knox said. "Take the case of the  wide receiver who might or might not be juggling the ball as he steps on the  sideline -- or just inside the sideline.  </P> <P> "It's humanly impossible for one (official) to watch the receiver's hands and  feet at the same time. There are a lot of cases like that where instant replay  is your only recourse."  </P> <P> Moreover, Knox has concluded that instant replay doesn't add to the length of  the game.  </P> <P> "It's the penalties," he said. "Every penalty that any official calls adds a  minute to the game. The thing you really have to do is upgrade your officials  every season."  </P> <P> To Finks, that's easier to talk about than do.  </P> <P> "Our game is getting more difficult to officiate all the time," Finks said.  "The players keep getting bigger, the rules keep changing, bodies are flying  around faster than ever. We need instant replay because any help we can give  the officials is a good thing."  </P> <P> Tagliabue said that when the NFL polled its referees and other officials this  winter, 60% favored the use of instant replay. According to previous estimates,  only about 25% were in favor -- but there have been other indications that many  are accepting it as an aid.  </P> <P> One problem with the new rule is that, in the view of some coaches, replay  officials will be tempted to use all of their allotted two minutes every time  they stop the game to look at a play.  </P> <P> "That could happen," said Bill Polian, general manager of the Buffalo Bills and  also a new member of the competition committee. "But that's why we only put it  in for a one-year trial. Keep in mind, the time limitation was the key to the  vote."  </P> <P> The owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, Norman Braman, another replay opponent  who voted for it in the end, said it was the second year in a row that a  commissioner has used persuasion to get a yea vote on replay officiating  against the wishes of most clubs.  </P> <P> "We kept it last year as a favor to the outgoing commissioner, Pete Rozelle,"  Braman said. "Right now, we're still in the honeymoon period for his successor,  Paul Tagliabue -- and we gave Paul what he wanted. Next year, it won't be such  an emotional decision."  </P> <P> Next year, it might not pass.  </P></p>

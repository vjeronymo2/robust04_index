			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A tax court held that Arizona must reimburse about 72,000 retirees for state  income taxes they paid on their federal pensions. Judge William Moroney cited a  U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year, in which Michigan was told it  could not tax federal retirees unless it also taxed state, county and local  government pensioners. Craig Corimier, a deputy director in Arizona's  Department of Revenue, had warned that such a ruling could be "financially  devastating" because it could cost the state as much as $210 million. He said  the revenue agency had not yet decided whether to appeal the decision.  </P></p>

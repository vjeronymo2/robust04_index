			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat  Ataman has said that the stand adopted by the Greek Cypriot side  demonstrates its intransigent intentions and approach to the  confidence-building measures [CBM] process and to efforts aimed  at finding a solution through negotiations.    In reply to a question on the issue at his weekly news  conference today, Ataman recalled Greek Cypriot claims that the  CBM process has been terminated.    Pointing out that the positive and constructive approach  adopted by the Turkish Cypriot side has created an atmosphere of  restlessness and uneasiness in south Cyprus, Ataman noted that  the Greek Cypriot National Council has unanimously declared that  it is out of the question to return to the CBM process.    Ataman recalled Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias' statement  in Istanbul that the CBM process is dead, adding that, however,  the British foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state  made statements conveying that the process is continuing.    Ataman continued:    For some time now there have been reports in the Greek  Cypriot press that the successful attitude of the Turkish  Cypriot side is causing concern and that if the process  continues the Greek Cypriot side will not hesitate to take a  stand against the United Nations. Greek Cypriot leader  Kliridhis' threat to resign has also been interpreted by the  Greek Cypriot press as a form of blackmail against the United  Nations.    As you can understand this interpretation shows that the  stand adopted by the Greek Cypriot side demonstrates its  intransigent intentions and approach to the CBM process and to  efforts aimed at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem  through negotiations.</p>

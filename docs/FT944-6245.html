			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Flexible vistas unfold for richer pensioners - Personal pensions The chancellor announced the introduction of flexible annuities from May 1995, after the finance bill receives royal assent. That will allow those with personal pensions to extend the investment period into retirement and to draw down an annual income from the pension fund. Currently, those who need an income must buy their annuity immediately on drawing benefits. Once the annuity has been purchased, it is not possible to change the terms. In most cases, on death the fund is forfeited. Annuity rates - that is the level of income you secure for your investment - fluctuate significantly depending on the yields on long term gilts. In recent years the value of annuities has fallen by 30 per cent or more, so the purchase has become something of a lottery. Mr Simon Philip, director of personal finance with chartered accountants Binder Hamlyn, said: 'This will completely revolutionise pension planning for many people. Normally, the process is divided into two phases - the build up of the fund and the draw down of benefits. Now it will be possible to extend the investment period up to age 75.' Mr Philip added: 'The investment risk must be assessed regularly and carefully in the period before you want to lock in to annuity rates.' Not everyone should consider this option. Details are awaited, but there will be fixed costs associated with managing the retirement fund and the draw down of income. Mr Brian Hurl, marketing manager of independent advisers Lexis, said: 'This will only be an option for those with funds of Pounds 100,000 or more. The investment management will be a sophisticated process, since the aim must be to match the income draw-down with investment growth. The self-employed and those in certain types of occupational schemes - executive pension plans, for example - might consider this option.' In the wake of widespread mis-selling of personal pensions to those with company pension benefits, the government and investment regulators are expected to set a strict code for sales of flexible annuities. Mr John Moret, pensions manager with Provident Life, said: 'Some controls will be necessary. It is vital that these funds are managed professionally and properly - there must be a framework to protect pensioners' funds from being depleted through injudicious investments.'</p>

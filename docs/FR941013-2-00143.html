			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars (i.e., one- to fourteen-day programs with plenary sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience). It will support conferences only insofar as they are a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition. Furthermore, USIA will not support research projects or projects limited to technical issues. Publications intended for dissemination in the United States, individual student exchanges, film festivals or exhibits are also not eligible for support. In addition, this Office will not provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e. a semester or more) academic studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums or for degree-based programs will not be eligible under this RFP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and may have different guidelines or restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed budget:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $200,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants must submit a comprehensive budget for the entire program. There must be a summary budget as well as a breakdown reflecting both the administrative budget and the program budget. Please refer to the Application Package for complete formatting instructions. For better understanding or further clarification, applicants may provide separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity in order to facilitate USIA decisions on funding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Please note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All USIA-funded delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Allowable costs for the program include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; and ground transportation costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. escorting staff must use the published Federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in Central/Eastern Europe, the Federal per diem rates must be used. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Interpreters. Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division. Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Book and cultural allowance. Participants and escorts are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. U.S. staff do not get these benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Consultants may be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Room rental should not exceed $250 per day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) One working meal per project.

The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor of two to one. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during international travel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

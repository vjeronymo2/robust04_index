			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Strong sales growth lifts Astra ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, said first-half profits rose 58 per cent, to SKr3.67bn (Dollars 456.1m), as it continued to benefit from surging sales of its two main drugs, Losec and Pulmicort. The group warned that profit growth over the rest of the year would be slower, mainly because last year's fourth-quarter result was inflated by SKr500m in currency gains following the floating of the Swedish krona. It expects sales growth to continue at the 38 per cent level achieved in the first half. Currency factors slowed pre-tax profits growth in the second quarter from the 63 per cent of the first three months. However, growth in operating profits, which rose to SKr2.99bn from SKr2.06bn in the first half, was unchanged at 45 per cent. An 18 per cent increase in volume, and the depreciation of the krona powered the increase in group sales, to SKr10.56bn from SKr7.64bn. The group said sales rose 50 per cent in the UK. It also said its position was improving in Germany, its largest single market, where all drug companies came under an intense cost-containment squeeze in the first few months of the year. Even so, first-half sales in the German market fell 10 per cent. Sales of Losec, the company's highly-successful anti-peptic ulcer drug, rose 61 per cent to SKr3.28bn from SKr2.04bn. Total sales of the drug, including those through licensees, amounted to SKr5.55bn, against SKr3.3bn. Sales of anti-asthma agent Pulmicort climbed 53 per cent to SKr1.37bn from SKr898m. Plendil, the anti-hypertensive agent, increased sales by 41 per cent to SKr416m.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / SFO probes Pounds 60m 'options fraud' The Serious Fraud Office and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating a suspected commodities option fraud which may have resulted in a loss of more than Dollars 90m (Pounds 59.7m) to investors. The investigation is expected to be cited in the fraud office's annual report, due to be published this week, as one of the biggest cases of the past year. The report is expected to confirm that the number of big investigations based in the City is declining, but that the number of smaller provincial-based cases is growing. Investigators believe that the recession, combined with a tighter regulatory regime, has diminished the possibilities for major fraud. The investigation is focused on the activities of Mr William C. Dunn, a US-based commodities broker; his company, Delta Consultants; and an offshore business based in the Bahamas. It is thought to have been sparked by a complaint from an individual investor received late last year by the fraud office. Investigators say that losses occurred in trading between 1991 and 1993, mainly on the US markets. It involved hundreds of individual investors based worldwide. Money is thought to have been deposited in a number of US banks. The fraud office has since been working closely with US officials, with the FBI now taking the lead on the policing side. The FBI is understood to have questioned Mr Dunn in connection with the alleged fraud. Mr Dunn and Delta Consultants were named in a complaint filed recently in a New York Federal court by the US Commodity Future Trading Commission. The commission alleged that Delta, Mr Dunn and two offshore companies made 'false, deceptive and misleading representations of material facts in connection with soliciting and accepting funds from customers and prospective customers'. The precise nature of the alleged fraud remains unclear with investigators still trying to establish whether the funds have been lost or whether they have been diverted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] About 60 trading firms and foreign-affiliated  companies engaged in computer-related business will establish an  association as early as this month to expand public procurement  of foreign-made computers and information equipment. The  association will call on ministries and agencies in charge to  review the ordering system and bidding procedures so as to  facilitate foreign-affiliated makers' participation in public  works projects in the telecommunications sector. It will also  collect information on public works projects and provide it to  its members. The U.S. Government and other organs have made  more active moves to seek expansion of the government  procurement of supercomputers as well as the importation of  foreign-made information equipment, including cellular phones.  Under such circumstances, the association aims to become a  "lobbying body" to promote business with Japan.    The new organization expected to be established will be  (tentatively) named the "Association for the Promotion of  Telecommunications Equipment Import." The members are expected  to include foreign-affiliated computer makers and software  development companies, system houses, and trading firms engaged  in the importation of information equipment. Among major  companies that will be invited to participate are: Electronic  Data Systems (EDS), the Rikei Company [name as published], IBM  Japan, Microsoft Company, Motorola Company, Nihon Unisys Ltd.,  Nihon Digital Equipment Company, and Sumitomo Co. The  preparatory committee (with Takefumi Kanoya serving as chief of  the secretariat) has been proceeding with the selection of  executives and the association is expected to be formed as early  as May.    Several special committees such as the "Council for  Reforming  Public Works Project Ordering System" will be formed under this  association. Through these committees, the association plans to  collect information on government-planned projects and make  recommendations on how to promote telecommunications by setting  up a desirable public system and on how to revise the ordering  system.</p>

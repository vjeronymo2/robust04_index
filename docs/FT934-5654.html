			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat An agonising couple of days looms for Queens Moat Houses. Today shareholders meet to approve the 1992 accounts. Tomorrow, bond holders make their first response to the breach of covenants on the debentures. The controversy over the group's hotel valuations will loom large in both discussions. Equity holders are concerned that the latest valuation of only Pounds 861m weakens their position vis-a-vis the banks. If it is too low, their interests will be unduly diluted in any eventual debt-equity swap, while the banks will have an increased share in any future appreciation of the assets. Coincidentally, a low valuation of the properties is in the interest of the new management, too. The company's recovery will look more impressive if it starts from a low base. But that does not necessarily mean shareholders are being treated unfairly. First, Pounds 861m may turn out to be nearer the mark than the Pounds 2bn at which the hotels were valued in 1991. The new valuation promised by the company may shed some light, but it is a pity that an embarrassed Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has used the cover of the government enquiry into other aspects of the case to defer its own adjudication. Second, the real reason for the restructuring is that the company cannot generate enough cash to service its debt. Such a situation invariably puts banks in the driving seat. Arguably debenture holders face a different kind of choice. By calling in their security, they might end up with more cash than if they hold on and renegotiate the terms of their bonds as part of the overall refinancing. That, of course, would be one way of testing the Pounds 861m valuation. The risk to bondholders is that hotel sales would then take place at fire-sale prices, which is not what the valuers envisaged.</p>

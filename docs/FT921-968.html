			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Japanese wage rises at lowest for four years JAPAN'S leading industrial companies were yesterday near agreement on the lowest wage rises in four years in face of a severe decline in corporate profits. In contrast to German companies' inability to resist wage demands, Japanese companies were able to keep the average rate of wage rises below 5 per cent, even though the labour market continues extremely tight. The rate of increase in the steel, electric, car and shipbuilding industries should average about 4.8 per cent, against last year's 5.65 per cent. These agreements will set the pace for the rest of Japanese industry. The accords bring near a close the annual shunto, or 'spring offensive', as the wage talks are euphemistically known. It is a ritualistic struggle between management and labour that generally ends on a compromising note, despite much talk of strikes and demonstrations. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), praised labour's understanding of the tough business climate. The Bank of Japan declined to make any comment on the settlements. The wage rises are unlikely to upset the bank's efforts to bring inflation under control, although it remains concerned about the long-term inflationary impact of Japan's structural shortage of labour. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, said the settlements were likely to lead to a rise in unit wage costs in the first half of the fiscal year when industrial output is expected to be sluggish. This trend should reverse in the second half, when recovery is expected to begin. Mr Sogo Yoshimiya, an official at Rengo, Japan's federation of trade unions, said the unions were disappointed at the level of the wage settlement, but satisfied on the progress towards cutting working hours. Average annual working time last year, at 2,016 hours, was the highest in the industrialised world. Electrical companies had agreed a target of 1,800 total working hours by next year, and holiday entitlements would increase immediately from 15 to 20 days after the first year of work. As an extra measure to discourage excessive working hours, pay premium for overtime work would be increased from 40 to 45 per cent of the basic wage rate. Settlements in the electric machinery industry will come to an average increase of 4.7 per cent, while workers in shipbuilding and heavy industries will enjoy a 5.05 per cent rise, reflecting brisk business in that sector. Wage gains in the steel industry, hit by a drop in output, will be limited to 3.63 per cent. Toyota Motor, Japan's biggest vehicle maker, has agreed a wage increase of 4.83 per cent, against 5.5 per cent last year. Toyota's annual bonus will also be cut to an equivalent of 6 months' wages, compared to 6.2 months last year. Taking into account a special anniversary bonus, workers will receive a net bonus decreased by Y10,000 (Pounds 43.66). In Toyota's case, a demand that the overtime premium be raised from 30 to 35 per cent more than the basic wage rate was rejected. Working hours at Toyota last year came to 2,170 hours; the company said it would keep to plans to reduce this by 100 hours a year until it reached 1,900 hours. Japanese trade unions generally emerge from the shunto looking fairly toothless. But historically, the Japanese workforce has benefited from consistent real wage rises and high job security. Flexibility on wages has also helped their employers to endure difficult business conditions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Knowledge of the waste.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final subpart CC standards allow TSDF owners or operators to use their knowledge of the waste for waste determinations (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hazardous Waste Treatment Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 886 F.2d 355, 370&hyph;71 (D.C. Cir. 1989) upholding the use of generator knowledge to determine if treatment standards are met). Information may be used that is prepared by either the facility owner or operator or by the generator of the hazardous waste. Examples of information that could constitute acceptable knowledge include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Organic material balances for the source, process, or waste management unit generating the waste;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Documentation that lists the raw materials or intermediate products fed to a process showing that no organics are used in the process generating the waste;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Information that shows the waste is generated by a process that is substantially similar to a process at the same or another facility that generates a waste that has previously been determined by direct measurement to have a volatile organic content less than the action level; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Test data that provide speciation analysis results for the waste that are still applicable to the current waste management practices and from which the total concentration of organics in the waste can be computed; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Other knowledge based on manifests, shipping papers, or waste certification notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When test data are used as the basis for knowledge of the waste, the owner or operator must provide documentation describing the testing protocol and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in the determination of the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste. For example, an owner or operator may use individual organic constituent concentration test data that are validated in accordance with Method 301 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 as the basis for knowledge of the waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Tank Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The tank standards establish the requirements for tanks using air emission controls to comply with the general standards of the rule. No air emission controls are required under the subpart CC standards for a tank in which all hazardous waste placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organics in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the tank standards do not apply to a tank in which biological degradation of the organics in the hazardous waste treated in the unit is demonstrated to achieve specific performance levels. Either of the following sets of conditions must be demonstrated to qualify for this exemption: (1) The organic reduction efficiency for the process is equal to or greater than 95 percent, and the organic biodegradation efficiency for the process is equal to or greater than 95 percent; or (2) the total actual organic mass biodegradation rate for all hazardous waste treated by the process is equal to or greater than the required organic mass removal rate. The organic biodegradation efficiency or the organic mass biodegradation rate for a biological treatment unit is determined by procedures specified in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tank standards specify that the owner or operator install and operate on each affected tank one of the following air emission control systems: (1) A cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device; (2) a fixed-roof type cover with an internal floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements equivalent to the new source performance standard (NSPS) for volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage; (3) an external floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements equivalent to the VOL storage NSPS; or (4) a pressure tank that is designed to operate as a closed system. Under the subpart CC standards, an owner or operator is allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional controls) for affected tanks under certain conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four conditions must be met for a particular tank before use of a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional controls) is allowed under the subpart CC standards. First, the hazardous waste cannot be mixed, stirred, agitated, or circulated within the tank by a process that results in splashing, frothing, or visible turbulent flow on the waste surface except during limited circumstances. Second, the hazardous waste in the tank cannot be heated by the owner or operator except when necessary to prevent the waste from freezing or to maintain adequate waste flow conditions for continuous normal process operations. Third, the hazardous waste cannot be treated using a waste stabilization process or a process that produces an exothermic reaction. Finally, the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste in the tank must be less than the limit established in the rule by tank design capacity. For a tank having a design capacity equal to or greater than 151 m3 (approximately 40,000 gallons), then the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste in the tank must be less than 5.2 kPA. For a tank having a design capacity equal to or greater than 75 m3 (approximately 20,000 gallons) but less than 151 m3, then the maximum organic vapor pressure of the waste in the tank must be less than 27.6 kPa. For a smaller tank (design capacity less than 75 m3), the maximum organic vapor pressure must be less than 76.6 kPa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subpart CC standards require each cover opening not vented to a control device to be maintained in a closed, sealed position except at those times when a specific opening must be used to add, remove, inspect, or sample the waste in the tank or when it is necessary to use the opening to inspect, maintain, or repair equipment located inside the tank. Also, safety devices that vent directly to the atmosphere may be used on the tank, cover, closed-vent system, or control device provided that the safety device is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors. These safety devices are to remain in a closed position except when an unplanned event requires that the device be open for the purpose of preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of the tank, cover, closed-vent system, or control device in accordance with good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, combustible, explosive, or other hazardous materials. An example of an unplanned event is a sudden power outage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jurij Trushin, representative of the Russian </F> Federation in Macedonia, by Moscow correspondent Mirce  Adamcevski; place and date not given: "Macedonian Policy -- the  Future in the Balkans"]    [Text] Moscow, December--The Russian Federation has  recently appointed Jurij Petrovich Trushin [name as published]  as its permanent representative to the Republic of Macedonia.  He is a professional diplomat, involved in the Balkans for 20  years. His dissertation was on the Balkans, and he has also  written a number of scientific works related to this region. He  has spent more than 10 years working in the diplomatic service  in Bulgaria. This year, he has been engaged in the global  problems of that part of Europe. He has been professionally and  scientifically linked to the Balkans for more than 20 years.    [Adamcevski] Mister Trushin, how do you view your  appointment to the post of permanent representative of the  Russian Federation in Macedonia?    [Trushin] This appointment to Macedonia is a great honor for  me. The Macedonian people are few in number, but have a deep  and old culture, and if we look at the history of the Balkans,  it cannot be disassociated from Macedonia. Moreover, our two  peoples are closely connected through close blood, religious,  and historic links. As you know, Russia was christened (it  accepted Christianity) and became a Christian country through  the great merit of the Ohrid Exarchate. We know that Kiev  Russia had strong relations with Ohrid. There are numerous  other examples in history when the two countries and peoples had  active cooperation. From that aspect, it is a great honor and  duty for me to be appointed to Macedonia. I say great duty  because, unfortunately, the history of the Macedonian people was  carried on in such a way that many in Macedonia know a lot about  Russia, but only a few in Russia know about Macedonia. That  will be one of my basic goals, to get to know that country  better and to bring the truth about that people to the brotherly  Russian people.    [Adamcevski] You have now touched the next question. What  other aims will be basic to your activities?    [Trushin] I have already mentioned them: The intensification  of the traditional friendship and cooperation between our two  peoples. The second goal is to get to know the history and  culture of that people, to study the present situation, and to  inform my leadership, my government, my people. One of the most  important goals of my stay in Macedonia, as a representative of  the Russian Federation, will be to make our people, our country,  realize the guarantee of stability and independence of the  Macedonian people. The policy conducted by Russia in Macedonia  should contribute to stability and peace in that country. In  brief, these will be the goals during my stay in Macedonia.    [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the present situation  in Macedonia within the framework of the Balkans?    [Trushin] I think that the policy led by President Kiro  Gligorov, who enjoys great respect in our country, and this has  been confirmed during the numerous discussions and meetings I  have had with my leadership, is the best policy, because his  policy is directed toward good neighboring relations with the  neighboring countries. That is an example of how the future  policy in the Balkans should be, despite the fact that this is  the time when Macedonia is surrounded by furious passions, wars,  and interethnic disputes. Thanks to its leadership, thanks to  the fact that the Macedonians are a very peaceful people, of  good intentions, it can be said that Macedonia has succeeded in  being the only states of former Yugoslavia to have avoided those  events. Here, I think that this policy of peace, good  neighboring relations, and cooperation with the neighbors, in my  opinion, is the main orientation in the policy of Macedonia. On  that plan, Macedonia will always have support from Russia, from  our government, and leadership.    [Adamcevski] Can you tell us about your views on the future  development of the situation in Macedonia?    [Trushin] It is ungrateful to forecast policy. However, the  way it seems to me, the fact we are now witnessing a broad  process of recognition of Macedonia by the European countries,  by the world, proves a full recognition of the peaceful policy  of Macedonia. My opinion is that the line of international  recognition of Macedonia, neglecting the known difficulties,  represents a chance for Macedonian perspectives, for overcoming  those difficulties, for it becoming a full and equal member of  the world's community on its road to civilized development.    [Adamcevski] What will be your role and the role of the  Russian Federation in that direction?    [Trushin] If we reduce all that to Russian-Macedonian  relations, I would like to mention that Russia was the first of  the superpowers to recognize Macedonia. It recognized its  independence on 4 August last year, by the act of our President  Boris Yeltsin. Then our Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid a  visit to Macedonia, followed by his deputy Vitaliy Churkin. In  implementing the act of President Yeltsin, official inter-state  relations were established between the two countries and  respective representatives were appointed. My leadership has  entrusted me with the task of going to the spot and learning  about the situation in Macedonia, and then I am expected to  submit adequate proposals to our leadership and government in  compliance with the development of the situation.    [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the presence of the UN  forces in Macedonia?    [Trushin] Our line in that direction is clear and  consistent. If those forces contribute to the development of  stability and the reinforcement of peace in Macedonia, to its  economic growth and security, we can then welcome such a  presence.    [Adamcevski] However, some Russian media said that Russia  had abandoned the Balkans, asking about the reason for the  presence of the Americans there, that is in Macedonia.    [Trushin] First of all, we look at the presence of the  Americans within the framework of the UN forces. On the other  hand, I think that such an aspect appears as a remnant of the  ideological concept of the division of the world between the two  superpowers. Now, we are developing a Russian policy on the  indispensable Partnership for Peace, for which we meet  understanding in the Western world. Therefore, any actions,  Russian, U.S., or some other countries', must contribute to the  reinforcement of stability, of good neighborliness. The  ideological remnants must be excluded from these actions, as  well as the confrontations and the division of the world between  two systems. That is why we consider that our role, I would  say, in assisting Macedonia, will mean a continuation in the  direction followed hitherto. If the U.S. policy leads to  stability and development in Macedonia, we shall welcome it and  we shall cooperate with the Americans.    [Adamcevski] You know that a great part of the Macedonian  foreign trade exchange was linked to the USSR, that is Russia.  What will you do, now that the exchange has been lowered, to  promote this situation?    [Trushin] With the breaking up of the USSR and Yugoslavia,  the traditional trade relations have been remarkably weakened.  It does not affect only the former republics of the USSR and  Yugoslavia, because it is a larger process. Let me note that  Macedonia was the only one of the former Yugoslav republics that  imported more than it exported to the USSR. This is a very  significant detail. Our analyses show that there are  possibilities for increasing Macedonian exports to Russia. Our  side is pleased to show great interest in textiles and small  industry. Our large market is interested in tobacco, in shoes,  and in many other products bought in Macedonia. There is a  mutual interest with the Macedonians, too. Now that the economy  is being restructured, it is very important to start direct  links and contacts between the respective companies. In that  framework, I view my mission in Macedonia as a possibility for  promoting economic cooperation to a higher level. It will be a  great contribution if Russia helps Macedonia get back on its  feet. That is extremely valuable. For that purpose it was  decided, right after my appointment, to also appoint an economic  counselor to Macedonia. It demonstrates that we have put the  issue of foreign trade relations in the first place.    [Adamcevski] Would you like to add something I have failed  to ask about?    [Trushin] I would like to say that the characteristic of my  mission is that, compared to representatives and ambassadors  appointed to, so to say, "worked out" countries, I am starting  an unusual mission in that aspect. Unfortunately, that was due  to history itself, therefore there are no experts on the  Macedonian language, on the Macedonian history, and so on.  Therefore, in addition to my everyday obligations, I shall be  also learning the language, the country.... In that  perspective, my contacts with Macedonian historians, linguists,  and people of culture, will play a great role for me. On that  plan, we must use the links among the scientists of the two  countries, as well as the existing potentials. There are such  ideas now. When it became clear I was going to Macedonia, I was  visited by some representatives of the intelligentsia, the mass  media, some scientists, and they came out with the idea of  opening a Russian House in Macedonia, which would be the only  one in the Balkans. Therefore, it would be a Russian House  accumulating the spiritual wealth of the Russian people, which  we would generously share with our brothers, the Macedonian  people. This idea has already been accepted by Macedonia. I  have already had meetings with your eminent writers and artists.  The government circles have also accepted it with pleasure and  approval. It will be the first step in introducing the two  peoples that have traditional and cultural links. There are  also other ideas, but this is the first major one, and I, as the  first representative of the Russian Federation, would like to  realize it. I think it will also be well accepted by the  neighboring countries. I think they will have an understanding  for that, so that we can expand the cooperation.    And finally, I would like to wish the Macedonian brotherly  people success in overcoming the present difficulties and in  making Macedonia a flourishing state in the family of civilized  nations.    [Article contains following boxed passage on page 2]  <H5>  Promptness for Better Mutual Cooperation </H5>   Yesterday, President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro  Gligorov received a protocol visit of the official  representative of the Russian Federation in our country, Jurij  Petrovich Trushin.    The Russian representative conveyed to President Gligorov  the  cordial greetings and new year's wishes of President of the  Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and the Russian leadership,  emphasizing their readiness to promote further relations and  cooperation with Macedonia in the interest of the two nations  and countries, for peace and stability in the region.    President Gligorov expressed his gratitude and returned the  greetings and wishes, emphasizing that Macedonia is following  with great attention and pleasure the efforts of President  Yeltsin and the Russian leadership to further democracy in  Russian society and peace in the world. Gligorov also talked  about the possibilities for, and interest in, an ample  cooperation in all fields of mutual interest, based on the  historical links between the two countries and on the democratic  developments in both countries.    President Gligorov welcomed the opening of the Office of the  Russian Federation in Macedonia and expressed his hopes that it  would soon grow into an embassy.    Discussions were also held on the current issues regarding  Macedonian-Russian relations, on the situation in both the  countries, as well as on the situation in the Balkans.

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported a much more orderly and sedate performance from the derivatives markets, writes Steve Thompson. In stock index futures the December Footsie contract opened at 2,629 and progressed up to 2,638 in relatively subdued early trading, but then began to slide as it reacted to a rather uninspiring showing in the cash market where a number of big lines of stock were said to have been on offer. Sentiment was further weakened by at least two large programme trades. The absence of much rumoured takeover activity also dampened enthusiasm. Expectations of a cut in German interest was dashed when German bonds began to ease. The opening of Wall Street found December at the day's lowest level of 2,605, but it then embarked on a good rally which left it at 2,622 by the close, 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 32 points. Turnover was a disappointing 6,651 contracts. In stock options there was heavy activity in Grand Metropolitan which attracted 5,129 contracts, as a leading house was said to have carried out a series of big trades in the January 390 calls, along with the January 360 puts and calls. British Gas attracted 1,595 contracts and BT 960 contracts. Total turnover in stock options at 25,741 was also disappointing.</p>

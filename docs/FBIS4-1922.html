			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan </F> Provincial CPC Committee, by TA KUNG PAO staff reporter; date  and place not given: "Pu Chaozhu Answers Questions Raised by TA  KUNG PAO Reporter"]    [Text] [Pu Chaozhu] Situated in China's northwestern  frontier, Yunnan borders on Burma, Laos, and Vietnam. It has a  4,000-km long boundary line and a population of 38 million  people, which is slightly bigger than that of Guangdong. With  25 minority nationalities living in Yunnan, the province ranks  first in China in terms of the number of minority nationalities.  In the past, the province was very hard to get to and  culturally backward. Although it had abundant material  resources, its economy failed to develop for a long time. From  1979 to 1983, the provincial government made vigorous efforts to  develop agriculture, and thus basically solved the problem of  food and clothing in five years time. Then, in light of its own  strong point in resources, the government concentrated efforts  on developing such crops as tobacco, tea, sugarcane, and rubber.  Yunnan's tobacco is the best in China. Its geographical  conditions, such as a big temperature gap between day and night,  a long periods of sunshine, and soil, are particularly suitable  for the growth of these commercial crops. Through six or seven  years of efforts, production of these crops has expanded, thus  laying a solid foundation for the development of light industry.  Since 1983, the government has concentrated the province's  human, material, and financial resources on vigorously  developing the processing industries and technology of these  commercial crops, set up new factories, and transformed old  factories. Today after 10 years of efforts, the province has  seven large cigarette factories, of which two rank very high in  Asia with a production capacity of 5.5 million cases [xiang  4630] a year; 84 sugar refineries with an annual output of 1  million tonnes; 100 or so tea processing plants with an annual  output of 55,000 tonnes; and an annual rubber output of 40,000  tonnes. These undertakings which require little investment have  yielded large taxes and profits and are of high efficiency. In  1983, Yunnan had just 1.17 billion yuan in financial revenue,  but in 1993, the figure had topped the mark of 20 billion yuan,  or an increase of 1.7 times. In the terms of ratio alone, this  increase was the highest level in the country. We handed over 4  billion yuan to the central authorities and retained 1.2 billion  for our own disposal. Even with money ready at hand, the  provincial government dared not spend it wantonly. There were  two major factors causing the province's prolonged backwardness.  One was the "software" question, namely, people's cultural and  education quality was too poor, and the other was the "hardware"  question, including backward infrastructures in the energy  industry, communications, and water conservancy. This being the  case, for Yunnan to develop further, it is necessary to  introduce vigorous transformation in these two aspects. The  provincial government decided that money should not be spent on  construction of non-productive projects and even on repairing  the Government Conference Hall, which was built in the 1950's  and has now became dilapidated. The provincial authorities  decided, first of all, to invest a large amount of funds in  capital construction. Yunnan has abundant mineral resources.  However, without electricity, there would be no way to exploit  them. Through 10 years of efforts, the province and the  Ministry of Water Resources have managed to jointly establish  the Lancang Jiang Power Station, with a generating capacity of  1.5 million kwh. In 1983, the province had just 1.5 million kwh  in generating capacity. Hence, the generating capacity of a  Lancang Jiang Power Station was equal to the total generating  capacity of the province in the previous year. The waters of  the Lancang Jiang, which come from the glaciers of the Qinghai  Plateau, have a stable source and will certainly not dry up. In  cooperation with Guangdong Province, Yunnan is now building a  larger power station in the upper reaches of the Lancang Jiang,  with a generating capacity of 4.2 million kwh. After completion,  all electricity will go to Guangdong Province for its use. At  first, Guangdong provincial leaders did not believe that and  thought that we lured them to get hooked and we just took a  fancy to their money. In fact, with the completion of the  construction of a power station in the upper reaches of the  river, if we use the drawn waters of the lower reaches to  irrigate farmland in the dry season, this will help solve many  problems.    In transportation, the province has 27 million tonnes of  goods and materials to be shipped out. However, in the past we  just relied on the Chengdu-Kunming and Guiyang-Kunming railways  whose highest total carrying capacity was just 10 million  tonnes. The province was thus compelled to "carry out  production according to the amount of goods and materials  shipped out." The production of goods and materials which could  not be shipped out was not allowed. After enduring enough  sufferings in this regard, provincial authorities were  determined to vigorously solve the problem. Now we have three  new railways under construction, of which the Nanning-Kunming  Railway can be said to be the artery of the whole Southwest  region. The construction is undertaken jointly by Yunnan,  Guangxi, Guizhou, and the Ministry of Railways, and after  completion, it will have a carrying capacity of 10 million  tonnes, and the province will be able to ship out 100 percent  more goods and materials. Moreover, there are arterial  highways, airports, and waterways under construction. In the  days to come, we are prepared to spend another seven to 10 years  opening wider to the outside world, importing new and high  technologies, developing major industrial projects worth five to  10 billion yuan, and changing the economic structure. For  example, as an anti-smoking trend has become common practice in  the international community, it will be dangerous for us to  develop the tobacco industry on a single-line basis. Maybe the  industry will collapse at any time. In the days ahead, with the  exception of tobacco, tea, sugar, and rubber, we still hope to  strengthen development of such areas as the machinery and  electrical industries, nonferrous metals, iron and steel,  timber, food and drinks, spices, and Chinese herbal medicine.  For example, the results of a study show that Chinese medicine  pseudo-ginseng [san qi 0005 0003], a special product of Yunnan,  is not inferior to the ginseng grown in northeast China in terms  of useful ingredients. Since the drive of reform and opening up  to the outside world was launched, there has been a tilt in the  state's investment policy. To put it another way, the state has  invested more in the eastern coastal areas and less in the  southwestern border areas. For instance, according to the state  plan, Yunnan was expected to be built into a nonferrous metal  base in the 1950's and the state's investment in the province  constituted 2.5 percent of its total investment. However, in  the Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plans, the ratio dropped to 1  percent or so, and even less than 1 percent. Under these  circumstances, should Yunnan passively wait for state assistance  or actively try to find a way out by relying on its own efforts  and hard work? We decided to rely on our own efforts and go all  out to develop ourselves instead of waiting. We started with  the development of agriculture and light industry, and after  accumulating funds, we used them in education and capital  construction, and as the investment environment improved, we  developed major industries.... Practice in the last decade has  proven that this line of thinking is correct and workable. This  is roughly the case in the last 10 years. In the coming 10  years, we will surely be able to develop faster with better  results on the basis of what we have achieved in the last 10  years.    [TA KUNG PAO] In Yunnan minority nationalities live in  compact communities. What is the situation of nationality  concord and unity?    [Pu] Before the founding of the People's Republic of China,  in Yunnan there were more than 20 minority nationalities who  lived in different social formations, ranging from primitive  communal societies where there was no conception of private  property, land was publicly owned, and earnings were equally  distributed, to slave societies, to societies under the rule of  feudal lords or hereditary headmen, to feudal societies. After  liberation, they "entered socialism in a single bound" as one  may well say. For many years, we have put stress on the  nationality cadre policy. Of Yunnan's population totaling 30  million people or so, the combined population of 25 minority  nationalities constitute less than one third. However, of the  contingent of cadres at all levels, cadres of minority  nationalities make up 25 percent. The more senior the cadres,  the greater the ratio becomes. Of the members of the provincial  party committee and government, deputies to the provincial  people's congress, and members of the provincial committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 40  percent are people of minority nationalities and the remaining  60 percent are people of the Han nationality. In the past few  year, we have managed to ensure that minority nationalities are  not oppressed politically and not exploited economically.  However, this does not mean that we have solved all the  problems. Because of some long- standing historical reasons,  the gap between the minority and Han nationalities in the  cultural and economic fields still exist. Moreover, as the Han  nationality's economy and culture expand, the gap will become  wider and wider. This will probably cause problems. Only when  the economy and culture of minority nationalities are upgraded  and developed can the contradictions between the two sides be  solved and can genuine unity and concord achieved. Provincial  authorities attach great importance to this problem.    [TA KUNG PAO] There is a rumor circulating abroad that  Yunnan Province is beset with the problems of drug cultivation  and trafficking. What is actually the true situation?    [Pu] Yunnan Province has a long boundary line.  Intermarriage is common among people living in the frontiers  which are not separated by big rivers, and it is impossible to  surround them with wire entanglements. These people are  relatives of each other. For a long time, people living inside  and outside the frontiers have lived together in peace and have  been law-abiding on the whole. However, there are also  difficulties. Outside our borders, people grow 1 million mu of  opium poppies. So long as they have a bumper harvest of opium  poppies, we will have bad luck. For our part, the Yunnan  provincial government firmly bans the cultivation, trafficking,  and selling of drugs. Even dozens of mu or a piece of land sown  to opium poppies will be promptly weeded out as soon as they are  discovered. Last year over 100 mu of opium poppies were rooted  out. However, banning cultivation of opium poppies does not  solve the problem. As long as you look out at the places across  the frontier line you stand on, a sea of red opium poppies will  meet your eyes. Making use of Yunnan as a thoroughfare for drug  trafficking, drug trading groups ship drugs to Guangzhou and  Hong Kong via Kunming. We also firmly ban and crack down on  such activities. Last year, we arrested more than 3,000 people  and dealt with some of the cases based on solid evidence  according to law. Drug traffickers who are arrested will  certainly be dealt with according to law, be they from other  provinces or outside the borders. While strengthening border  customs inspection, we rely mainly on the joint defense of the  people, the Army, and the police and form a gigantic net so that  there is no escape for drug traffickers. Last year, we seized  and confiscated drugs totaling some five tonnes, or 3.5 tonnes  of heroin and 1.5 tonnes of opium. However, according to our  calculation, this was only the tip of the iceberg. The  traffickers succeeded in smuggling out most of their drugs. As  long as there are drug markets abroad, it is difficult to solve  the problem. Last year, the number of drug cases dropped but  that of major cases increased, and there were even cases of  armed smuggling and escorting of drugs. This is a complicated  international problem. Now we are seeking cooperation with  international anti-drug organizations to jointly crack down on  drug trading activities. In a word, on no account does Yunnan  grow and traffic drugs. The province firmly bans drugs.    [TA KUNG PAO] Will you please say something about the recent  developments of border trade?    [Pu] On the 4,000-km frontier line, 28 counties are slated  as border trade areas, with 186 materials being duty-free as  approved by the customhouse. We have adopted some flexible  measures in areas such as currency exchange and communications  and transportation. Now a border trade coordinating organization  of five provinces and seven parties in southwest China has taken  shape, hundreds of companies are engaged in border trade, and  they are expanding markets. Last year, the transactions of  border trade totaled 3 billion yuan and the 1985 figure was just  30 million yuan. Now, in reality, goods traded on the frontiers  come from all parts of the country. Hence, border trade has  become, in reality, a form of foreign trade.</p>

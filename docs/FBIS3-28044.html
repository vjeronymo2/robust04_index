			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The professor of the  Puebla State University of Mexico, Miguel Alba Vega, recently  dedicated an article titled "Independent Policy of WPK [Workers'  Party of Korea]" to the paper CAMBIO.    The independent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea for  the  accomplishment of the socialist cause is expressed in working  out all lines of the revolution and construction in the interest  of its people and in conformity with the realities of its  country. The article said, and went on:    However good the experiences of other countries may be,  President Kim Il-song never introduces them if they are not  suitable to the realities of his country and the interest of his  people.    Korea firmly maintained the line of building a  self-supporting national economy when the revisionists forced it  to enter an economic league, advertising about profitableness.    It is thanks to the wise leadership of the president that  the  WPK has had no a slightest deviation in its nearly 50-year-long  guidance to the revolution and construction.    The independent policy of the WPK is also expressed in  solving all problems arising in the revolution and construction  on the principle of self-reliance.    The president, believing in the people and depending on  them,  led the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the fatherland  liberation war against the U.S. imperialists to victory as well  as the construction of a new country after the liberation, the  post-war rehabilitation and construction and the socialist  revolution to victory.    The WPK's independent policy is surely guaranteed by the  principle of chuche in ideology, independence in politics,  self-sustenance in economy and self-reliance in defence.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has now turned  into  a socialist country steadily developing on its own foot, not  being subordinate or dependent.    This is the result of the independent policy with which the  Korean people value independence and dignity more than their  lives and allow nobody to trample down national independence.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / One-stop advice centres ill-conceived, Major told The president of Leeds Chamber of Commerce last night used a dinner attended by Mr John Major to attack the government's 'ill thought-out' proposals on services to industry and commerce. He said these were putting his chamber's future at risk. Mr David Richardson said: 'Commerce and industry are being burdened with new schemes and initiatives dreamed up by civil servants and politicians when they take on a new post - and which often get forgotten once they move on to pastures new.' Mr Richardson, a partner in the surveying firm of Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith, was speaking at the chamber's annual dinner where Mr Major was guest of honour. He attacked proposals for 'Business Links' - the one-stop shops offering advice and support to industry. 'We are caught in the middle of a confused struggle between government departments to provide an ill thought-out scheme which few people are certain is really needed,' he said. 'This chamber has been representing its members for more than 200 years and I have no intention of being caught up in a scheme which puts our financial future at risk, particularly since it could end up on the scrap heap if the Treasury turns off the financial tap. We will work with the government, but not at any price.' Business Links are promoted by the Department of Trade and Industry as centralised providers of support services. Previously this role has been partly fulfilled by chambers. A year ago Leeds chamber was asked by the government to jointly bid with Leeds City Council and the local training and enterprise council to run a one-stop shop, offering services in competition with itself. Mr Richardson appealed to Mr Major to end the confusion and concentrate responsibility in one department, the DTI.</p>

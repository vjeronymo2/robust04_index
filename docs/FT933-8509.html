			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Bold new music in Tuscany - William Weaver roves through the Italian summer music festivals MUSIC-LOVING Tuscan summer residents are lucky, for in almost every part of the Italian peninsula's largest and, arguably, loveliest region there are concerts, performances, festivals. The Siena area is particularly blest: in the city itself the Settimana musicale senese continues its 50th season mixing scholarship with performances: eminent specialists speak and debate at conferences during the day, and the subject of their erudition is heard in the evening. In Montepulciano, the festival (or 'workshop' as it is understatedly called), founded almost 20 years ago by Hans Werner Henze, continues to pursue its eccentric course, seeking a popular consensus with outdoor performances and accessible prices, while presenting bold programmes of new or unfamiliar music, plays, dance. And, a bit to the south, under the dramatic, beetling peak of Monte Amiata, the cellist Antonio Lysy organises a series of chamber music evenings centering around the family estate, La Foce. The Lysy series, known as 'Encounters in the Territory of Siena', concluded its 1993 festival last week with a typically refined and impressive concert in the sober courtyard of the Renaissance palace of Pius II Piccolomini, in the town of Pienza, which the learned Pope designed as the summer residence of his court. Lysy's audience - - heard a group of first-rate artists like the pianist Jeffrey Swann, the violinists Ani Kavafian and James Buswell, the violists Barbara Westphal and Sophie Renshaw, as well as Lysy and his fellow-cellist the aristocratic Carter Brey, in various combinations, playing Haydn, Schumann, and the rare, haunting Reger trio op. 141. In earlier concerts, the programmes ranged from Haydn's delightful little Concertos for 'lira organizzata' (a kind of hurdy-gurdy favoured by King Ferdinand of Naples, who commissioned the pieces) to seldom-performed, youthful chamber works by Puccini. In nearby Montepulciano, a few nights later, there was quite a different feeling. In the course of the 'Workshop,' now under the artistic direction of the Italian composer Giorgio Battistelli, with the German conductor Markus Stenz as music director, a number of young artists collect, to perform but also to listen. So the audience suggests a university or conservatory atmosphere, a knowledgeable, participant, but not uncritical public, ideal company for the hearing of new and demanding music. The most substantial work of the brief season, given in the Teatro Poliziano, was a 90-minute one-act opera, Leyla und Medjnun, by the 33-year-old Hamburg composer Detlev Glanert, a Henze protege and former pupil, now also co-director of the Montepulciano municipal music school. Written in 1987-88 and first performed at the Munich Biennial, Glanert's work is based on a libretto by Peter Schneider and the Turkish poet Aras Oren, drawn from the classic Arabic story, best known in the great 12th century epic retelling by the Persian poet Nizami (an affecting English version, published in 1966 by Cassirer, also inspired a libretto by Andrew Porter for the Chinese-American composer Bright Sheng, performed at the Chicago Opera and in San Francisco). In Montepulciano, the Glanert opera was given in an Italian version by Matteo d'Amico and Marco Marica, though the enunciation of the performers did not always make the words clear. The worst offender was the 'Zenne', or narrator, a spoken part assumed by the Italian actor Elia Shilton. For that matter, the very existence of the narrator was a theatrical mistake, dulling the effect of the drama, which had little of the radiance of the great love story. In his small orchestra - about a dozen players - Glanert introduced an Oriental stringed instrument, the Tar, whose plaintive twang added welcome colour to the music, a colour that was absent from the stark staging by Lorenza Cantini, brightened chiefly by some charming puppet animals designed by Donatella Espositi, but only briefly exploited. As Madjnun, the young prince driven mad by love, the tenor Lynton Atkinson was correct, cold, far too sane. His Leyla, Svetla Vassileva, was more appropriately impassioned, sweet-voiced and tender. Among the other members of the fairly large cast, Sabina Macculi won attention as a lithe and lyrical gazelle. Glanert, in this youthful work, demonstrates taste and talent; happily, he is already at work on a second opera, which will no doubt appear in the Montepulciano context.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pozdnyakov report from St. Petersburg under the </F> "Atom" rubric: "`A Hungry Operator Means the Threat That  Chernobyl Could Recur.' Leningrad Nuclear Plant Workers Picket  Oblast Administration Seat"]    [Text] Workers of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant  (LNPP), wearing working uniform -- white overalls, special caps,  and foot gear -- are picketing the building of the Leningrad  Oblast Administration and the Leningrad Electric Power  Department. The picketers demand that wages be paid to LNPP  workers that have not been forthcoming since February. Although  Leningrad Oblast governor Aleksandr Belyakov has promised to  discuss the problem with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the  financial situation of the Leningrad nuclear power plant workers  has not changed.    According to Aleksandr Yeperin, LNPP general director, the  power plant has been plunged into very severe financial straits  by the intervention of the Russian government, which has  prohibited the nuclear power plant from imposing financial  sanctions on its debtors; hence, the LNPP often has to supply  customers with electricity virtually for free. Despite the  possibility of signing a contract for delivering electricity  from Sosnovyy Bor to Finland -- to be paid in hard currency --  this is unlikely substantially to ease the LNPP's financial  plight, because the plant management has to make regular  payments for nuclear fuel (earlier the plant had a one-year  reserve, but this has now been used up).    For the time being, the plant management is not going to  take  extreme measures and spend the money earmarked for fuel  purchases on workers' wages, because a shutdown of the plant's  reactor could become the first step toward a general power  crisis in Russia.    Plant workers themselves, who took to the street to picket  administration buildings, think that the government should  drastically change its policy with regard to the nuclear power  industry. They believe that the shortage of money in the  industry could bring about not only a power crunch, but also  even more serious consequences.</p>

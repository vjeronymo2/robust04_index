			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOXING NOTES;  </P> <P> TYSON ACID TEST FOR 'MOUTHPIECE OF CHAMPIONS'  </P> <P> Who is the bravest man in boxing today?  </P> <P> Here's one vote for Dr. Richard Kaufman, a dentist who designed the so-called  "Mouthpiece of Champions," a device that resets the jaw of a boxer and  supposedly improves his ability to take a punch.  </P> <P> Kaufman claims no boxer has ever been knocked out while wearing it, but he  admits it was worn by Michael Olajide when he was stopped by Iran Barkley and  by Donny Lalonde when he was stopped by Sugar Ray Leonard. Said Kaufman: "I  don't count TKOs."  </P> <P> Anyway, Kaufman's mouthpiece, and his reputation, face by far their toughest  test July 21, when Carl Williams wears it into the ring to fight Mike Tyson.  Williams, known for his tinkling chin, has yet to be knocked down while wearing  the Kaufman Special.  </P> <P> Kaufman said part of Williams' problem in taking punches was the poor condition  of his mouth, with many rear teeth missing, causing a misalignment of his jaw.  Kaufman says the mouthpiece resets Williams' jaw in a position that makes his  entire body "kinesiologically stronger."  </P> <P> And, Kaufman adds, the same type of mouthpiece was worn by Bonecrusher Smith  when he fought Tyson, and it will be recalled that the Clutcher did, indeed,  stand up for 12 rounds. So how does the good doctor think The Truth will do  against Tyson? "With my mouthpiece, he can probably go at least five rounds  with Tyson," Kaufman said. "If he keeps his ... hands up."  </P> <P> For Sale: Two slightly tarnished Golden Boys. Well-spoken, marketable, rare  white variety, popular with the opposite sex, do great pre- and post-fight  interviews. Looking for title shots despite recent setbacks.  </P> <P> Sold, to ABC, which sprung for the weekend package of Donny "Golden Boy"  Lalonde vs. World Boxing Council light-heavyweight champ Dennis Andries on June  24, followed by Bobby "Matinee Idol" Czyz vs. International Boxing Federation  light-heavyweight champ Prince Charles Williams on June 25.  </P> <P> Lalonde, coming off a creditable showing against Sugar Ray Leonard in November,  deserves another shot at his former crown. Czyz, coming off a loss to WBA champ  Virgil Hill, is the type the networks seem to love, win or lose, and he and  Williams fought an exciting match last time, the Prince winning on a  ninth-round TKO.  </P> <P> Of course, the most attractive match would have been Czyz-Lalonde, but that  would've violated the Golden Rule of Network Boxing: Don't knock off a Golden  Boy sooner than you have to.  </P> <P> Lou Duva and Shelly Finkel flew out to Los Angeles to observe 6-6, 315-pound  Tony Mandarich in a boxing workout. Mandarich, the Michigan State offensive  tackle chosen second in the National Football League draft by the Green Bay  Packers, has said he wants to fight Tyson and is willing to postpone his  football career a year to do it. Duva and Finkel, rejecting suggestions that it  is all a negotiating ploy, came away impressed.  </P> <P> "I never saw a guy as ferocious and strong as this guy," Duva said. "He's all  strength and he outweighs Tyson by 100 pounds. He can pick Tyson up and throw  him out of the ring."  </P> <P> Sorry Lou, but any boxing person can answer that claim in just three words: Too  Tall Jones.  </P> <P> IBF middleweight champ Michael Nunn will defend his title against former IBF  champ Iran Barkley, on HBO, in August. The questions are where and when. In the  running are Trump Plaza (Aug. 11), the Las Vegas Hilton (Aug. 12) and Caesars  Palace (Aug. 19). Promoter Bob Arum wants Trump, because he believes the Los  Angeles-based Nunn's career needs some East Coast exposure, but Nunn's manager,  Dan "Hollywood" Goossen, wants to keep Nunn fighting in front of friendly West  Coast fans.  </P> <P> More Duva on Mandarich: "He's a better athlete than Tyson. He runs a 4.6 40  (yard dash)." Sorry, Lou, but that's been tried already, by Alfonzo Ratliff and  Tyrell Biggs, among others. Problem is, you run out of ring after 20 feet.  </P> <P> Don King's idea of staging an undercard of Hollywood stars boxing one another  to prop up a Tyson-Jose Ribalta fight in Los Angeles is the same as telling the  public, "This fight is garbage," in different words.  </P> <P> The self-styled "World's Greatest Promoter" sold Tyson-Williams to Trump for a  bargain-basement $1.5 million -- half his original asking price and the lowest  site fee for any Tyson fight since he won the title in November 1986. And, he  let potential Tyson opponent Adilson Rodrigues, with whom Tyson could have made  about $10 million in Brazil, get away. Instead, "Maguila" will fight Evander  Holyfield July 15.  </P> <P> Reyes Cruz and Joe Manley turned him down, so Buddy McGirt faces Derrick Kelley  at the Felt Forum in New York May 25, in preparation for a CBS network date  with Tony Baltazar on July 9.  </P> <P> In a recent spasm of lunacy, I turned to Mitch Green for some insight into the  Tyson-King alliance. How long, I asked Blood, did he think Tyson and King would  stay together?  </P> <P> "Not long," he said, sounding serious and thoughtful. "Not long at all."  </P> <P> Why? "Because I'm going to kill both (of them)."  </P></p>

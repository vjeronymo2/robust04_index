			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- The decline in Russian  production for 1994 will amount to 12 per cent, and consumer  prices will rise by five times, according to the Russian  Government's social and economic forecasts for 1994, discussed  by the government presidium on Thursday. The report is intended  to be sent to the State Duma as an accompaniment to the draft  federal budget.    Aleksandr Shokhin, the main speaker at today's meeting,  reported that the Economics Ministry had prepared four main  types of forecasts. The first forecast is called  inertial-adaptational, implying the virtual continuation of the  present state of the economy.    The second envisages strict monetary policy, characterized  by  the activation of market mechanisms, the lowering of inflation,  and the continuation of the sharp decline in production.    The third forecasts active fundamental restructuring, which  presupposes the creation of a foundation for the implementation  of basic economic restructuring, with inflation higher than it  is at present, and with less financial balance.    Shokin considers the fourth alternative the best. It  supposes a policy of active economic stabilisation, accompanied  by moderately strict monetary policy and designed for a  two-front fight against inflation, by limiting state  expenditures and by selective stimulation of production.    The advantages of the fourth alternative stem from the  state's limited financial resources for implementing qualitative  structural reforms this year. It is, in effect, based on  selective support for highly-effective state enterprises, on the  financing of quick-return investment projects, and also on  widening the sources of financing for the social sphere,  especially concerning housing.    According to the government's fourth forecast, Russia's  gross  national product (GNP) might fall by eight per cent, and  industrial production might decline by 12 per cent. Overall  agricultural produce would fall by seven per cent, production of  energy resources, by four per cent. This variant forecasts a  five to six per cent unemployment rate, which translates to  about three million unemployed russians. The average growth of  consumer prices would be 12 to 13 per cent a month, falling to 7  to 9 per cent monthly by the end of 1994.    According to this prognosis, out of a 745 trillion rouble  gnp, 3.9 per cent would be spent on state investments, three  percent on state subsidies, 1.6 per cent on state expenditure on  science and research, and five per cent of the GNP would be  devoted to defense expenditures.    Shokhin announced that the government's forecast for 1994  under a policy of active economic stabilisation was fairly  optimistic and oriented towards resolving the main problems of  economic reforms and getting the maximum use out of reform's  advantages as soon as possible. Therefore, he concluded, such a  task would be difficult, but completely realistic.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Men in the News: Reformists with the mostest - Yegor Gaidar and Grigory Yavlinsky / John Lloyd on Russia's opposing economic champions Reform of the economy is the central issue in Russia, and has been the main theme of the election campaign. Mr Yegor Gaidar has dominated - not because his proposals are popular, but because they have commanded the general support of President Boris Yeltsin and have attracted (not without compromises) such centrist figures as Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. Mr Gaidar has never succeeded in going as far nor as fast as he has wished, but he has been able to stand against a full-scale reversal of his policies. In the first fully democratic elections Russia has seen, however, he has been confronted by a man who proposes an alternative vision of reform - and who insists that he is more of a reformer than the first deputy prime minister. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yabloko electoral group, has put before the voters a strategy which, though not fully fleshed out, has the advantage that it has not been put into practice. Mr Gaidar's way has inevitably claimed victims. Between these two youngish men (Mr Gaidar is 37, Mr Yavlinsky 41) there is little affection. Mr Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice, was born among the Soviet elite: his grandfather was a civil war general after the 1917 revolution and a famous children's writer (streets are named after him), his father a military commentator on the daily newspaper Pravda. The leader of Yabloko was born of a Russian family in the west Ukrainian city of Lvov, where his father was a serving officer who ran an orphanage. Mr Yavlinsky came to government first - serving as a deputy prime minister in the (Soviet era) Russian government formed by Mr Boris Yeltsin in 1990 - after co-authoring the '500 day' reform plan. He resigned when Mr Yeltsin failed to support his proposals, and then worked with Professor Graham Allison of Harvard University (now an assistant secretary in the US Defence Department) on the 'Grand Bargain' plan to reform the Soviet economy with western assistance. A deputy prime minister in the last Soviet government under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr Yavlinksy ended his government service when the latter resigned two years ago, and has since headed his 'Epicentre' consultancy group, advising the government of Kazakhstan and the leadership of the Nizhny Novgorod region, while keeping up a steady stream of informed criticism of the reform process. Shortly before the elections, he put together his electoral coalition - sharing the leadership with Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a former Soviet deputy and Russian government adviser, and Mr Vladimir Lukin, presently the Russian ambassador to the US. Mr Gaidar came to government as Mr Yavlinksy left it. After a career which spanned academia and journalism (for the once-prestigious Kommunist and Pravda), he was invited by President Yeltsin to spearhead economic reform in the first cabinet of an independent Russia - later becoming acting prime minister. As Mr Yavlinsky tells the story, Mr Gaidar asked him to join that government: after a long and heated talk in Mr Yavlinsky's room on the 27th floor of the former Comecon building, which has a panoramic view of Moscow, he refused. Mr Gaidar went on to liberalise prices and trade and to begin the privatisation process in an increasingly rocky year (1992) which ended with his forced resignation. Out of government, he formed Russia's Choice, which swept into it many of the radical democratic groups in parliament and outside. Both these candidates for the highest offices of state are of high intelligence, but they are otherwise different in chemistry and attitude. Mr Gaidar insists he is a reluctant leader: Mr Yavlinsky has loudly and frequently announced his intention to stand for the presidency. Mr Yavlinsky is by turns impatient and jocular, always at the centre of attention or striving to be: Mr Gaidar is courteous, slightly awkward and formal. He has found it hard to learn the hand-shaking, back-slapping part of government and politics, and in a recent phone-in on Moscow Radio his desire to make himself and his politics attractive was at patent war with his distaste for giving easy answers. Where Mr Yavlinsky has had the luxury to condemn most of Mr Gaidar's actions and to hold up his own - untested - propositions as manifestly better, Mr Gaidar has been forced during the campaign to defend or at least make the best of an economy which continues in deep crisis. His first year was a hard one. In an interview in the newspaper Izvestiya, he described last year thus: 'Imagine that you know in theory how to fly a plane. And then someone sits you down in the cockpit - not of a trainer, but in a real plane. The pilot disappears, the plane is falling rapidly towards the ground and nobody wants to sit in the pilot's seat. You sit there and try to think how the plane will react to your commands. But you have no experience and no feeling of real contact with the engine, without which your actions are crude and often spasmodic. That's how I felt in my first period in government.' No wonder he felt so. Prices, which he had thought would double, went up 10-fold. Support for radical reform, apparently solid after the collapse of the 1991 August putsch against President Gorbachev and of the Soviet Union, itself collapsed by the spring of last year. Increasingly, politicians and commentators told Mr Gaidar that the costs of reforms were being felt above all by the old, the poor and the sick. He was derided as a shock therapist, an arch-monetarist, a destroyer of the Union. There was truth in all of this. Early in 1992, he held a joint press conference with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, whose rapid stabilisation of the Polish currency in January 1990 was a model for supporters of Mr Gaidar, to stress his 'shockist' credentials. His programme was for Russia alone, not (as Mr Yavlinsky's) for all the former states of the Union: he and his circle had, after the putsch, concluded that the Union's time was up. Mr Yavlinsky stands against this overall philosophy. In an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday, he said that 'Gaidar liberalised the Soviet economy. I will destroy the Soviet economy. In doing what he did, he simply made state monopolists into private monopolists. My programme is to demonopolise, to privatise much further, and only then can you stabilise the currency.' He said he would also resume the search - which he gave up when the Union crumbled - for an economic and banking agreement between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. This would co-ordinate their economic and monetary behaviour. 'I think now they are ready for this. I would say that if they wished to keep separate currencies they should do so, but actually Ukraine has shown this doesn't work.' Hyper-inflation is raging there and the currency has collapsed. The two men differ on the possibilities for reducing inflation. Mr Gaidar has pledged, again and again in this campaign, that inflation will come down to 5 per cent a month by the end of next year from its present rate of 15 to 20 per cent: in his Izvestiya interview, he said that he hoped the average wage, which he said was now about the equivalent of Dollars 80 a month, would rise to Dollars 120 or more by the end of next year. Mr Yavlinsky thinks this is nonsense. 'Inflation will not come down significantly, whatever happens,' he said. Further, he believes that unemployment, now hidden, will burst out in the coming year. Under any of the reform options, harder times are to come: but under his, he says, an economy still caught in the rigid grip of a socialist system - its props gone but its internal workings still unreformed - will at least be shaken up and exposed to market competition. The difference between the first deputy prime minister and the man who would be president is thus as much as, say, divides a liberal or conservative party from a social democratic one in a western state. Both are within the boundaries of market principles, but both have their own logic. But this is Russia 1993. As the campaign winds up, the threat of a high turn-out for the neo-fascist and Communist parties appears to grow. Mr Gaidar has for some weeks appealed for the reform parties - and especially the two leaders among them, his own and Mr Yavlinsky's - to come together. Mr Yavlinsky has been cool. But on Thursday, after seeing a poll which showed Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist, running second, Mr Yavlinksy appeared to have changed his mind. 'There is no reason on my side why we cannot agree. I have no particular bad feelings for him (Gaidar). The key thing for me is that he can be brought to see the basic direction of my programme and we can agree. And then we will see.'</p>

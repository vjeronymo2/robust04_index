			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pablo Alfredo Herken Krauer: "The Dark Side"] </F>   [Text] Paraguay could very well have become a predictable  and predetermined country. Its economy might have avoided  becoming one of the poorest and most backward in Latin America,  and its people might have had a higher standard of living.    When lecturers deal with the issue of successful and  unsuccessful countries at foreign universities, they usually  teach that the United States did everything possible (and became  a superpower) with many (resources) at its disposal; Japan did  everything even though it had practically nothing; and Argentina  did nothing despite having everything. But what about Paraguay?  I would suggest that while having many resources it did very  little indeed.    What went wrong? The economic and political systems failed  as  did the governments and the people. We were, and are, swindled.    The result of this is that in the eyes of many people  abroad--even though they do not really know us--we are as poor  as Haiti, as militarized as Cuba (where the government, the  party, and the Army are part of the one and only "family,") and  as predetermined as Panama under the wretched General Manuel  Antonio Noriega. We are seen as very backward in economic  reforms when compared to Chile, Mexico, Argentina, and Peru over  achieving a more competitive, modern, and efficient economy.    Today, in mid-1994, the year which was forecast to have  brought an economic "boom" [preceding word in English] and a  major step forward in our development, very few can guess or  predict what is in store for Paraguay in the short- and  medium-term. Who can really say what will happen?    Just as there are few who can predict the future, similarly,  those who can forecast--those who can devise measures to face  what will happen--do not abound either.    What a country! Yet, technically speaking, there are  positive  results in the present economic scene even though Paraguayans  are very cautious, have a deep mistrust of what the government  says or does, and have no definite outlook for the future.    At the beginning of the year it was feared that inflation  would run at approximately 30 percent. Yet prices have climbed  much slower and, following the 0.5 percent inflation rate in  May, we could end the year in a much better position than  expected. The rate of exchange between the dollar and the  guarani rose by less than 4 percent in six months.    The Central Bank's international monetary reserves have  increased by 29 percent so far this year and by 40 percent  compared with May 1993. This is a significant financial sign of  our guarantee and credit-worthiness to the rest of the world.    This is especially so if we recall that in February 1989 we  did not have--literally speaking--any reserves at all since the  $233 million then in the Treasury vaults were not enough to  cover the payment arrears that had accumulated with  international creditors, which totalled $303 million. Moreover,  we had to shoulder our $1.885-billion external debt--some 48  percent of our total annual economic production--which had  nearly tripled since 1980 due to [former President Alfredo]  Stroessner's extravagance that has caused us so many headaches.    Our international monetary reserves now stand at $898  million--probably the best level in the last 10 years--with no  significant arrears with our foreign commitments, with a sizable  dollar deposit in our banks ($638 million), and with a "reduced"  foreign debt amounting to just $1.232 billion (representing 17  percent of the country's production in 1994), the Paraguayan  economy can afford the luxury of laughing at the critical  situation confronting many other Latin American countries that  suffer from their over-indebtedness.    The Central Bank's international reserves have increased by  3,642 percent in real terms since 1988, dollar deposits have  grown by 349 percent (by 475 percent since February 1989), and  the external debt has been reduced by 35 percent in the period  under consideration (by 41 percent since December 1989).    Indeed, Paraguay does not have any problems with its  external  debt, and the "nice" side of its economy projects a positive and  attractive image to the world. And yet, we are unfortunately  seen as a Haiti (a poor and backward country), a Cuba  (militarized and under the hegemony of the Colorado Party), a  Panama (drug traffickers), and we trail far behind the leading  countries in the region. This is why we are neither a  predictable nor a predetermined country.    On closer examination, or by dwelling upon the present  economic circumstances, the problem of foreseeing what will  happen and preparing for it becomes even more curious and  worrisome when we see that since August 1993--when President  [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy took office--Central Bank international  reserves have increased by 50 percent, dollar deposits have  grown by 14 percent, and $273.2 million from Itaipu [in  royalties] has entered the country.    If this were not enough, the distinctive trait of the policy  of the finance minister and his team is that of a more balanced  budget management. They have at their disposal 50 percent more  financial resources than last year--some $544 million--and have  spent approximately $387 million, thus yielding a 41-percent  surplus.    On one hand, income tax collection has increased by 68  percent, revenues from value added tax and customs duties have  grown by 36 percent and 32 percent respectively, and royalties  from Itaipu have tripled. On the other hand, social expenditures  (education, health care, and housing) have edged up by 40  percent.    Notwithstanding this, Paraguayans are cautious and  distrustful, they are neither satisfied with nor reassured by  the performance of the administration, and the outlook is  uncertain. Why?    Some colleagues would argue, quite rightly, that the "harsh"  or gloomy side of our difficulties should come before the  "bright" side of the economy. To spell it out; cotton  production will drop by 20 percent, there is no "boom" in  soybean production, economic activity is either stagnant or near  a standstill, credits that are in the process of being collected  have increased by 67 percent (from May 1993 to May 1994), one  can hardly make ends meet, and many people are barely eking out  a meager existence or are even slipping.    This is true, but regardless of the harsh economic  reality--and going beyond the positive results--the dark side of  the economy does not explain the spectacle of a country which,  instead of being predictable and predetermined, looks more like  a boat adrift.    It is my considered opinion that the problem is presently  more political than economic. Proof? 1) A government that did  not start as expected and desired; 2) A president who does not  convince and seems to be ensnared; 3) A military chief--General  Lino Cesar Oviedo--who went from being the hero in the  democratization film to being the chief bad guy, providing an  additional example of how we cheat each other; 4) The crazy  internal struggle by Colorado Party factions, which smells of a  foul and irresponsible plot to undermine Wasmosy's  administration; 5) Political chicanery and jingoism in general  that characterizes the performance of the ruling party and of  the opposition, like the case of 23 pitiful senators who tried  to deal a "coup de grace" to the privatization of some  state-owned companies.    This all leads me to conclude that the dark side of politics  is more prejudicial than its economic counterpart.    From this viewpoint, one should be grateful for the present  performance of the economy. Nevertheless, we could be in a much  better situation and Paraguay could have become a predictable  and predetermined country.    If the Wasmosy administration had been more concerned about  the nation than about the party, if the ANR [the National  Republican Association-Colorado Party] had been less of a  troglodyte, if Congress had been more concerned about bills, if  politicians had been more coherent, and if Gen. Oviedo had been  sent into retirement, then the state of affairs in 1994 would  have been very different and the positive results of the  "bright" side of the economy would have really been instrumental  in expediting and deepening change.    Although hard to believe, if Gen. Oviedo had been retired,  Paraguay would now be a credible, predictable, and predetermined  country. It would have been easier to give up being another  Haiti, Cuba, or a future Panama, and the world would know us  better.    We could be in a better situation; we should be in a better  situation. Despite all its resources, Paraguay has done very  little. We have been cheated and we have allowed it to happen.  Cowards die several times; heroes die only once.</p>

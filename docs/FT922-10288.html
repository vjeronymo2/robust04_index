			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / McDonald's plans hospital outlet McDONALD'S, the fast-food company, is negotiating to open a restaurant at Guy's Hospital in south-east London. Guy's and Lewisham Trust said it wanted to maximise the variety of foods offered at the hospital. The restaurant would take over an existing public restaurant and there would be 'absolutely no loss' of hospital catering jobs, the trust said.</p>

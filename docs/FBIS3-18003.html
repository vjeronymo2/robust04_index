			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today, esteemed listeners, you will hear a  recorded conversation with the prime minister and not a regular  live broadcast from the prime minister's reception. At the  moment the prime minister is on his way home from Slovenia. We  inform our listeners that the recorded conversation will be  about Lithuanian foreign policy. Therefore, apart from the  prime minister, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys is also taking  part in the conversation.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] The first  question is to the prime minister: what are the objectives of  the visit to Slovenia. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Now concerning the recent uproar which is  felt here in Lithuania -- the Selma [construction company] case,  the purchase of weapons, searches carried out in people's  houses, and so on. Why does Russia show such a great interest  in all this? Why such reaction?    [Prime Minister Slezevicius] The reaction, which was first  of  all voiced by Mr. Matochkin and Mr. Yegorov during their visit  here, is about Russia's concern that the construction of houses  in the Kaliningrad region may be discontinued. This is the  official pretext for their concern. During our meeting and  during our visit to the Kaliningrad region we made assurances  that, as far as Lithuania is concerned, there would be no  obstacles toward the construction being continued. [passage  omitted]    The comments which appeared in the Lithuanian press  concerning this criminal case is rather categorical, saying that  the case is leading to high-ranking Russian officials, therefore  it is only understandable that this causes them concern. I  think that such allegations do not help in the normalization of  our mutual relations. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Could you comment on the military transit  from Kaliningrad and back?    [Slezevicius] The location of the Kaliningrad region is  rather unique indeed. It is an enclave. Therefore, naturally  it causes certain problems both to Kaliningrad and Lithuania,  because in spite of our categorical attitude to this issue, the  transit through Lithuania is unavoidable and therefore it is our  task to determine the procedure with regard to how the transit  of foreign transport should proceed through our country.  [passage omitted]    [Foreign Minister Gylys] [Passage omitted] There is yet  another question. I would like to clarify a report by the  Baltic News Service concerning motor vehicle transit. Russia  indeed wants some priveleges for motor vehicle transit.  However, our state has...[pauses] Being aware on the one hand,  as the prime minister has already mentioned, of Russia's right,  perhaps a wish, to have access to the enclave, however, we have  to be in control of all this movement. Therefore, the BNS  report claiming that an agreement has already been reached on  motor vehicle transit is premature. The problem is very complex  indeed.    [Correspondent] The following rather pressing question is  about relations with Poland. Here is the recorded voice of  Augustinas Rimkus [not further identified] from Vilnius.    [Rimkus] Why is the text of the treaty with Poland being  made  secret? The article in the treaty concerning the occupation by  Zeligowski should be confirmed not only by the representatives  of the government but by the entire nation. All this should be  condemned, however all this is being made secret. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] There are more listeners voicing their  concern that the texts of inter-state treaties are not made  public in advance.    [Slezevicius] [Passage omitted] There is one point, however,  whereby I can assure that this treaty fully corresponds to the  interests of the Lithuanian state. Any attempt to aggravate  inter-state relations is not wanted. We had to find mutually  acceptable formulations which would satisfy both sides  concerning the evaluation of the historical facts and, of  course, ensuring the inviolability and integrity of our  territory. These general principles have been recorded. The  treaty has been initialled by Mr. Gylys, who is taking part in  this conversation.    It is clear that in the second half of next month the visit  by Polish President Walesa is to take place, during which the  treaty will be signed, and of course, following this, the treaty  will be made public.    [Gylys] It is of interest to note that when I arrived in  Poland I was acquainted with the materials [not further  specified] and I noticed that the formulations and statements by  the radical forces are similar to those here in Lithuania. The  Polish radical forces -- it is true that they are not as  numerous as they are in this country -- say that with this  treaty Lithuania has forced Poland to go down on her knees.  Something similar is hear from the side of our radicals.    [Slezevicius] The initialling of the treaty, in spite of the  radical voices mentioned by the minister, has been received  essentially very positively. This will be a very positive step  toward the normalization of our mutual relations. Following  this an agreement on free trade, upgrading the border regime,  joint work by the customs houses, and other steps must follow.  The political treaty will become the foundation for the  acceleration of our further economic relations.    [Gylys] The world community reacted positively to the step  taken by us. Yesterday, I received a letter from U.S. Secretary  of State Christopher. We also received a letter from France and  we also expect more support. The world understands that  relations with neighboring countries should be normalized.    [Slezevicius] [Passage omitted about the assistance given by  the Scandinavian countries]    [Correspondent] I would like to ask you about Lithuania's  relations with Germany.    [Gylys] Germany made a significant step by inviting the  foreign ministers of the three Baltic states to the capital  city. We had a five and one-half hour long consultation session  on all issues. The main issue was our integration into Europe  both in the economic, security, and political sense. We believe  that Germany has adopted a very clear stance; Germany is our  ally and demonstrated this unequivocally.    [Slezevicius] I would like to mention that Germany is our  biggest trading partner in the West. Half of all the trade  volume with the West is comprised of trade with Germany.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What are relations like with other European  organizations, including NATO?    [Slezevicius] After 14 May last year, our dialogue with the  European Union has been developing rather dynamically after the  Maastricht Treaty. These are very important stages: our  aspiration for a free trade agreement, an intensive dialogue,  and consultations on this issue are taking place, much hard work  is to be carried out by us. There is also the Partnership for  Peace signed by the president. Our aspiration is to set up a  peace-keeping battalion together with our neighboring countries,  which would be the first serious step -- apart from the  Partnership for Peace -- toward integration into the NATO  defense structures.    We are aware that our gaining membership of NATO is a long  process. Therefore, while being aware of this, we have to set  up the basis for this in various aspects, which include the  standardization of weapons, using the same methodology, and so  on. [passage omitted] The confirmation by Germany that  compensation will be paid for the damage [inflicted on Lithuania  during World War II] has been reached. It is evident that the  process of negotiations on this issue should be accelerated, and  of course it must be specified in which way and by which dates  this compensation will be met.

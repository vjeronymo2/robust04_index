			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Bombay broker granted bail Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the heart of the Rs35bn (Pounds 627m) Bombay stock market scandal, was released on bail by a special court yesterday, only to be rearrested for alleged violations of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, writes Shiraz Sidvha from Bombay. In the streets outside the Bombay stock exchange, brokers celebrated the release of Mr Mehta, who had artificially bolstered exchange prices earlier this year before being arrested for fraud.</p>

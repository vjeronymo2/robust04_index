			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: The dangers of political architecture - Architecture THIS summer beach reading takes on a serious tone as Europeans loll on sunny islands, within earshot of the sounds of hideous civil wars. Two particular books seem to have a timely relevance for anyone interested in the inevitable effects of politics upon architecture - The Arts of the Third Reich by Peter Adam, (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 24.95) and Stalinist Architecture by Alexei Tarkhanov and Sergei Kavtardze, (Laurence King, Pounds 35). Both these books are about blood and buildings. Hitler and Stalin, two tyrants of the twentieth century, both needed more than just terror to perpetuate their nauseating ideals. Hitler had serious architectural and artistic ambitions - indeed he is supposed to have wanted to be an architect. He would certainly have given architectural arrogance a new dimension. But he was served by his architect Albert Speer and the sculptor Arno Brecker in ways that were not completely without artistic merit. The tragedy of art and architecture being used so blatantly for banal propaganda purposes is that all artistic standards are debased. Even a good artist is inevitably corrupted. Stalin simply encouraged mindless monumentalism. The two Russian authors have written an extremely staight-forward account of a period that is very recent to them with elegant objectivity. The Stalinist style has an interest because if it had been built with its modernist cubist style of ornament and without its Social Realist heroics, it might well be admired today. Instead the mighty buildings stand for a hollow and horrific period of megalomania. Peter Adam has gathered from the slowly opening archives a good collection of visual images many of which have never been seen before. From his book you get a very strong sense of art perverted by politics. It is the kind of book that makes the reader examine his aesthetic responses as well as his political ones. The author engages in an impossible search for artistic objectivity and inevitably leaves a lot of difficult questions unanswered. His analysis of the ways that Nazis misused artists is accurate and fascinating. Both books belong in any library about the art and architecture of the twentieth century. Both demonstrate the huge set-back these tyrants caused to the natural development of a historically based architectural tradition. First tyranny and then modernist excesses almost succeeded in killing off history as a source of architectural development. Both the Nazis and the Stalinists perverted history - and we are all still suffering for it. How often is fascist now used as a term of abuse when classicism is revived today ? These books both show objectively the dangers of political architecture and the artistic danger of perverting history. On a calmer note, anyone interested in recent architecture should take a look at a series from Phaidon Press. It is called 'The Architecture in Detail' series - and plans to be a range of monographs with excellent drawings and photographs of the, 'most celebrated buildings of the last two centuries'. The series struck me as useful to anyone contemplating commissioning an architect, (a rare and recondite activity today) and probably useful as crib sheets for practising architects. The buildings covered include, The Red House by Philip Webb; The Oxford Museum of Natural History by architects Deane and Woodward; Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea in Finland; Frank Lloyd Wright's Barnsdall House in Los Angeles; The Royal Festival Hall; The Hoover Factory; the UK Pavilion at the Seville Expo; and many more. They are far from perfect as a series because they seem to fall between two stools. They are quite expensive - Pounds 19.95 for a paperback magazine format and yet they are not the last word on the buildings they cover. They are not written by scholars and indeed the texts I have read are very variable - the quality of the actual writing does not seem to matter. Several of the series deal with recent trendy architecture - it is hard to see the lasting significance of some London restaurants and advertising offices. If the series can avoid appearing as uncritical publicity brochures for current contemporary architects it will be far more successful. My other criticism is that an aversion to captions and a certain martyrdom to the wilful ways of the graphic designer makes the series more difficult to read than should be the case. The most successful are the titles that are photographed by one distinguished photographer. The publishers hope for annual subscribers - twelve slim volumes a year - and offer a good discount. I had looked forward to the summer break to have time to read the handsome volume, The Italian Renaissance Interior 1400-1600 by Peter Thornton, (Weidenfeld and Nicolson , Pounds 65.00 ). What a disappointing book - perhaps the subject is too big and the evidence too recondite to make a book on this intriguing subject readable and scholarly and convincing. This is really an amazing cull of pictorial material assembled by a team of helpers and captioned at length by an author who is clearly more interested in certain aspects than in others. I cannot be alone in finding it hard to take seriously a tome that wants to be seen as scholarly but contains this extraordinary disclaimer by the author - 'Readers may notice that when I come to matters that do not particularly interest me (or about which I am rather ignorant, which comes to the same thing) I say very little; I mention these matters in the appropriate places merely so that my coverage of the field should be fairly comprehensive.' This reader noticed that Mr Thornton is not particularly interested in architecture, nor is he even remotely interested in painting. His analysis of fragments of great paintings selected to illustrate interiors of his period almost always ignores the artist's colour and compositional intentions. The book is full of wonderful pictures - the text is a worrying muddle.</p>

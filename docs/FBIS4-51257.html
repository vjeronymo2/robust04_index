			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zeng Xiancheng (2582 2009 2052)] </F>   [Text] Fuzhou, 1 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Fujian  Literature and Art Radio officially started broadcasting this  morning. At this point, Fujian People's Broadcasting Station,  which has a 45-year history, has already developed into four  specialized stations; namely, Southeast Radio Company, Economic  Radio, People's Radio, and the Literature and Art Radio, thus  satisfying as much as possible the many diversified needs of the  masses.    The reform of Fujian broadcasting began step by step in  1993.  The Southeast Radio Company was the first one to begin  broadcasting. Then came Fujian Economic Radio and the Fujian  People's Broadcasting Station's Comprehensive News Radio. At  present, these specialized radio stations are flourishing and  well received by the broad masses of people, to the extent that  radio broadcasting, which had been seriously challenged by  television programming, shows great vitality again.    Fujian Literature and Art Radio, established upon approval  by  the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, is a comprehensive  radio station that mainly broadcasts music, but will also  broadcast literature and drama. After beginning broadcasting,  it will diligently build a great hall of literature and art to  provide the public with a new dimension of entertainment,  appreciation, enlightenment, and development.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Babcock sings the blues - The week ahead Barring disasters, one of the least surprising results of the week should come on Monday with full-year figures from Babcock International, the engineering contracting and materials handling group. Announcing a Pounds 78.6m rights issue last month, the group gave detailed estimates of its figures for the year ended March 31 - a pre-tax loss of Pounds 41.2m, which includes a Pounds 25m exceptional charge and compares with profit of Pounds 21.1m in 1992/93. Further evidence on the state of the UK grocery market will come on Tuesday from Kwik Save, the UK's largest grocery discounter - one of those which is putting pressure on J. Sainsbury (which announces annual results on Wednesday) but also is facing competition on its own territory from expanding continental discounters. Interim pre-tax profits are forecast to increase from Pounds 61m to Pounds 62m-64m. Scottish Power, the electricity generator and distributor, is expected to reveal annual profits of between Pounds 340m and Pounds 350m pre-tax on Wednesday. This compares with Pounds 308m last time. The dividend will probably rise by 11 per cent to 12.4p via a final of 8.27p. Three of the UK biggest insurance companies will next week report increases in profitability in the first three months of 1994, confirming the recovery in the general insurance market. General Accident is expected to post pre-tax profits of about Pounds 60m, compared with Pounds 42m to the same period of 1993. Commercial Union, which reports on Wednesday, is tipped by analysts to produce profits of between Pounds 38m and Pounds 80m, with an average of about Pounds 50m. Royal Insurance, also on Wednesday, is forecast to report pre-tax profits of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 51m (Pounds 2m). Each of the companies will benefit from the impact of past increases in insurance rates and indications of an improvement in claims experience in the UK. Some analysts warn, however, that the profit levels now being achieved do not represent any increase on the last quarter of 1993, and suggest that competition is returning to some sectors of the market. Weather losses in the US and Canada, where there have been long spells of sub-zero temperatures, could also dampen some figures. Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance, which have much smaller US businesses, do not report on a quarterly basis. J. Sainsbury's downbeat trading statement in January, when it announced a fall in both underlying sales and gross margins, and a property write-down of Pounds 365m, was one of the lowest points in a bleak year for UK food retailers. On Wednesday, the grocer is forecast to announce a fall in pre-tax profits for the year to March from Pounds 735m to between Pounds 320m and Pounds 340m. That is after both a Pounds 365m non-recurring write-down on property, reflecting the fall in value of many of Sainsbury's sites since it bought them; and a Pounds 40m recurring depreciation charge resulting from the group's decision to depreciate buildings by 2 per cent a year and a revised depreciation policy on fixtures and equipment. The key questions Sainsbury is expected to address on Wednesday is whether trading has improved since January - and whether gross margins have stabilised - plus the future of its 'Essential for essentials' campaign launched last October. That marked a move away from periodic promotions towards 'everyday low prices' on 300 own-label lines accounting for about 10 per cent of turnover. Analysts are also keen to hear more about Sainsbury's plans for its other businesses - the Savacentre hypermarkets, Homebase DIY superstores and US supermarket chain Shaws - as well as planned trials of a city-centre format, Sainsbury's Central. Royal Bank of Scotland reports its interim results for the year to March 31 on Wednesday and is expected to double last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 91.6m, as well as providing a good increase in the interim dividend. The strategic question which the bank might try to answer at its results presentation is whether it will spend its healthy capital on acquisition. It was among those expressing interest in buying Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. The interim figures from Grand Metropolitan, due on Thursday, should show a healthy increase of about 10 per cent on last year, to some Pounds 445m. The Pillsbury Green Giant business in the US should do well, given the floods in the mid-west last autumn and the resulting rise in vegetable prices. The Burger King hamburger business, also part of Pillsbury, is likely to produce a strong showing, too. The interest charge will be reduced by the sale of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain to Scottish &amp; Newcastle. But the really hot topic is whether GrandMet will take the opportunity to unwind its unhappy Inntrepreneur pubs joint venture with Courage. The betting appears to be against it - this soon, at any rate. Unilever's first-quarter figures on Friday should show only modest improvement, perhaps to Pounds 450m against Pounds 440m last year. The main depressing factors should be in detergents. The recent rather nasty downturn in the US started only in the second half of this year, and this quarter should also start to show the costs of launching the new super-concentrated detergent across Europe.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Fears over Kurds prompt meeting GROWING anxiety over the evolution of a Kurdish state is set to dominate the meeting in Ankara today between Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, and his Syrian and Iranian counterparts. The talks are the first attempt by the regional powers to find a solution to the instability in north Iraq, where Kurds have set up a de facto administration since allied forces left the area at the end of the Gulf war. The US, as well as the UK and France, who have provided the air deterrent for the Kurdish-held areas, is concerned lest Ankara and the other capitals should use the fear of a Kurdish state as an argument to negotiate again with Baghdad. Turkey, Syria and Iran - with Kurdish minorities of their own, like Iraq - have deep misgivings about recent moves to establish an elected Kurdish assembly which has already declared its intention to set up a federal state. Today's meeting will also give the Turks an opportunity to reassure their neighbours, after 20,000 Turkish troops went into north Iraq last month to flush out bases of the separatist Kurdish Workers party who had used the power vacuum in the area to mount attacks on Turkish positions. The Iranian parliament urged the Turks to withdraw. Turkey is in a strong position to shape regional developments. The Turkish parliament has still to decide whether to extend the allied security umbrella for the Kurds beyond the new year. Equally vital, Turkey controls the cross-border trade which provides the lifeline for the Kurdish-held areas in the face of the Iraqi embargo on supplies. Turkish officials are keen that the current UN embargo against Iraq should not prejudice Turkey's long-term relations with Baghdad.</p>

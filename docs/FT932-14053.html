			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico reaps benefits of trade liberalisation - A Gatt report which finds much to praise but sees some dangers in Nafta MEXICO's trade policies have won a generally glowing testimonial from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In a report published yesterday which stresses the worth of open trade in promoting economic development and social welfare, Gatt says Mexico is already benefiting from economic and trade liberalisation combined with tough fiscal discipline. Gatt economists expect the still-to-be-ratified North American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada, due to come into force next year, to give the Mexican economy a further boost. However, they warn that Nafta may lead to some diversion of trade and increase Mexico's vulnerability to economic fluctuations in the US, which already accounts for more than two-thirds of exports and imports. The report documents the transformation of the economy since the debt crisis erupted in 1982. The structural adjustment programme started in 1983 and accelerated since 1989 has turned Mexico from an inward-looking state-dominated economy to 'a largely open economy driven by private sector initiative'. Tariffs have been halved from 27 per cent in 1982 to 13 per cent today. Only 2 per cent of imports are covered by import licensing, down from 100 per cent. Dependence on oil exports has fallen from 67 to 32 per cent of total merchandise exports, while manufactures - notably vehicles, machinery and chemicals - now account for 59 per cent. Mexico is by far the leading exporter and importer in Latin America, the report says. Foreign trade now enables Mexico to import goods and services needed for development and to finance its Dollars 75bn (Pounds 49.6bn) foreign debt. The structural adjustment programme has already borne fruit in a resumption of economic growth, rising incomes and lower inflation, Gatt says. 'The performance of the Mexican economy in the last five years demonstrates how the liberalisation of international trade and investment regimes and a comprehensive macro-adjustment programme can be mutually supportive.' Growth has averaged 3.5 per cent over the past four years and inward investment is now running at record levels. Inflation has been brought below 12 per cent in 1992 from an average 86 per cent in 1981-88, while state finances have swung from large deficit in the early 1980s to a surplus of over 3 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, Mexico's privatisation programme - 'one of the most extensive in the world' - has reduced the number of state-owned enterprises from 1,239 to 221 in the past 10 years. The transformation has not been without pain. Mexico's GDP did not regain 1981 levels until 1989 and real per capita incomes overtook 1980 levels only in 1991. Inflation is higher than in leading trading partners and since 1989 Mexico has run a big merchandise trade deficit - nearly Dollars 16bn last year, Dollars 11bn of which was accounted for by trade with the US. The Gatt report estimates that Mexico's five export processing zones (maquiladora) - manufacturing mainly electronic products and automotive parts - may account for up to half the country's total goods exports. Exports from the zones, located mostly along the US frontier, rank second only to petroleum as foreign exchange earners. However, the relative importance of the maquiladora sector is diminishing, Gatt says. The report also notes that over time maquiladora industry has moved from cheap labour-based assembly to more skilled-based activities with higher value added. The report is critical of some aspects of Mexico's trade policies. It says tariff escalation - higher tariffs as the degree of processing of imports increases - is common. Effective tariff protection continues to be higher than average in cars, computers, iron and steel, metal manufactures, basic chemicals and electrical machinery. In particular, Gatt attacks protection for the motor vehicle industry as 'incompatible' with Mexico's trade liberalisation policy.</p>

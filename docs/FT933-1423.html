			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Sudan's civil war dispirits aid agencies: 'The outside world is feeding this war' AS SUDAN'S bitter civil war enters its tenth year, the United Nations and western relief agencies are spending Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) to feed and shelter hundreds of thousands of families displaced by the conflict. The international effort to ward off starvation in southern Sudan is both larger and more costly than the media-lit operation in Somalia last year. Operation Lifeline Sudan, the UN group co-ordinating relief efforts, estimates 1m people cannot feed themselves. The war has robbed them of their homes, their land and their cattle. There is no trade because the cash economy has collapsed. The UN's attempts to secure 'corridors of tranquility' for the passage of food convoys have been shortlived. So UN cargo aircraft drop as much as 1,500 tonnes of food a week over an area three times the size of Britain. In some areas, relief workers are flown in and out on a daily basis because their safety cannot be assured overnight. This kind of relief operation does not come cheap. Conservative estimates put the cost at Dollars 4m a week. And although non-governmental organisations (NGOs) report that the immediate threat of starvation has been averted, many relief workers have begun to question the expense of a humanitarian gesture which can only alleviate the symptoms of the Sudanese malaise. The cure can only come with the end of the war. Mr Marcus Oxley, of the Irish charity Concern, says NGOs are now faced with the impossibility of planning any long-term development work because of the conflict. 'Dealing with the famine emergency was the easy bit. But what can we do now? NGOs do not have the power to solve Sudan's political and military conflicts.' Some relief workers, frustrated by the endless displacement of southern communities and the swelling refugee camps in Uganda and Kenya, believe the humanitarian effort has been misguided. 'The outside world is feeding this war,' says Mr Philip Winter of Save the Children Fund. 'It is impossible to prevent combatants getting hold of food relief. Government troops eat it. The southern rebels eat it. And nobody wants to make a fuss about it.' Dispirited UN officials say they have no option but to work through whichever military faction controls areas targeted for relief. They cannot quantify how much food is syphoned off to feed the fighters. And they see no hope of an immediate ceasefire. The Khartoum government, led by General Omar al-Bashir, has recaptured several towns in southern Sudan since the Southern People's Liberation Army split into two rival factions in 1991. But for most of this year the Moslem Arab north has done little more than watch its black and predominantly Christian southern countrymen massacre each other in the struggle for hegemony over the rebel movement. 'Most of the hunger and displacement this year has been caused by fighting among the rebel SPLA factions,' says Ms Sally Burnheim of Operation Lifeline Sudan. Unlike the faltering UN operation in Somalia, the UN humanitarian mission in Sudan has no mandate to broker a peace accord. One ceasefire mediated by the US this year collapsed almost as soon as it was signed. Four attempts to bring the rival SPLA factions together have failed. It is unlikely Washington will be able to play a further peacemaking role, after accusing Khartoum of harbouring terrorist groups. But if US concern with Islamic fundamentalism grows, southern Sudan could become a flashpoint in the struggle to contain its spread. Already, President Yoweri Museveni's government in Uganda is believed tacitly to be supporting Mr Garang's SPLA faction. Mr Garang's guerrillas form a convenient buffer between Islamic fundamentalist militias sitting in the Khartoum-controlled garrison towns of southern Sudan and Uganda's northern provinces. Mr Garang accuses his rival, Mr Machar, of accepting military supplies from the government in Khartoum. Mr Machar denies he is supping with the devil. Washington suspects Khartoum is being supplied by Iran and China, which is denied by the parties involved. 'The international community appears to have run out of ideas to solve Sudan's intractable conflict,' says Mr Winter. He believes western donors would make better use of their money if they employed it to find an end to the war.</p>

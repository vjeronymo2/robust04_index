			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Schools back privatised inspectors Most schools are happy with the new inspection system for England introduced last September, says a report from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) has contracted out the work to new inspection companies to ensure that every school is inspected at least every four years. In a survey of the first 100 schools inspected, 90 per cent reported that the inspections were well managed. Two-thirds of the schools said the contract for inspection allowed adequate coverage of their school's range of work. Coopers &amp; Lybrand also said new 'lay' inspectors, whose presence was at first strongly opposed by teachers, had 'played a useful role' and were 'well received in schools'. Ofsted was also told, however, to reduce demands on schools for producing information before inspections. Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, accepted the report and announced that the number of inspection days for each primary school would be reduced when their new four-yearly inspections started in September. The National Union of Teachers complained that schools' resources had been excluded from the inspectors' remit. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'That exclusion, which also covers class sizes, is a political decision to enable the government to avoid the blame for shortfalls which must lie at its door.'

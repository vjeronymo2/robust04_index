			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Soros buys into US property A US property fund set up earlier this year by George Soros and advised by Paul Reichmann, former head of Olympia &amp; York, yesterday made its first investment as it paid Dollars 634m (Pounds 419m) for a block of properties and property loans from Travelers, the US insurer. Also yesterday, Soros' Quantum Fund revealed a plan to set up a new UK property fund to take on its interest in a Pounds 500m joint venture with British Land, the UK property group, which was announced in June. Shares in the new fund, denominated in sterling, could eventually be listed separately in London. The disposal by Travelers marks the insurer's first bulk sale of properties since an announcement in February that it intended to accelerate the disposal of Dollars 5bn of underperforming property loans and properties acquired as a result of defaults on commercial mortgages. Quantum Realty Fund, the Soros US property fund launched in March, bought 35 properties and 12 commercial mortgage loans, representing 6m square feet of commercial space and 6,000 residential units. Travelers said the money raised would be reinvested in higher-yielding assets, principally corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bonds. Neither side would disclose the yield on the underperforming properties, but Mr Reichmann said the investment brings 'strong current cashflow as well as the prospect for significant capital appreciation as the property markets recover later in the decade'. Quantum Realty will put up around Dollars 210m, with a further Dollars 90m being provided Mr Soros and various Soros family investment vehicles. The rest has come from a bridging loan, which will be refinanced by an issue of mortgage-backed securities. The leverage in the fund could be increased in the future by a further securitisation in the form of a property investment trust, Mr Soros said. Following the Travelers deal, the Quantum Realty Fund will still have Dollars 500m of equity to invest in properties. Meanwhile, the Quantum Fund said the plan to spin off its UK property interests would not alter the terms of its relationship with British Land, in which the investment fund owns 11m shares.</p>

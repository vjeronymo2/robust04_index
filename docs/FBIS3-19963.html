			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release No. OPSS 52/94 issued by the UK Office of </F> Public Service and Science: "Review of Government Security  Completed: Revised Security Classification System Introduced"]    [Text] The prime minister, John Major, today announced the  outcome of a review of the management of security in government  departments and agencies. This has been conducted against the  background of recent changes in the nature of the threats to  government security and the Government's White Paper on Openness.    Answering a Parliamentary Question from Mr. Bob Dunn MP for  Dartford, Mr Major said:    "In recent years, the nature of the threats to government  security has changed. Whilst some of the traditional threats to  national security may have somewhat reduced, others have not.  The security of Government is also increasingly threatened by  for example theft, copying and electronic surveillance, as well  as by terrorism.    ``To ensure that its approach to security reflects current  threats, the Government has recently completed a review of its  arrangements for the management of protective security in  departments and agencies. This has recommended a new protective  marking system for documents which will help identify more  precisely those which need protecting, enabling them to be  protected more effectively according to their value. The new  system will also be more closely related to the Code of Practice  on Government Information announced in the Government's White  Paper on Openness.    ``In addition, the review has concluded that existing  security measures should be examined closely to ensure they are  necessary in relation to today's threats; that commercially  available security equipment should be more widely used; and  that personnel vetting enquiries should be streamlined  particularly in routine cases. Overall, the aim is to give  departments and agencies, and management units within them,  greater responsibility for assessing the nature of the risks  they face and for making decisions, within a framework of common  standards of protection, about the security measures they need  to put in place. Substantial cost savings will result.    ``The first stage of the implementation of the proposals of  this review will be the introduction of a new protective marking  system with effect from 4 April 1994 alongside the Code of  Practice on Access to Government Information. The new  definitions, which will allow fewer Government documents to be  classified, particularly at the higher levels, are set out  below. The other elements of the new approach to protective  security will be put in place in due course.''  <H5>  The Four Categories of Protective Marking: Definitions </H5>   The markings to be allocated to any asset, including  information, will be determined primarily by reference to the  practical consequences that are likely to result from the  compromise of that asset or information. The levels in the new  protective marking system are defined as follows:    TOP SECRET: the compromise of this information or material  would be likely: to threaten directly the internal stability of  the UK or friendly countries; to lead directly to widespread  loss of life; to cause exceptionally grave damage to the  effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or to the  continuing effectiveness of extremely valuable security or  intelligence operations; to cause exceptionally grave damage to  relations with friendly governments; to cause severe long-term  damage to the UK economy.    SECRET: the compromise of this information or material would  be likely: to raise international tension; to damage seriously  relations with friendly governments; to threaten life directly,  or seriously prejudice public order, or individual security or  liberty; to cause serious damage to the operational  effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the  continuing effectiveness of highly valuable security or  intelligence operations; to cause substantial material damage to  national finances or economic and commercial interests.    CONFIDENTIAL: the compromise of this information or material  would be likely: materially to damage diplomatic relations (ie  cause formal protest or other sanction); to prejudice individual  security or liberty; to cause damage to the operational  effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the  effectiveness of valuable security or intelligence operations;  to work substantially against national finances or economic and  commercial interests; substantially to undermine the financial  viability of major organisations; to impede the investigation or  facilitate the commission of serious crime; to impede seriously  the development or operation of major government policies; to  shut down or otherwise substantially disrupt significant  national operations.    RESTRICTED: the compromise of this information or material  would be likely: to affect diplomatic relations adversely; to  cause substantial distress to individuals; to make it more  difficult to maintain the operational effectiveness or security  of UK or allied forces; to cause financial loss or loss of  earning potential to or facilitate improper gain or advantage  for individuals or companies; to prejudice the investigation or  facilitate the commission of crime; to breach proper  undertakings to maintain the confidence of information provided  by third parties; to impede the effective development or  operation of government policies; to breach statutory  restrictions on disclosure of information; to disadvantage  government in commercial or policy negotiations with others; to  undermine the proper management of the public sector and its  operations.  <H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>   1. The existing protective marking system comprises a  classification system of four levels relating to national  security, complemented by a complex range of privacy markings  (eg COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE, MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE) relevant  to other sensitive information. These markings will be replaced  from 4 April 1994 by a single system of protective markings that  encompasses the whole range of information and other assets held  by government.    2. The definitions on which the current system is based are:    --TOP SECRET: "causing exceptionally grave damage to the  nation"    --SECRET: "causing serious injury to the interests of the  nation"    --CONFIDENTIAL: "being damaging to the interests of the  nation"    --RESTRICTED: "being undesirable in the interests of the  nation"    Privacy markings cover lower levels of damage, or harm to  interests narrower than that of the nation as a whole.    3. The new markings retain the same labels as the old  classifications, but the definitions have been elaborated so as  to encompass the threats to government information both in  respect of national security and more widely. They have also  been defined in terms of the consequences of compromise. This  makes the definitions less abstract, so that people can better  decide on the right level of marking for any information. The  intention is that these markings will serve as a signal to  indicate the standard of protection that needs to be afforded to  the information in question. This will help both to drive down  the amount of information classified, particularly at the higher  levels, and to encourage the provision of sufficient, but not  excessive, standards of protection.    4. Costs. It is difficult to establish the current costs of  security in government. Costs are spread widely and impinge on  a wide range of government activities. However the direct,  observable costs of security management in government are  currently estimated at over 300 million pounds a year. Savings  are expected to arise from the protective marking system  reducing the amount of material afforded the highest, hence most  expensive, levels of protection; from enabling departments and  agencies to put in place what they determine to be the most  cost-effective protective measures in their own circumstances;  from a critical review of the value added by existing security  measures; from making maximum use of industry-standard  equipment; and from the streamlining of the personnel vetting  system.    5. In addition, it is expected that the implementation of  the  review findings will enable contractors employed on classified  government business to reduce their own security costs and will  encourage wider competition amongst contractors for classified  government work.</p>

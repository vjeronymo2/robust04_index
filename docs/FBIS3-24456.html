Ms.  Kurkova accused the missing man of organizing the mass  provocation against her personally and against the democratic  management of the television and radio company as a whole by  setting up a sponsorship agreement between "Kommercheskiy tsentr  TV i radio Peterburga" [Commercial TV and Radio Center of St.  Petersburg] and the limited partnership "Nevskiy Glashatay"  [Neva Herald], which her husband, Vadim Tareyev, heads. That  agreement was the cause of the scandal.    According to information which is as yet unconfirmed, Mr.  Syroyezhin is now in Austria, protecting himself from the  focused interest of law enforcement organs. People in the  company are also saying that the missing man called Ms. Kurkova  and informed her that he is in one of the hospitals on Russian  Federation territory where he is hiding from the "raids" of  racketeers. It is possible, however, that both versions are far  from reality, since contradictory rumors are flying through the  halls of the RGTRK [Russian State Television and Radio Company]  that Mr. Syroyezhin was seen in the United States, while others  allege that he has "holed up" in Moscow.    However, it has become known that there exist directives  signed by Mr. Syroyezhin transferring large amounts of the  television and radio company's capital abroad--to the account of  the company TV and Radio St. Petersburg, whose founder is once  again Mr. Syroyezhin himself. Taking into account the fact that  it was the "American" company TV and Radio St. Petersburg which,  with the approval of the vice premier of the Russian government,  Vladimir Shumeyko, was supposed to receive 49 percent of the  charter capital in conjunction with the joint stock company  RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 (the RGTRK with Mr. Shumeyko's  approval was supposed to invest all its buildings, structures,  and equipment in the joint stock company's charter capital); it  is likely that the scandal will prove to be larger than was  initially supposed.    It is interesting that Mr. Syroyezhin at one time was  appointed deputy chairman of the RGTRK by that same Ms. Kurkova.  Now even she and her husband are trying to have nothing to do  with the energetic Mr. Syroyezhin. In a statement on one of the  broadcasts of St. Petersburg radio, Mr. Tareyev explained that  he took R12 million as sponsorship aid from the joint stock  company Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. Petersburg  (although he suspected its indirect budget origin) and  surrendered to the persuasion of Mr. Syroyezhin whom he trusted  because he knew his father, a scientist well known in Petersburg.    Ms. Kurkova in turn explained that she knew nothing at all  about her husband's firm receiving major financial aid from the  partners of the state television and radio company which she  manages.    Now the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 is  trying to impart a purely political look to the scandal  surrounding the RGTRK's financial activity. In a broadcast on  St. Petersburg radio, which is subordinate to Ms. Kurkova, she  was called a "fearless journalist whom her enemies, most of whom  she acquired during the years of perestroyka, want to settle  accounts with." Taking into account that the political  opposition had a hand in the appearance of the packet of  documents on the activity of the management of the RGTRK  Petersburg-Channel 5 at the procurator's office, Bella Kurkova  announced that the ultimate goal of the organizers of the  scandal is to "remove first Kurkova, and then Sobchak, and then  even Yeltsin from office."    A special presidential commission which came to St.  Petersburg to verify the accusations against Ms. Kurkova is more  and more inclined to the conclusion that if the RGTRK management  did in fact do some strange things, it was not out of malice;  the head of the commission, Andrey Semikolennyy, announced in an  interview on St. Petersburg radio: "Kurkova has become a victim  of major political provocation." It is altogether possible that  even the city procurator's office will be satisfied with the  explanations of the "difficult circumstances" in which the  management of the television and radio company found itself and  will terminate the investigation.</p>

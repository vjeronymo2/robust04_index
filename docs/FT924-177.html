			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Management: Bulgarian entrepreneurs cash in on capital ideas  -The early success of market initiatives In 1989 Irona Komitova and her colleagues were called 'happy suiciders' by sceptics who doubted their ability to encourage market sector initiatives in Bulgaria. Three years on they work in smart offices in the centre of Sofia, having successfully created Bulgaria's first private bank, launched a string of business newspapers, set-up an insurance company and initiated several key pieces of commercial legislation. Their organisation also acts as a voice for the country's emerging entrepreneurs. Komitova, aged 33, is a founder member of the Union for Private Economic Enterprises which was formed in 1989 on the initiative of Valentin Mollov, a Sofia lawyer. Mollov started the UPEE by asking for volunteers on a local radio station. About 600 would-be entrepreneurs, including Komitova, then working at a steel institute, turned up at the first meeting. 'Even before the fall of the Zhivkov (communist) regime in November 1989, we had had Law 56 which permitted individuals to set up private companies. Mollov had the idea of bringing these people together,' she explains. A core team of seven emerged with Komitova becoming secretary general, a post she still holds. Within five months, the UPEE had launched First Private Bank. 'We played an 'incubating' role for the bank. We approached the legislature to amend the constitution which did not allow private banks. We organised the share subscription and publicised the necessity of a private bank in the press,' Komitova says. The bank, which lends mainly to private companies, now has more than 70 branches and 650 employees. The UPEE also launched a weekly business newspaper. 'We called it 168 Hours  -the number of hours in the week,' Komitova says. 'We wanted to get across the idea that a market economy means hard work and that private businessmen are responsible for their companies seven days a week.' The group launched another business newspaper, 24 Hours, in 1991. Within two months it was Bulgaria's top-selling daily. 'Independent information about the market economy is essential in a country like Bulgaria which had one of the most closed communist regimes,' Komitova says. According to the UPEE, another leftover from the past is the state's attitude towards entrepreneurs. 'The government has been slow to facilitate the financing and new legislation that private business needs', she says. 'Privatisation of state companies should not be presented as the only way to a private sector. We encourage entrepreneurs to set up their own companies - it's easier and cheaper.' The UPEE lobbied successfully for the corporate tax rate to be reduced from 50 to 40 per cent. It has also helped to draft legislation, including laws to govern small- and medium-sized companies. The UPEE leaders have not concealed their new-found riches. They all have shares in First Private Bank. Some have developed their own projects. Dimiter Zvezdev, UPEE vice-president, for example, owns a computer plant in Singapore. 'We've been open because we want to promote the idea that it's not a vice to be rich,' Komitova says. 'Historically, Bulgaria has been more conservative than the central European countries. We've had fewer examples of what private initiative can achieve.' But there is still disbelief that the group has earned its profits legally. UPEE companies have been investigated several times for alleged tax fraud. 'Government officials cannot understand that certain types of businesses can make really big money,' says Petyo Blaskov, editor-in-chief of the 168 Hours press group. Komitova also believes UPEE has been targeted because it is critical of government policy. It has called for faster privatisation, for a bankruptcy law to be passed and for state enterprises, which control 95 per cent of industry, to be managed more professionally. 'The biggest problem private entrepreneurs face is the country's shortage of funds available for investment. Our large external debt has made it hard to raise much foreign capital,' Komitova says. 'It's been encouraging to see the successes of some of our first members. But overall, for private companies in this country, it's still a struggle to survive.'</p>

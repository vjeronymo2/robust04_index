Today, he reiterated the idea of a Jerusalem  united under Israeli control. For the old part of the city, at  the center of the dispute, Rabin has proposed a tripartite  administration. Miguel Moreira reports.    [Moreira] This morning Rabin spoke for more than an hour  with  Portuguese businessmen and tried to convince them that to invest  in Israel could prove very beneficial. According to Rabin,  peace is very close and the future is promising. The AIP  [Portuguese Industrial Association] personnel answered by  nodding their heads. They are willing to go forward with new  deals in civil construction and textiles.    At this meeting, Rabin reiterated that the administration of  the sacred part of the city of Jerusalem should be a tripartite  one.    [Begin Rabin recording, in English with superimposed  translation into Portuguese] We believe that one has to  distinguish between the living city of Jerusalem and the holy  city of Jerusalem for the three religions. We are committed to  allow free access and free religious practice to the members of  the Christian and Muslim religious communities. But it is more  than that. The administration of religious shrines is not  carried out by Israel; it is in the hands of the various  churches. [end recording]    [Moreira] After the visit to the AIP, Rabin went to the  Assembly of the Republic where he met [Assembly Speaker] Barbosa  de Melo and a number of political leaders. At the moment, he is  having lunch at Belem Palace with President Soares.</p>

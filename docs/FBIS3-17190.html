Chernomyrdin gave his forecast  on the dollar exchange rate. In his view, the dollar will reach  3,000 rubles by the end of the year. Moreover, Chernomyrdin  said that the government does not intend to take, as he put it,  uncivilized measures or to artificially curb the rise in the  dollar exchange rate any more. Chernomyrdin stressed that there  will be no further mass interventions. We will proceed in a  normal and civilized manner.    Regarding the IMF talks, Chernomyrdin believes that the IMF  has now supported the government's present policy and that there  are no disagreements on the main parameters of the budget after  yesterday's talks -- which, to remind you, ended late last  night, after 2300. The agreed parameters are as follows: A  monthly inflation rate of about seven percent by the end of the  year; a federal budget deficit of about nine percent of the  gross domestic product.    Lastly, replying to a question from journalists about  tomorrow's government sitting, Chernomyrdin said that no changes  would be made to the draft budget submitted to the Russian State  Duma following the talks with the IMF.

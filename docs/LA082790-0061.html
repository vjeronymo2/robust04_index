			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Probes Alleged TV Dumping: The Commerce Department said it has opened an  inquiry into whether Asian and Canadian television makers are trying to avoid a  U.S. "anti-dumping" ruling on selling color television tubes in the United  States.  </P> <P> The agency ruled in 1988 that companies in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and  Canada were selling the sets with the tubes at below cost. In making the  ruling, it assessed anti-dumping duties. A coalition of U.S. color tube makers  and their unions asked the department to see if the firms were skirting  anti-dumping duties by having the sets assembled in Mexico.  </P></p>

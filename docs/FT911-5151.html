			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Lower interest lifts S Lyles to Pounds 316,000 Substantially lower interest charges helped S Lyles, the yarn spinner and dyer, to increase pre-tax profit from Pounds 301,000 to Pounds 316,000 in the half-year ended December 31 1990. Turnover fell from Pounds 9.82m to Pounds 8.58m, a reflection of both the volume of business and lower commodity prices, said Mr John Lyles, the chairman. The quality of business, however, remained high, he said, and 'we now sense there is a feeling of gradual recovery in the air'. Earnings per share in the half-year came to 2.64p (2.51p) and the interim dividend is again 1.5p. The company is seeking authority to purchase its ordinary shares, and repay the preference shares at par. An extraordinary general meeting has been called for May 13.</p>

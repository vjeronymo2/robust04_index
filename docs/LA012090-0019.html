			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ER FANS GET LAST LAUGH AT COLUMNISTS  </P> <P> I would like to express my thanks to Mike Downey for giving all the Southland  49er fans a team to root for in the AFC title game as well. Mr. Downey's  baseless column picking the Rams and the Browns in Super Bowl XXIV so  thoroughly incensed my fellow Niner supporters that we found ourselves pulling  for the Broncos in the entirely meaningless AFC championship, simply to prove  Mr. Downey an incompetent prognosticator. I get the feeling that Mr. Downey,  perhaps rethinking his predictions, requested the Denver assignment on Sunday  so as to avoid directly facing the music on Monday.  </P> <P> Thanks again; perhaps he would do all the 49er fans an additional favor by  making the Broncos his Super Bowl pick.  </P> <P> PETER ARONSON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

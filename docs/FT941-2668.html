			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / MPs to probe committee system A powerful committee of MPs is preparing to review how Westminster's select committee system can be made to function more effectively. The cross-party Commons liaison committee - comprising all select committee chairmen - wants to conduct the review partly in response to a campaign of procedural non-co-operation with the government that Labour has been waging since December. Some of the chairmen are pressing for the liaison committee to cast its net wider. They would like to see the review examine whether the select committees, parliament's most powerful tool for scrutinising the executive, need greater powers to do their job. In particular, they want the review to consider whether there should be an automatic right for committee recommendations to be put to a Commons vote. Since many of the chairmen believe that the committees' powers are already extensive and adequate, the scope of the review is generally expected to fall short of these demands. It is expected to consider, however, whether more debating time needs to be set aside in the Commons to evaluate select committee reports, and whether steps need to be taken to limit the influence of party whips. The most bad feeling in the procedural battle has been caused by Labour's decision to refuse to allow its MPs to 'pair' - that is, to agree with a Tory counterpart to miss a non-crucial vote.</p>

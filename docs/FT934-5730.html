			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Army purge strengthens Nigeria's military ruler General Sani Abacha strengthened his position as Nigeria's new head of state at the weekend by purging army officers loyal to the former military ruler, Gen Ibrahim Babangida. He also formed a civilian cabinet which balances tribal loyalties and includes some respected ministers. The moves show Nigeria's military ruler, who seized power on November 17, combines ruthlessness and persuasion in dealing with opponents. Following last week's forced retirement of Lt Gen Aliyu Mohammed as head of the army, the removal of 17 officers including nine brigadiers is seen as a decisive blow to Gen Babangida's remaining support in the armed forces. A reshuffle in September under the interim government had failed to curb pro-Babangida factions at the senior level or to quell unrest in lower ranks. The 33-member cabinet, known as the executive council, includes several supporters of Mr Moshood Abiola, who emerged the unofficial winner of the annulled presidential election in June. The cabinet is headed by Gen Abacha and the chief of general staff, Lt Gen Oladipo Diya, who comes from the pro-Abiola south-west, and includes as foreign minister Mr Babagana Kingibe, interior minister Mr Akex Ibru and education minister Dr Iyorchia Ayu. The finance minister, Mr K I Kalu, served in the same post in the mid-1980s, earning respect as an advocate of market reforms. Together with Mr Paul Ogwuma, a recent appointment as central bank governor, Mr Don Etiebet, who is retained from the interim government as oil minister, and Mr Adamu Ciroma, another former finance minister, Gen Abacha has an economic team which, if allowed free rein, could achieve reforms that western creditors are seeking.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Resumption of Cooperation Calls for </F> Abandonment of Confrontation"]    [Text] The upcoming visit to China of the British Foreign  Office Minister Alastair Goodlad was first disclosed by the  British Foreign Office and then confirmed by the Chinese  department concerned.    Although he is not coming to discuss the issue of Hong Kong,  he should be coming to improve Sino-British relations and resume  friendship and cooperation. Otherwise, the visit will be  meaningless.    Some newspapers in Hong Kong have expressed a welcome for  Goodlad's upcoming visit to China and have held that this is a  sign of improvement in Sino-British relations.    In the past few years, Britain has erroneously estimated the  situation in China and has changed its policy toward China, thus  harming the friendship and cooperation between China and  Britain. China has not developed in the direction of the  illusions cherished by Britain but instead, has become more  open, more prosperous, and stronger. Practice has proved that  the British Government's confrontation with China goes against  the global tide, does harm to its own interests, and does not  have the support of the people. China is a vast market with an  extremely large potential and is a country that holds the  balance of the world. Whoever ignores her or even has trouble  with her will come to grief. Not long ago, the Clinton  administration was uncompromising in insisting on linking human  rights with trade and claimed that it would not extend China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status if China did not "improve  its human rights" situation according to their instructions.  The Clinton administration had no alternative but to succumb to  the reality of China's extraordinary development and finally  extended China's MFN status without any conditions attached,  expressing its willingness to strengthen trade and economic  cooperation with China. At present, some economically large  countries in the world are trying to have closer ties and  cooperation with China. Can the British people think of why  their government wants to have confrontation with China instead  of taking an approach in the interests of the people? Recently,  the Conservative Party of the British Prime Minister John Major  suffered a total defeat in the parliamentary elections, losing  all five seats; this was followed by bitter defeat in the  European Council elections in which nearly half of the original  32 seats were lost mainly to the opposition, the Labor Party.  This has evidently shown the voters' dissatisfaction with the  British Government and John Major's position is in danger.  Under such circumstances, the Major administration has no  alternative but to look for some way out. Trying to improve  relations with China and to resume cooperation is one of the way  out.    The key to improving Sino-British relations is that Britain  must abandon its erroneous policy of confrontation with China.  A report issued recently by the Foreign Affairs Select  Committee of the British Parliament discloses the situation of  changes in the policy toward China by the British Government in  recent years and also counsels the British Government about  continuing its confrontation with China, thus adding fuel to the  fire. If the British Government really wants to resume  Sino-British cooperation, it must make an open statement on its  stance toward that report.    People will judge whether or not Britain has the sincerity  to  improve its relations with China by its actions. Although  Alastair Goodlad's visit to China is not for discussing the Hong  Kong issue, he cannot avoid touching upon the Hong Kong issue  and his visit cannot have any impact on how to handle the issue  of Hong Kong. What Chris Patten practices in Hong Kong will be  an important expression of the change in the British  Government's policy toward China. If Alastair Goodlad really  comes to improve relations and to resume cooperation, he should  urge the British side to create an atmosphere of cooperation on  the issue of Hong Kong and to negotiate and solve together with  the Chinese side, some pressing problems such as those  concerning the new airport, the military use of land, and so on.    Regarding the political structure, it is impossible to have  Sino- British cooperation because the basis for such cooperation  has been completely destroyed by the British side. Qian Qichen,  State Council Vice premier and concurrently Foreign Minister,  reaffirmed yesterday: "It does not matter whatever plan the  1994 and 1995 elections are carried out, the terms of office of  those elected will only last till 30 June 1997 and after that,  the councils concerned will be reorganized". However, China and  Britain can cooperate in issues other than the issue of  political structure, such as economic and social issues and  issues concerning the people's livelihood. The Chinese side has  always been sincere in such cooperation. So long as the  proposals conform with the principle of state sovereignty and  smooth transition and are in the interests of the economic and  social development of Hong Kong and of the peaceful and  contented lives and work of the residents, the Chinese side will  adopt a positive attitude to negotiate with the British side and  to solve all the problems in a fair and reasonable manner. Vice  Premier Qian Qichen said that the breaking down of talks on the  elections in 1994 and 1995 was something of the past and at  present, the two sides should seek opportunities for cooperation  on other issues.    Regarding solutions to problems of the new airport and land  for military use, Qian Qichen, State Council Vice Premier and  concurrently Foreign Minister, Lu Ping, director of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Chen Zuoer, representative of  the Chinese side on the Defense and Social Order Subcommittee,  have in the past few days adopted optimistic attitudes. They  all believe that progress has been made in the talks and hope  that agreements can be reached earlier rather than later. This  shows that the Chinese side sincerely hopes to cooperate with  the British side.    It seems the British side has been put to the test. If the  British side shows a cooperative attitude at meetings of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and is willing to listen to  fair and reasonable views from the Chinese side, the two sides  will be able to reach agreements on the new airport and land for  military use and this will show Alastair Goodlad's sincerity to  improve relations and resume cooperation in his visit to China.    In short, since Alastair Goodlad wants to seek cooperation  in  Beijing, he should create a favorable atmosphere for cooperation  before he starts his trip. This should be shown not only in  words but also in deeds. Talking about Alastair Goodlad's visit  to China, British Ambassador to China Robin McClaren said that  the British side hoped to resume better relations but denied  that the British side hoped to readjust the policy for  Sino-British relations during the visit. We can only ask: Can  China and Britain resume "better relations" if the policy toward  China is not readjusted? What is the meaning of the remarks by  the ambassador?</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa agreement talks focus on withholding plan A SCHEME to withhold cocoa from the oversupplied world market is expected to dominate this week's meeting of producers and consumers. Delegates gathered here for a second round of talks on a new accord to replace the present International Cocoa Agreement, which expires in September 1993, say the three-week meeting, held under the auspices of the UN Conference on Trade and Development, will focus on the scope, finance and operation of the export withholding scheme proposed by consuming countries to stabilise prices. Although the producers have not formally withdrawn their preferred export quota plan, it is regarded as having effectively been abandoned at the first round of talks in April. Producing countries, hit hard by the slump in cocoa prices, overproduction and excess stocks, are anxious to conclude a new agreement before the current cocoa year ends in September. But delegates believe another session of talks is likely to be needed. These have already been pencilled in for next November. Mr Kouame N'Guessan of the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, speaking for all producers at Monday's opening session, said they had come to the meeting 'ready for compromise'. However, Mr Zago Jacob Goffa, the Ivory Coast delegate, said any new agreement must stabilise prices at remunerative levels. Under a withholding scheme, this would mean withdrawing whatever quantity of cocoa from the market was necessary to defend an agreed price range, Mr Goffa said. Producers want to keep the price range at the SDR1,485-2,155 a tonne (Pounds 1,120-Pounds 1,620) ruling when the International Cocoa Organisation suspended price support early in 1988. The European Community, which accounts for 40 per cent of world cocoa consumption, has proposed limiting withholding to 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes. Consumers see export withholding as a temporary measure while producers put in place, by quotas or other means, tough curbs on production to balance world supply and demand. Producers want more onus on withholding to 'manage' the market.</p>

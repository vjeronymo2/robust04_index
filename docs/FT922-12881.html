			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Moody's lowers rating on Dollars 7.5bn of Nissan debt THE FINANCIAL troubles of Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest vehicle maker, were yesterday underscored when Moody's Investor Service, the US rating agency, lowered its credit rating for Dollars 7.5bn of Nissan debt. Moody's said it expected Nissan's operating returns and other financial measures would remain under pressure in the medium term. The downgrading amounted to a conclusion that Nissan's corporate strategy for the past five years - which included heavy spending to improve the product line-up - had failed to deliver any financial benefits to the company. Although Nissan has managed in Japan to polish its stodgy image among consumers by launching a series of radically styled cars, other car companies have followed a similar strategy and have neutralised any potential benefit for Nissan. As a result its market share stopped declining in Japan about five years ago, but has not improved. Moody's said it did 'not expect Nissan to significantly strengthen its market position in the coming years. As a result, Nissan's profitability and cash generating ability, which have been pressured by soft market conditions, are likely to remain depressed during the intermediate term.' Moody's said Nissan's aggressive research and development and capital investment have led to increased levels of debt. Nissan's capital structure could be weakened further should the spending continue, unless Nissan finds a way to improve cash generation. Nissan none the less had strong balance sheet liquidity, with cash and short-term investments of over Y800bn (Dollars 6bn), and large unrealised gains on its short-term investment portfolio. As a result of these considerations, Moody's lowered Nissan's long-term debt rating from A1 to A2.</p>

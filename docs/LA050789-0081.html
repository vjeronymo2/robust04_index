			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Three hundred anti-nuclear protesters appeared outside Kings Bay Naval  Submarine Base near St. Mary's, Ga., and 59 were arrested in the largest of 28  demonstrations at nuclear facilities around the country. Pax Christi, a  national Roman Catholic peace group based in Erie, Pa., organized the protests  to mark the anniversary of a 1983 pastoral letter from U.S. Catholic bishops  that opposed the development of first-strike nuclear systems. Those arrested,  including a 79-year-old woman who carried a sign that read "Granny for Peace,"  were cited for trespassing and obstructing the road in front of the base,  police said. Bruce Nelson, a spokesman for the Camden County Sheriff's  Department, said two demonstrators, who gave their names as John and Jane Doe,  were jailed on charges of refusal to give their proper names. The others were  released after being given warning citations, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 18 MORE WELLS WILL MONITOR RADIATION IN WATER  </P> <P> Rockwell International and U.S. Department of Energy officials said Friday that  18 additional ground-water monitoring wells will be installed by the end of the  year in a portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory where nuclear research  was conducted for nearly 40 years.  </P> <P> The announcement follows an Energy Department report that identified areas of  radioactive and chemical pollution on the site and called for more  environmental tests. The California Regional Water Quality Board in Los  Angeles, responding to the report, said additional monitoring wells will be  required at the site three miles west of Chatsworth and two miles southeast of  Simi Valley.  </P> <P> The report said more wells are necessary since inadequacies in the lab's  ground-water monitoring system make it impossible to tell the full extent of  chemical and radioactive pollution at the 2,668-acre complex. Currently, the  company monitors 123 on-site wells.  </P> <P> James Werner, a former consultant who worked on the report, is a scientist with  the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. He said news of  the additional wells is "encouraging, but meaningless unless they work with the  regulatory agencies" in placing the wells where they would be most likely to  detect pollution.  </P> <P> Rockwell and Energy Department officials said Friday they intended to work with  regulatory agencies in locating the new wells.  </P> <P> Officials said Friday in an interview that the additional wells "should put to  rest any fears" about pollution moving off the site. Steve Lafflam,  environmental manager of the site, said the 18 wells will cost the Energy  Department about $250,000.  </P> <P> The lab, operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne division in a rugged area of the  Simi Hills, has been on the state Superfund cleanup list for several years  because of high levels of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a chemical solvent, in  ground water beneath the complex. Rocketdyne has been treating ground water in  one part of the property where TCE has been found at levels of up to 11,000  p.p.b., 2,200 times the amount that would be allowed in drinking water.  </P> <P> The report acknowledged apparently for the first time that some radioactive  contamination also exists in soil and structures from nuclear operations and  spills. Energy Department officials said radioactively contaminated soil exists  in an area known as the sodium burn pit and a sewage leach field where  radioactive water has been spilled. They said the highest radiation level found  so far has been 4,900 picocuries per gram of soil, or up to 190 times the  natural background levels.  </P> <P> Rocketdyne and Energy Department officials said pollution at the site poses no  immediate threat to nearby residents.  </P> <P> Between 1947 and 1986, nuclear research was conducted on a 290-acre portion of  the site, part of which was leased by Energy Department. About 12 nuclear  reactors operated there, including the first plant in the United States to  provide nuclear-powered electricity to consumers.  </P> <P> No nuclear work currently is being done at the site, although Rocketdyne plans  to bid on contracts with Energy Department to recycle spent nuclear fuel rods,  said R.J. Tuttle, manager of radiation and nuclear safety at the site.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Myron Levin contributed to this story.  </P></p>

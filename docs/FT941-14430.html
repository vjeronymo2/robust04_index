			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Crest seeks Pounds 19m for return to offensive Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based house builder and commercial property developer, yesterday announced a Pounds 19.1m rights issue to expand its land bank and increase development activities, after three years of retrenchment. The announcement was accompanied by the release of better than expected profit figures for the year to October 31. Some 22.53m new shares are to be issued at 88p on a 1-for-4 basis. This represents an 18 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing share price of 108p. Holders of convertible preference shares will be offered 88 new shares for every 1,000 held. The ordinary share price closed up 6p at 114p. Pre-tax profits for 1993 came to Pounds 2.13m after an exceptional charge of Pounds 2m, which resulted from a judgment against Crest Nicholson over its failure to complete on a land purchase in 1988. The figures for 1992, restated for FRS 3, showed a Pounds 975,000 loss. Sales in the 12 months increased 15 per cent to Pounds 273m (Pounds 238m). Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, said the rights issue would provide funds for the expansion of its short-term land bank - diversifying away from its core southern focus - and the redevelopment of some of its higher margin strategic land holdings. The company is emerging from two years of losses following the collapse in house prices in 1990 and 1991. Mr Callcutt said: 'In the last three years, we have been fighting back from the brink. We are now in a position where gearing has come back down to 39 per cent, and we have done this without calling on shareholders.' The management would be satisfied with gearing below 50 per cent, compared with a post rights gearing ratio of 17 per cent. The dividend of 1p marks Crest's first pay-out since 1990. Earnings per share amounted to 0.01p (3.96p losses). COMMENT This rights issue sets the seal on a remarkable turnround in the company's fortunes since Mr Callcutt took over in July 1991. Net debt has been more than halved, from Pounds 104m to Pounds 40m, turnover of residential houses has hit record levels despite the recession and the group has successfully unloaded the bulk of its lower margin sites acquired at the peak of the late 1980s property boom. Its current task is to translate this into profits. The company enjoyed pre-tax profits of Pounds 37.1m in the year to October 1989, but analysts do not expect it to revisit these levels for some time.</p>

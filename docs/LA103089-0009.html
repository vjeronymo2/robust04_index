			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEBSTER HAS DEFINITION OF KINGS: AWFUL  </P> <P> After being shut out for the first time in 262 regular-season games last week  against Calgary, the Kings came to Winnipeg with a sense of urgency. But when  the Kings beat the Jets Friday night, it got on a plane and left for somewhere  else. Pittsburgh, they hope. The spiritless Kings stayed behind and lost, 6-1,  Sunday night in the rematch against the Jets.  </P> <P> Having spent three days and four nights in a town that only Nanook of the North  could love, it appeared as if rigor mortis had set in on the Kings by the time  they arrived at Winnipeg Arena. But King Coach Tom Webster slapped that excuse  away when it was offered to him after the game.  </P> <P> The Kings were outshot, 42-20. They also were outhustled and outhit. But  Webster had not seen enough. He called a practice for 8 o'clock this morning,  three hours before the Kings are scheduled to catch a plane for Pittsburgh.  They will play the third game of a six-game, 11-day road trip there Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> Actually, the Kings reserved ice time at Winnipeg Arena for this morning's  workout before the loss. But Webster made it sound like a punishment when he  informed the players of it Sunday night.  </P> <P> Otherwise, he would not discuss his postgame remarks to the players. But he  could not have been much more blunt with them than he was with reporters.  </P> <P> When one asked how he liked the Kings' effort, a bewildered Webster said, "How  can you ask that question?"  </P> <P> Webster answered it anyway.  </P> <P> "It was just an awful effort," he said. "We did not come determined to play. It  was very evident from the start. Winnipeg wanted this hockey game. We got  frustrated when we couldn't score, and we quit working.  </P> <P> "I'd like to sit back and give them the benefit of the doubt, but right now  it's hit the boiling point."  </P> <P> Unlike last season's coach, the taciturn Robbie Ftorek, who always appeared as  if he needed a Rolaids, Webster is amiable and patient. No one was even sure if  he had a boiling point.  </P> <P> But after three truly terrible performances in four games since last Sunday --  a 7-4 loss at Chicago, a 5-0 loss at home against Calgary for the Kings' first  scoreless game in more than three years and this 6-1 loss to the Smythe  Division's last-place team -- it was no more Mr. Nice Guy.  </P> <P> If any of the Kings disagreed with Webster's assessment, none dared talk back  to him.  </P> <P> Later, sitting on a chair outside the locker room with his head bowed, team  captain Wayne Gretzky sympathized with his coach.  </P> <P> "All three of the coaches are pretty frustrated," he said, speaking of Webster  and his two assistants. "They've been patient with everybody, but sooner or  later their patience runs thin.  </P> <P> "I think we're all very disappointed in the way we've handled ourselves.  Winnipeg played well tonight, but we didn't rise to the occasion. We just  played awful."  </P> <P> They rose to the occasion 48 hours earlier, playing as if they had something to  prove after Wednesday night's embarrassment against Calgary and beat the  improved Jets, 3-1. But that seemed to satisfy the Kings.  </P> <P> "When you win, you've got to be happy," Gretzky said. "But then you've got to  forget about it. You've got to be . . . (ticked) off to play the next game. We  haven't done that yet."  </P> <P> Gretzky, who was held pointless for the third time this season, almost did not  stay around for the end of the game. He was sent to the penalty box for the  first time this season for high-sticking with 3:39 remaining. Unfortunately for  him, it was only a two-minute penalty and he had to return.  </P> <P> With 1:30 remaining, King goaltender Kelly Hrudey also was charged with a  penalty for roughing after delivering a forearm to Winnipeg winger Paul Fenton.  </P> <P> That certainly was the result of frustration. He said that he was angry at the  Jets for not respecting his space.  </P> <P> Hrudey could have been just as angry at the Kings' defensemen, who should have  had to pay for tickets to watch the game along with the 14,367 fans. Hrudey was  the only player Webster praised. The goaltender had 36 saves, one more than he  had in the 3-1 victory Friday night.  </P> <P> But when baited by reporters about his teammates, Hrudey would have nothing of  it. He did not even criticize them for not delivering a new stick to him for  four minutes in the third period after his broke.  </P> <P> By then, it hardly mattered.  </P> <P> For one reason, Jet goalie Daniel Berthiaume had his best game of the season.  That came as a surprise to the fans, who booed him lustily before the game,  because he gave up four goals in the first 10 shots of a 6-4 victory last week  against Washington.  </P> <P> But the Jets (5-6) got major-league goaltending against the Kings (6-6) from  rookie Tom Draper Friday night and Berthiaume Sunday night.  </P> <P> The Kings, however, made heroes of a lot of Jets Sunday night.  </P> <P> Left winger Brent Ashton scored not only his first goal of the season, but also  his second. Defender Fredrik Olausson scored his first goal. Another defender,  Dave Ellett, scored two goals.  </P> <P> The lone King goal came on a sneaky shot by center Bernie Nicholls from the  right side after he took a pass behind the net from right winger Dave Taylor.  That came with 6:54 remaining in the second period. Winnipeg got the goal back  three minutes later on a perfect slap shot by Ellett that sent defender Barry  Beck and Hrudey sprawling.  </P> <P> That is a good adjective for the Kings as they head to Pittsburgh, feeling a  sense of urgency. Whether that is just a 24-hour bug or can be sustained  probably will not be known until later in the week.  </P></p>

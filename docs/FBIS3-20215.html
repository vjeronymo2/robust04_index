			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Rauf Denktas has said that UN  officials are trying to impose the confidence-building measures  package on the Turkish Cypriots by applying pressure. Denktas  met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant  special envoy in Cyprus, at 1600 today. [passage omitted]    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that the  Turkish Cypriot side is in favor of continuing the talks on the  package. Denktas declared, however, that the UN officials are  pressuring the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the package  without even allowing it to assess the latest developments.  Pointing out that additions have been made to the package, and  topics that are not related to the package have been included in  it, Denktas remarked that it is impossible to be forced to  accept these proposals by a certain date. These proposals  include matters concerning the guarantee issue, to which the  Turkish Cypriot people are very sensitive, Denktas announced,  stressing that it is out of the question for the Turkish Cypriot  side to accept them.    Denktas explained that the Turkish Cypriot side underlined  the flaws and shortcomings of the initial package, which Greek  Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis said he would  accept at the time. Some of these have since been resolved,  Denktas added, noting: They were able to solve some of them.  Therefore, we were not wrong. The rest they did not touch  because the Greek Cypriot side is not willing to accept them.  We do not accept this.</p>

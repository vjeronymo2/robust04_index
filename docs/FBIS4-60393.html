			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 22 (AFP) -- An increase in oil  revenues and reforms in several Arab countries pushed up  domestic investments in 1992 to their highest level in eight  years, an official Arab report said Sunday.    Investments in the Arab League's 22 members stood at 112.16  billion dollars in 1992 compared with 97.97 billion dollars in  1991, 104 billion dollars in 1990 and 91 billion dollars in  1985, the report said.    The report by the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF)  provided no figures in 1993 but economists in the region said  investments were expected to be lower in 1993 due to a sharp  decline in oil prices.    "From the 1993 budgets in most Arab states, especially the  Gulf oil-producers, you could see a rise in expenditure but a  small part was allocated for new projects while the private  sector still heavily depends on government spending," an Abu  Dhabi-based economist said.    The AMF, the Arab League's main financial institution, said  Arab oil earnings increased by 10.4 percent to 102.6 billion  dollars in 1992 from 92.9 billion dollars in 1991 due to  resumption of Kuwaiti oil exports after the Gulf war.    Investments in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and the United  Arab  Emirates (UAE) accounted for more than half the total Arab  public and private investment in 1992, the study showed.    In Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil-producer and exporter,  they stood at 29.57 billion dollars compared with 22.3 billion  dollars in 1991.    They rose to 7.7 billion dollars from 6.1 billion dollars in  Kuwait, to 14.19 billion dollars from 13 billion dollars in  Iraq, and to 7.86 billion dollars from 7.22 billion dollars in  the UAE, the study showed.    Domestic investments also increased in all member states  carrying out economic reforms.    In 1992, they stood at 1.5 billion dollars in Jordan, at  3.79  billion dollars in Tunisia, at 8.25 billion dollars in Egypt, at  6.8 billion dollars in Morocco, and 1.96 billion dollars in  Yemen.    Djibouti and Mauritania emerged with the lowest investment,  standing at 88.3 million dollars and 180.6 million dollars  respectively. The report gave no figures for war-battered  Somalia and the Israeli-occupied territories.    "Investment increased in most Arab countries but key oil-  producers remained by far the main investors," the report said.    It showed investment in Iraq, Libya, Algeria and the six  Gulf  Cooperation Council (GCC) states stood at 83.6 billion dollars  in 1992, compared with 28.5 billion dollars in the remaining  League members.    The report showed those nine oil-producers also accounted  for  the bulk of public and private consumption, estimated at 265.5  billion dollars in 1992 of the total Arab consumption of 378  billion dollars.    Government consumption, which includes spending on services,  stood at 97.3 billion dollars in those nine states, far higher  than consumption in the remaining members of 20.3 billion  dollars.    The report gave no details of the investments but it showed  it affected most components of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).    The GDP in the non-oil industrial sector grew to 50 billion  dollars in 1992 from 40.6 billion dollars in 1991, while the  communication sector increased to 32.4 billion dollars from 31  billion dollars,    In trade and hotels, it rose to 63.9 billion dollars from  54.7 billion dollars. Agriculture surged to 66.7 billion  dollars from 57.5 billion dollars and water, and electricity to  5.77 billion dollars from 5.26 billion dollars.    As a result, the total GDP grew by around 9.7 percent to  483.4 billion dollars in 1992 from 440 billion dollars in 1991.  Those nine oil-producers accounted for 354 billion dollars,  nearly 73 percent of the total Arab GDP in 1992.</p>

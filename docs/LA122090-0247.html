			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BOMB SQUAD GETS WRONG STEER  </P> <P> A congressman's car used to haul fertilizer a few weeks ago triggered a bomb  scare at the White House today.  </P> <P> The alert, which closed the West Wing driveway to traffic for about 50 minutes,  was caused by a bomb-sniffing German shepherd who raised an alarm about Rep.  Herbert Bateman's gray Lincoln while it was parked inside the White House  complex.  </P> <P> The Virginia Republican, with seven other congressmen, was there to brief  President Bush on the group's recent trip to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "It was fertilizer from some azaleas hauled in the back seat a few weeks ago,"  Bateman explained as he left the White House. "Great fun."  </P> <P> But the alert prompted a full shutdown of traffic in and out of the driveway  while a single security official, dressed in a green helmet and bulletproof  vest, carefully combed the car.  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Lang introduces softer tone on ruling Scotland MR Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, yesterday inaugurated a more conciliatory approach by the government to ruling Scotland and called for 'a change of tone in Scottish politics'. Presenting his team of four Scottish Office ministers, Mr Lang again rejected opposition demands for a multi-option referendum on Scotland's constitutional future but did not rule out referendums as a matter of principle. He said no proposal had been put to him by the opposition parties, which were 'puffing and posturing'. Mr Lang said the issue of constitutional change had been dealt with in the general election. The Scottish National party, which fought for Scottish independence, had won only three seats while the biggest swing in Britain against Labour, which wanted a devolved Scottish parliament, had been in Scotland. 'I can see circumstances in which a referendum is a useful mechanism, and for that reason I'm certainly not willing to rule it out in principle,' he said. 'But when you start talking about a referendum on three rather woolly and ill-defined concepts then you identify all kinds of difficulties in phrasing it, in carrying it out and in deciding what has been decided after the referendum has taken place.' Labour and the SNP have demanded a referendum with a choice between the status quo, a devolved Scottish parliament and independence. A rally will be staged in Glasgow on Sunday by Scotland United, a group formed by Labour MPs. Mr Lang said he was willing to listen to proposals for changes in how Scotland was governed within the union of the United Kingdom. His minister of state, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the former advocate general, has responsibility for constitutional matters, in addition to health and home affairs. Lord Fraser said he did not wish to 'over-emphasise' that responsibility. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the education minister, said he wanted 'calm and steady' progress in education after the upheavals of recent years. His fellow junior ministers are Sir Hector Monro and Mr Allan Stewart.</p>

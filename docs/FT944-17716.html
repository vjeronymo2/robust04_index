			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes well above the day's low point Wall Street The jittery US stock markets retreated again yesterday, although the leading indices finished well off the session's lows, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 13.79 lower at 3,787.34, a marked improvement from the early afternoon when the index was down by as much as 53 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was finally off 1.07 at 453.52. But the partial comeback obscured the extent of a downturn set off by fresh data suggesting that the economy was growing at an unmanageable pace. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advances by 1,751 to 538 after heavy volume of 360.3m shares. The losses were not restricted to the New York SE. The Nasdaq composite was down 1.02 at 746.28, while the American SE composite was set back 2.70 to 451.11. The broad sell-off was triggered by the latest in the series of unfavourable surprises which appeared to bring forward the next move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. The Commerce Department said orders of factory goods had jumped 4.4 per cent, confounding analysts who had predicted a 3.5 per cent increase after July's 2.0 per cent decline. Bonds plunged on the news, as fixed-rate investors acted upon their anxieties over the unsettling outlook on inflation. Late in the day the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond was just below 8.00 per cent, an important psychological barrier. The prospect of another move to curb growth depressed many stocks whose fortunes are closely linked to the economic cycle. Alcoa, the aluminium supplier, slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 82 3/4 and Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, gave back Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 53 1/4 . Deere ran counter to the trend, moving forward Dollars 1 to Dollars 67 7/8 . Elsewhere, takeover speculation continued to buffet some individual stocks. On the Nasdaq, Apple surged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 as talk circulated among investors that Motorola would launch a bid for the computer company. Motorola receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 50. Marion Merrell Dow relinquished Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 a day after its shares appreciated 10 per cent. Hoechst, the German group, is said to be considering a move to acquire the drugs company. Dow Chemical, which owns 72 per cent of MMD, retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 . The completion of a deal in the health care field was given a mixed reception by investors. Columbia HCA was marked down Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 after agreeing to acquire HealthTrust, a Nashville-based hospital group, for Dollars 3.68bn in newly issued stock. HealthTrust strengthened Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 on the news.</p>

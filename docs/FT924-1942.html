			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Business in the rainforest THE FINANCE director, specially clad for the occasion in ski jacket, jeans and trainers, explained management-employee relations at his factory. 'People work when and if they want to - including the children.' The Kayapo Indians of A-Ukre village, deep in the Amazonian rainforest - all 238 of them - are founding members of the A-Ukre Trading Company, which harvests Brazil nuts to produce oil for export to the UK. The company was set up in 1990 and last year exported its first production run of 1,500 kilos of virgin cold-pressed oil. This year, about 5,500 kilos are expected. The Body Shop has contracted to buy whatever is produced, for use in hair conditioners. The factory is run as a co-operative - everyone earns the same rate and everyone pitches in, says Bephoti, finance director and A-Ukre warrior. 'They like it because Brazil nut oil production does not destroy the forest or ruin the rivers. When our children are our age they will still be able to make and sell oil,' he says. After wages, the income goes into a community fund to pay for medical treatment, fishing hooks, hunting ammunition, and maintenance and fuel costs for fishing boats and an aeroplane - to make hospital trips. Village settlement has introduced previously unknown health problems to the Kayapo. Bephoti was in London recently with Ropkran, another Kayapo Indian from Pukanu village. He is production director of the Pukanu Trading Company, which is planning to produce Brazil nut oil and bead bracelets for export. The warriors' five-day trip was to raise funds for development schemes - in association with the Body Shop - to help their communities become self-sufficient. Companies in the UK are being asked to invest - either financially or by donating relevant products - in a dental project, health care and education schemes, and in rainforest research. The businessmen were also working on a video project to record their culture.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Beijing attempts to ease traders' worries - Rapid growth has prompted concern over futures regulation THE proliferation of capital and commodity markets in China is proving a bonanza for financial information service companies. However, the rapid growth has prompted concern among traders that the lax regulatory environment may threaten market development. Companies like Reuters and Telerate are witnessing explosive growth, much of which can be attributed to futures trading. 'These companies provide a service which is critical to the trade. The next step is to provide the service in Chinese,' says China MinMetals, China's largest metal trader. Faced with a backlog of orders, both Telerate and Reuters are racing to keep up with demand. 'We are experiencing tremendous growth, but it will peak this year,' says Mr David Feng, Tele-rate's general manager for north-east Asia. Mr Feng says: 'The information service companies have put futures trading in proper order because of their ability to provide accurate information on a real-time basis. This increases the liquidity of the market.' The two financial information companies compete head-on. Industry sources say Reuters has captured a bigger share of foreign exchange dealing services, while Telerate has the advantage in equities trading, especially in southern China. However, the dramatic increase in the number of securities and futures brokerage houses throughout China is providing enormous opportunities for both companies. Last year, China opened eight futures markets which registered a total trade volume of more than 55.8bn yuan (Dollars 9.8bn) for the year. The Shanghai Metals Exchange witnessed its busiest day to date last month, with more than 5bn yuan worth of transactions in one day, against volume of 153.4bn yuan for the first 12 months of operation. Since they cannot retrieve hard currency, foreign trading houses do not participate directly in China's futures trade. 'Once the yuan becomes convertible the situation will improve,' says MinMetals. Local brokers earn hard currency by acting as intermediaries between domestic customers and foreign futures exchanges. China MinMetals' foreign trading, for example, is concentrated on the London Metals Exchange. Traders' worries include the lack of regulations and the absence of standardised contracts. 'So far we have lots of customers, lots of interest and markets with huge potential, but we don't have laws or an enforcement body and we need this as soon as possible,' says China International Futures (CIFCO), China's largest futures brokerage. Last month the State Administration for Industry and Commerce announced new regulations calling for the re-registration of all futures brokerages. Brokerages have to meet a set of regulations, including proof of 10m yuan in registered capital, a minimum of 20 full-time brokers, an efficient accounting system, and necessary floor space with adequate communications. 'This action is only the beginning, but hopefully it will extinguish the activities of the large number of illegal traders. Most of the exchanges still need to develop standardised contracts and proper clearing systems. The establishment of a body to take on this task under the direction of the State Council would be a large step in the right direction,' says MinMetals. It is difficult to say when this will happen. Many exchanges are still using forwarding contracts and have not made the jump to futures contracts, although many analysts believe this will take place within the year. The recent rapid growth of futures markets is a direct reflection of economic reform. Previously, futures were frowned on because of of their speculative nature. Today, shareholders in CIFCO, which started up as recently as December, include government ministries and large state-run investment companies.</p>

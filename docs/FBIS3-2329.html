			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wu Hao (0124 4110) and correspondent Chen </F> Leshan (7115 2867 0810)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to the State  Nationalities Affairs Commission, China has achieved remarkable  success in training and selecting minority cadres, and also, the  nation's policies and rules in this regard have further improved.    The CPC and the state always attach great importance to  minority cadres affairs, and they always consider forming a  large contingent of ethical and capable minority cadres to be a  major policy for people of all nationalities to achieve  equality, unity, progress, and common prosperity. Thanks to the  efforts made by party committees and governments at all levels  as well as by relevant departments over the past four decades,  the number of minority cadres has increased from 10,000 or so in  1950 to more than 2.28 million today, including large numbers of  party workers, administrators, economic workers, scientists,  technicians, cultural workers, educators, and health workers.  Many minority cadres have assumed leading posts and are playing  leading roles in minority regions' political, economic, and  social development.    As reform and opening up continue to proceed, minority  regions have also taken effective measures for training,  selecting, and appointing minority cadres, and the valuable  experiences they have gained have enhanced the work of bringing  up minority cadres. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been  training minority cadres while carrying out reforms and opening  up to the outside world. Under a cadres exchange program, the  region has adopted all kinds of measures -- such as rotating  minority cadres at different posts, retraining incumbent cadres,  sending outstanding college students to work at grass-roots  units, providing counterpart support, exchanging cadres with  different areas, and appointing cadres to work in developed  provinces and regions -- to improve minority cadres' competence  so that they can mature and become more proficient during the  course of their training. Meanwhile, Xinjiang has hired experts  to teach management and technology, to carry out scientific  research, to take part in academic exchanges, and to help set up  plants and mines in the region. Today all prefectures and  counties in Xinjiang have launched similar cooperative projects,  and the results that some have achieved are remarkable. Many  minority cadres have become business directors and managers or  persons in charge of science and technology projects.    Tibet's programs for training minority cadres give priority  to five categories: 1) To people of minority nationalities  while selecting trainees. Since 1980, Tibet has trained 27,363  minority cadres of various categories and at various levels --  or 72.75 percent of the total number of cadres who have been  trained -- through various channels. 2) To county- and  higher-level leading cadres. 3) To intensive, short-term  training for minority cadres. 4) To training local cadres  through channels linking Tibet with other parts of the country.  Tibet has a program for each year sending minority cadres to  other parts of the country for advanced studies. 5) To training  courses which are of practical use.    While striving to build strong ranks of minority cadres,  minority autonomous regions also pay great attention to  combining training programs with the need to exercise autonomy.  The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has stated that training  and selecting minority cadres must be underscored in projects  for training, recommending, and evaluating the performance of  cadres; reorganizing or reelecting leading groups; or drawing up  policies and regulations for cadres. The region also has stated  that such affairs must be organically integrated with the  exercising of regional autonomy. The region has also stressed  that the number of minority cadres must account for a proper  percentage in the region, and that the number of Mongolian  cadres and cadres of the Han and other nationalities --  especially leading cadres -- must account for a proper  percentage of cadres in leading organs so that the number of  minority cadres can be proportionally in line with the minority  population as well as with the regulations of the "Law on the  Regional Autonomy of Minority Nationalities." In light of this  law, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has done as much as  possible so that cadres of all nationalities, while increasing  in number, will become more competent in handling political  affairs and in involving themselves in scientific and cultural  projects. The region has made it a policy that there should be  no arbitrary uniformity in training and in selecting minority  cadres, that preferential treatment must be given to people of  minority nationalities who have few cadres, and that  consideration should be given to past and present circumstances  and the situation of people of other nationalities.    While training and selecting minority cadres, all regions  also stress the need to foster the concept of viewing cadres  affairs as a whole. Guangxi emphasizes that cadres of the Han  and minority nationalities must respect each other, learn from  one another, and assist one another. All autonomous regions  have promoted the unity between people of all nationalities by  emphasizing the view that people of the Han nationality and  people of minority nationalities need one another.</p>

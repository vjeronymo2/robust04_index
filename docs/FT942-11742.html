			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Falconbridge plans CDollars 1.3bn share issue Falconbridge, the west's second-biggest nickel producer, plans to go public again with a CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 940m) share offer. Pricing will be set around mid-June. The offer is being made in Canada and by private placement internationally, said Mr Lars Eric Johannson, senior vice-president. Proceeds will help to pay off Falconbridge's CDollars 1.8bn debt. Canada's Noranda and Trelleborg of Sweden each acquired 50 per cent of Falconbridge five years ago for CDollars 2.2bn. After the offer, Noranda's equity holding will be about 45 per cent. But Trelleborg will not participate and its interest will drop to 30 per cent. The public will hold about 25 per cent. Falconbridge's main operations are the nickel mines at Sudbury, Ontario, where new deep reserves have been found, the Kidd Creek copper-zinc mine in northern Ontario, a nickel refinery in Norway and nickel mines in the Dominican Republic. It also owns one-third of the CDollars 1bn Collahuasi project in Chile. Many analysts believe base metals prices are due for recovery with improving world economic growth. The underwriting group is led by Wood Gundy, Burns Fry, Gordon Capital and RBC Dominion Securities.</p>

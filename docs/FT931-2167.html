			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / ICI waste output falls sharply IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reduced its worldwide emissions to land, sea and air by 9 per cent from a total of 5.68bn tonnes in 1991 to 5.167bn tonnes last year, the company states in its second environmental report. Hazardous waste, ICI's main priority, was cut by 26 per cent from 475,000 tonnes in 1991 to 350,000 tonnes last year. That represents a fall of 48 per cent since 1990. Over the same period non-hazardous waste was cut by 9.7 per cent. Waste production overall has fallen by 14 per cent since 1990. The group aims to reduce wastes by 50 per cent by 1995, using 1990 as a baseline. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'The achievements made to date are impressive and are a credit to the individual skills, determination and enthusiasm of everyone in the group.' The group was nevertheless fined and prosecuted 21 times for environmental incidents, including seven times in the US, four times in continental Europe and five times in the UK. The total number of prosecutions and fines was 26 in 1991 and 30 in 1990. Sir Denys said there was clearly much to be done in this area. ICI restated its emission figures for 1990 and 1991 to exclude water evaporation at a plant in Pakistan and deep well injection in the US. Earlier figures given by the company for all emissions had been 8.627bn tonnes for 1990 (restated at 6.012bn), and 8.31bn tonnes in 1991. Between 1991 and 1992 capital expenditure on environmental measures increased from about Pounds 130m to about Pounds 170m while environmental operating costs rose from about Pounds 180m to about Pounds 170m. Non-hazardous waste disposed on land fell from 1.47bn tonnes in 1991 to 1.468bn last year. Non-hazardous emissions to air dropped from 297,000 tonnes to 280,000 tonnes over the same period. Non-hazardous wastes to water fell from 3.484bn to 3.068bn. Energy consumption fell 12 per cent during 1992 compared with 1990.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Net assets fall by 24% at TR Property TR PROPERTY Investment Trust, which took over New England Properties at the end of January, yesterday announced a 24 per cent fall in its net asset value, from 40.61p to 30.71p per share, during the year to March 31. Revenue before tax fell from Pounds 3.79m to Pounds 1.31m as a result of lower trading profits and provisions of Pounds 2.15m against the fall in value of property dealing stock. Group income from fixed investments rose marginally to Pounds 6.5m. Mr Paul Hyde-Thomson, chairman, said that the New England Properties acquisition had fitted well with the existing spread of assets. The acquisition had enabled TRPIT to increase its weight in industrial property and increase the income return on the property portfolio to 10.3 per cent. 'Although activity in many areas of the property market is quickening, values remain depressed and it may be some time before our markets reflect the economic recovery that appears to be beginning,' he said. Earnings per share fell from 1.04p to 0.34p. A final dividend of 0.85p is proposed, making an unchanged 1.45p for the year.</p>

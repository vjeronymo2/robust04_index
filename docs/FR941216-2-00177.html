The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is serving as a cooperating agency, with responsibilities limited to participating in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) process; participating in the scoping process; and review and comment on the Draft and Final EIR/EIS. The FAA is the lead Federal agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 29, 1992 the FAA issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS. The Port of Oakland, pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970 will also prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed development. In an effort to eliminate unnecessary duplication and reduce delay, the document under preparation, is a joint EIR/EIS in accordance with the President's Council on Environmental Quality Regulations described in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1506.2. The Joint Lead Agencies for the preparation of the EIR/EIS are the Federal Aviation Administration and the Port of Oakland, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The previous notice referred to the proposed action as the ``2002 Airport Development Program.'' The current proposed action is now revised to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Airport Development Program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ADP), with a new buildout year of 2000, as opposed to 2002. This change is due to the recent acceleration of aviation activity (1993&hyph;1994) at Metropolitan Oakland International Airport. In addition, a new baseline year (1993) will be used to establish existing conditions and long-term analysis will consider the year 2010. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed extension of Runway 11/29 and the high-speed exit taxiway are programmatic projects in the ADP, because the design of these improvements has not reached a sufficient level of detail to support an environmental finding. These two airfield improvements will be identified in the EIR/EIS as projects that are scheduled for construction after the year 2000, although feasibility and design studies may be undertaken before that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A wetland restoration project was previously proposed to mitigate impacts caused by the placement of 33 acres of fill (of which approximately 25 acres consisted of wetlands) in 1986, that were previously permitted under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Permit Number 14003E78B. This permit was rescinded by Federal Court order in 1988. Since that time, the parties in the litigation have negotiated a resolution of the wetland mitigation issues. Consent decrees setting forth this resolution have been filed with the Federal District Court. Because the wetland restoration program will be accomplished as provided in the consent decrees, and not as part of the ADP, it has been removed from the ADP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The alternatives to be evaluated in the EIR/EIS have been augmented since the initial scoping meetings held on January 27, 1993. In addition to the no-action and reduced development alternatives previously identified, the EIR/EIS will consider: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. An air passenger terminal dominant alternative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. An air cargo dominant alternative and; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A modified airport roadway project alternative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The previously identified ``regional alternative'' was reevaluated by the metropolitan planning organization in their Regional Airport System Plan Update, and was found not to be practical or feasible to the proposed action. Accordingly, the ``regional alternative'' was dropped from further consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments and suggestions on the revised scope are invited from Federal, State and local agencies, and other interested parties to ensure that the full range of issues related to these proposed projects are addressed and all significant issues identified. Comments and suggestions may be mailed to the FAA informational contact listed above. Comments on the revised scope of work should be submitted no later than January 15, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Hawthorne, California on December 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert C.

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Curriculum for technology rapped: National Institute attacks 'demotivating' syllabus THE NATIONAL curriculum for technology in England and Wales has led to 'great difficulties in teaching' and leaves less academic children 'disadvantaged and demotivated', the National Institute for Economic and Social Research says. It adds that the quality of practical learning opportunities is below that in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The institute article, written by Helvia Bierhoff and Sigmund Prais, criticises technology teaching in the last two years of compulsory schooling for being too intellectualised, and for requiring pupils to work in a broad range of materials. They say national curriculum requirements 'have led to inadequate specialisation, inadequate progression, and to poor quality of finished work'. They also criticise the attitude adopted in English and Welsh schools, saying: 'Unless practical subjects are intellectualised and linked to academic subjects and bulky paperwork activities, they continue to be regarded as not having a wholly legitimate place in the school curriculum.' New proposals for the national curriculum published late last year would encourage higher-quality work by allowing greater specialisation and more practical work, the report says. But it suggests schools are not equipped with the specialised workshops teachers need to take advantage of the proposals. The report criticises attainment targets set by the national curriculum, including a requirement for pupils to 'identify needs and opportunities' for technology in different contexts. The aim is to free pupils from the 'straitjacket' of doing what the teacher told them, but the institute found some national curriculum targets to be irrelevant to pupils' everyday lives. The institute's authors prefer the Continental approach of concentrating on practical subjects. They found that Continental schools allowed a third (or more) of their pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 to do systematic courses in specialised disciplines such as woodwork, metalwork and textiles. Continental employers believed that pupils taught this way were more motivated, had better work habits, and learned how to respond responsibly to instructions in applied contexts.</p>

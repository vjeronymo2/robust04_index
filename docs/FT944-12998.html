			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rallies The dollar rallied yesterday following the release of third quarter GDP figures which prompted a sharp rise in the bond and equity markets, writes Philip Gawith. Although GDP growth of 3.4 per cent was above market expectations, the report in total convinced the market that inflationary pressures were more subdued than it had believed. The dollar finished in London at DM1.5094, up from DM1.4950 before the GDP figures, and touched DM1.5170 during the New York morning. Against the yen it finished at Y97.335 from Y96.895. The firmer dollar weighed on the D-Mark in Europe, and also depressed sterling. The pound fell from Dollars 1.6370, before the GDP figures, to Dollars 1.6235 at the close. It traded in a narrow range against the D-Mark to close at DM2.4505 from DM2.4519. Analysts said the dollar's rally had been driven mostly by short term traders, many of whom had been forced to cover short positions they held ahead of the GDP release. One observer described it as a 'typical Friday afternoon short squeeze.' There were also reports that funds bought dollars on the IMM futures market, driving the price up further. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the GDP report had 'delayed the day of reckoning in terms of the Fed's decision on interest rates.' He said this could work against the dollar. 'The prolonging of the uncertainty is the main problem for investor confidence,' he said. Mr Marshall said it was difficult to be optimistic about the dollar 'with the economy dangerously close to capacity constraints and a central bank that appears to be dithering.' For dollar bulls, there is some cheer to be had from a technical perspective. Chartists said the dollar had, on a weekly basis, made a reversal of its downward trend. After touching a low in July, it then traded sideways until earlier this month. Chartists say it is possible this pattern could be repeated, although the long term picture for the dollar is still down. The combination of the US GDP figures, and bullish comments about the UK inflation outlook, from Bank of England governor Mr Eddie George, prompted a rally in short sterling futures. The March contract traded 34,000 contracts to close at 92.78, up from 92.66. The Bank of England provided Pounds 610m late assistance to UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 1.1bn shortage. Earlier it had provided Pounds 344m assistance at established rates. Three month sterling LIBOR was unchanged at 6 per cent. Before coming under pressure from the dollar, the D-Mark was supported by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president. He told an economic foundation in Bonn that 'a strong currency is in the best interests of the German economy.' Elsewhere, the South African central bank governor, Dr Chris Stals, said in Johannesburg that a fairly substantial net inflow of capital from July to September would hasten the abolition of the financial rand system, but 'not now'. This caused the financial rand to weaken to R4.025 against the dollar from R3.985. In Nigeria meanwhile, the naira recovered on the free market to N90 against the dollar, from a record low of N100. The government tried to fix the exchange rate at N22 last January.</p>

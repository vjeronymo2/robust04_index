			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed Chih Ts'e (2535 4595), standing for Chih </F> Ts'e Investigation and Research Co., Ltd.: "Prospects of the  Financial Reform in Mainland China"]    [Text] Since early 1994, the Chinese Government has adopted  an ever more cautious attitude in its pursuit of the financial  reform. The present article summarizes a thorough research into  the financial reform in Mainland China, carried out since the  end of last year by the Chih Ts'e Company. We hope it will  assist readers in getting to know and fully understand the    financial reform on the mainland.    Following the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, and having set the establishment of the socialist  market economy system as general objective, the Chinese  Government formulated a series of reform plans. One of their  most important components is the reform of the financial system.  The following major items are included in the scheduled  financial reform plan: The People's Bank is to become a Central  Bank; commercial finance is to be separated from the state's  policy-directed finance; the present specialized banks shall be  converted into commercial banks, and appropriate banks shall be  established for the state's policy-directed finance; various  kinds of financial institutions of a nonbank character and  securities markets shall be developed; banks with new and  different ownership systems shall be established; the financial  markets shall be gradually and to a limited extent opened to the  outside world.    These reform plans of the Chinese Government have attracted  general attention in Chinese as well as foreign financial  circles, and have raised great hopes of financial reform in  1994. Contrary to this optimistic anticipation, the Chinese  Government, since the beginning of 1994, has been adopting an  ever more cautious attitude toward financial reform. The present  article summarizes the thorough research of financial reform in  Mainland China carried out since the second half of last year by  the Chih Ts'e Company. We hope it will assist readers in getting  to know and fully understand the financial reform on the  mainland.    Two Kinds of Interests, Two Kinds of Objectives    One of the major special characteristics in the 15-year  history of the reform has been that implementation of whichever  item of mainland reform has always been the result of continuous  back-and-forth adjustments and negotiations between the central  government and the local governments. Not one item of the reform  has been implemented according to the predetermined plan and  timetable of the central government. The financial reform will  reflect this basic characteristic even more intensely.    As far as the central government is concerned, its  fundamental objective in the financial reform is establishment  of a new system of macroregulation and control, suited to the  conditions of market economy, to replace the former  administrative method and to realize the developmental  objectives of the central government. In the immediate future  and for a medium range of time, the policy of strengthening  macroregulation and control actually means strengthening the  central government's control of the economy and reducing the  ability of local governments to interfere. The central  government is particularly interested in having the People's  Bank as quickly as possible assume the various functions of a  central bank and to have it designated as policy-setting bank.  Converting the specialized banks into commercial banks is being  viewed as even more important, in that it will enable the branch  agencies of specialized banks to free themselves of the  influences exerted by local governments and to raise the  efficiency of their credits, and, furthermore, to be able to  continue maintaining control over the scope of credits.    As far as the local governments are concerned, the  fundamental objective of the financial reform is to reduce as  far as possible the central government's financial control in  one's territory, to increase sources of funds for one's  locality, and to provide for all local enterprises and for local  economic development a financial environment that is less  exposed to influences emanating from the economic condition of  the overall entity. The local governments will therefore attach  greater importance to the development of all kinds of direct  methods of financing and of banking institutions of a local  nature, including the development of local banks. They also hope  that it will be possible in the course of the commercialization  of the specialized banks to gain greater freedom from the  central authorities' centralized control and restraints on  their, the local governments', scale of operations.    No doubt, these two reform objectives do not agree with each  other, and that reveals a very serious contradiction. This  disparity is bound to constitute a substantial impediment in the  financial reform and in the commercialization of the specialized  banks.    Fundamental Obstructions Impeding Financial Reform    The financial reform on the mainland is up against three  most  fundamental obstructions:    1) The enterprise system. The most basic  characteristic of mainland enterprises, whether they are  state-run or collective-run, is that they take responsibility  for profits but not for losses. As long as they have attained a  certain proportion and employ a certain number of staff and  workers, enterprises under most circumstances simply cannot go  bankrupt and cannot be closed down. To a very large extent this  is due to the fact that mainland enterprises also function to a  very large part as a social security system. Once an enterprise  would go bankrupt, workers would lose their jobs, and this would  endanger social stability. Neither the central government nor  the local governments will wish this to happen. Under these  circumstances, the enterprise-bank relationship cannot possibly  be a completely economic relationship, banks also cannot  possibly grant loans completely according to economic  principles, and it is then also quite impossible for banks to  enforce repayment of loans when enterprises find themselves  unable to repay bank loans. In most instances nowadays, banks  will grant credits to enterprises that incur serious losses or  whose assets do not cover their liabilities just to have them  keep up production or to ensure by their loans that the workers  will be paid their basic wages. What has to be emphasized here  is that in any case the reform of the enterprise system will be  a very slow and gradual process. Before having truly established  an enterprise bankruptcy system and a social security system,  and before these systems are really functional, no great  progress is possible in the commercialization of the specialized  banks on the mainland.    2) Macro-economic control. After the very thorough  reform of the planning system, finance, especially the system of  specialized banks, has at the present stage become the central  government's major means of exercising macroeconomic control and  the major means of realizing the objectives of its industrial  policy. Prior to having established a new form of macroeconomic  regulation and control, the commercialization of the specialized  banks would soon result in detaching these banks from the  economic interests of the central government and allowing them  to adopt an attitude of noncompliance with state policy, where  such conflicts with the banks' own interests. This would  undoubtedly weaken the ability of the central government to  control economic activities. Even if, as a matter of priority,  special banks are established for the state's policy-directed  financial affairs, having all credit business operated along  commercial principles would then still make it impossible for  the central government to realize a large part of its  macroeconomic policy objectives, because the credit operations  of the specialized banks would be of so large a scale as to be  decisive within the total amount of credit operations. This  would apply to the areas of controlling the overall scope of  credits, the direction of credit investments, assurance of  employment, etc. For these reasons, the central government is  adopting a most cautious stand in the question of  commercialization of the specialized banks.    3) Local interests. For a variety of reasons,  setting up branch agencies of the specialized banks all over the  country would make these branches, to a certain extent, banks of  the local governments. To achieve their local economic  objectives, the local governments would use every means to have  the specialized banks grant credits according to their, the  local governments', demands. If the basic-level bank branches  would not be able to freely decide on the granting of loans, it  would hardly be possible for any real commercialization to be  truly materialized. It has to be emphasized, therefore, that  even if it would be possible to keep organizational and staff  matters free from the influence of the local governments, the  local branches would, in all their business operations, still be  subject to the dispositions and directions of the local  governments.    The significance of the above-stated three difficulties is  perhaps: Apart from the experts, there is nobody in Mainland  China who truly hopes for an early commercialization of the  specialized banks.    A Reform Characterized by Peripheral Reforms    The central government is fully aware of the complexity of  such problems as the commercialization of the specialized banks  and the overall reform of the financial system. It is,  therefore, adopting a very cautious attitude toward these  reforms. Even though the "Resolution of the Third Plenary  Session" and related documents emphasize the importance of  financial reform and the commercialization of the specialized  banks, in actual implementation greater importance is placed on  stability and feasibility of the reform process. Key points in  the reform for the immediate and medium-range future are to  strengthen, as a matter or priority, the functions of the  Central Bank and the establishment of banks for the state's  policy-directed financial affairs, so as to achieve the  separation of ordinary finance from the state's policy-directed  finance. In matters of commercialization of the specialized  banks, the stand taken is one of steadiness and soundness. Early  this year, at the All-China Financial Work Conference, the  presidents of the four specialized banks did not emphasize  commercialization as a key task, but merely mentioned, in  general terms, the intention to advance in that direction.  Thereafter, the complexity of the entire macroeconomic situation  and the increasing pressure of the commodity price increases,  had the central government and the relevant agencies become even  more cautious in the matter of promoting financial reforms.    In reviewing the past experiences in the reform, we believe  the financial reform and commercialization of the specialized  banks will possibly show more or less the following  characteristic developments:    1) In overall progress and dispositions, matters will  on the whole follow the basic course of past reform activities  on the mainland. At first, a relevant reform plan will be  formulated, and an appropriate locality will then be selected  where the project will be launched as an experiment on a small  scale to gain necessary experiences. On the basis of the  collective experiences, the project will then be gradually  expanded. Completion of the relevant reform plan could be  expected within a year.    2) As to its specific forms, the reform may be  conducted in a variety of forms in parallel. In the area of  securities markets (securities to comprise stocks and bonds), as  to non-bank financial institutions, as to the commercialization  of specialized banks, as to various forms of local banks, as to  banks on the shareholding cooperative system, as to the limited  opening up of the domestic financial market and of business in  people's currency [RMB], experiments in various forms will be  conducted simultaneously.    3) Stimulating the process of commercialization of the  specialized banks by other types of financial reforms. This  comprises two basic aspects: First, most speedy development and  promotion of various forms of direct financing. Second, most  speedy development of banks other than the specialized banks.    Because every type of direct financing and banks other than  the specialized banks are much closer to the development of the  regional economy, and are much easier influenced by local  governments, these financial activities and reforms will receive  much more support from the local governments. We may therefore  see in the coming few years a rapid development of these  financial reforms, and there will also be a substantial impetus  from the basic level toward the upper levels in the core concern  of the financial reform, namely in the commercialization of the  specialized banks.    Opportunities Brought by the Financial Reform    As far as foreign investors are concerned, the financial  reform in Mainland China, regardless of its speed, will provide  a series of new investment opportunities, and will also be of  assistance to foreign investments already in place on the  mainland. Speaking only of the reforms that have already taken  place, these opportunities exist on the whole in the following  areas:    1) Foreign-Financed Banks. At present, the Chinese  Government already allows foreign capital to set up fully or  partly foreign-financed banks in the special economic zones  [SEZs]. In Shanghai, there are already over 80 foreign-financed  banks and financial institutions, and such also exist in other  SEZs.    2)Opening up trade in RMB. At present, Shanghai  has already decided to open up, tentatively and within limits,  trade in RMB to foreign financial institutions within the year.  With this as starting point, all SEZs will gradually engage in  similar experiments. Even though this type of business activity  is restricted to the SEZs, the fact that each SEZ has the  position of financial center will have the effect that these  experiments will have widespread influence and will penetrate  into the other areas of Mainland China.    3)Non-Bank Financial Institutions    Chinese Government regulations on foreign capital entering  into securities and funds are very relaxed. In the next few  years, these areas will experience very rapid development. At  present, as many as 600 funds of various types are awaiting  approval. After the People's Bank will have promulgated its  regulations on the administration of funds, mainland funds will  develop very rapidly.    Overall, the fact that financial reform and financial  activities on the mainland are drawing closer to international  practices will induce the government to gradually relax  financial controls. It will, furthermore, adopt a series of new  forms of financial activities and provide new opportunities for  financial investments, and foreign investors will gain much  benefit in the course of these developments.</p>

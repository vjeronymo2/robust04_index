			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, a Fort Tiuna spokesman announced that the  implementation of a three-part financial Armed Forces Welfare  and Social Securuty Global Plan, designed to improve the  military's standard of living, had been suspended because of  budget shortfalls. As is already known, the Global Plan was  formulated by the Defense Ministry a few months after the  unfortunate 4 February and 27 November 1992 incidents. The  objective of this plan was -- and continues to be -- to improve  the military's standard of living, enhance benefit quality,  strengthen the programs that would finance the plan, and widen  the coverage and design new programs to protect the entire FAN  [National Armed Forces] population. These specific objectives,  however, according to the military source, will not be  implemented because of the serious fiscal deficit that is  hampering the Armed Forces' capital requirements.    During the administration of then Defense Minister General  Ivan Dario Jimenez Sanchez, the plan was encouraged in order to  meet the general objective of offering welfare and security to  FAN military and civilian personnel. The plan itself was  designed by taking into account issues like health, housing,  recreation, socioeconomic support, social security, sports,  education, and culture and to include other related issues that  would ensure as many "benefits as possible" to all FAN  personnel. At any rate, under the administration of Gen. Angel  Rafael Montero Revette it has become necessary to reschedule the  plan. The fiscal deficit would seem to be the stumbling block  to welfare and social security benefits since it unfortunately  hampers several of the programs which had been allocated until  1995, the date selected to implement the plan.    The Defense Ministry spokesman indicated that after  analyzing  the socioeconomic situation of military personnel, including  those civilians working for the military, it was concluded that  the FAN personnel's social securuty and welfare in general is  inadequate. This is especially true in health care, housing, and  recreation, where there is a need for more money. In principle,  the plan stipulated the need for 18 billion bolivares. This  amount would be divided as follows: 37 percent to health issues,  40 percent to housing, and 9 percent to recreation. On the  other hand, the plan would be divided into three parts based on  how it would be financed: A Global Investment Plan to be  implemented by means of additional financial investments  procured through a Public Credit Law and a contingency budget  prompted by the aforementioned Investment Plan, the financing of  which would be done through ordinary budget stipulations. In  addition, financially quantifiable measures are clearly needed  in order to reinforce decisions made in the two previous plans.    The military spokesman concludes by indicating that the  strategies of the Global Plan, which have so far been more  theoretical than practical, are aimed at achieving the  implementation of the welfare and social security system,  accomplishing and consolidating the development of social  policies through legal, institutional, and financial mechanisms  and procedures in order to provide administrative consistency  and coherence to the social programs. It also seeks to  encourage the active participation of all social sectors, draft  systematic and balanced programs to continuously improve health  care, housing, education, culture and recreation, sports, social  welfare, as well as socioeconomic support.</p>

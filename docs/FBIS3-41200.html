The DEA used barrels equipped with a transmitter in order to  locate the laboratories for which the chemicals were destined.  These activities, in 1985 and 1986, took place in the greatest  secrecy and without the knowledge of the Netherlands Justice  Department. The CRI [Central Information Research Agency] had  made it known to the Americans during the preparatory stages  that such infiltration methods were to be rejected.    For the deliveries, the Americans used the Netherlands  criminal informer Dick Stotijn, who was in contact with drug  cartels in South America. He was appointed director of a  company, Berg Trading Services, which was based in the Belgian  town of Putte, just over the border from the Netherlands. In  the Netherlands Antilles Stotijn found drug dealers ready to  take chemicals purchased from the French company Blondeau. With  the knowledge of the French company, direction finders were  included with the ether and acetone in the barrels.    According to DEA agent D. Laverty, who worked in The Hague  in  the 1980's, two major operations were conducted in any event via  the export from Belgium in 1986. One shipment located a  laboratory in Colombia which was finally put out of operation.  The former head of the CRI narcotics bureau, G. de Gooyer, said  that his department was not "actively involved" in the  controlled dispatch of chemicals. He said he could not remember  whether his American colleagues had told him what they were  doing. [passage omitted]</p>

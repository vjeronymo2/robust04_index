			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Air France and Lufthansa merge luxury hotel chains AIR FRANCE and Lufthansa are to create one of the world's largest luxury and business class hotel groups by merging their respective Meridien and Kempinski chains. The 80-hotel group, including the Hotel Kempinski in Berlin, will have annual sales of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 565m) and 25,000 employees. Meridien is already a large player in the business hotel market with 60 hotels worldwide and a strong presence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East as well as Europe. Kempinski is still strongest in its native German market, but has expanded into Asia and North America. Air France, the French state-owned airline, will be the majority shareholder in the merged company, but the two airlines have yet to finalise other details. The hotels will retain their own names. The merger of the two chains marks another phase in the co-operative agreement between Air France and Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, which dates back to 1989. The two companies have since undertaken a number of joint projects including the construction of a new passenger terminal at Kennedy airport in New York. The deal also forms part of the consolidation of the international hotel industry, notably in the business sector. It follows the Dollars 2.3bn acquisition of Inter-Continental hotels by Saison, the Japanese retail and leisure group, and the Dollars 1bn takeover of the Hilton chain by Ladbroke Group. Meridien and Kempinski are joining forces at a sensitive time for the business travel market which has not yet fully recovered from the devastating effects of the Gulf war in the first quarter of last year. The industry has since been haunted by the economic slowdown in Europe and North America, which has affected both the business and leisure travel markets. It now faces the threat of a significant slowdown in demand from the Japanese reflecting the problems of Japan's economy. These problems have intensified the pressure on the international hotel groups to cut costs by pooling resources.</p>

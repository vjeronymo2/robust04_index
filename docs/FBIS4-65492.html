			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD(LAU): "The Largest Belgian Air Base: </F> More Than 60 Aircraft in the Heart of the Forest"]    [Excerpt] Weelde, 17 May (BELGA) -- On Tuesday [17 May],  the Belgian Air Force opened up the doors of its surplus  aircraft storage depot in Weelde (in the northeastern part of  the province of Antwerp) to the press. In total, 38 "Mirage  5's" and roughly 20 F-16's are stored there in ultramodern  hangars. In fact, Weelde is the largest air base in Belgium,  and it is there that combat aircraft await potential buyers.    "These aircraft have somehow plunged into lethargy,"  Lieutenant General Guido Vanhecke, the Air Force commander,  said, addressing journalists from the Aviation Press Club (APC).    The so-called Delcroix Plan for restructuring the Armed  Forces has obliged the Air Force to downgrade its latest  "Mirage" hunter-bombers, 20 of which are currently being  modernized, and to withdraw from service some 35 of its F-16's.  While awaiting a potential buyer, preferably another state,  these machines have been gathered in Weelde, at one of NATO's  spare aerodromes. [passage omitted]</p>

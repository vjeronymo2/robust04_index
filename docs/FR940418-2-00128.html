			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration may be traded. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange states that it may instead list long-term, reduced-value put and call options which will be computed by dividing the value of the full-value Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. The interval between expiration month for either full-value or reduced-value long-term options will not be less than six months. The strike price interval for reduced-value Index options will be no less than $2.50 instead of $5.00.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amex Rule 903C(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Applicable Options Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Options on the Index, including long-term options based on the full or a reduced-value Index, will be governed by Exchange Rules 900 C through 980C. These rules govern matters such as disclosure, account approval and suitability, position and exercise limits, margin, trading halts and suspensions, and floor procedures. Surveillance procedures currently used by the Exchange to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in regular and long-term options on the Index. The Index is deemed by the Exchange to be a Stock Index Option under Amex Rule 901C(a), and a Broad Stock Index Group under Amex Rule 900C(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange seeks to list near-the-money ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , within ten points above or below the current index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise) price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. The Exchange has also proposed to amend Rule 904C(b) to establish a position limit of 25,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no more than 15,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange states that it expects the Hong Kong Option Index to attract a substantial number of customers, including institutional activity, and is therefore seeking Commission approval permitting it to use its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 3. The Amex originally proposed permitting the use of its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 99 contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of options based on the Hong Kong Option Index, including long-term options based on either the full or a reduced-value of the Index, will serve to protect investors, promote the public interest, and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities market by providing investors with a means to hedge exposure to market risk associated with the Hong Kong equity market and provide a surrogate instrument for trading in the Hong Kong securities market. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  In particular, Hong Kong Option Index options will benefit U.S. investors by allowing them to obtain differential rates of return on a capital outlay if the Hong Kong Option Index moves in a favorable direction within a specified time period. Of course, if the Hong Kong Option Index moves in the wrong direction or fails to move in the right direction, the options expire worthless and the investors will have lost their entire investment. Thus, the trading of options based on the Hong Kong Option Index will provide investors with a valuable hedging vehicle that should reflect accurately the overall movement of the Hong Kong equity market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new securities product upon a finding that the introduction of such product is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult with respect to an option that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

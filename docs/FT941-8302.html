			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Names begin long journey through courts The High Court will this week consider the first of 38 legal actions by loss-making Names which would have been settled in Lloyd's unsuccessful Pounds 900m offer. The case is being brought by 366 Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market - who were members of Pulbrook syndicate 334 and lost Pounds 44m in the 1985 year of account. It will start on Wednesday and is expected to last four weeks. The Names are suing the Pulbrook agency, which managed the syndicate and is now part of the Merrett Group, and 11 separate members' agents who placed them on the syndicate. The syndicate specialised in 'long-tail' insurance business in which claims often emerge many years after inception of the policy. It had a stamp capacity - the amount of premiums it can accept under Lloyd's rules - of Pounds 22.2m. The syndicate has a large exposure to pollution which accounts for 76 per cent of all its reserves. Chatset, the firm which analyses the results of the Lloyd's market, says the syndicate's losses could reach more than Pounds 120m, or about Pounds 60,000 for every Pounds 10,000 committed by each of its Names. The court is also set to rule this week in a case by two Names alleging negligence by members' agents in the selection of syndicates. The case - in which Mr Justice Gatehouse will give judgment - is one of a number launched by individual Names outside action groups. Mr David Tiplady, one of two solicitors involved in the case, said it 'could open the gate for other cases'. Also this week Mr Justice Cresswell will begin a review of the timetabling and other aspects of litigation planned by Names. He took over responsibility for the cases following the appointment of Mr Justice Saville to the Court of Appeal in January. The biggest legal action by Names - involving 3,000 Gooda Walker Names - will begin on April 26. Some 1,950 Feltrim Names expect their case to come to court in October.</p>

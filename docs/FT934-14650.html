			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Biotechnology While the giants of the UK drugs industry are out of favour, the pigmies are winning friends. Not all are biotechnology companies in the strictest sense. But it matters little that Scotia - which raised Pounds 40m yesterday - is working with fatty acids rather than large proteins. Like British Bio-technology last year and Celltech next month, it is issuing shares to finance the development of drugs which are some years from the market. The latest spate of offerings owes much to the relaxation of stock exchange rules demanding a three year profits record. There is no evidence that small companies are better at steering drugs through development. Biotechnology drugs often command high prices, so the threat of government regulation - such as President Clinton's proposed National Health Board - is just as real. Diagnostic products arguably face lower regulatory hurdles, but that is no guarantee of commercial success. Drew Scientific, the diagnostics company which floated in May, has already issued its first profits warning. The gamble is that just one in a portfolio of small biotechnology stocks will have sufficient scientific and commercial skills to outweigh those that fall by the wayside. The 30 per cent fall in the US biotechnology sector this year argues for caution. There has been a handful of spectacular successes, but more disappointments than anticipated when the biotechnology bandwagon rolled down Wall Street in 1990. Many US companies which raised funds then are thirsty for more. With their home market in sceptical mood, the new-found enthusiasm of UK investors must look too good an opportunity to miss.</p>

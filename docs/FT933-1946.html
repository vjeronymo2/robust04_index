			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (13): Big business implications - British companies are leading the way in Europe in applying EDI - a simple idea that saves time, effort and money / Electronic data interchange THE BENEFITS of electronic data interchange (EDI) have been so great to Tesco, over the last six years that the retail chain has stopped measuring them against the costs. 'The EDI costs are absolutely negligible and are covered by our savings on the phone, fax and mail alone,' says stock management director Mr Dave MacInnis. 'That means we have all the business benefits for nothing.' Those benefits are impressive: 'We've reduced stock levels yet improved stock availability and sales; cut lead times on orders; cut administration; and improved communication with our suppliers.' Tesco, an EDI pioneer, now trades electronically with over 1,200 companies of all sizes, representing more than 95 per cent of products on its shelves. Half these suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. Tesco has also used EDI to forge close business relationships with a quarter of them, sending 13-week sales forecasts to help them schedule production and reduce stocks - thus keeping their own costs and prices down. Computer manufacturer ICL is enjoying similar gains by using EDI as a route to just-in-time ma nufacturing and business process re-organisation, according to chief executive Mr Peter Bonfield: 'In manufacturing we've reduced the time from manufacture to invoice from 20 days to three. We've reduced our inventory by Pounds 100m, with a big impact on the balance sheet and customer response time. The delivery time for PCs has been cut from four weeks to 48 hours maximum. Automating our purchasing has reduced our administration costs by 70 per cent.' Companies like these have gone way beyond the original EDI idea of exchanging routine business documents such as orders, acknowledgements and invoices over telecommunications lines between computers run by customers and suppliers. Tesco's experience shows that this in itself is enough to justify EDI, by reducing the delays and human error which are built into the process of keying order information into a computer, printing it and mailing the document to a supplier, where it is keyed in again. This process is repeated right down through the supply chain. Indeed, it has been estimated that 50-70 per cent of computer output becomes computer input. The UK is the clear leader in Europe in its use of EDI and the number of companies trading electronically is growing at 25 per cent a year. But even so, less than a third of the top 1,000 companies have taken it up. The likes of ICL and Tesco have cajoled and helped their smaller trading partners into EDI, taking the total number to around 10,000. But, as Sir John Harvey-Jones told a recent EDI conference, 'we are barely scratching the surface.' 'Why are we so loath to use the opportunities of electronic trading when it pays for itself in paperwork savings alone, without the additional business advantages?' Sir John demanded. He went on to answer his own question, reflecting the views of leading users, consultants and service suppliers in this field. 'The real pay-off from information technology only comes when it is used to totally transform the way business is done and the way a company is organised. Companies have made a major jump ahead of the competition by having vision and openness to change. 'However, most companies are still organised in vertical components. Those that look across the totality of the business are all too few. This is one reason why getting EDI to really run and show its paces has been such a problem. It has tended to be looked on as the preserve of the IT department, not as a valuable enabling tool to change the way that every part of the organisation does its business.' He added: 'I pushed ICI into EDI not for the savings per invoice - although these were respectable - but because I believed EDI was a key to altering the way our business was done and the relationships we had with our suppliers and customers.' EDI is a 'proven strategic vehicle' for business says Ray Walker, chief executive of SITPRO, the Simpler Trade Procedures Board. He is chairman of the UK National EDI Conference. The forthcoming EDI 93 event in October (see details on page four of this survey) is the largest yet. Most of the growth in EDI has been led by big companies, whether those with such vision or those simply looking initially at cutting administration costs. Neil Lawrence, EDI manager at service supplier British Telecom, believes the number of the top 1,000 companies using EDI will double to around 600 in the next two or three years - and each will bring in 1,500 or more of its suppliers. Meanwhile the UK's main service suppliers - market leader INS, AT&amp;T - Istel, European leader GEIS, IBM and BT - are trying to make EDI more attractive to small companies. These suppliers run networks which direct messages from one company's computer to any other company's system. 'Tesco, Sainsbury's and others are doing sophisticated things and have transformed their business but we haven't really got to the volume market yet,' says INS marketing director Colin Billinge. 'The market has become more competitive and we want to stimulate growth still further by attracting the hundreds of thousands of small firms.' INS, which has 55 per cent of the UK market, has recently packaged its network and support services in new ways and cut prices for smaller new entrants. This month it has launched a software package which enables companies to adapt quickly to the message formats and procedures of different trading partners. Service suppliers are also wooing communities of users and finding unlikely successes among some of the smallest companies. For example manfacturers of small electrical appliances, including Braun and Tefal, have set up an EDI community with local repair shops, some of which are two-man bands with a personal comp uter working from a market stall. The repair firms send orders for parts via the British Telecom EDI service, cutting the repair time from a week or more to 24 hours in many cases.</p>

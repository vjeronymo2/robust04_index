			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: NEW NAME BUT THE SAME OLD REX  </P> <P> The new sign's up and the name change is official: Rex Restaurant by Newport  Pier is now 21 Oceanfront. Different name, basically same restaurant. Owners  (Rex and Susan Chandler), managing director (John Rader) and executive chef  (Luis Tzorin) are all as before. So, too, is the menu -- with a few additions.  The change of name heralds the advent of the new Rex Restaurant, to open in  Fashion Island in mid-October.  </P> <P> Hubert's in Hutton Centre, Santa Ana, debuts Thursday, Sept. 27, at MacArthur  Boulevard and the Costa Mesa Freeway in the mauve building, earlier site of the  Courthouse Restaurant. Chef Harry Tobor, formerly of the Ritz-Carlton in Rancho  Mirage, will prepare an eclectic mix of international cuisine, from lobster  strudel with chive butter to squab with pan-fried noodles. The main bar will  feature wood-grilled pizzas and tapas, the finger foods of Spain.  </P> <P> Hubert's is at 2 Hutton Centre Drive. Lunch Monday through Friday; dinner  nightly and Sunday brunch from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. A la carte lunch prices: $6 to  $9; dinner, $8 to $15. (714) 545-6776.  </P> <P> Look for the Bay Colony, serving authentic New England fare, to debut at 3950  Campus Drive in Newport Beach toward the end of October. It's the extensively  researched, long-dreamed-of project of former attorney and former New Englander  Ken Golden. Boston baked beans and brown bread, cranberry dishes and live  lobster are a few of the promised menu items.  </P> <P> Rattlesnake beer, Gator lager and Rhino Chasers amber ale are just some of the  labels on the list of more than 20 uniquely named American regional beers being  featured at -- where else? -- Hunters Saloon in the Doubletree Hotel, Orange.  The saloon also imports ales, pilseners, lagers and stouts from such faraway  places as Cold Spring, Minn., and Yakima, Wash. Buck Mathias, Doubletree's  director of food and beverages, terms it "the largest selection of regional and  micro-brewed beers in the South County, the work of the best brewmasters in the  country." Each day a featured beer is offered at a special price. Hunters  Saloon is at 100 The City Drive and is open from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., Monday  through Friday; 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m. to midnight Sundays.  Information: (714) 634-4500.  </P> <P> Doing lunch on Saturdays appears to be the newest trend. Bistro 201 opened  recently for Saturday lunches, served from 11:30 a.m. till 3 p.m. The  restaurant is at 18201 Von Karman Ave., Irvine, (714) 553-9201. Also, Zeppa in  Fashion Island has just introduced Saturday lunches, from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30  p.m. Reservations: (714) 640-0600. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

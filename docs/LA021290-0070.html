			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HBO WAITING TO SHOW REPLAY;  </P> <P> BOXING: CABLE NETWORK IS PUTTING TOGETHER A TWO-HOUR SPECIAL, BUT IT PROBABLY  WON'T BE SHOWN BEFORE FRIDAY.  </P> <P> HBO will replay the Buster Douglas-Mike Tyson fight, but not until the end of  the week.  </P> <P> The playdate will be announced today.  </P> <P> "It probably won't be before Friday," Seth Abraham, HBO senior vice president  in charge of sports, said Sunday from his home in New York.  </P> <P> "If there had been no controversy, we would probably show the fight (today) or  Tuesday. But now we want to put on a different type of show than just the  fight. We'll approach it with a eye toward history, not just an eye toward  ratings.  </P> <P> "Since we are a pay network, we don't have advertisers telling us to play it  right away and get the ratings."  </P> <P> Abraham said HBO wants to line up interviews with both fighters, with the  referee, and possibly others. A two-hour special is being planned.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of logistical work to be done," Abraham said.  </P> <P> Unless promoter Don King's appeal is upheld, the loss for Tyson means his  $26.5-million, eight-fight contract with HBO is off.  </P> <P> With two fights remaining on the contract, Tyson will get about $20 million  from HBO, Abraham said.  </P> <P> Abraham said he went to the HBO studios Sunday to take a close look at the long  count in the eighth round.  </P> <P> "I had an engineer slow it down," Abraham said, "and I looked at it over and  over. No question it was a long count, but no question Buster Douglas could  have gotten up at any time. He simply took the four extra seconds the referee  gave him."  </P> <P> On NBC Sunday, sportscaster Bob Costas also put a clock on the 10th-round  knockout of Tyson. It too had a long count.  </P> <P> Highlights from the fight can't be shown by news outlets for one year because  HBO owns the delay rights.  </P> <P> But Sunday, NBC and CNN did show the long count in the eighth round. They got  it from a news conference held by King Sunday in which he used footage from  Japanese television to make his point. CNN and NBC simply had a cameraman shoot  off the video.  </P> <P> "We can't put an iron curtain over the world," Abraham said.  </P> <P> "ESPN and other networks have inquired about a deal for permission to show  highlights. We said no thank you."  </P> <P> HBO commentator Larry Merchant, after returning home to Santa Monica Sunday,  said he was simply doing his job when he pressed Douglas for postfight comments  despite the fighter's emotional state.  </P> <P> "My job was to let him compose himself and for him -- not me -- to decide if he  wanted to go on," Merchant said. "Knowing him from the past and knowing him to  be a bright fellow, I felt he would come around, and he did."  </P></p>

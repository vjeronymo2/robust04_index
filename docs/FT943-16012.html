			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital Equipment may sell assets to Quantum Digital Equipment, the struggling US computer company, is discussing the sale of much of its storage business to Quantum, a fast-growing disk-drive maker, as part of a radical restructuring Digital is expected to unveil shortly. Analysts said the sale, which might raise Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m, could be just the first of several disposals by Digital as the company sheds peripheral assets in an attempt to return to profitability. Digital said yesterday that it was discussing the sale to Quantum of its magnetic disk, DLT tape drive, solid-state disk drive and thin film heads businesses. Its storage sub-systems and video and interactive information services businesses were not part of the discussions. The company does not have a large presence in disk drives, but it is a force in the high capacity end of the market, while Quantum, based in Milpitas, California, is a leading supplier of storage products at the low capacity, personal computer segment. Digital, which is based in Maynard, Massachusetts, made an unexpected Dollars 183m loss in its latest quarter. It is expected shortly to announce a restructuring plan involving the loss of up to 20,000 jobs, plant closures and other asset sales. Mr Robert Palmer, its chief executive, said yesterday that the Quantum negotiations were part of its overall plan to return the company to profitability as quickly as possible. 'This effort includes stringent cost controls, focus on those areas where we can add unique value to our customers and continued staff and facility reductions.' He said the company was closely examining which businesses and areas of technology it needed to supply directly to customers and which areas it made sense to supply through strategic partners. Analysts speculated that other assets up for sale could include the company's software products and its consulting business.</p>

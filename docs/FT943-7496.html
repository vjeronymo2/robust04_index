			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / People: AT&amp;T Istel Per Olof Loof (above), appointed to head AT&amp;T Istel, the European data communications and systems integration subsidiary of the US telecoms giant, is the third of AT&amp;T Europe's recent recruits to be poached from Digital. In February, AT&amp;T appointed Pier Carlo Falotti, Digital's former European head, as its first European chief executive. Loof, 43, Digital's European sales and marketing vice-president, transfers to Redditch-based AT&amp;T Istel on Falotti's coat-tails. With 3,000 employees, Istel is AT&amp;T's largest European venture. AT&amp;T's European strategy remains unclear, but its deal last month with Unisource, the joint venture between the Dutch, Swedish, Swiss and Spanish national telecoms operators, underlines its commitment to the European market, and data communications will be critical to any European advance by AT&amp;T. Loof's experience promoting Digital in the financial services sector will be especially useful at Istel. Before Digital he was at Arthur Anderson, in Sweden and the US. Peter Teague, Istel's current chief executive, moves to become vice president and chief financial officer of AT&amp;T UK, which is expanding after gaining a draft UK telecoms licence last month.</p>

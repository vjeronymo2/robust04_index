			<p>BFN     [Text] Economy and Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit has  reservations about the agreement to be signed between Israel and  the PLO, and says it has components which do not conform with  the opposition to the development of a Palestinian state, to  which labor had made a commitment.    Minister Shetrit has misgivings about Israel's agreement to  permit the Palestinians to issue their own passports and stamps.  He also opposes the ambiguity of the agreement and criticizes  the fact that no date has been fixed for the annulment of the  Palestinian National Covenant.</p>

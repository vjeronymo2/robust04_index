			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / EC veto possible DOWNING STREET signalled that Mr John Major is ready to veto attempts by Britain's European Community partners to reduce the Pounds 1.8bn rebate Britain receives on its contributions to Brussels. Senior ministers have been discussing the implications for the rebate of plans by the European Commission to restructure and expand the Community's financial base. Detailed proposals from Brussels are expected within the next few weeks. Whitehall officials said Mr Major would block changes unless Britain's rebate was protected.</p>

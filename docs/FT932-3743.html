			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ritblat borrows to buy shares MR JOHN RITBLAT, chairman of British Land, entered yesterday into a loan agreement to finance his purchase of 1m British Land shares. The agreement limits his exposure to price movements of the shares being used as security for the loan. 'These arrangements contain certain provisions which will limit his exposure to movements in the price of these shares being provided as security for the loan, between today's date and 6th July ,1994,' the company said in an announcement to the Stock Exchange yesterday. Mr Ritblat declined to discuss the loan. 'It is nothing to do with the public. It is my private affair.' he said. The shares being acquired by Mr Ritblat are part of an incentive arrangement made by some British Land executives with the Quantum Fund, managed by Mr George Soros. On June 2, when British Land announced its Pounds 132m rights issue and a partnership with the Quantum Fund, it said that Mr Ritblat would acquire 2m British Land shares. At least 1m of these shares were to be acquired from Quantum at Quantum's cost price.</p>

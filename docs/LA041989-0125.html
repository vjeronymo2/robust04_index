			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> A Santa Ana judge turned down a request by Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppes Inc.  to dismiss an attempt by creditors to put the company into involuntary  bankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana rejected the request because  of significant changes in the list of those who claim to be creditors of the  company, Heidi's attorney Martin Foley said. Foley said he plans to file a  revised motion to dismiss the creditors' attempt, and that a hearing on the  request is scheduled next month. Also on Tuesday, a group of Heidi's  franchisees said it filed a petition with the Bankruptcy Court to force two of  Heidi's subsidiaries into Chapter 7 bankruptcy, said Jim Teledano, an attorney  for the group. Under a Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy, the company stops  doing business and its assets are liquidated. Heidi's, a Laguna Hills-based  firm that operated as an independent, publicly traded company at the time of  the original filing, is now owned by Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc., which  purchased a majority interest in Heidi's in late February.  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Sharp fall in US leading index prompts warning on recovery THE US recovery is 'not solid', the White House warned yesterday, after the index of leading indicators posted its sharpest fall since the official end of the recession two years ago. The commerce department said the index, which is designed to give advance warning of economic trends, fell 1 per cent between February and March, more than financial markets expected. However, early figures for car and retail sales last month painted a brighter picture. Analysts said sales of domestically produced cars appeared to be running at an annualised rate of 7.0m in the last 10 days of April, up from 6.6m in the same period of March. Surveys also pointed to a rebound in retail sales after bad weather depressed sales in March. President Bill Clinton said the leading index figures reinforced the case for quick enactment of his deficit-cutting bill. Keeping the deficit down was the best investment government could make and the best route to lower interest rates, he said. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, blamed slower US growth on 'worldwide economic softness' and lack of investment during 12 years of Republican rule. The sharp fall in the index followed a rise of 0.5 per cent between January and February. Nine of 11 components of the index fell, led by a drop in permits for home construction, an increase in claims for state unemployment insurance and a shrinkage of the average working week. Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said growth would decline to an annual rate of only 1 per cent in the second quarter, against 1.8 per cent in the first quarter and 4.7 per cent at the end of last year. The second quarter slowdown would reflect companies' efforts to run down excessive stocks built up in recent months as a result of falling demand, she said. Growth, however, was likely to recover in the second half of the year. The fall in the leading index follows a report on Monday of a sharp fall last month in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a barometer of conditions in manufacturing industry.</p>

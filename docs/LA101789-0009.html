			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STEP FOR WORLD SAFETY, IF EAST BLOC IS SERIOUS;  </P> <P> TERRORISM: THE SOVIETS MAY NOW RECOGNIZE IT AS A MENACE THAT MUST BE FOUGHT,  THOUGH THEIR ACTIONS SO FAR GO ONLY PARTWAY.  </P> <P> Western governments were intrigued but skeptical when Mikhail S. Gorbachev  declared almost four years ago that "the Soviet Union rejects terrorism in  principle and is prepared to cooperate actively with other states to uproot  it."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union and other East Bloc nations have a long track record of  providing weapons, training and sanctuary for America-hating terrorists  dedicated to the destruction of Western democracy through assassination and  sabotage. They have been the major source of arms and political support for  Syria and Libya, which in turn have sponsored the Middle Eastern fanatics who  maim, murder and kidnap in the name of holy war against Israel and  "imperialism."  </P> <P> Evidence is growing, however, that the Soviets really have come to see  international terrorism as a menace that must be fought in cooperation with the  United States and other countries. If so, the ramifications for the war against  terrorism are incalculable.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's 1986 remarks on terrorism were followed by feelers to the West and  subsequent U.S.-Soviet contacts on the subject. Formal superpower talks opened  last June. And an unofficial task force of U.S. and Soviet experts has twice  met to discuss possible areas of cooperation. The last such meeting, which  included an ex-CIA chief and two former generals in the KGB secret police,  occurred this month in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Task force members agreed on the need for "timely exchange" of information on  terrorist plans and activities. They proposed that no nation "sponsor,  encourage, train or supply any kind of terrorist activity," and that all  governments "take all appropriate measures to . . . persaude other nations and  groups with which they have contact to cease and desist from employing  terrorism tactics."  </P> <P> The proposals bear no official imprint so far, but they are being relayed to  both governments in preparation for a second round of official talks.  </P> <P> Most Western experts dismiss any notion that the Soviets have masterminded the  global terrorism network. But Moscow has supported terrorist groups that would  have existed anyway in the apparent conviction that violence directed against  the capitalist West was, by definition, in the Soviet's interest.  </P> <P> Thousands of Third World "freedom fighters" received training in subversion and  sabotage at training camps in the Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea, Bulgaria and  Czechoslovakia. Many later emerged as terrorists. Defecting terrorists have  told of East German and Cuban instructors at similar training camps in the  Middle East.  </P> <P> The Soviets clearly are in a position to provide, if they will, a gold mine of  information on the personalities, communications and logistics arrangements of  international terrorists.  </P> <P> But why should they do us favors? Part of the answer, Western experts believe,  is that Moscow has become increasingly concerned that links with terrorists  could seriously endanger the good relations with the West that are essential  for the economic success of perestroika. Beyond that, the Soviets have come to  realize that terrorism could endanger the internal stability of the Soviet  Union, too.  </P> <P> Brian Jenkins, formerly of the RAND Corp., recently noted that, while many  incidents have not been publicly reported, "in recent years hijackings inside  the Soviet Union and terrorist attacks against Soviet officials abroad have  brought the Soviet Union to fifth place in the list of terrorist targets."  </P> <P> In view of the nationalist fervor now sweeping the Soviet Union, the Kremlin  must be uneasy that terrorist tactics could be adopted by anti-Soviet elements  in the Baltic states, the Ukraine and especially the southern border republics  with their large Muslim populations that might be potentially susceptible to  the fundamentalist extremism that is rampant in neighboring Iran and  Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, one suspects, would like to head off the possibility of home-grown  Soviet terrorists receiving support from the West. What's needed now is action  to back up the rhetoric of cooperation.  </P> <P> The Soviets have gone part way. They are credited with helping to influence the  Palestine Liberation Organization to embrace efforts for a negotiated  settlement with Israel. They are also said to have bluntly told Syria not to  use military force against Israel, to have urged a policy of restraint upon  Iran and to have been active in trying to end the cycle of murder and terrorism  in Lebanon.  </P> <P> If the Soviets are serious, though, they could do much more. They could  pressure Cuba, Bulgaria and East Germany to stop giving aid and comfort to  visiting terrorists. As the major supplier of arms to Syria and Libya, they  could exert great leverage on these state sponsors of terrorism to knock it  off. They could blow the whistle on impending terrorist operations known to  Soviet intelligence.  </P> <P> Until such things happen, the Soviets will be a part of the problem instead of  the solution.  </P></p>

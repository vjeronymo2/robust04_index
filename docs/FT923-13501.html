			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: NMC to pass final dividend NMC, the packaging company, is passing its final dividend for the year to March 31 because of uncertainties about the timing and proceeds of its planned flotation of a stake in Universal Packaging, its US offshoot. Mr Norman Gordon, chief executive, said dividend policy would be reviewed when the situation had been resolved. He added that almost all the group's profits arose in the US and existing financing arrangement restricted their repatriation. The flotation was intended to improve this structural imbalance. The company, which last year failed to take over API, a rival packaging company, suffered a downturn in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.39m to Pounds 5m. The passing of the final dividend leaves the total for the year at 1.25p, against 3.55p. Universal increased profits as a result of a strong rise in sales in the second half. UK businesses had a difficult year with losses in the point of sale activity. Turnover for the year declined to Pounds 93.6m, against Pounds 110.8m which included a Pounds 17.3m contribution from property and finance. The figure included Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 5.04m) from Hobbs Packaging which was sold in January. Earnings per share were 2.76p (7.07p) basic or 5.91p (8.61p) fully diluted. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 615,000 relating to costs of its failed API bid.</p>

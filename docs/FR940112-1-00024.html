			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having considered these comments, the Commission is deferring issuance of a final rule at this time pending development and testing of the necessary software. Once that process is complete the Commission intends to issue a final rule providing for the electronic filing of Form 1. The Commission presently anticipates that that process will be complete in time for the electronic filing of Form 1 for reporting year 1994, due on or before April 30, 1995. However, there will be no electronic reporting of Form 1 for reporting year 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, the Commission believes it useful to comment on certain suggestions and recommendations made by interested parties concerning features they believe should be incorporated in the software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is presently developing a personal computer (PC) based software package for Form 1 reporting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The software will be available on standard computer diskettes with instructions and documentation, and will be sent to each Form 1 respondent without charge. This package will display the Form 1, schedule by schedule, on a respondent's PC. The required data may then be manually key-entered on the respondent's PC. The program will also permit the respondent to ``import'' the required data from its PC or mainframe computer directly into the software package, thus avoiding the manual data-entry process. When the data entry process is completed, the respondent, using the software, will produce a data diskette that will be submitted to the Commission, along with the required paper copies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The data contained on the data diskette will be in a data base format for use by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An IBM compatible, DOS-based system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The software package will also enable respondents to print paper copies of the form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has already initiated the process of procuring the necessary software package for automating Form 1 reporting. The Commission intends to test all aspects of the system, including data input, data output, and print capability. The Commission also intends to conduct a field test of the software package with volunteer Form 1 respondents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected the program to be complete and to have diskettes ready for distribution to each Form 1 respondent in time to allow reporting for reporting year 1993 by the April 30, 1994 filing deadline; that time frame is being delayed pending development and testing of the necessary software. Thus, there will be no electronic reporting of Form 1 for reporting year 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters generally expressed support for the objectives set forth in the NOPR, although virtually all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested a delay in implementation until at least reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters also made numerous suggestions and recommendations concerning development and implementation of the proposal. It was the Commission's intention in initiating this proposal that the software would be developed by the Commission's staff and that modifications or revisions would be made as necessary based on the results of staff and field tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, a number of commenters have offered specific suggestions as to features which they believe should be incorporated in the software, and the Commission has reviewed these various suggestions and is prepared to state its views on most of these suggestions. Additionally, the Commission's staff will continue to evaluate suggestions as the software is developed and the field test is undertaken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Effective Date of Electronic Reporting Requirement and Response to Comments on Software  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A majority of the commenters suggested that implementation be delayed from reporting year 1993; they variously suggest delays until, for example, reporting year 1994, or voluntary filing in 1994 and mandatory filing in 1995, or until one year after the software package has been fully tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments received, the Commission agrees that the electronic reporting requirement should not be implemented for the 1993 reporting year. Rather, we believe that the electronic reporting requirement should be delayed pending development and testing of the required software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

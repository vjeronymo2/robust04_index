			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany today, utilizing  his constitutional powers, pardoned a number of individuals  accused of allegedly committing political crimes.    Among those pardoned are former President Eric Arturo  Delvalle and the 510 corregimiento representatives who appointed  Francisco Rodriguez as president for the presidential term that  started on 1 September 1989. Also included in this pardon  granted to those who committed only political crimes are  Benjamin Colamarco Patino; Arturo Diez; Rafael Arosemena;  Orville K. Goodin; Olmedo David Miranda; Nander Pitty Velasquez;  Jorge Eduardo Ritter; Marta Amado Trevia; Manuel Solis Palma;  Francisco Sanchez Cardenas; Julio Shaik; and Jaime Simmons.    Meanwhile, Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque, who allegedly  slandered and offended Omayra Correa by publishing three  political cartoons in LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in August and  September 1989, was also granted a pardon. Others who were  granted presidential pardons include journalists Escolastico  Calvo and Guillermo Keevers.    These pardons fail to absolve these people from being  prosecuted for committing common crimes, however.</p>

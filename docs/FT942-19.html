			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (9): Travelling businessmen can keep in touch / An investigation into the latest in in-car communications Radio waves have beamed a one-way stream of entertainment and information into moving vehicles ever since the first car radio was fitted. But, over the past decade, advances in data processing and cellular radio-telephony have added a new two-way 'interactive' dimension to in-car communications which is already increasing the productivity of the travelling executive on the road. Leaving the office no longer means forsaking the facsimile machine, the computer system and the telephone. Cellular- radio telecommunications services in particular have proved to be a valuable business tool, initially for voice, and now for data communications. Equipped with the right cellular telephone handset, a portable computer and a fax-modem, it is now possible to exchange data with head office, collect electronic mail or send a facsimile message while on the move. Where a hard copy is required, lightweight high quality portable printers are now available, as are notebook PCs with inbuilt ink-jet printers. If secure high quality voice-only telecommunications are required, the business traveller will soon be able to use one of the new pan-European GSM-standard digital cellular telephones to make a telephone call almost anywhere in Europe. In a couple of years satellite-based systems will offer digital telecommunications services from anywhere on earth. Alternatively, if data-only transmission is needed then a new breed of dedicated mobile data service operators has begun to appear. This revolution in mobile telecommunications started in the US in the early 1980s and spread to Europe via Scandinavia and the UK in the mid-1980s. Since cellular radio telephone services began in Britain in 1985, the number of subscribers to the two original analogue networks, Cellnet and Vodafone, has grown to about 2m - or a fifth of the total 10m cellular telephone subscribers in Europe. From the outset, cellular telephones found their way into executive vehicles in the form of dedicated carphones. In equipment terms carphones still provide a cost-effective option for the corporate fleet, but lightweight pocket-sized hand-portable telephones have come to dominate equipment sales in recent years. Most of these handsets can also be used with a car kit - which extends battery life and provides better reception - but can also leave the vehicle along with the user. Meanwhile, the range of cellular services available to the business user has expanded dramatically in the past two years. In particular, digital cellular technology has led to a second generation of cellular networks in Europe, while encouraging the operators of the older analogue networks to cut prices and re-organise their tariff structures. In the UK Cellnet and Vodafone offer a total of six different tariffs on their analogue networks. In addition both have built digital networks based on the GSM standard. In Britain, where the old analogue networks still provide superior national coverage, some analogue handset prices have been cut to Pounds 100 or less and the uptake of these new GSM services has been relatively slow. However, in Germany and other markets where analogue network capacity was restricted, or had not been developed, GSM subscriber numbers have grown rapidly over the past two years. In some markets, particularly Denmark and Germany, aggressive marketing has already resulted in the elimination of the price premium on GSM equipment. The launch last year of the Mercury One-2-One service in the UK - the first digital PCN (Personal Communications Network) in the world - followed by inauguration of Orange, the network owned by Hutchison Telecom, in April has provided subscribers in Britain with further options. Orange's tariff structure in particular is designed to appeal to high volume business users. In Europe PCN networks are also planned in Germany and France. In the longer term these digital cellular services should have another key advantage over their analogue counterparts - digital technology makes it much easier to transmit data over a cellular radio network. The liquid crystal displays on GSM and PCN handsets can potentially be used to provide a sophisticated pager and message service. In addition, handsets equipped with an appropriate socket should eventually be able to accept data from a notebook PC or a handheld personal digital assistant, without the need for a modem. In the meantime, however, it is perfectly possible - though somewhat more difficult and less reliable - to send or receive data over an analogue network using a special wireless modem and handset. Another alternative is to sign up for a dedicated mobile data service, such as the Ram Mobile Data network in the UK, that is designed to work with portable PCs and other digital equipment such as facsimile machines at high speed. Digital radio in either cellular or satellite form, is also likely to provide the communications backbone for another set of productivity enhancing tools for the motorist - so-called route guidance and congestion avoidance systems. There are already a number of commercially available route guidance systems in use in the UK and elsewhere. Among the real-time systems is Trafficmaster, which is used by more than 4,000 British motorists. It is a dashboard-mounted unit which tells drivers about traffic speeds on about 1,000 miles of motorways in the south and midlands, pinpointing delays and estimating travel times. The information is collected by infra-red sensors placed on bridges and gantries over motorways which monitor the speed of passing traffic and send the information to a control centre in Luton from where it is relayed immediately to subscribers' vehicles. More sophisticated systems integrating problem identification, satellite global positioning systems and route guidance are likely in the next decade. Much of the groundwork for these systems has being undertaken under the aegis of EU-sponsored research programmes such as Prometheus which have brought together the big European vehicle and components manufacturers in strictly non-competitive collaborative research. Some researchers are already suggesting that by the end of the century in-car electronic navigation equipment, working with global positioning systems, will allow a driver to follow the progress of a journey on a moving map shown on a screen, or enable emergency services to pinpoint a disabled vehicle. Research is also being conducted in the UK and elsewhere into Radio Data Systems which would allow local traffic information to replace national broadcasts in digitised form. This up-to-date data would be decoded by the in-car navigator and the driver alerted to problems ahead either via a text display, or by a computer generated voice. What seems certain is that the next generation of communications technology will enable the travelling businessman to send and receive vastly more information. At the same time, increasingly sophisticated data processing equipment will enable this information to be analysed, manipulated and displayed more easily - and integrated with other in-vehicle electronic systems ranging from entertainment equipment to collision avoidance systems.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: Clinton plan fails to impress Poland The Polish government yesterday grudgingly endorsed President Bill Clinton's Partnership for Peace proposal, calling it 'an insufficient step in the right direction'. President Lech Walesa, who is due to go to Prague for a meeting with the US leader tomorrow to tell him of Polish disappointment at Nato's failure to open up more to the central European countries, has been pressing in recent days for a firm commitment for central European membership of Nato from the Brussels summit. He has also criticised the plan proposals as not going far enough to ensure the security of the region. Mr Walesa suggested yesterday that Nato membership should be offered to Russia as a way of controlling its nuclear arsenal. 'I do not know why the world has not asked Russia to put its nuclear weapons and other terrible weapons at Nato's disposal when they join. Nobody has dared ask such a question so far.' Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Polish foreign minister, yesterday put a brave face on the issue, however, and said after a cabinet meeting attended by the president that Poland would accept the US proposal 'after we have seen the details', adding that 'the proposal goes in the right direction.' 'After all,' he continued, 'now we are in the waiting room - before there wasn't even any talk of Nato membership.' He added that Washington had publicly stated in the past few days that 'the security of Poland and the other countries of the region was of material interest to the United States', which he viewed as the administration's most far-reaching statement to date on the issue. Mr Olechowski was speaking in the wake of an announcement that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the far right Liberal Democratic party, the second largest fraction in the new Russian parliament, was planning a visit to Poland. Mr Zhirinovsky's strong showing in the Russian elections has rekindled Poland's fear of its neighbour. Mr Olechowski warned that should Mr Zhirinovsky do anything construed as being against Polish interests, he would be expelled .</p>

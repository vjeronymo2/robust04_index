			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Observer: Not so human race It's a funny old world when South Africa's voters have to prove they are white in order to vote in the referendum whose aim is to gauge support for abolishing apartheid. Those who carry identity documents issued after 1986 - which do not indicate race - will have to provide other evidence of racial purity. This conjures up visions of the bad old days of the 'pencil test': if a pencil inserted in the hair failed to lodge there, a person could usually pass as white. But race classification experts need not sharpen their pencils this time: Pretoria will check identity documents against the electoral roll or birth records to ensure that no non-whites sneak into the polling booths. Meanwhile, the prospect of the referendum has sent South African whites around the world scurrying to make sure they will be able to vote - nowhere more so than in London, the main centre for South African expatriates. The republic's London embassy reports that on Wednesday alone, no fewer than 1,350 people called in to find out how to vote. Such is the enthusiasm that there is talk of hiring a jumbojet to ferry people down to Johannesburg in time for referendum day, March 17. With an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 South Africans resident in Britain - most of them expected to vote 'yes' to a continuation of President FW de Klerk's reforms  -the expatriate vote could be vital if the contest is as close run as some people expect.</p>

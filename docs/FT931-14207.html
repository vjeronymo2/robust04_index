			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / President in waiting invokes JFK spirit AT NOON today Mr Bill Clinton becomes the 42nd president of the US. Yesterday he spent a few quiet moments at the grave of the man who inspired him to take up a political career, President John F. Kennedy. Mr Clinton, his wife Hillary and about 20 members of the Kennedy clan placed white roses on the graves of the two assassinated Kennedy brothers. He read the inscriptions on their tombstones, but said nothing. He hardly needed to, because it is the stuff of legend (and captured on film) how, just four months before Kennedy was killed in Dallas in 1963, the gangly 17-year-old youth from Arkansas, as a member of the American Legion's Boys Nation, shook hands with the president at the White House. There is an additional symbolism to the tribute. At 46, Mr Clinton is three years older than JFK when he assumed office, yet both represent the ascent of a younger generation of Americans to the seat of power. It is likely Mr Clinton will again invoke the example and memory of his idol when he gives his inauguration speech today. Most of Mr Clinton's last full day as a president-elect had a youthful theme. He took his customary morning jog and later was to attend a couple of galas mostly for the young. He told an older lunchtime group, the governors of the 50 states, that they ran 'our laboratories of democracy' and he would need them to tell him as president what he was doing right - and wrong. Elsewhere serious business was afoot, with new bombing raids over northern Iraq and an apparent Iraqi offer of conciliation. But there was good news from Capitol Hill. Assorted Senate committees unanimously approved the nominations of six of his would-be cabinet, including Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state and Mr Mickey Kantor as US trade representative. The full Senate may confirm some nominations this afternoon. The judiciary committee heard an apology from Ms Zoe Baird, the attorney-general designate, for having employed two illegal aliens. Its senior Republican, Mr Orrin Hatch of Utah, said the incident was no disqualification to her serving as head of the Justice Department. Meanwhile a dozen senior State Department appointments were announced and as many as 100 more across the government promised for this week, thus ensuring that not all desks in the corridors of power would be empty this afternoon.

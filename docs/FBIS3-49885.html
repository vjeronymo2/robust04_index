This  statement was made by Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia  [KSCM] Chairman M. Grebenicek at a news conference. He  expressed his dissatisfaction with the Czech Government's  immediate agreement to this proposal without a public debate and  called for a referendum. According to Deputy Chairman M.  Ransdorf, the Partnership will make considerable claims on the  Czech Republic's budget. He emphasized the likelihood of a  "certain yielding of part of our state sovereignty" without  clear security guarantees. According to the KSCM, collective  security should be based on the CSCE.    M. Stiborova, chairwoman of the Left Bloc Party, said that  Partnership for Peace will not resolve our entry into NATO. In  her opinion, not even the expansion of NATO is a path toward  collective European security. According to Stiborova, the CSCE  should form the basis for European security.</p>

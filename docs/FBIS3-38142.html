She stated this while addressing a crowded news  conference at the Congress Media Center of the World Economic  Forum in the Swiss city of Davos yesterday. Benazir Bhutto said  Pakistan, as a developing country, wants to spend its human  resources and limited mineral resources to eradicate poverty,  diseases, and illiteracy. The prime minister said Pakistan has  really become a suitable country for investments, where foreign  investment is not only safe but the percentage of profit is also  very high. Investments can be taken out of the country without  any hindrance. She said we are relaxing the rules and  regulations on economy in order to promote investments in the  country and also are lifting the remaining government controls.  She said Pakistan is situated geographically on an important  location between the newly independent Central Asian states and  the Gulf countries and it provides the best and the least  expensive route for access to these fast developing markets.  Referring to Pakistan's steps for forging close commerical ties  with Central Asian states, she said projects are on the anvil to  establish rail and road links between Pakistan and Central Asian  states. She said investors from Japan, Turkey, and Singapore  have offered assistance in these projects.    She said Pakistan has come ahead as a democratic,  progress-loving, and Islamic nation. The recent elections,  which have been recognized at the international level as the  most fair and transparent elections in our election history,  have made it clear that there is no place for retrograde and  conservative tendencies in Pakistani elections. The prime  minister made it clear that Pakistan's foreign policy is based  on peace and justice in our region and stability in the world.  She emphasized that durable peace cannot be established in an  atmosphere of injustice, exploitation, and foreign hegemony.    Referring to India's continued aggression in Jammu and  Kashmir and its atrocities on the Kashmiris, the prime minister  said India is constantly negating a meaningful dialogue to  resolve this dispute in accordance with UN resolutions, which  call for holding a plebiscite. In response to a question on  Pakistan-India talks on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and the  support for appeal to observe total strike on 5 February, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto said the appeal for a strike has been made to  protest against India's continuous aggression on Jammu and  Kashmir; its inhuman acts of atrocities on Kashmiri men, women,  and children; and lack of initiative from the Indian side to  resolve this dispute. She said that she agreed to the  secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India as the talks  were deadlocked for the past 18 months. This is the first  occasion that India held talks on the Kashmir dispute as a  separate item of the agenda, but India has not halted the series  of atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir. She said Pakistan has  earned its independence through political process as well as  struggle and hence it cannot keep aloof from the struggle of the  Kashmiris to realize their right of self-determination. India  is also committing gross human rights violations in Jammu and  Kashmir. These facts prove that India is not desirous of any  sort of initiative for resolving the Kashmir dispute. That is  why an appeal has been made to observe total strike in Pakistan,  Azad Kashmir, and occupied Kashmir [as heard]. Ms. Benazir  Bhutto said Pakistan wants the resolution of this dispute on the  basis of UN resolutions as it supports the objectives and  activities of the United Nations.    Pakistan had supported the UN resolutions on Kuwait,  Somalia,  and Bosnia and the activities carried out there under its  auspices. Pakistan supports the peace accord reached between  Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. She said serious  attention will be paid to Israel-Syria talks on Golan heights.  The relations of Islamic countries with Israel in future will  depend upon the outcome of these talks. On Bosnia, she said  Pakistan has offered to provide assistance to Bosnian Muslims.  She said herself and her Turkish counterpart, Ms. Tansu Ciller,  will soon visit Sarajevo to express solidarity with Bosnian  Muslims. She said the dispute in Bosnia should be resolved in  accordance with the UN resolutions and Muslims should be  protected from massacres and other crimes.</p>

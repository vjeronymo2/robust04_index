			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates ease MONEY market rates eased slightly yesterday, implying more optimism about an interest rate cut in the UK around the time of the March budget than has been seen in recent weeks. The key three-month interbank rate, which is a good indicator to sentiment on interest rates, fell a touch from 10 9/16 - 1/2 at the opening to close at 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent - the level of current base rates. One senior trader said this was the first time three-month money had traded around 10 1/2 for a couple of months. Mr Nigel Newman, a senior economist with Barclays, said the deciding factor on a UK interest rate cut would be sterling's position within the exchange rate mechanism. 'Everything is in place for another half point interest rate cut,' he said. However, if sterling was 'pushing against the bottom' of the ERM grid, that could prevent a cut, Mr Newman added. The March short sterling contract, which opened two basis points higher at 89.69, firmed to 89.70 by the close in London. This implies an interest rate of 10.3 per cent in March. Overnight money finished at sharply lower levels following a healthy injection from the Bank of England. In early operations the Bank injected Pounds 2.241bn, 'the biggest amount of help seen in one go since 1989,' said the senior trader. Initially, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.3bn, which was later revised to Pounds 2.55bn. Of the early assistance, Pounds 833m was comprised of bands one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band three at 10 3/16 per cent, and band four at 10 1/8 - 3/32 per cent. A further Pounds 1.408bn was purchased for resale on February 26 and 27 at 10 7/16 per cent. In the afternoon the bank bought band one and two bills totalling Pounds 154m at 10 3/8 per cent and gave late help of Pounds 155m. Call money eased in Germany as the market found itself with more than enough liquidity. Rates were quoted at 9.55/60 per cent compared with Thursday's 9.60/65 per cent. In the US, the Federal Reserve drained reserves by a weekend matched sale-repurchase agreement at 3 13/16 per cent. The operation knocked expectations that the Fed would cut the funds rate from 4 to 3 3/4 per cent. The cut is still expected in the short-term, however, with early next week leading the betting. Economists said they did not expect a cut in the discount rate.</p>

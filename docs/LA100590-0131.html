			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Milken Hearings Delayed: Federal court hearings in which witnesses are due to  give evidence against junk bond king Michael Milken have been postponed at  least until next Thursday.  </P> <P> The hearings had been scheduled to begin in New York on Tuesday. A judge  allowed the delay after Milken's defense lawyers complained that they didn't  have enough time to prepare. Both prosecution and defense witnesses are due to  testify on whether Milken committed additional crimes, a question the judge  will take into account when she determines Milken's sentence on the six counts  to which he pleaded guilty.  </P></p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / The Markets: Myth of empty sovereignty - Economic Eye In France 'the notion of the unsurrenderable sovereignty of the 'Etat nation' still carries weight, although this sovereignty has long since become an empty shell.' Thus did Mr Karl Lamers, writing for the Christian Democratic Union in a paper published just before the German parliamentary elections, condemn French hesitation in taking concrete steps towards 'the goal of a strong and integrated Europe capable of effective action.' In a subsequent article for the FT (November 7), he extended this assessment to all European states. The view that sovereignty is empty has become a cliche in the debate on Europe's future. Yet it is nonsense. French sovereignty is not empty, if by sovereignty is meant the ability to pass laws conducive to the prosperity of the people. Nor is this true only for a large country like France. The fallacy is the identification of sovereignty with power. The ruins of the Soviet empire are testimony to the extent of this mistake. The search for the omnipotent state proved a sure route to its collapse. It is true that sovereignty may also depend on a state's ability to sustain political independence. This century has demonstrated that very few countries are securely sovereign in this sense, perhaps the US alone. But this does not mean that all the others are economically impotent. To assume this is to confuse international economic transactions with war. Needless to say, this mercantilist viewpoint is not restricted to Germany. Listen to Elisabeth Guigou, formidably able French minister for European affairs during the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty. She writes, in a book which contains a position on European affairs close to that of Mr Lamers, that 'divided, Europe would more than ever be the prey of the big economic powers'.* A European crisis would 'leave each country alone to face the American and Japanese mastodons'. To understand why such fears are mistaken, one must turn one's gaze from Europe to the other end of Eurasia. There we find a long-united colossus around whose periphery hang three insular economies and a politically-divided peninsular. The populations of these four vary in size from 10 per cent of their neighbour's to less than 0.5 per cent. For decades, all four were forced to look to world markets for economic opportunities. In doing so, they found themselves confronting tariffs, discriminatory quantitative restrictions and arbitrary 'anti-dumping' provisions. Here then must be the hapless prey of which Mme Guigou writes. But one of them is, of course, Japan, the others being South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Consider defenceless, free-trading Hong Kong, with its tiny population of 6m. It has, according to the World Bank, attained a real income per head greater than French or British levels and more than 10 times higher than mainland China's. Its economy also grew at an average rate of 6.7 per cent between 1980 and 1992. But many other economies in the east Asian region, both large and small, matched or surpassed this achievement. Large and small, that is the point. Look at the table, which lists the world's 12 largest countries by population (with the European Union included as one country). Are big, politically powerful countries also rich ones? The US is, as are the EU and Japan. But take a look at China, India, Russia or Pakistan. Have big countries enjoyed high rates of economic growth? Not necessarily. On the whole, poor economies grew more quickly than rich ones, because of the opportunity to catch up. But even this rule is not infallible, as the Nigerian and Mexican disasters demonstrate. Adam Smith argued cogently that free trade gives a country the same opportunities as membership of a great empire. It fails to do so only if all significant economies are rigorously protectionist. Then, indeed, it would be necessary at least to be part of a trading bloc. There is, therefore, a self-justifying prophecy implicit in the fears of those who advocate such blocs. Happily, this is not the world we live in. Many of the most successful economies have, like Singapore, neither had large populations nor been part of trading blocs. They have, instead, exploited opportunities for global trade in what has proved to be an adequately open and competitive world market. To understand why this has worked it is necessary to appreciate how governments are able to promote the prosperity of their people. This is admirably explained in a book by Professor Russell Roberts of Washington University in St Louis, by use of an imaginary dialogue between a television manufacturer and David Ricardo, inventor of the theory of comparative advantage.** What then is the secret of wealth, according to the professor's David Ricardo? It is to 'use your resources wisely. By resources, I don't just mean the traditional natural resources of fertile land, oil and minerals, but the know-how, education, ingenuity and drive of the people. Using your resources wisely means giving the people the incentive to work hard and the incentives to innovate, to take risks'. The EU can do this, but so can (and have) Switzerland and Hong Kong. The economic value of the EU to its members is not that, without it, the economies of member states would be trampled underfoot by giants. It does not depend on its being huge, but rather on its ability to induce members to exercise sovereignty more wisely than they would outside it. Unless this is clearly understood, the EU, for all its size, is doomed to poor performance. * Elisabeth Guigou, Pour les Europeens (Flammarion, 1994); ** Russell D Roberts, The Choice: a Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1994).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How size fails to ensure wealth  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Population                     GNP per head      GDP growth 1980-92 Million (1992)                       1992           (annual average                                    (Dollars)           % growth)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     1,162          China              470                9.1       884          India              310                5.2       347          EU              20,774                2.2       255          US              23,240                2.7       184          Indonesia          670                5.7       154          Brazil           2,770                2.2       149          Russia           2,510                  -       124          Japan           28,190                4.1       119          Pakistan           420                6.1       114          Bangladesh         220                4.2       102          Nigeria            320                2.3        85          Mexico           3,470                1.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank, Eurostat  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

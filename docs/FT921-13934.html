			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paribas falls 7.3% on profit downgradings SECTOR rotation spread to a number of bourses yesterday, while Paris concentrated on individual stocks, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ended flat, but its steady close masked some big movements. The CAC 40 index closed 0.24 lower at 1,859.95, for a 1.2 per cent rise on the week. Volume eased to FFr3bn from FFr3.2bn. Paribas slumped FFr26 or 7.3 per cent to FFr330 on 172,33 shares on a wave of downgradings on 1991 net income, from previous forecasts of around FFr2.5bn to FFr1.5bn. The bank was reported to have told analysts at a meeting on Thursday that it would have to make heavy provisions for loans to Maxwell companies. BSN rose FFr28 to FFr1,140 with 269,670 shares traded on speculation that the Agnelli family would increase its stake in the food giant. Similar talk drove Perrier up to FFr1,455 before it slipped back to close FFr8 higher at FFr1,396. Early selling, following the company's statement late on Thursday that profits had fallen as much as 20 per cent in 1991, pushed Lyonnaise-Dumez as low as FFr428. But it bounced back to close FFr15.50 higher at FFr458 in 258,705 shares. FRANKFURT negotiated expiry day for DTB options with equities still ahead, the DAX index closing 4.65 higher at 1,670.99 after a rise of 2.63 to 678.64 for the FAZ at midsession. Gains on the week were 3.4 and 4.0 per cent. Volume rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.2bn. Strike threats were shrugged off as Bayernhypo and Bayernverein rose DM6 to DM405 and DM6.20 to DM427.20, and Hoesch and Thyssen by DM13.50 to DM255.50, and DM4.40 to DM221.80. It remained a traders' market, rather than one for the fundamentalists. The point was demonstrated again in carmakers, where the oversold Volkswagen recovered another DM7.80 to DM324 while Daimler, highly regarded by most analysts, fell DM2.70 to DM748.50. MILAN ran into some profit-taking at the end of a strong week dominated by domestic buying. The Comit index fell 2.92 to 548.11, up 3.1 per cent on the week. Volume was estimated at less than Thursday's heavy L176.3bn. Pirelli continued its recovery ahead of its rights issue, closing L68 or 5.7 per cent higher at L1,270. The stock has jumped by 20.8 per cent this week. Telecoms were mixed after parliament approved a major restructuring of the industry on Thursday night. Brokers said that the overhaul was expected to favour Stet, Italcable and Sirti, but it increased the chances of Sip having a rights issue. SIP fell L27 or 1.8 per cent to L1,498 while Stet added L13 to L2,284. Insurers were depressed by indications that there would be no change in car insurance tariffs before 1992. Generali eased L435 to L30,365. AMSTERDAM was swayed by the dollar's volatility. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.3 to 120.5, up 3.7 per cent on the week, in heavy turnover of Fl 1.14bn. Philips rallied Fl 1.60 or 5.3 per cent to Fl 32.00 on reports of upgradings. It said on Thursday that it was closing a microchip plant in the US. Shares in the brewer Grolsch were suspended at Thursday's closing price of Fl 185.00 ahead of news that it was negotiating to buy the British regional ale brewer, Ruddles, from Courage. ZURICH talked of a recovery in cyclicals with Alusuisse, SFr28 higher at SFr937, also reflecting the revival in the aluminium price. Declines elsewhere included Von Roll, down SFr50 to SFr900 on a group loss for 1991. The all-share SPI index fell 2.2 to 1,104.05 on the day, but rose 1.5 per cent on the week. MADRID steadied after an early fall but still ended with the general index 2.76 lower at 253.92, a fraction higher on the week. The index was weighed down by Telefonica, which fell Pta50 to Pta1,215 after it said that stockholders' equity and, to a lesser extent, future operating results could be affected by plans for new pension benefits. BRUSSELS closed higher, the Bel-20 Index adding 7.58 to 1,156.50 for a 4.5 per cent rise on the week. Petrofina put on BFr25 to BFr10,975 on moderate volume of 7,860 shares. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index put in its third consecutive rise to close 1.8 higher at 982.2. A rise of SKr5 to SKr122 in Ericsson B could not offset the drop in Astra A of SKr22 to SKr560. OSLO was lifted by Norsk Hydro which jumped NKr13, or 8.5 per cent to NKr166. The all-share index rose 8.92 to 464.24, up 8 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes  Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm       3 pm     close 1137.58  1138.20  1137.19  1139.25  1138.75  1138.40??  1136.74  1135.24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1140.39              Day's Low  1134.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Jan 16         Jan 15        Jan 14         Jan 13         Jan 10   1131.02        1140.52       1112.87        1105.02        1105.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ??

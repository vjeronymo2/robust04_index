			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Thunderstorms slapped North Texas with tornadoes, drenching rain and hail,  causing floods. The storms swept through Oklahoma and Louisiana as well, but  with lesser effect. In the East, heavy rains dropped up to three-fourths of an  inch of rain per hour on northern New Jersey, triggering flash flood watches  for New York City and Philadelphia. The Southwest storms spun off tornadoes  that touched down near Abilene, Menard and Longview, all in Texas, and  McAlister, N.M. No major injuries or damage were reported. More than 11 inches  of rain fell in Antelope, Tex., northwest of Ft. Worth, and more than five  inches fell along the Red River dividing the Lone Star State from Oklahoma,  flooding roads and homes. National Guardsmen with trucks helped evacuate 150  people from low-lying areas in Gainesville, Tex., state officials said.  </P></p>

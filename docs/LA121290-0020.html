			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO ADDS TEAMS TO ITS BASEBALL TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> San Fernando High's preseason baseball tournament has been expanded to eight  teams and may add more teams in the spring of 1992, according to Tiger Coach  Steve Marden.  </P> <P> The spring tournament, in its second season, will include City Section teams  Grant, Birmingham, Granada Hills, Kennedy, Narbonne, Franklin, Poly and San  Fernando.  </P> <P> The inaugural Tiger Invitational featured a six-team field, and Marden said  that, based on feedback, he may expand the tournament to 10 or 12 teams in  1992. Marden said coaches like the fact that the tournament lasts just eight  days, rather than continuing over several consecutive weekends and into the  regular-season schedule.  </P> <P> "Sometimes in those tournaments, you end up using a second baseman or an  outfielder on the hill," Marden said. "Nobody wants to use their best pitcher  when they might have an important league game coming up. This tournament  doesn't drag on forever."  </P> <P> Each team is guaranteed four games in the tournament, which runs Feb. 20, 21,  26 and 28. Also, area teams have been guaranteed that they will not face a  league opponent. San Fernando, which was 3-0-1 in tournament play last season,  is the defending champion.  </P> <P> Marden said that a handful of Southern Section teams from the area inquired  about entering but are prohibited from playing until March 7.  </P> <P> The tournament could help fill the void created when the Thousand Oaks  tournament folded over the summer.

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Oslo struggles to shake off its depression - Karen Fossli reviews the prospects for the bourse as it languishes at a three-year low OSLO is finding it difficult to shake off the depression which has pulled the stock market down by 10.5 per cent this year, but domestic analysts believe that the second half will bring a change for the better. On Monday, the all-share index hit a three-year nadir of 369.99, forcing 19 stocks to their lows for 1992. It finished at 378.11 yesterday. Oslo has been plagued by bad news carried over from last year, and the Bundesbank's discount rate decision last week has extinguished any glimmer of optimism. The market is particularly sensitive to external influences, due to the high dependency of its blue chip industrial and shipping stocks on dollar-denominated export earnings. Its industrial index has fallen by 4.1 per cent since the start of the year, but the shipping sector has plunged by 30.2 per cent as shipowners struggle to cover operational costs, as charter rates sag and the dollar weakens. Export companies have lost up to 20 per cent in revenue due to the weak dollar, analysts estimate. Domestic factors such as uncertainty over membership in the European Community (EC) and a slower than expected recovery in the economy have also taken their toll on sentiment. This holds true to a lesser extent for bank and insurance shares, whose poor performance this year can be attributed to the successive years of major losses and a general lack of confidence in the country's banking system. However, analysts believe that banks have seen the worst. The failure of Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, to create a Scandinavian insurance giant with Sweden's Skandia in an alliance involving Danish and Finnish insurers, has led to unrest in the market. Uni's undesirable Skandia situation - a 28 per cent stake worth NKr4bn (Pounds 673m), achieving nothing - is inhibiting the company's own domestic equity investment, which in turn has sapped liquidity from the market. Uni's 'A' shares, too, have been trading about 50 per cent lower at NKr25 since the end of last year. Norway's domestic strength, in North Sea oil and metals, is producing cautious optimism, at best, for the second half. The country is Europe's biggest oil producer, alongside Britain, with crude output of about 2.1m barrels a day, but it is also a large exporter of light metals. It is no surprise, therefore, that the economy's health depends on oil prices and the dollar. The caution is demonstrated by Statoil, the state oil company, which has mounted yet another cost-cutting campaign in which it aims to trim NKr2bn from operational budgets in an effort to withstand low crude oil prices. However, Mr Tom Skjaerstad, a broker with the Oslo-based Norse Securities, believes that the market has bottomed out and that there is hope for recovery in the second half. 'Oil prices have firmed at around Dollars 20 to Dollars 21 a barrel, our political climate is stable and there exists a commitment internationally to support the dollar,' he says. On shipping, Mr Skjaerstad thinks rates for VLCCs (very large crude carriers) will firm in August and September, and that scrapping of old tonnage will continue. Mr Tormodd Andreassen, managing director of Alfred Berg Securities in Oslo, dismisses the market's performance in the first half of 1992 as dismal but sees only gradual recovery in the second half. 'Financial consolidation in Norway has come a long way and this implies that consumption will pick up, leading to recovery,' he says. 'There will be some improvement - maybe even more improvement than in other countries - but there will be no really solid gains in the capital markets, unless the dollar strengthens considerably and German rates come down.' Mr Andreassen adds that, this autumn, three outstanding political issues will affect the market: Parliament is meant to ratify the European Economic Area agreement, linking the EC and Efta, in which Norway is a member; an application to join the EC will also be decided by the government; and in October an 'election budget' will be presented.</p>

Their discussion, entitled  "Okinawa in the Asia-Pacific Era," lasted 90 minutes.    Due to Tsukushi's popularity as a newscaster, there were  many  young people in the audience. The theater was filled to near  capacity with an audience of 1,200 on hand.    The discussion, moderated by Tsukushi, covered a wide range  of topics, including those entitled "The Power of Okinawan  Culture, Which Retained Its Identity Under U.S. Military Rule,"  "Internationalization Based on a Distinct Culture," and  "Japanization and Okinawa's Identity."    Tsukushi said: "In prefectures which seek social and  economic  vitalization, the people have fears and concerns about local  depopulation due to a decreasing population. The average income  in Okinawa is the lowest of any in the nation, but its  population has continued to increase since the end of World War  II. This, in effect, is Okinawa's answer to such concerns.  Okinawan society shall serve as a model for the society that  Japan is seeking to become."    Regarding the policy of peace which the prefectural  government advocates, Governor Ota said: "To keep Okinawa's war  experiences from becoming a thing of the past is a difficult but  important task. We hope to accomplish this task and to continue  to move forward."    [Tsukushi] Although internationalization is widely  advocated,  there are, on the other hand, many cases in which exchange  students coming to Japan from other Asian countries develop  anti-Japanese attitudes. However, for Okinawa, where there are  1,400 exchange students, it is said that a majority of them  return home with a good impression of the prefecture.    [Ota] I feel that this is because Okinawa and those  countries  have similar climates, living conditions, and cultures, in  addition to similarities in terms of their historical  backgrounds. Many Asian countries have experienced periods of  rule by powerful Western nations, during which the peoples did  not even have control over their destinies or living conditions.  Although Okinawa did not come under colonial rule, I feel that  Okinawa and Asian countries are connected by common cultural  roots as oppressed peoples.    [Tsukushi] As for the current frictions between Japan and  the  United States, if Japan stressed its distinct uniqueness, the  United States would try to undermine it by claiming that Japan  is a "heterogeneous" country. Japan advocates the concept of  internationalization, but the Japanese tend to group together  among themselves, as can be seen in their conventional use of  the term "gaijin" [foreigner]. On the other hand, I have the  impression that Okinawans are more open psychologically.    [Ota] Asia is a multiethnic region with different religions  and languages, but there are many things about Japan concerning  a tendency to exclude alien cultures. During the days when it  was a kingdom, Okinawa got along well for a long time with other  countries, frequently coming in contact with "alien" cultures  and accepting them.    [Tsukushi] There is a mistaken notion that being able to  speak English fluently is equivalent to becoming  internationalized. Even now, some people in mainland Japan have  the gross misunderstanding that the Okinawan people speak  English. There seem to be few Okinawans who have really  mastered English. Here there seems to be a more open culture in  which speaking English does not necessarily mean that one has  become internationalized.    [Ota] There are many U.S. military personnel stationed on  Okinawa, but exchanges cannot be conducted easily because they  are confined inside chain-link fences. Moreover, the Americans  ruled the Okinawans after the end of World War II. Therefore,  even though Americans and Okinawans live in the same land,  exchanges between the peoples have been impossible because of  their relationship as rulers and the ruled. Exchanges truly can  be carried out only on the basis of a relationship between equal  partners.    [Tsukushi] When discussing the English language, there is  the argument that English-language imperialism invades other  cultures. Great Britain, which indirectly controlled India,  trained a handful of local rulers who could speak English  exactly like Englishmen. Although the United States came into  Okinawa bringing all its military, political, economic, and  cultural power, Okinawa did not turn out to be like India. When  we think of the reasons for this, I believe that it was the  power of Okinawan culture that helped it withstand the  circumstances.    [Ota] The museum built in Shuri by the U.S. military  symbolizes a U.S. policy which was aimed at alienating Okinawa  from Japan. The United States asserted that "because the  Okinawans developed such a fine culture in the days of the  Ryukyuan Kingdom, they do not have to rely on the Japanese." At  the time, there was a deep-rooted reaction among the Okinawans  against such a U.S. policy, even though they were burdened with  the problem of not being able to become economically  self-sufficient.    [Tsukushi] The United States poured funds, called the high  commissioner's funds -- which can be likened to funds set up by  Mito Komon [popular name for Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandson and the  second daimyo (1661-90) of the Mito domain, Tokugawa Mitsukuni,  who invited Japanese and Chinese scholars to compile the  History of Great Japan] -- into local districts to  send over 1,000 Ryukyuan exchange students to the United States.  However, they did not necessarily all end up having  pro-American sentiments.    [Ota] The United States did intend to foster pro-American  local nationals via the exchange student system. However, the  pursuit of knowledge is immeasurably deep. The more a student  devotes himself to it, the more he learns what human beings are  all about. Eventually, he realizes how outrageous military rule  is.    [Tsukushi] By getting an education in the United States, a  student realizes the abnormal situation on Okinawa. This is so  ironic. By the way, I feel that nowadays, young Okinawans are  properly reexamining their identity, which is deep-rooted in  their culture. With 20 years having passed since the reversion  of Okinawa to Japan, they have gained confidence about what they  are. I feel that this is a very healthy and wonderful thing.  <H5>  Asia Music Pageant in Okinawa '94 </H5>   [Tsukushi] I believe that the general theme of this musical  event is related to people's identities. This is a chance for  people to get in contact with other people--something like a  contest--to try to confirm one's own identity in the process of  mutual association. Otherwise, one shall end up indulging in  self-complacency. I feel that it is important to educate people  about what happened to Okinawa and what occurred there,  historically speaking. There should be more opportunity for  cultural exchanges and to hold discussions about peace. Frankly  speaking, I feel annoyed when I visit the war memorial site at  Mabuni-no-Oka. There, memorial engravings list war victims  separately, according to their home prefectures. Mr. Ota, it  seems that the prefectural government plans to construct a  monument listing all victims who died during the Battle of  Okinawa, regardless of where they hail from.    [Ota] I have visited India, Thailand, Burma, and recently  Singapore. What I noticed in all these countries is that the  young people there are proud about building their countries.  They have great passion. It was overwhelming. However, this  seems to be quite lacking among young people in Okinawa. As for  peace, it is important for young Okinawans to learn properly  about the circumstances under which their parents, brothers and  sisters, and grandparents were forced into inhumane conditions.  Whether you win or lose, war results in more and more people  being hurt. We would like to build the "Peace Monument" to  convey the message that war is meaningless.    [Tsukushi] I take it that the names of war victims from  mainland Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and Korea are all to be  engraved on this monument. Am I correct about that?    [Ota] Yes, and I think there will be over 200,000 names  engraved on it.    [Tsukushi] I have also heard that some interesting incidents  have come to light. These should also contribute to preventing  Okinawa's war experiences from becoming a thing of the past.    [Ota] So far, war survivors have reported to the prefectural  government's War Victims Relief Division the sacrifices they  made in supporting the nation's military cause. If we look at  the actual situation during the Battle of Okinawa, there were  some people who were critical of the nation's war policy. Some  of them were executed because they refused to turn over their  important food supplies to the military. Therefore, with this  project, the prefectural government has been trying to carry out  investigations to include all victims from babies to the elderly.    [Tsukushi] In some cases, whole families were killed, and  then there is no one left to report such cases.    [Ota] Many died together with their relatives and with  entire  family clans.    [Tsukushi] In another way, Okinawa carries with it the  image of an island of military bases.    [Ota] The concept of peace is at the very foundation of  Okinawan culture. From the days of the Ryukyuan king, Sho Shin,  the Okinawan people were forbidden to carry weapons. After the  Satsuma [of present-day Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu] invaded  the Ryukyus in 1609, the ban on carrying weapons was enforced  even more strictly. As a result, the Okinawans learned the  martial art of karate to protect themselves. All these things  have permeated the Okinawan way of life. Okinawans have  maintained peace by establishing relations of mutual reliance  with neighboring countries.    [Tsukushi] For the Okinawan people, the ground warfare--the  so-called "typhoon of steel" [in World War II]--certainly took a  very heavy toll. Incidentally, however, possibly greater damage  has been done to Okinawa's natural environment since Okinawa's  reversion to Japan in 1972 than during that period of ground  warfare.    [Ota] The U.S. military has taken over Okinawans' precious  farmland to use for military bases. Even very fertile parcels  have all been taken away. Among other towns, Kadena has 83  percent of its total area taken up by military bases, with over  10,000 local residents being forced to live on the remaining 13  percent [percentages as published]. They have no other choice.  The prefectural government, for its part, seeks to get rid of  military bases to protect the natural environment. This is a  very difficult issue, but we hope to try not to destroy the  environment.</p>

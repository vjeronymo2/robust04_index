			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Mitsui Shipbuilding plan MITSUI Engineering and Shipbuilding, the leading Japanese shipbuilder and part of the Mitsui group, plans to double capital spending in its shipbuilding business to Y6bn (Dollars 47.5m) in fiscal 1992, Kyodo reports from Tokyo. It initially planned to invest Y10bn in plant and shipbuilding equipment during a five-year period beginning in fiscal year 1989. The shipbuilding business has since come out of a slump, and with many new orders on its books, Mitsui Engineering has decided to boost investment in 1992. The company plans to improve the efficiency of its shipbuilding operations by spending about Y2bn to modernise a painting plant. The improvements are aimed at expanding the facility's capacity, allowing construction of more double-hull tankers, which are in greater demand due to increasing concerns about marine pollution from oil spills.</p>

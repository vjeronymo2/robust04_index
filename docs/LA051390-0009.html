			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BACHELOR GIRLS BY WENDY WASSERSTEIN (ALFRED A. KNOPF:  $16.95; 209 PP.)  </P> <P> Playwright Wendy Wasserstein (author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Heidi  Chronicles," among other plays) practices a mordant style of humorous feminist  essay which broadens the category familiar from columnists like Cynthia Heimel  and Alice Kahn. Wasserstein's "Bachelor Girls" are not just women caught  between post-puberty and middle-aged Angst; they are sisters doing battle with  the woman's lot in life from from Day 1 to death.  </P> <P> Not that Wasserstein ignores the complexities of the twenty-somethings to  forty-somethings. Her piece on "The World's Worst Boyfriends" acknowledges the  woes of women whose fate it is to live in a time when People magazine can run  an article on "the three available, sensitive, attractive men." But the  anxieties of weight she lampoons in "To Live and Diet" begin early and last  into old age. Even as a slender 8-year-old, she recalls, she and her friends  were aspiring to the three "perfect diamonds" as the legs were pressed  straight: between ankles, knees and upper thighs. "As I ramble through life,  whatever be my goal," she observes, "I will unfortunately always keep my eye  upon the doughnut and not upon the whole." Sonja Bolle  </P></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Virtue's modest reward Financial markets have been caught in a vicious circle all year from which they may just be escaping. So far, 1994 has been characterised by a tumbling dollar and falling US bond prices, leading scared Japanese investors to sell dollar assets so making matters even worse. European markets have had limited success decoupling from the US. But yesterday the dollar poked its head above the Y100 level, building on a rally that has lasted a month. The yield on the long US Treasury bond also dipped below 8 per cent and there is talk of Japanese investors once again buying dollar bonds. The change in mood is modest but real. Investors, who previously thought the US Federal Reserve was not taking tough enough action to pre-empt inflation, have been impressed by last month's 75 basis-point rise in short-term interest rates. Recent weeks have seen a pronounced flattening of the yield curve, implying that the market expects further rate rises from the Fed and thinks they will keep inflation at acceptable levels. If this tentative mood change is sustained, the year's vicious circle could be replaced by a virtuous one, in which a stronger dollar encourages Japanese investors to buy dollar assets which in turn provide more support for the currency. The market's reaction to yesterday's employment data shows its willingness to look on the bright side. Non-farm employment rose faster than expected in November, which could have been seen as inflationary. But comment focused on the falls in hourly earnings and the average working week. Inflation will undoubtedly pick up in the US. But 8 per cent bond yields already discount quite a lot on that front.</p>

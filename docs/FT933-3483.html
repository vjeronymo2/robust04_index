			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Oil exploration licences granted THE GOVERNMENT has awarded five new on-shore petroleum exploration licences in locations ranging from the Yorkshire region to an area between the North and South Downs in Surrey and Sussex. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the award of the licences to Eukan Energy Limited and Altwood Petroleum was made outside the formal licensing rounds for exploration acreage. It was the first use of the 'out-of-round procedure', under which companies can apply to the government for acreage in areas where they believe early exploration for oil and gas is merited. 'The use of the out-of-round procedure in this case is another example of the flexibility of our licensing system,' Mr Eggar said. The five licences are in the following areas: Yorkshire, north-east of Sheffield. the Staffordshire/Cheshire border north-east of Stoke-on-Trent. the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border north-west of Nottingham. Surrey and Sussex between the North and South Downs. All of the licences are on private land. The companies will need planning permission and the owners' consent before they can begin seismic testing and exploratory drilling. A separate government appraisal licence would be required if any oil or gas is discovered. In another move intended to demonstrate flexibility in on-shore oil and gas exploration, the government allowed Tullow Exploration temporarily to extend its seismic work 1km beyond the boundaries of two licences it holds in Lincolnshire. Mr Eggar said the award of the new type of seismic survey licence was 'a clear demonstration of our commitment to support oil and gas companies through a flexible licensing system'. The licence awarded yesterday does not allow any drilling and only covers areas adjacent to a principal licence. It will last for one year.</p>

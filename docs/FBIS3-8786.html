Refugees were given shelter by as many as 111 countries  and the largest refugee groups of 10,000 people are accommodated  in Germany, Turkey, France, and Austria. Arif Smajkic, minister  of refugees, labor, and social welfare in the Government of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, presented the data at the press  conference held yesterday at the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  "The figure of 680,000 refugees does not include refugees from  Bosnia-Herzegovina accommodated in Croatia. Exact information  about the number of Bosnia-Herzegovinan citizens that are still  in Croatia has not yet been gathered. About 70 percent of the  total number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina are Muslims,  there are less Croats, and a large number of Serbs found shelter  in refugee camps in Western countries," said Smajkic.    Before coming to Zagreb, where he will talk to Minister Ivan  Parac and Adalbert Rebic, Minister Smajkic visited many Western  European countries and learnt about the status of refugees and  workers staying in those countries. "The accommodation, status,  and care of refugees in host countries is satisfactory," said  Smajkic. Furthermore, he said that he met with representatives  of international humanitarian organizations in Geneva and that  they presented many programs for the return of refugees. Before  the end of April, the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina will  propose several models for the return of refugees, and it can be  expected that Bosnia-Herzegovinan citizens will soon start  returning to their homes.    Smajkic said that most refugees accommodated in Western  countries have welcomed the Croat-Muslim Washington agreement.  People will most probably first be able to go back to  Herzegovina and central Bosnia, and their return will be  financed by their host countries, international humanitarian  organizations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, and various funds. Wounded people, medical  workers, engineers, and technicians, i.e., professional people  important for the rebuilding of the country, will go back first.  Large groups of refugees will go back only after accommodation  and jobs have been secured for them.    Yesterday, Minister Smajkic visited the "Kruge" refugee  center in Zagreb in which, as he said, living conditions,  especially hygiene conditions, are satisfactory.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission for </F> Prohibition of Chemical Weapons To Convene in The Hague"]    [Text] The Preparatory Commission for the Organisation for  the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will hold its seventh  plenary session from 27 June to 1 July in The Hague. It is  expected to be attended by a majority of the representatives of  the 157 states which have signed the Convention on Chemical  Weapons. The session will be chaired by Ambassador Grigoriy  Berdenikov of the Russian Federation. The Convention on  Chemical Weapons, opened to signature on 13 January 1993 and  signed by 157 states, will enter into force 180 days after the  date of deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification, but in  no case earlier than two years after its opening for signature.  Eight countries have ratified the convention so far. As soon  as it enters into force, the convention will be applied by the  OPCW. All major decisions are taken in its plenary sessions,  and work is prepared in the Preparatory Commission or working  groups and expert groups. On 27 June, Mr Ian Kenyon, Executive  Secretary of the Preparatory Commission, will present a report  reviewing developments and issues since the sixth plenary  session in mid-April. Questions to be examined include the  organisations' budget and programme, training of inspectors,  confidentiality policy, inspection procedures for chemical  weapons facilities including equipment and sampling and so on.  The new president for the period August 1994 to February 1995  will be elected from one of the Latin American signatory states.  The Convention on Chemical Weapons prohibits all development,  production, acquisition, retention, stockpiling, transfer and  use of chemical weapons. Signatory states are obliged to  destroy their chemical weapons and chemical weapons production  facilities as well as any chemical weapons they may have  abandoned on another state's territory. Implementation of the  convention will be verified through reporting requirements,  on-site inspections and short-notice challenge inspections. The  civilian chemical industry will also have to comply with  obligations regarding the production, processing or consumption  of chemicals that are considered relevant to the objectives of  the convention.</p>

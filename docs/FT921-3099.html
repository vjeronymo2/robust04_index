			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Hard-headed Italian bank sets the pace: Haig Simonian reports on San Paolo's flotation today and its plans for tomorrow With around L250,000bn (Pounds 116bn) in total group assets, 800 domestic branches and a significant presence abroad, San Paolo bank does not fit the description of a typical Italian public sector bank. It is far from undersized and not over-dependent on its home market. After today's L1,525bn flotation of 20 per cent of its shares, San Paolo will stand out even more from the pack. One of Italy's more dynamic and better-run financial institutions, its decision to go public marks a high point for the bank and the biggest leap so far in Italy's 18-month-old bank liberalisation process. Under the 1990 Amato law, public sector banks received the green light to become joint stock companies and float up to 49 per cent of their shares. San Paolo is only the second Italian bank to take advantage of the change, but the flotation dwarfs the L400bn raised by Banco di Napoli last November. Today's issue will be Italy's biggest initial public share offering, and the second-largest capital raising on the bourse after last year's L1,750bn rights issue by the Generali insurance group. Some analysts have complained that the L12,200 price tag on San Paolo's new shares is dear compared with other quoted Italian banks. The issue price puts San Paolo's price-earnings ratio at around 11 - above those of Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), two big, well-regarded public sector banks which are already partly quoted. Mr Gianni Zandano, San Paolo chairman, disagrees. 'We think the pricing is competitive,' he says. The price/earnings ratio for Credito Italiano and BCI is distorted by the special five-year tax breaks they gained after buying out loss-making public-sector companies in the late 1980s, which reduced their tax levels to between 25 per cent and 31 per cent, compared with 42 per cent for San Paolo. Many bankers suggest the best comparison for San Paolo is not with a top public sector bank, but with Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private sector financial institution, which trades on a p/e of around 13. Ambroveneto is also a model of independence from politicians. To emphasise its autonomy, San Paolo will shortly announce the appointment of three leading private sector businessmen, including Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, head of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group, to the board of its banking operation. Freedom from political influences should allow the bank to continue its hard-headed business practices, which have seen net earnings, restated for the revaluations involved in the restructuring process, reach L540bn last year. Profits should rise by around 10 per cent in 1992, and the bank has already indicated it will pay a dividend of at least L400 a share for 1991 - its first year as a joint stock company. Earnings will also gain from tougher cost control. Mr Zandano says the 21 per cent surge in staff costs last year on account of a new three-year wage contract and a sharp increase in pension fund payments was an exception. A string of foreign and domestic acquisitions over the past two years has prepared San Paolo better than Italy's other big banks for the freer competition in European banking in the 1990s. It now has the biggest network of any foreign bank in France, with 45 branches, and operates almost 135 branches in Spain through stakes in two domestic banks. The group has also taken smaller holdings in other foreign banks. San Paolo is the biggest shareholder in Hambros, the UK merchant bank, with just over 14 per cent. But San Paolo's biggest expansion has come at home. Last September, it paid L2,100bn for 50 per cent of Crediop, the big Rome-based medium and long-term lending institution, taking its stake to 90 per cent. Crediop completed San Paolo's structure as a full-service bank. Commercial banks are forbidden under Italian law from making medium to long-term loans to industry, which is reserved for specialist institutions. 'Buying Crediop means nothing important is now missing for the group,' says Mr Zandano. San Paolo is now entering a consolidation phase, says Mr Zan- dano. Though takeover opportunities will not be overlooked, the stress is now on organic growth. Tying Crediop more closely with the San Paolo group will allow it to extend its activities beyond traditional big corporate clients to medium and smaller-sized companies. The group will also continue to build up its branch network to strengthen its deposit base. The slowdown in Italy's traditionally high private savings rate at a time of high lending has forced San Paolo to turn increasingly to relatively expensive interbank finance to bridge the funding gap, affecting earnings in 1991. This year, it has decided to limit lending to the rate of deposit growth. 'It's a complete policy shift. Now our most important variable will be deposits,' says Mr Zandano. The bank's concentration in Italy's wealthy north, especially means it already has a strong geographical advantage. San Paolo has an uncontested position in its native Piedmont, while it is strongly represented in neighbouring Lombardy, the country's industrial powerhouse, through two big regional subsidiaries, Como-based Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda, headquartered in Bergamo, which have also been opening new branches. The rest of the bank's cash from the flotation will go towards rebuilding liquidity, depleted after the Crediop purchase. Large cash balances should also boost this year's profits given the huge spread the bank can make between the 4 per cent its new equity will cost in terms of dividends and the 12 per cent or more to be made on the money markets. San Paolo's cash balances will balloon further once it floats part of its Crediop stake, probably next year, leaving it with a bare majority of the shares. 'It's not our business to keep money tied up which could be used better elsewhere,' says Mr Zandano.</p>

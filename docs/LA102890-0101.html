			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAME-ENDING BRAWL SPOILS BOWDEN'S 200TH  </P> <P> What happened after the game seemed to bother the coaches more than what  transpired during No. 12 Florida State's 42-3 thumping of Louisiana State on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Florida State's Bobby Bowden had the joy of his 200th coaching victory tempered  by a game-ending brawl.  </P> <P> "It's a shame what happened at the end," Bowden said. "It shouldn't have  happened."  </P> <P> Bowden and LSU Coach Mike Archer were unsure what happened after Florida State  linebacker Kirk Carruthers was whistled for a late hit on the game's final  play.  </P> <P> "I just ran out there to try and break it up," Archer said. "It was a good hard  football game until that point."  </P> <P> The brawl required coaches and stadium authorities to separate the players and  Archer declined the roughness penalty to avoid another confrontation.  </P> <P> Florida State linebacker Marvin Jones required stitches near his right eye from  an injury suffered in the melee.  </P> <P> "They finally got an opportunity to take something out and they went for it,"  said Carruthers, who, despite drawing the penalty, blamed the fight on LSU  players.  </P> <P> LSU (4-3) had five turnovers, three leading to Florida State touchdowns in the  first half as the Seminoles rolled up a 28-3 cushion.  </P> <P> "Everything that could have gone wrong, did," Archer said. "You saw all that  today."  </P> <P> Bowden said, "The defense played doggone well. They set up our offense time and  again."  </P> <P> Carl Simpson recovered two fumbles by LSU quarterback Chad Loup that set up a  pair of touchdowns and Terrell Buckley's recovery of a fumble on the game's  first play jump-started the runaway for Florida State (5-2).  </P> <P> "I felt like we had to get ahead and then we fumble the kickoff," Archer said.  </P> <P> Bowden, 61 next month, is the 11th major-college coach to win 200 games. Penn  State's Joe Paterno, with 224, is the only active Division I coach with more  victories.  </P></p>

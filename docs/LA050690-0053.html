			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SMASH-MOUTH PEST CONTROL' METHOD TO ERADICATE MEDFLIES  </P> <P> William Jordan is right on with his description of "Smash-Mouth Pest Control"  ("Medfly vs.  </P> <P> Macho," Commentary, April 23). I call it "the testosterone solution." If you  don't understand something, kill it, rape it, or spray it in a territorial  frenzy as tomcats do.  </P> <P> I agree with Jordan that women are less inclined to use force. Yet when our  young are threatened we are dangerous indeed. Even the alpha male cannot stand  against us then.  </P> <P> I call for an end to the malathion spraying and the prosecution of those  criminals responsible for upsetting the balance of nature, endangering our  lives, sickening our children and violating our constitutional rights.  </P> <P> MARY G. ST. MARTIN  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

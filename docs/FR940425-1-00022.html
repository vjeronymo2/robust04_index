			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Heat buildup in tires is generally caused by vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overloading, high speed operation, and/or tire underinflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sustained high temperature can cause structural degeneration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the material of the tire and result in reduced tire life or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential catastrophic tire failure. A tire's resistance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature buildup is graded under the UTQGS as ``A'', ``B'', or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``C'', with ``A'' being the best and ``C'' being the minimum standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of performance. Tires of high quality, as a result of superior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design and construction, can be expected to last longer without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure when subjected to sustained high speed operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA tests tires for temperature resistance using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same laboratory test wheel utilized in testing a tire's high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed performance under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FMVSS) No. 109,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New Pneumatic Tires. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The high speed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance test under FMVSS 109 is run at speeds of up to 85  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mph. The temperature resistance test under the UTQGS, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is run at speeds of up to 115 mph. A tire graded ``A'' has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successfully completed the test procedure at a sustained speed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 115 mph on the test wheel. A grade of ``B'' means that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tire has successfully completed the test procedure at speeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 100 mph and 115 mph; and a ``C'' grade indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory completion of the test at speeds exceeding 85 mph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but at or below 100 mph. Of the 2,100 tires graded in 1993, 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent were graded ``C'', 50 percent were graded ``B'', and 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent were graded ``A''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA considers temperature resistance a valid safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern and is unaware of any problems with the ratings. While important from a motor vehicle safety standpoint,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, the significance of temperature resistance is not so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widely understood by consumers as the treadwear and traction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of this fact, and recent interest in a rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance grade, the agency is considering whether a rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance grade could provide equivalent safety information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the temperature resistance grade and thereby negate the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for temperature resistance grading. The issue of a rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance grade arose at the White House Conference on Global  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Climate Change on June 10 and 11, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the White House Conference, a number of measures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce greenhouse gasses were discussed. One of the many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures related to vehicle fuel economy was the increased use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of low rolling resistance tires in the aftermarket. Michelin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented a paper on that issue at a meeting of the Auto and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Light Truck Workshop of the Transportation Working Group of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> White House Conference on Global Climate Change on July 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993. Michelin asserted that the average rolling resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all-season radial original equipment manufacturer (OEM)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tires was 22.6 percent less than that for all-season radial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement tires. Further, if replacement tires had the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rolling resistance as OEM tires, a 4 percent overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement in fuel economy could be realized. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Michelin announced a manufacturing process by which low rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance tires could be produced with no increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflation pressures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the conference, the Administration issued a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report on a series of initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, entitled The Climate Change Action Plan, on October  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19, 1993. Among other things, the Plan calls for reduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plan contains nearly 50 initiatives to accomplish that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal. One of those initiatives calls for DOT, through NHTSA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to issue new rules and test procedures requiring tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to test and label tires relative to their rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This request for comments is part of NHTSA's commitment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Climate Change Action Plan. Because the UTQGS are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to truck tires, NHTSA's Office of Research and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development will, in a separate but related action, work with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> truck tire manufacturers and truck fleet and owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations to promote a voluntary truck tire rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also notes that one of the factors that causes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat generation in tires also causes higher rolling resistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, the friction resulting from a tire's rolling resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the immediate cause of heat generation in the tire. Rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance is measured in a procedure similar to that used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining temperature resistance. The rolling resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test consists of running a tire under load on a laboratory test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheel. The energy consumed in and recovered from running the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tire is measured and the difference is the heat energy lost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is a measure of rolling resistance. The smaller the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference, the more fuel efficient the tire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since rolling resistance and temperature resistance are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related and are measured by similar tests, it is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether any safety benefits would be lost by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituting rolling resistance for temperature resistance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the UTQGS. FMVSS No. 109 would continue to ensure that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tires are capable of operating safely at speeds up to 85 mph,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby establishing a minimum safety threshold. Further, fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency could be expected to generate more interest and be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more easily understood by consumers than temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the UTQGS to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consumers it is intended to assist. However, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that there is a strong relationship between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rolling resistance and fuel consumption. Rolling resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data generated under existing SAE test procedures could be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for quantifying the correlation with fuel consumption. SAE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommended Practices J1269 and J1270 specify rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance measurement procedures for passenger car tires. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency would welcome data that could be used to demonstrate how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in tire rolling resistance values translate into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements in ``real world'' fuel economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Issues for NHTSA Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above, the objective of the UTQGS is to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful, comparative information to consumers that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist them in making informed selections when purchasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger car tires. In addition, the UTQGS should stimulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive forces in the marketplace, resulting in better tire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. By improving the UTQGS, NHTSA believes it can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve those goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is hopeful, therefore, that this notice will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elicit useful comments and suggestions on the UTQGS issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above. NHTSA's major concerns are whether to propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to deal with treadwear grades that are becoming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely high and therefore of diminishing credibility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to propose raising the thresholds for traction grades;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and whether it is more appropriate under the National Traffic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Motor Vehicle Safety Act for the agency to propose adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rolling resistance to the UTQGS as a fourth grading category or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituting it for temperature resistance. NHTSA specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Does the existing system for measuring treadwear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in misleading grades? Why?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Should a new system be developed for establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treadwear grades? What system?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

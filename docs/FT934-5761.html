			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / The city now standing still: Traffic jams are becoming a year-round nightmare for Bangkok's 8m inhabitants It is Monday, 6.30 pm, on the streets of Bangkok. A European businessman in a pinstripe suit with rolled-up trousers wades through 18in of rain and raw sewage, briefcase in one hand, shoes in the other, heading for home. In another flooded road nearby, a pair of Thai schoolgirls are trapped with the family chauffeur in their BMW. The engine is still running in spite of the water, but the traffic ahead is stationary. They left school 3 1/2 hours ago and are only halfway home. A secretary who left work at 5 pm is standing in a crowded, motionless bus. She will not reach her home in the suburbs until 11 pm. An Englishman is forced to abandon a business trip to southern Thailand after missing his flight; it took him more than three hours to reach the airport. His pregnant wife has just spent six hours in a taxi trying, and failing, to keep an appointment. Back in their apartment, she vents her frustration by methodically ripping to shreds a novel set in Thailand entitled A Haunting Smile. This is, to be sure, a particularly bad Monday during the rainy season. But traffic jams, once a source of wry local humour, are becoming a year-round nightmare for the city's 8m inhabitants. Some Thais predict the government will fall because of its failure to reduce congestion in the capital. The effect on society and on family life is profound. Cars have become second homes; middle-class Thais sleep, read books, watch television, make telephone calls and do their homework in the Volvo. Mothers rise before dawn, drag their children out of bed and into the car to beat the rush hour, and feed them breakfast at the school gates. Dinner with friends has become an unwelcome chore. Even the normally aloof royal family has intervened in response to public frustration. King Bhumipol has donated 13m baht (Dollars 500,000) to the traffic police, allowing them to buy more motorcycles and train a 'rapid deployment force' to rush to congested intersections. 'Traffic is getting worse and worse and everybody is moody, be it Thais or foreigners,' said Queen Sirikit in her birthday speech at the palace in August. 'The crisis has reached an unbearable point . . . It's sad to see children leaving home at four o'clock in the morning.' There is, unfortunately, no relief in sight. Successive governments, corrupt or inept and sometimes both, have failed to plan the development of Bangkok or provide any form of urban public transport other than buses and taxis. Property developers building high-rise blocks - which will generate yet more traffic - can flout such regulations as there are with a well-placed bribe. Only 9 per cent of the city's surface area is given over to roads, compared with a typical 25 per cent in the world's other major cities. As Thais become more and more prosperous, an extra 450 new cars jostle on to the streets each day. Thailand is now a bigger market for cars than Australia, and on its way to becoming Toyota's biggest foreign market outside the US. Thai commuters have quickly developed survival tactics to deal with the ordeal of spending six hours a day in their cars. One of the most popular radio stations in Bangkok is 'Jor Sor Roi,' or Radio 100. Drivers with mobile telephones give details of the latest snarl-ups over the air to their fellow victims. The radio station once co-ordinated the helicopter rescue of a woman about to give birth who was trapped in a traffic jam. Physical needs are catered for by the Comfort 100, a Dollars 5 portable toilet available from Esso garages which looks like a plastic petrol container with a funnel; or the Easi Pee, a sort of plastic bag containing liquid-absorbing gel; or, for something more than mere urination, the all-purpose Combi, a bag in a cardboard box. For those in a hurry, gangs of motor cycle taxi-drivers wearing coloured overshirts (for which they have to pay protection money to the police) are clustered at various street corners around the city. They can be seen weaving skilfully with their passengers in and out of the immobile lines of cars. Then there are the mobile offices. Dr Narongchai Akrasanee, head of the General Finance group of companies, uses a modified Volkswagen Transporter, a van fitted with swivelling chairs, a telephone, a facsimile machine, a television, video and compact disc players and a refrigerator. Visitors can hire a similar but slightly less luxurious van from the Regent Hotel for Bt5,000 a day. 'It's mad,' Narongchai says of the traffic. 'It's the major suffering of the people here, and it's making the government very unpopular . . . If we don't have public transportation soon, it will be crazy.' He and his researchers estimate that congestion costs the city's inhabitants nearly Dollars 2bn a year in lost time and fuel. Other estimates run as high as Dollars 6bn. Desperate citizens, encouraged by newspapers, have proposed dozens of improbable schemes to alleviate their plight, including declaring a state of emergency: 'Give a supremo draconian powers,' said one Bangkok Post headline. After years of contemplating and then failing to deliver everything from elevated Skytrains and Skybuses to underground trains, government officials are thinking of moving the capital - or at least their ministries - to a new site further east. One of them even suggested building twin motorways in the Chao Phraya river, which runs through the city centre and remains one of Bangkok's few relatively pleasant spots. Another idea, supported strongly by the police, is to reverse the direction of major one-way streets, although no one is sure why this would make any difference. A further proposal is to ban cars on alternate days on the basis of their licence plate digits; those starting with an odd number would be allowed out on, say, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and those with even numbers on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. But they tried that in the Nigerian capital, Lagos, and all the rich families bought extra cars so they could drive every day of the week. Even if a solution - an underground railway, for instance - is agreed, it would take years to build and the construction work would cause further chaos. In the meantime, Bangkok will continue to suffer. Its people are poisoned daily by the carbon monoxide, lead and toluene spewing from thousands of exhaust pipes. A fifth of the traffic policemen have hearing problems, and many have lung disorders as well. The manic behaviour of Bangkok bus drivers has been explained partly by a study conducted by a local university into the effects of exhaust fumes. According to Professor Thephanom Muangman, dean of the environment and resources faculty at Mahidol University: 'The gases are powerful enough to devastate the central nervous system, brain functions and consciousness,' One can only guess at the psychological impact of the traffic on Bangkok's school pupils. 'Our children's future is being badly affected,' said a letter to the Post from a 'concerned parent' who pleaded with the authorities to do something to return the country to harmony and sanity. 'Hurry up,' the writer said, 'before we all go mad.' The crisis has already had an impact on the capital's culture. A Thai author won a prize this year for a novella called A Family on the Road; the family lives entirely in its car and the book ends with the wife becoming pregnant.</p>

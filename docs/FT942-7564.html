			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Decision on debts gets split reaction - Late payments Public companies will have to state their bill-paying policies in directors' reports, and government departments will have to abide by Confederation of British Industry guidelines on payment. But the government has decided not to introduce legislation to give companies a statutory right to interest on overdue debts because there was 'no clear mandate from the business community'. Unless there is 'a significant improvement within the next two years' the government will review the case for legislation, the white paper says. The decision pleased as many smaller-business lobby groups as it angered. The Federation of Small Businesses, which with the CBI cautioned against legislation, welcomed the move. 'This is a good outcome,' the federation said. 'We had been concerned that large companies would have used a statutory right for their own benefit.' Reports on payment records could 'form the basis of a blacklist - a shame list' that would encourage the bad payers to improve their record. The Forum of Private Business, which represents 21,000 smaller businesses and led the campaign for legislation, said the white paper was 'a charter for cheats'. At any time about Pounds 50bn of overdue debts is outstanding. About Pounds 17bn of that is owed to small and medium-size companies, according to Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank. Many companies will seek to negotiate a price discount in return for paying on time. The white paper recognises the extent of the problem of late payment. Overall consultations had shown there was a narrow margin in favour of legislation 'but there was much concern about the negative impact that it might have on small businesses'. The paper also says the government will work with the business community to develop a proposal for a British standard for prompt pay-ment. It will also make legal changes to streamline and simplify court procedures for debt recovery and review the possibility of increasing the scope of small-claims procedures to cover collection of debts. The government said the 'major need is to bring about a change in business culture and hence shorter payment times' but that the 'public sector must give a lead'.</p>

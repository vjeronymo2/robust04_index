			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SWIMMERS POST MANY BESTS, BUT NO RECORDS  </P> <P> Optimists that they are, organizers of the 1989 U.S. Olympic Festival chose to  begin the 13-days' worth of competition with a song of local note.  </P> <P> "Ooooooook-lahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plain...," blared the  music from tiny speakers at the Oklahoma City Community College pool, venue for  the swimming events Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Yes, well, the Festival was short of both wind and expected records on its  first day. Turns out that the muggy heat (it reached the low 90s at poolside)  and the occasional delays that happen during these meets sapped many a swimmer  of energy. The result: lots of personal bests, but no Festival records.  </P> <P> As meek breezes nudged the assorted banners, 104 of the country's lesser known  swimmers, all 18 or under, assembled for the first day of actual Festival  competition. They were treated to a brand new pool with 81-degree water  temperatures (a tad too warm for competition) and an enthusiastic audience.  </P> <P> The official opening ceremony is scheduled for Friday, but since the majority  of these swimmers will travel to Los Angeles later this month for the national  championships, an early start was granted. The remainder of the 37-sport  competition begins in earnest Saturday.  </P> <P> Fitingly enough, an Oklahoman -- Trip Zedlitz of Oklahoma City -- won the  Festival's first event, the 200-meter individual medley. By the way, his real  name is Alfred Charles Zedlitz. Zedlitz later finished second in the 200-meter  backstroke.  </P> <P> The only multiple winner was Paige Wilson of Athens, Ga., who won both the  200-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.  </P></p>

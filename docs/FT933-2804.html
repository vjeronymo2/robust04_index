			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / A lifebelt for Brazil's urban poor: The street economy is worth Dollars 490bn WALKING along the main commercial thoroughfare of Rio de Janeiro is a daily battle. Pedestrians bump and curse along pavements packed with stalls selling everything from sink plungers and hair grips to video games and computer parts, which in the past three years have transformed the centre of Rio into an enormous bazaar. Much of what is sold looks like junk. But, according to the Inland Revenue (RF), Brazilian streets are paved with gold. A recent RF study found that the informal economy, including prostitution, drugs and illegal gambling, moves around Dollars 490bn a year - more than the country's entire gross domestic product. A nationwide phenomenon, the underground economy is most visible in Rio, which has up to 200,000 stalls (or camelos, as both stalls and stallholders are known) and Sao Paulo, which has an estimated 160,000 - five times the number of shops. Mr Rodrigo Lopes, economic development secretary for Rio, says: 'It is a phenomenon of urban sociology which happens in any big city but here is intensified by misery, recession, lack of welfare and an excessive tax system.' Brazil has the world's biggest income gap between rich and poor, soaring unemployment (Sao Paulo has 1.14m unemployed), a recession which has seen per capita income drop 10 per cent in three years, and a complete absence of any welfare system. Sociologists struggling to explain the lack of social unrest in such a country often seize upon the burgeoning informal economy. Mr Carlos Lessa, professor at Rio's Federal University, says: 'It's a non-institutional lifebelt that society has created to survive.' Mr Marcio dos Santos, selling knives and scissors in his regular spot directly outside a hardware shop on Rua Uruguaiana, is a former florist who lost his job and needed a quick way to support his wife and four children. Now earning Cr200,000 (Dollars 10) a day, he says: 'It's a much better living than I got in the florist's. It's 100 per cent profit.' But it is not always a question of survival. The camelo explosion has thrown up entrepreneurs who run networks of 40 or more stalls, even supplying hot meals to their salesmen. Their wares are often stolen goods or contraband, smuggled high-tech items otherwise unobtainable because of Brazil's strict import laws. Despite its disorganised appearance the camelo business is rigidly controlled, with formal representatives and each stallholder assigned his own territory, for which, in some cases, rent must be paid. When cash-starved local governments, frustrated by the sales tax slipping through their fingers, periodically send in police and tax inspectors, the stallholders often respond with gunfire. Mr Cesar Maia, the new mayor of Rio, says: 'The problem is that urban disorder has become structured and developed a new order.' Rejecting the heavy-handed approach, his administration has developed a four-year strategy working on three fronts. First it is making it easier to obtain licences, allowing people to set up businesses in their homes, previously prohibited, and giving tax exemption for small businesses. At the same time the administration is working with police to locate and seize clandestine deposits of merchandise. It is also moving into areas at night and closing them off so camelos cannot come in. Instead, small markets will be created for a limited number of licensed stalls. By contrast, Sao Paulo has resorted to police action to force stallholders off the streets. In fact camelos are just a fraction of the informal economy. Mr Lessa estimates that 40 per cent of the workforce of Rio is involved in 'non-regulated activities', whether transport, repairs, or running illegal lotteries. Sao Paulo even has a fleet of 2,000 clandestine buses. In the past two years more of the formal economy has stopped paying taxes, partly because of recession but also because of the heavy burden and complicated system. So most businesses run a caixa dois (second cash register) or parallel accounting system, and restaurants and shops rarely give proper receipts. Many camelos belong to shops, selling their wares to avoid sales tax. Mr Paulo Protasio, head of the Rio Chamber of Commerce, says: 'Camelos are just the visible tip of the whole fiscal iceberg. If I pay a salary of Dollars 200, the worker only receives Dollars 70 and the rest goes in taxes and contributions. It is almost impossible to make money legally and we are destroying the formal productive system.'</p>

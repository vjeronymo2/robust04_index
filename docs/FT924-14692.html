			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese congress expected to liberalise grain market THE 14th Chinese Communist Party congress next week is expected to move away from state control of agriculture and endorse the use of free markets in grain, Reuter reports from Beijing. Diplomats and foreign grain traders expect the government to allow farmers to have more freedom over what to grow. It could also give up its monopoly of the grain trade, allowing domestic private traders to conduct business in China for the first time. 'We hear the congress will decide to liberalise the grain trade - decentralise it completely,' one Asian trader said. A Western economist said: 'The farmers could find themselves free to choose what to grow and where to sell it.' The move is expected because recent bumper crops in some provinces have led to tonnes of grain rotting in the open because of inadequate storage, while other areas have had to import because the transport network cannot get the grain where it is needed. The country is expecting this year's harvest of grain - China's main crop - to reach a record 440m tonnes. Farmers have suffered from bumper crops because the state-set price for grain drops, and they have turned away from the crucial grain staples to farm lucrative cash crops, frustrating the national planners. Millions of farmers have also left the land to seek jobs in factories. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun earlier this year called for an end to the government's monopoly on grain purchasing and marketing. He said state control should only be used as an expedient during periods of shortage. Mr Tian proposed setting up more grain wholesale markets nationwide and experimenting with measures on how to make grain supply management market-sensitive. Earlier this year, Guangdong province became the first region to free grain prices from government control. Fujian and Jiangsu provinces have since come close to complete deregulation.</p>

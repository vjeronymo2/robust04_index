			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The Commission of the  European Union has decided to investigate a plan by the French  Government to inject 20 billion francs (3.5 billion dollars)  into the Air France airline, an EU spokesman said on Wednesday  [25 May].    The enquiry is a normal procedure under European treaties to  ensure that state aid does not interfere unfairly with  competition between companies in different countries of the  union.    Air France is in severe financial difficulties. The  Commission recently instructed France to give foreign airlines  access to Orly airport south of Paris, effectively opening the  French domestic market to competition.    Air France, and its domestic subsidiary Air Inter, saw this  as adding to their commercial problems.    The Commission said that it wanted to be sure that aid for  the restructuring of Air France would have the expected effect  on the company and on the whole group and that the size of the  recapitalisation was not disproportinate in relation to the  problem, the spokesman said.    At the beginning of March Air France had put forward a  recapitalisation plan requiring the state to provide 20 billion  francs. Under the plan the company would shed 5,000 jobs  without redundancies. The new capital would be provided in  three portions over three years.    Air France, which made a loss of 8.48 billion francs (1.5  billion dollars) in 1993, has said that it plans to freeze pay  for three years, to reduce the number of airliners it operates  and to reduce its purchasing programme.    The French Government put this plan before the Commission in  March. The Commission, following the standard procedure, has  now decided to open an enquiry to be sure that the aid is  compatible with EU law.    The Commission wanted to be sure that the aid would be the  last to be received by the company and would not be used to  acquire shares in other EU airlines, the Commission said.    The aid must not disrupt the market on routes on which  companies in the Air France group competed with other European  airliners, it said.    The Commission hoped to reach a conclusion before the summer  holidays because it was conscious of the urgency of the case.    The aid could not be paid until the investigation had been  competed, the spokesman said.    The Commission is already probing Air France, under an  enquiry begun in November, in connection with the issue of  shares to raise 1.5 billion francs (265 million dollars) which  were underwritten by the French state-controlled deposit  organisation the Caisse des Depots et Consignations Francaise.    In Paris on Wednesday the government approved a bill which  would enable the state to issue shares in Air France to  employees who agreed that their pay be frozen for three years.</p>

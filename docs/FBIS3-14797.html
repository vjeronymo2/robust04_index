"I welcome the amnesty if it leads to stabilisation of the  political situation in the country", Barannikov was quoted as  saying by his lawyer Dmitriy Matveyenko on Friday.    Matveyenko, however, told TASS that the former minister  understands that an amnesty covers only guilty people and "does  not consider himself to be such a man".    Barannikov is currently staying at home. He was transferred  from prison to hospital because of heart problems and later  released on condition that he stays in moscow.    The lawyer said his client had been already discharged from  hospital and his state of health is satisfactory.</p>

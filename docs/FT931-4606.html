			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure warns of Pounds 1m loss Shares of Tomorrows Leisure fell 4p to 22p yesterday following a warning from the directors that the USM-quoted hotels, golf and leisure centres group would incur a pre-tax loss in excess of Pounds 1m for the year to March. That would compare with profits of Pounds 731,000 (Pounds 860,000) for the previous 12 months and with a deficit of Pounds 110,000 for the opening six months of 1992-93.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Reacting to allegations of false testimony by jailhouse informants in criminal  cases, the state Senate approved a bill that would limit payments to informants  to $50 and require judges to warn juries to be skeptical of their testimony.  The measure, authored by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), is in  response to news accounts of a jailhouse informant who demonstrated that he  could invent a convincing confession.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Under Secretary Kofi Annan from Ghana by </F> Guido Santevecchi in Rome; date not given: "The `Folgore' May  Be Called Upon To Intervene in Bosnian Chaos"]    [Text] Rome -- A tough, frustrating and painful mission has  just come to an end in Somalia, and there is already talk of  committing Italian troops in another nightmarish war scenario,  namely, Bosnia. The United Nations is looking frantically for a  further 10,000 blue berets to be deployed within the next few  days in order to preserve the fragile cease-fire. Until now,  nobody had requested Italian troops, given the rule which  prohibits the United Nations from making use of military  personnel from bordering countries or countries involved in  previous conflicts (such as World War II), but in the face of  desperate need, the British suggested a departure from that  rule. The UN undersecretary for peace missions arrived  yesterday in Rome.    [Santevecchi] Mr. Annan, are you here to take up the offer  of  1,700 soldiers which the government made in 1992?    [Annan] The policy of ruling out bordering countries has not  been changed yet. I have no requests to make, I am not here to  negotiate, but to take part in a convention on UN reforming.  True, the countries already involved in operations in the  former Yugoslavia are saying that they already have done enough.  Unless we find another solution fairly quickly, in the end we  may have to drop that rule which so far has excluded Italy,  Austria, and Turkey. This possibility is being discussed in New  York.    [Santevecchi] It has also been suggested that Italians could  be sent to take over from other forces in hot spots that are not  affected by the prohibition?    [Annan] This would make no sense. Reinforcements are needed  in Bosnia as soon as possible. Consider, for example, replacing  forces deployed in Cyprus, Somalia, or Mozambique, with Italian  troops. It would take too long and, besides, you cannot change  a unit's operational area from one day to the next. At the  most, we could send replacements to Croatia in order to be able  to transfer units which are already incorporated in UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] from Croatia to Bosnia. [Annan ends]    It sounded somewhat strange to discuss the possible  deployment of Italian troops under the UN flag with a man who  was one of the protagonists of last summer's "hot days," when he  asked for, and obtained, the sacking of General Bruno Loi, who  was guilty of having predicted, and stated, that by following a  hard line and giving [Somali General] Aidid no quarter,  Mogadishu would become an uncontrollable battlefield. This, of  course, is exactly what happened. Moreover, today Kofi Ann will  be sitting beside the "rebel" officer, since they will both be  speaking at the meeting organized in Rome by the Disarmament  Archive.    [Santevecchi] Mr. Under Secretary, only yesterday Robert  Oakley, former U.S. envoy to Mogadishu, admitted that "Italy,  with its profound knowledge of Somalia, had understood the  dangers involved in the operation much earlier than the  Americans, who unfortunately only realized this too late."  Oakley also asserted that the United Nations proved to be  incapable of coordinating its efforts with the countries already  involved in field operations.    [Annan] (The Ghanaian diplomat nodded affirmatively, and  then  replied with frankness about the summer crisis between the  United Nations and Italy and the brutality) No doubt some  mistakes were made. Attention has focused too much on Aidid's  personality, and on North Mogadishu. The fact that in the rest  of Somalia the operation was largely successful, and that nobody  is dying of starvation any longer down there, has not been  sufficiently highlighted. But I think the main mistake, on the  part of governments and public opinion alike, was expecting a  rapid solution with no risks involved. In this sense, the  problems we faced in Somalia have helped us clarify our ideas as  regards future peacekeeping operations. As far as Loi is  concerned, his fault lay in voicing his disagreement publicly.  This is not allowed when you are part of an international  force. (So, then, Annan and Loi are still "enemies.")    [Santevecchi] Anarchy and partisan warfare will be resumed  on  a large scale. This is what most experts expect following  Western disengagement.    [Annan] Let me say that in all situations of this kind, the  decisive thrust toward peace can only come from the local people  and their leaders. The international community can only help.  Discussions and negotiations are currently under way in Somalia  among the various chiefs, including Aidid. I believe they now  understand they cannot afford to miss this opportunity. I do  not believe that the 20,000 blue berets that will remain there  (Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese, Zimbabweans) will be subjected  to systematic attacks. I do not rule out the possibility of  skirmishes, banditry, but you will see, the situation will not  return to what it was before the intervention.    [Santevecchi] You seem to be engaged in a permanent quest  for  men and resources, a sort of door-to-door begging to obtain a  few hundred blue berets. How can this be changed?    [Annan] Currently we are engaged in negotiations with more  than 50 states with a view to reaching permanent agreements. We  want to know what resources these countries are ready to commit  to the United Nations -- combat units, logistic support, medical  units -- including the timescales and terms of this commitment.  Then we will know what forces we can rely on.    [Santevecchi] Mr. Annan, let us imagine that the "Folgore"  [Division] arrives in the former Yugoslavia. What would you  think if General Loi joined them, perhaps in command of the  troops?    [Annan] (Laughed, then was serious again) It is not UN  policy  to suggest to any country who should command their troops. That  is all.</p>

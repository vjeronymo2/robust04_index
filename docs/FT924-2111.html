			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Teletext games to stimulate audience TECHNIQUES used to raise newspaper circulation, including cash prize games, will be applied to stimulate interest in teletext from the beginning of next year. The first signs of a shake-up in the teletext service on ITV and Channel 4 will come just after midnight on January 1 when Teletext, a company in which Associated Newspapers has a 45 per cent stake, takes over from Oracle. Earlier this year Associated, with partners Philips Electronics and Media Ventures, won the teletext franchise with a bid of Pounds 8.2m a year compared with Oracle's Pounds 6.6m in one of the more obscure tenders for commercial broadcasting licences. They have since bought the right to use the generic name teletext as the name of the service. More than 10m homes have television sets that can receive teletext - the text information service - but only a third of them regularly use it. Papers such as the Daily Mail will carry game cards which will also be available at newsagents. Results of games with prizes of up to Pounds 1,000 a day will be broadcast on Teletext. There will be free games for children and others played using premium rate telephone calls. Sir David English, chairman of Teletext, said: 'We think we can do better than Oracle. We don't think they were very imaginative in either their marketing or their journalism.' It plans to change the balance of its service throughout each 24-hour period, with pages devoted to mothers and children during the afternoon, family entertainment during the evening and more adult- oriented pages late at night. For the first time, there will be a separate news service for each of the 14 ITV regions. The basic news service from the Press Association will be supplemented by journalists from the Mail group, owned by Associated Newspapers, and local correspondents. Sir David said teletext advertisers had signed up at rates 25 per cent to 30 per cent higher than that achieved by Oracle.</p>

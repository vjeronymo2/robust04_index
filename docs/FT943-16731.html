			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Mirror men make news - Directors' transactions Last week, we highlighted the increase in directors' share buying. The market continues to be affected by pressure from overseas as well as other internal markets, but directors continue to search out the silver lining and dealing has continued apace. While the largest acquisitions all were recorded in open offers or new issues, there was an interesting, and topical deal, at the Mirror Group, now the home of The Independent as well. Five directors, including Sir Robert Clark, the non-executive chairman, and chief executive David Montgomery bought stock at prices between 126-134p. The war of the broadsheets continues and there has so far been little change in Mirror Group's shares. Dewhirst Group, the textile company, has featured regularly in this column. Directors started buying last December when the share price was just under 100p. The most recent transaction was by Brian Farrow. He has been on the board for almost one year and this deal, at 135.5p, brings his total holding to more than 200,000 shares. The sale by two directors - including the finance supremo - of RJB Mining was no surprise since a note of their intention to sell following the management buy-out was made when the shares got a quote. RJB Mining is one of the key coal producers bidding for the mines that are being sold off by the government as a part of its privatisation plan. Both directors retain stakes in the company.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                No of Company                Sector  Shares  Value   directors  -------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied London Prop.

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica to go public after major restructuring FINMECCANICA, the Italian engineering group, is to go public, using one of its subsidiaries as a vehicle to obtain a listing on the Milan Stock Exchange, Agencies report from Rome. IRI, the state holding company which owns Finmeccanica, has approved a complex operation to restructure and float the engineering group on the bourse. The plan involves a L1,200bn capital operation which includes issuing L750bn in convertible bonds with warrants for shares in the newly quoted company, IRI said. Under the plan, Finmeccanica will merge with its Sifa unit, whose shares are already quoted. Trading in Sifa stock was suspended pending the announcement. Finmeccanica would hand IRI the 62.3 per cent of Sifa it controls, then Finmeccanica will merge with Sifa, IRI said. The process of merging with a quoted unit is a faster way for Finmeccanica to quote its shares on the market than applying for a listing itself, analysts say. IRI already owns 5.8 per cent of Sifa with the remainder is traded on the open market. Once Sifa has merged with Finmeccanica, it will change its name. Part of the funds generated by the fundraising operation will allow Finmeccanica to comply with an European Community order to repay to the government L615bn plus interest accrued since 1989. The EC ruled that the money, used by Alfa Romeo, the car maker which was at the time owned by Finmeccanica, was an illegal subsidy. Last year Finmeccanica posted a consolidated net profit of about L150bn compared to L119.6bn in 1990. Finmeccanica employs more than 45,000 workers and is expected to report a consolidated net profit of L150bn lire for 1991.</p>

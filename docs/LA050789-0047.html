			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW-RENT CAR THIEVES  </P> <P> I read your feature article called "Car Salesmen Talk of Perils, Precautions,"  by Beverly Beyette (April 21) and noted that one automobile sales manager said,  "If I was going to steal a car, I wouldn't steal a Hyundai. I'd steal a  Mercedes."  </P> <P> According to CCC Information Services of Chicago, a car valuation service, the  top 10 imported cars that were stolen in 1988 included the 1987 Hyundai Excel  and the 1988 Hyundai.  </P> <P> According to the CCC company, thieves target certain models based largely on  demand for the cars and their parts. The top 10 domestic cars stolen in 1988  included the 1980, 1981, and 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.

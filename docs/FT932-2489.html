			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / To each according to his guile: Corruption at all levels of Russian life is impeding the reforms that could sweep it away Visitors flying into Moscow confront a sign when they present their passports for inspection: 'It is forbidden to offer souvenirs or money to officials.' Bribery at airports is just one sign of Russia's endemic corruption gnawing at the government, law enforcement, the armed forces, the banking system, the state-owned media and business. Russia has always been corrupt - from early Tsarist times, when officials' wages comprised nothing but bribes, to the Soviet era, when Communist party functionaries colluded with criminal gangs in a number of ways to exploit the state monopoly over the economy. But today, official corruption and embezzlement of state property are so pervasive that Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi claims it reaches President Boris Yeltsin's entourage and threatens the foundations of the Russian state. Mr Rutskoi said last Friday: 'For 72 years, first the Communist mafia robbed the state, now the democratic mafia does it.' For Ms Ella Pamfilova, the social welfare minister who opposed official privileges in the old Soviet parliament, corruption is the obstacle on which market reforms 'constantly stumble'. In theory, the reforms should sharply reduce opportunities for corruption by removing state controls on prices and the distribution of goods and services. But the short-term picture is different. Corruption could stall the reforms because too many officials have a vested interest in retaining control of assets and economic decision-making. And, in the early days of their implementation, the reforms, including the ambitious privatisation programme, are creating opportunities for corruption. Some politicians fear the extent of corruption could spark a public backlash against change. 'People are developing fully justified discontent which could lead to a rebellion, to the pendulum swinging back to . . . 1937 (the height of Stalin's purges),' warns Mr Yuri Boldyrev, state inspector responsible for rooting out corruption in the Yeltsin administration until he was fired in March - it is widely believed to appease officials whom he was investigating. He may be wrong about a direct political backlash, given the resignation of a sceptical Russian public. But once Russians realise the extent of the role played by corruption in economic mismanagement, their attitude may change. For instance, artificially low domestic prices for energy and other commodities are encouraging entrepreneurs, in league with corrupt officials, to make fortunes from exporting Russia's natural wealth - with little left over for tax authorities. One Russian government estimate suggests budget revenues could increase threefold if export quotas and domestic price controls on energy were removed. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical finance minister, is looking for ways to remove quotas, free energy prices, and devise market mechanisms for transferring funds where they are most needed. It is not clear he will be allowed to succeed because of divisions in the cabinet. In addition, corruption, along with the arbitrary behaviour of the authorities, is discouraging new investment and the emergence of small businesses. Foreign and local businessmen are exposed to demands for bribes from officials who could invent reasons to hold up projects. The banking system, at the core of Russia's efforts to move to a market economy, is also not immune. The central bank, which controls the distribution of large amounts of cheap credits and 90 per cent of bank transfers, is open to corruption, according to its former chairman, Mr Georgy Matiukhin. He says it is possible to bribe 'young female employees with a bottle of French perfume'. Although he did not amplify, the arrest last week of five employees, who worked in the central bank's clearing system, on charges of diverting funds with forged transfer documents, underlines the vulnerability of a paper-based bureaucracy. The reasons and opportunities for corruption are clear. Demoralised officials, impoverished by price liberalisation and unhindered by fears of retribution from a weakened state, are grabbing what they can to secure a comfortable future. 'The poor chinovnik (bureaucrat) . . . is left face to face with the entrepreneur who has large amounts of money to spend,' wrote Mr Yevgeny Savostianov, the deputy chief of the security ministry, as the KGB is now called. 'Only spiritual giants can resist temptation in such conditions,' he said, pleading for better pay and conditions for civil servants. Several officials in charge of privatisation are being investigated for abuses despite a relatively transparent system for the disposal of state property. According to Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, 'crime and corruption are the function of a weak state'. But he argues that rapid progress in privatising large chunks of the state-owned economy will, in time, reduce opportunities for corruption. It is no surprise that the state is described in colloquial Russian as a 'kormushka' - or feeding trough - for corrupt officials. The extent of the illegalities and mismanagement have raised fears that western aid for Russian reforms will simply be wasted. But Mr Mario Blejer, a senior World Bank economist and frequent visitor to the former Soviet Union, says that corruption cannot be an argument for withholding aid. He argues, like many others, that the west can best help by continuing to make large-scale assistance conditional on the reduction of state controls and other economic reforms. The reforms would also help stem capital flight. 'When stable conditions arise for investment in Russia, Russian businessmen will be the first to bring their money back to Russia,' predicts Mr Blejer. Creating the stable economic conditions which would make corruption less attractive means a struggle on three main fronts. One is institutional reform. A second is synchronising the different reform elements, such as liberalisation, demonopolisation and stabilisation. The third is creating a competent government. Some headway is being made in building the institutions and laws needed to combat corruption. Legislation now before parliament defines corruption for the first time - as 'the use of an official position . . . for the illegal gain of material and any other benefits . . . and also the offering of these benefits'. It also requires officials to declare their revenues, place their assets in trust while they are in office, and bans them from simultaneously working for private companies. But institutional reforms will fail if attempted in isolation. Mr Blejer believes two Latin American examples are appropriate to the Russian case. 'Argentina and Mexico were corrupt from top to bottom. But the problem was largely solved by reducing the (bureaucratic) controls that people could exercise on others,' he says. Having taken over the fight against corruption from his vice-president, Mr Yeltsin has yet to demonstrate that he has the political will to tackle the problem. General Aslanbek Aslakhanov, a former police chief who is now the head of parliament's committee for law and order, complains: 'At least in the old days we arrested people. Now you can even read in the newspapers about officials giving away buildings for personal gain and nobody could care less.' Indeed, until now, corruption allegations have been mostly used by politicians to discredit rivals. Mr Nikolai Fyodorov, the former justice minister, wrote in Moscow News last week that, when he told Mr Yeltsin about a deputy prime minister who had 'committed a crime in the United States', the embattled leader had replied: 'Never mind, he's one of ours and he is very energetic.' When forced to choose, Mr Yeltsin has tended to put officials' loyalty to him wabove their ability to deliver decisive policies and clean government. His recent referendum victory gave him a mandate to pursue radical political and economic reforms. But the evidence so far suggests that any success against corruption is likely to be a result of economic improvements rather than a result of legislation and enforcement by the government.</p>

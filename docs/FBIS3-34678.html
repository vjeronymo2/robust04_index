			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 12 Feb (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  has said that U.S. President Clinton's positions toward the  Arabs since the bombardment of Baghdad have been part of a  scheme designed to pulverize the Arab nation and eliminate Islam.    In its editorial today, the paper criticizes the state of  collapse and retreat that has characterized Clinton since he  assumed power in the United States. Facing a host of ethical  and financial scandals, which the U.S. media has drowned him in,  Clinton has kneeled down until his forehead has begun to touch  the ground in order to appease the media and secure their  silence over his scandals, the paper said.    AL-JUMHURIYAH added: Last week, Clinton chose to lie to the  Congress regarding Iraq. This week, he chose Libya with the aim  of inflaming the Congress against the Arabs and Muslims.    It is known that Clinton has asked the Congress to impose  more sanctions on Libya on the pretext that it threatens U.S.  national security. This is the same formula Clinton used last  week claiming that Iraq is trying to rebuild its nuclear weapons.    AL-JUMHURIYAH recalls the U.S. President's comment on  Sarajevo's heinous massacre. He said the United States cannot  unilaterally intervene to end the massacres there. The paper  vehemently assailed the arrogant U.S. position on what the  Bosnian Muslims are facing, noting that Clinton is not ashamed  of admitting that the indifference toward what is taking place  in Bosnia-Herzegovina emanates from the fact that the it is not  a country that produces oil or strategic items.    AL-JUMHURIYAH regrets the fact that human rights issues,  from  the viewpoint of the world's superpower, are based on the  principle of sheer material interests. This demonstrates their  new approach toward implementing a criminal Malthusian policy  based on the mass annihilation of humans. The paper asserted  that these proposals by the White House administration reveal  the criminal nature of the U.S. strategy. This strategy is  based on noninterference in world events depending on two  points: First, whether there is a threat to U.S. national  security; second, whether there are funds and military  capability outside the United States; in other words, others'  resources are used to achieve U.S. objectives.    The paper urges the one billion Muslims, including the 200  million Arabs, to adopt a militant position in order to prevent  the crimes of the new Malthusianism and stop the isolation of  Arab and Muslim countries.</p>

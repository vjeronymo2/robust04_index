			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR WATTS  </P> <P> As a resident of South Los Angeles, I am concerned about the Watts  redevelopment plan.  </P> <P> They shouldn't be doing this, because there might be a lot of people who don't  want to move.  </P> <P> I think that the main thing that should be done to improve this community is  for guys and girls to stop being in gangs. I think the people should get  together and clean the dirty places. I think the other solution is for drug  dealers to stop dealing drugs.  </P> <P> CLAUDIA MAZARIEGOS  </P> <P> Locke High School Student  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

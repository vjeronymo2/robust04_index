			<p>BFN     [Text] Transkei leader Major General Bantu Holomisa says  homeland chief ministers will not be receiving salaries after  June. He was speaking on his campaign trail in the [Orange] Free  State. Gen. Holomisa also said that drastic steps would be taken  after the election to restore law and order in South Africa.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Richard Newton] The general  addressed ANC supporters at (Mothente) at Theunissen and  (Mangaoen) in Bloemfontein today. During the rally he said that  ANC president Mr. Nelson Mandela would become the new paymaster  on the 10th of May. Apart from the axing of salaries for  homeland ministers, he said, the ANC government would also cut  the defense budget. The money saved here would be used to  improve the living standard of blacks. Gen. Holomisa said that  ANC policy after the election would be to restore law and order.  This swould be done by taking drastic steps agaisnt the right  wing and Inkatha.    [Holomisa] You will no longer see the right-wingers having  training camps, or going to the shooting range, or marching  through the streets carrying weapons, or wearing uniforms.  There will be no private armies under the rule of the ANC.    [Newton] The general also said that all weapons being used  for self-defense must be handed over to the new government after  the 27th of this month. He said it was a blessing that the  Goldstone Commission had exposed the generals who were providing  guns to the Inkatha Freedom Party. He added that the pressure  was now on the state president to quell the violence. He also  told prospective farmers that farmers with more than one farm  would have to share with those who want farms. Ninety-three  billion rands had been budgeted by the ANC for housing, he said,  and 23 billion for education. [end recording]</p>

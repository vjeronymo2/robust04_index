			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Sinn Fein leader is barred from US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has barred the latest attempt by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to enter the US. The exclusion was made because of Mr Adams' alleged involvement with the IRA. The White House yesterday confirmed the decision had been taken even though Mr Adams' declared reason for his trip was to explain his peace initiative with Mr John Hume, the leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party. In a letter to New York's departing Democrat mayor Mr David Dinkins, which was published in yesterday's Irish Times, Mr Clinton said: 'Credible evidence exists that Adams remains involved at the highest level devising IRA strategy. . . (he) has still not publicly renounced terrorism.' A US official said Mr Clinton had pledged during his election campaign to consider granting Mr Adams a visa. He added: 'We did consider it, and we decided against it.' Mr Dinkins' office said it believed a visit by Mr Adams would help the peace process. Mr Adams yesterday said the remarks by Mr Clinton were 'black propaganda' based on 'lies concocted by the British'. He insisted he had no involvement in terrorism and added: 'This type of unfounded allegation is used by the British government as a cover for its real intention, which is to prevent any informed debate about its involvement in Irish affairs.'</p>

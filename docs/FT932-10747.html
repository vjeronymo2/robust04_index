			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Generator may halve cost of clean-up SCOTTISHPOWER, the privatised Scottish electricity company, believes it can nearly halve the projected cost of reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide, a main cause of acid rain, from its coal-burning power station at Longannet on the Firth of Forth. It also said yesterday that it was to spend Pounds 24m on equipment which would produce less nitrogen oxide and remove dust from flue gases at the plant. The company is soon to apply for planning permission to install flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment at Longannet. It put the cost 'in excess of Pounds 200m'. This compares with figures of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m quoted in its prospectus for flotation in 1991. ScottishPower intends to use an FGD system called seawater scrubbing instead of the more common system which uses gypsum to remove sulphur from flue gases. Seawater scrubbing has not been used in Britain before, partly because none of the plants where FGD is being installed are on the coast. The company, which yesterday launched its new environmental policy, has to meet standards on emissions set by the government in line with targets laid down by the European Community. In 1990 the government decided that 8,000 MW of UK generating capacity should be fitted with FGD equipment. Yesterday Mr Mike Smith, ScottishPower's chief operating officer with responsibility for environmental issues, said: 'We have pointed out to the government on a number of occasions that it would achieve greater environmental benefit if FGD was applied to more stations in England rather than applied to us.' This is because ScottishPower's plants partly burn Scottish coal, which has a lower sulphur content than other supplies.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WARRANT MEMBERS TO JAM AT CANOGA PARK AIDS BENEFIT  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Mancini's Restaurant in Canoga Park will be served with a  warrant. Two Warrants, to be exact.  </P> <P> At least two members of the popular rock band Warrant are scheduled to play at  a jam session on Valentine's Day. Money raised from the event will go to  organizations representing patients with AIDS and other blood disorders.  </P> <P> Expected to participate are the band's bassist, Jerry Dixon, and guitarist  Erick Turner, fresh from their nationwide tour as the opening act for Motley  Crue. Warrant, which will appear at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on Feb.  20, has recorded chart hits such as "Heaven," and "Down Boys." Other Warrant  members also may play at the benefit.  </P> <P> The appearance of Dixon and Turner has been confirmed by restaurant owner  Dennis Mancini and Jay Nevens, vice president of George Mahoney &amp;  Associates, the consulting firm coordinating the event. A band spokeswoman  would neither confirm nor deny it.  </P> <P> Nancee Lee, an AIDS therapist whose connections with Warrant helped set up the  appearance, said the show will cost $15. Tickets for the show and dinner will  be $40. Lee said organizers hope to attract 300 people and raise at least  $10,000.  </P> <P> "This is life and death for the kids," Lee said.  </P> <P> Specifically, Lee said, the money will go toward the opening of the Bobbie  Andelson Youth Home in the Wilshire District. The home will care for teen-agers  with the AIDS virus, offering school, sports, art, music, and psychological  support services. Because of their virus, the youngsters, many of whom are  runaways, have been unable to find shelter. The building is ready to be  occupied, Lee said, and it needs about $60,000 for operating costs.  </P> <P> Mancini said each night after 9 p.m., his restaurant becomes "Club M," a  dance/rock 'n' roll venue featuring live bands.  </P> <P> "That show," Mancini said, "is going to put my name out there. It's going to  get my club known."  </P> <P>  Members of Warrant will play in a jam session with Doc Lawrence and the  Tracer's, the headline group. Dinner will go from 7 to 9 p.m., with music from  9 p.m. to 1 a.m. The jam session costs $15, with dinner, $40. For information,  call (213) 445-5076.  </P> <P> </P></p>

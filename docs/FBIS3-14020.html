			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir is Part of Pakistan"] </F>   [Text] The people of occupied Kashmir have announced their  decision to celebrate "black day" on India's independence day.  The purpose of this action is abrogate India's claim on occupied  Kashmir. Celebration of the "black day" means that the people of  Kashmir want independence from India. In this context, the All  Jammu and Kashmir Freedom Conference has appealed to everyone to  observe a strike in all of Kashmir. This announcement was  endorsed by all religious, political and militant groups in  Kashmir. The Indian administration is greatly worried by this  announcement to observe a "black day" and has strengthened  security measures. It has increased the number of military and  para-military forces outside important buildings in Srinagar and  other cities and has arrested a large number of Kashmiri leaders  and young people. The freedom fighters are also determined not  to allow observance of India's independence day in occupied  Kashmir. They plan to respond strongly if the Indian military  tries to ruin their plans for observing a strike and  demonstrating. In addition to this effort in occupied Kashmir,  Kashmiris living in capitals and important cities of other  countries will demonstrate against India and demand resolving  the Kashmir issue according to the UN resolutions. The Indian  security forces will use force to foil the "black day" plans,  however, it will not reap any political benefit from it. The  international community knows that Kashmir is a disputed  territory and the people there are fighting against India's  occupation.    The Kashmiris are not alone in their efforts to get rid of  the Indian occupation. Azad Kashmir and Pakistan will observe  solidarity day with Kashmiris on 5 February. The Jamaat-i Islami  had first announced to observe this solidarity day. Later, Nawaz  Sharif, the opposition leader and president of the Muslim  League, appealed for a general strike to show solidarity with  the Kashmiri people. The government also announced to observe  general strike on 5 February to protest India's occupation of  Kashmir and the atrocities it is committing on Kashmiri people.  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto expressed solidarity with the  Kashmiris to the nation in a speech broadcasted on Monday  evening. She said Kashmir is Pakistan's artery and she herself  was going to present the case in the UN Human Rights Commission.  The 5 February strike will prove that Kashmir belongs to an  undivided nation. The prime minister loudly announced in her  speech that Kashmir is a part of Pakistan and is our legacy.  This problem will not be solved until India agrees to a  political solution. Some people believe that Madam Benazir  Bhutto had not said anything new about India, except that her  tone was sterner. It is believed that Pakistan's attitude about  Kashmir has become stricter now.    Whatever the reason, the government has begun to believe now  that the Kashmir issue cannot be resolved by talks with India  and Pakistan must take some effective steps to help the  Kashmiris. The prime minister took the right step by supporting  the solidarity celebration for February. This would make up for  the government's mistake of holding talks at foreign secretaries  level. The cooperation between the government and the people  will help present the Kashmiri issue to the world more  effectively. India will learn that the people of Kashmir and  Pakistan are united against it.  *</p>

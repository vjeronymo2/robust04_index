			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds lead share prices higher again AN INITIALLY sluggish UK stock market slipped back to test the Footsie 3,000 level early yesterday but then renewed its advance to close 16.7 up at a new trading and closing peak of 3,025. Renewed gains in UK government bonds provided the chief impetus for equities, with a squeeze on positions in both stock index futures and blue chip shares driving prices ahead. Corporate developments also worked in the stock market's favour. US regulatory approval for Zofran, its post-operative nausea drug, brought a welcome return of New York buying of Glaxo, which soon rubbed off on to the other pharmaceutical leaders. Weakness of this key sector, which is represented in the core stocks of most large investment funds, has been a significant drag on market confidence this year. The session opened well, with equity strategists at several leading securities houses reaffirming their bullish stance on shares. Few analysts have raised their 1993 forecasts in spite of the upsurge of the past month, and the range of estimates for the Footsie remains 3,150 to 3,500. However, with no lead at first from stock index futures or from gilts, share prices began to wilt. Sedgwick, the insurance broker, called the market for a Pounds 143m rights issue. The FT-SE 100 Index was soon 6.5 off at 3,001.8 although volume was low. The first turn for the better came when the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced what was regarded as a somewhat more helpful report on British Gas than had been feared by some stock market specialists. At first, however, it was only British Gas shares, rather than the broad range of the market, that responded positively to the news. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T's bid for McCaw had disappointed speculators in Vodafone, although the shares remained firm. Equities were moving into the second half of the session before gains at the long end of the bond market reactivated optimism for shares. Falling yields on government bonds have been significant in prompting a reassessment of prospects for the relative return on equities by the end of the year. The running was taken up by stock index futures and it was soon evident that last week's squeeze on share prices, reflecting unwillingness of fund managers to sell while at the same time seeking to buy, had intensified. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, 6.5 up at 3,465.9, also rose to a new peak but the influence of the stock index futures, which is tied to the FT-SE 100 stocks, and of the renewed confidence in pharmaceutical shares, also luminaries of the FT-SE 100 Index, took the interest away from the second line issues. Strong rises in British Gas, Glaxo and Wellcome gave a boost to the Footsie, but the gain of 2.24 in the Dow Industrial Average as New York opened its new session was of little importance for London. Of the 638.4m shares traded through the Seaq network yesterday, the contribution from non-Footsie stocks fell to only around 48 per cent, against some 60 per cent last week. More significantly, retail, or customer, business dipped to Pounds 1.12bn on Monday, compared with recent daily averages of around Pounds 1.5bn - implying that profit-taking had been fairly light.</p>

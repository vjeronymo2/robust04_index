			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in an  editorial today calls for further intensifying ideological  education among the party members and other working people.    To give precedence to the ideological education of the party  members and other working people is a consistent policy of the  Workers' Party of Korea.    The editorial says ideological education is the work to  train  the party members and other working people to be genuine  revolutionaries of Chuche type and arouse them to the  revolutionary struggle and construction work.    Ideological revolution is the pilot of the revolution, the  editorial notes, and goes on:    Ideological front is an acute battlefront in confrontation  with the imperialists.    Today the imperialists are intensifying their anti-socialist  ideological offensive as never before. In order to smash  corrupt bourgeois ideology, morality and way of life and  maintain the purity of socialism it is imperative to fully  prepare the people ideologically.    The ideological revolution is a mighty way of defeating  imperialism and achieving the victory of socialism.    Intensifying ideological education still further is a  decisive guarantee for successfully carrying out the  revolutionary tasks facing our party and revolution.    Only when ideological education is intensified, is it  possible to make the party members and other working people  effect a fresh upswing on all fronts of socialist construction,  breaking through difficulties.    What is important in intensifying ideological education at  present is to make all the party members and other working  people cherish singlehearted loyalty and unite around the party  and the leader as firm as a rock.    The editorial also lays stress on continuously pushing ahead  with the work of firmly arming the party members and other  working people with the Chuche idea and the revolutionary  traditions of our party and on intensifying education in  socialist patriotism among them to infuse them with noble  patriotism of defending the country.    The editorial calls for concentrating efforts on the  education of youth and children, the successor to the revolution  in particular.</p>

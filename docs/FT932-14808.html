			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Ilva outlines restructuring plans ILVA, the Italian steel group controlled by the IRI state holding company, yesterday outlined long-awaited restructuring plans to lower its debts and restore earnings. The news came as Ilva announced a L2,309bn (Dollars 1.46bn) loss for 1992 on sales of L10,087bn, down from L10,923bn the previous year. In 1991, the group lost L504bn after minority interests and after setting aside L411bn in extraordinary gains in a restructuring fund. Net debts rose to L7,583bn last year. Although financial details of the restructuring were not revealed, it is clear the proposals, to be submitted to the European Commission by the end of this month, could prompt a clash with officials and big European steelmakers. Ilva crossed swords with the Commission over two capital increases, amounting to L650bn, authorised by IRI. The opening of a formal procedure by the Commission has been postponed pending details of the restructuring. The plan envisages the creation of a company specialising in flat laminates. Although IRI will be sole shareholder, it will aim gradually to lower its stake below 50 per cent. Other Ilva operations, not deemed to be strategic but which cannot be sold immediately, will be handled directly by IRI.</p>

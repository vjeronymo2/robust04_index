			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Barter proves best for business, Burma style - Conducting trade with one of the world's most closed economies Few business activities are as challenging as trading with Burma. The country is short of foreign exchange, is burdened with foreign debt payment arrears of about Dollars 1bn, and has an official exchange rate that values the local currency, the kyat, at 20 times its black market rate. As if this were not enough, the military junta is regarded with such distaste by western governments because of its dismal human rights record that Burma - one of the world's poorest countries - has largely been denied foreign aid. Corruption is widespread. The Burmese economy, however, has grown by about 5 or 6 per cent a year for the past couple of years; the generals have cautiously liberalised the economy, encouraged border trade with China, welcomed more tourists and courted foreign investors from Thailand, Singapore and further afield. Barter, or countertrade, is playing an important role in this economic revival. Swapping products allows traders to bypass problems caused by the overvalued official kyat, and many Burmese and foreign import-export companies have found themselves reluctantly involved in barter deals. While some government ministries have access to foreign exchange, most private Burmese companies are allowed to pay for imports only with money earned from their exports. Furthermore, private traders must spend a quarter of their export earnings on imports deemed to be essential - such as palm oil - or convert a fifth of their dollars into kyat at the official rate, akin to throwing money down the drain. 'The trading side of things is not in accordance with normal business principles,' said one Burmese partner in a Rangoon trading company. 'There is no way you could make any money out of exporting anything from Burma officially. And the person exporting to Burma has to be prepared to receive strange products and sell them.' One of the most prominent barter arrangements in Burma is the deal between the ministry of forestry and Turnkey Contracts and Consultancy, a Singapore company, for construction of the recently opened International Business Centre, Rangoon's first modern office block. Diplomats in Rangoon say the multi-million dollar prestige project, in which companies such as Sumitomo and Texaco have already provisionally booked space, was paid for in Burmese logs. Asked whether he was paid in cash or trees, Mr Bernard Kwek, managing director of the Singapore company, said 'a bit of each' and described the deal as 'pretty complicated'. But most barter trade involves Burma's 5,000 or so small import-export companies. Many of them have not been established long enough to amass foreign exchange reserves that would allow them to use a letter of credit to pay for imports. In a typical deal a foreign company - often owned by one of the importer's Sino-Burmese relatives living in Hong Kong, Singapore or Bangkok - will send electronic goods, cement, machinery or pharmaceuticals to Burma on a 'consignment' basis - in other words, on credit. The importer then sells the goods for kyat on the free market, uses the kyat to buy local products - rice, beans, pulses, teak or fish - and then exports these commodities, either directly to the foreign party or elsewhere to raise dollars to pay for the original imports. Intense competition to buy limited quantities of Burmese commodities for export has pushed the prices of some Burmese products above their value on the international market. This problem (another way of looking at it is to say that the free-market kyat is undervalued) threatens the profits of both parties to a barter deal. Another complication is that different imports to Burma command different effective exchange rates because some products are more scarce than others. A dollar's worth of palm oil, for instance, sells for about 90 kyat, whereas a dollar's worth of medical drugs can earn 180 kyat. Traders have to know which products are being smuggled in from China and which imports are being bought by government enterprises with kyat at the official rate; in both cases the cost of the goods would undercut imports brought in legally by private companies for barter deals. Burmese businessmen complain that barter trade allows foreigners to make money on both ends of a deal. A Taiwanese company, say, can sell trucks at a profit to Burma, receive payment in logs, and then sell the logs for an additional profit in Taiwan. 'They are smarter businessmen,' complained one Burmese trader. But foreigners can lose money as well. Mr Pat Ferguson, a Scottish trader who has done business in Burma since the army crushed a pro-democracy uprising in 1988, claimed he had not been paid for a shipment of milk powder and palm oil sent to Burma on credit. He has protested to the Burmese trade ministry and the British embassy in Rangoon. 'I'm down Dollars 219,000,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, has expressed the  assessment that there will be a decline in terrorist attacks  from the autonomous areas following the signing of the Cairo  agreement. On the other hand, the number of terrorist attacks  from other areas in the territories will rise. Maj. Gen. Sagi  briefed the members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee today. Our correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports:  [begin recording]    Vismonsky: Twenty-four hours prior to the  beginning of the IDF evacuation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho,  Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF Intelligence Branch,  presented his evaluations regarding the near future to the  members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.  Sagi believes that the number of terrorist attacks within  Israel originating from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the  attacks against settlers inside those areas will significantly  decrease. On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Sagi expressed the  assessment that the level of terrorism will rise in other areas  of the territories where autonomy is not in effect. Sagi  explained to the committee members that the PLO has an interest  in keeping the security situation quiet and will therefore do  everything to reduce the number of attacks in the areas under  its control.    Maj. Gen. Sagi also commented on relations between the PLO  and the rejectionist groups, Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], and the Islamic Jihad. Sagi takes a positive view of  the inclusion of Hamas representatives in the autonomy  institutions as part of PLO efforts to prevent a Palestinian  civil war. Sagi asserted that the PLO will attempt to prevent  the murder of collaborators, noting that this phenomenon cannot  be completely stopped. [end recording]</p>

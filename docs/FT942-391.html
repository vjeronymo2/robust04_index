			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman Pounds 1.1m back in black Sutcliffe Speakman continued its recovery in the second half and for the full year to end-March swung from losses of Pounds 6.56m to profits of Pounds 1.1m pre-tax. All arrears of preference dividends will be paid on July 28 and ordinary dividends are resumed via a proposed 0.5p payment. Earnings per share emerged at 1.51p compared with previous losses of 19.02p. Turnover of continuing activities improved from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 22.6m. The Lancashire-based group is engaged in activated carbon technology and environmental protection systems. There was a further Pounds 839,000 (Pounds 7.72m) from discontinued activities. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the progress made marks the end of a transitional stage in the group's recovery. He will stand down as chairman at the annual meeting in July and be succeeded by Mr Earnest Tyerman, a non-executive member of the board since 1991. Mr Buckley said the balance sheet at end-March showed a significant change brought about by the rights issue and related refinancing agreements in July 1993.</p>

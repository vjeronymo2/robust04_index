			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Vietnam warning to foreign companies on licences Vietnam has said it will fine the growing number of foreign companies that are abusing representative office licences issued by the government. Representative offices are often an investor's first step into Vietnam but their licence only allows marketing and liaison. They are not allowed to receive income in Vietnam. However, an increasing number of foreign investors are using them for trading and carrying out business transactions. Foreign representative offices found violating their charter will be fined Dollars 50,000 and be subjected to surprise inspections by the Ministry of Trade, the government said. A further fine of Dollars 20,000 would be imposed for offices operating beyond expiry of their licence. The Ministry of Trade is responsible for granting licences. They say this happens because the rules applying to representative offices are not in keeping with the present investment climate. 'They were essential in the early years (of foreign investment) when people came to do feasibility studies,' said one US consultant based in Hanoi. 'But now people are actually trying to do business.' Vietnam's chamber of commerce and industry says there are 964 representative offices in the country, with 629 in the southern industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City and the rest in the capital, Hanoi. There are no official estimates of how many foreign companies are breaking the rules but local press reports citing violations have appeared more frequently this year. Most are understood to be small, Asian companies. Many foreign companies, particularly lawyers, sidestep the restrictions by negotiating business contracts in Vietnam but actually sign them and receive fees at branch offices elsewhere in Asia.</p>

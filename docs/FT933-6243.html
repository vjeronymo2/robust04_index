			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: When the taxman pays - David Cohen explains the benefits of PRP, a salary scheme designed to leave employees with extra income IT MIGHT have gone unnoticed by the voters at Christchurch but the government has introduced at least one popular tax measure. More than 1m employees now get tax relief on profit-related pay (PRP) and the numbers look set to grow rapidly. PRP is pay which varies with changes in the profits of the business at which the employee works. If paid under a scheme registered with the Inland Revenue, it is tax-free within certain limits. The tax privileges associated with PRP were introduced in 1987, and the tax-free limits were increased in 1991. For employees getting up to Pounds 20,000 a year, the limit is 20 per cent, while higher earners now have a ceiling of Pounds 4,000. That translates into a maximum tax saving of Pounds 1,600 for a 40 per cent taxpayer, and Pounds 1,000 for a basic rate-payer. The allure of these tax hand-outs has been behind a spectacular increase in the number of companies registering PRP schemes - from 2,049 in December 1991 to 4,904 in June 1993. Over the same period, the number of employees involved has also more than doubled, from 581,000 to 1,179,700. Apart from the rise in the limits, the key factor spurring companies to join the PRP bandwagon has been realising that introducing a scheme need not cause an increase in overheads. Instead of being given PRP in addition to basic salary, employees can be invited to exchange part of their salary for PRP. A properly structured 'salary sacrifice' arrangement should leave both employer and employee better off - with the bill being picked up by the taxman. Suppose, for example, that a company offered 10 per cent PRP in return for an equivalent pay cut. A worker on Pounds 10,000 would switch to Pounds 9,000 basic and Pounds 1,000 PRP. Paying no tax on the latter would mean that although his gross salary was unchanged, he would be Pounds 250 better off in terms of take-home pay. This type of salary swap is often being used instead of a salary increase; it costs the company nothing and gives the employees their rise. Alternatively, if the company wants to be more generous, it can give a partial increase plus PRP. Employees will then be even better off and the package will still have cost less than a full increase with no PRP. However attractive the theory, a salary sacrifice scheme can be implemented only with the consent of the relevant employees. And unless 80 per cent of those eligible to take part - all full-timers with a qualifying period of up to three years' service - agree, the scheme cannot proceed. How should employees react to such an offer? Does it have any risks? Obviously, that will depend on precisely what is offered. A key - if obvious  -point to remember is that the amount of PRP cannot be guaranteed in advance; it all depends on profitability. To allay employee concerns on this score, most companies pay out the bulk of PRP on account during the actual profit period. When the actual profits are computed, employees then get any balance owed. If, on the other hand, it transpires that profits are lower than expected and employees have, therefore, been overpaid, most schemes provide that the company waives its right to be repaid. This is crucial because it puts a guaranteed floor under the PRP. Take again the example of a worker earning Pounds 10,000 and sacrificing 10 per cent of his salary for 10 per cent PRP. Assume that 80 per cent of anticipated PRP is included in his monthly pay packet. Over the year, that will give him Pounds 800 of extra tax-free income. To get it, he has had to sacrifice Pounds 1,000 of taxable income which would have been worth only Pounds 750 net. So, with the promise that the monthly PRP is his for keeps, the employee can be certain that he will be at least Pounds 50 better off even if the company's profits fall below expectations. Most employees who get this degree of re-assurance will, no doubt, be prepared to sign on the dotted line. Before doing so, they ought at least to bear in mind that the reduction in their basic salary could have some negative consequences. In particular, if they belong to a company pension scheme, their entitlement might depend on their basic pay, with additional sums - such as PRP - being excluded from the reckoning. Similarly, if they apply for a mortgage, the offer from the lender is likely to be based on a multiple of salary with no account being taken of PRP. These minor quibbles apart, a well-structured PRP scheme is a must for any company wanting to use taxpayers' money to reward its staff and an opportunity which employees should seize with both hands.

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CLEAN-AIR CRUNCH'  </P> <P> The Times has been in the forefront in its support of a program for clean air,  and in seeking commitment to an effective plan that can enable us to reach the  nationally established ambient air-quality standards for the region (editorial,  "Clean-Air Crunch," Feb. 17). We applaud The Times commitment to this goal, and  we believe that only through a strong public information program can we truly  generate commitment that will be necessary to achieve the path to clean air.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce was disappointed, however, in The  Times characterization of the position of the business community relative to  clean-air objectives. We also are disappointed that an editorial policy which  has so consistently supported commitments to other major social service goals  in the areas of education, health care, housing and care for the homeless,  objects when an organization raises the point that committing available  resources to achieve air-quality goals, can have a serious impact on the  resources available to achieve other much needed regional goals.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce has publicly urged the Southern  California Assn. of Governments and the South Coast Air Quality Management  District to adopt the Clean Air Plan on March 17. We also have requested that  the district make available a full description of what the costs of each  segment of that plan will be over the next 5, 10 and 20 years. We have urged  that the district adopt a resolution of flexibility, which will clarify that  any new concepts brought forth to achieve clean-air objectives will be fully  evaluated and may be substituted for existing elements of the plan, if the new  strategies prove both environmentally sound and cost effective.  </P> <P> We believe that a plan that is estimated to cost $3 billion to $4 billion a  year needs to be fully evaluated and debated by all segments of the community.  However, we understand that a plan must be adopted and implemented.  </P> <P> The proposed air-quality plan is not the singular province of the staff of a  government agency, or even of the air district itself. It is a plan that all  citizens and businesses within the basin must know, understand and be committed  to. Honest debate about proposals that make the plan more reasonable, more  flexible and more effective is the least those of us who live and work here  should expect.  </P> <P> RAY REMY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST SAY 'YES'?  </P> <P> Lee Dembart's review of Ronald Siegel's book, "Intoxication," (Book Review,  July 23), while well intentioned, misstates the major point. Never in the book  did Siegel describe marijuana, cocaine or LSD as safe or "healthy and natural."  He clearly states that these drugs, while appealing to a section of society,  are potentially dangerous. In fact, he argues that such accepted drugs as  caffeine are unsafe. Siegel's premise is that we have a clearly documented  "fourth drive" for intoxication. But Dembart ignores Siegel's solution to the  problem of unsafe drugs and the natural drive to pursue them. Siegel's answer  is to change the pattern of usage and create "perfectly safe drugs." He  believes that the war against these drugs must go on, but that substitutes  should be created for them that can be used safely, without dysfunction to the  individual or society.  </P> <P> Siegel is not trying to return to the past, to the ideas of the '60s, as  Dembart alludes. Rather, he is looking into the future and addressing an issue  that only promises to become a continual and growing problem, unless it is  looked at from a new perspective. It is obvious that although the war on drugs  is necessary, it is not solving our nation's drug problem. As one drug becomes  unfashionable or suppressed, it is replaced with another. Why not replace it  with one that is safe to ourselves and to society?  </P> <P> BETHANY MUHL  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

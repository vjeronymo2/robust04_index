			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ENVOY LEAVES KUWAIT;  </P> <P> SUBSISTED ON TUNA FISH FOR MONTHS  </P> <P> A final evacuation flight landed in Germany today carrying the U.S. ambassador  to Kuwait and his staff, who survived a 110-day Iraqi siege of their embassy by  living on tuna fish and drinking water from a swimming pool.  </P> <P> Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, his deputy chief of mission, Barbara Bodine, and  three other American diplomats in Kuwait left their embassy early today and  flew to Baghdad and then Frankfurt aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane,  which also carried 25 other Americans.  </P> <P> While Iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage release announced  one week ago, the White House and Baghdad exchanged angry accusations today  over the dates of proposed high-level talks. But both stopped short of calling  off the peace effort, which is seen as the last chance of averting war in the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Iraq had still not offered  acceptable dates for the talks and did not seem to be taking the U.S. peace bid  seriously.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry denounced Washington for rejecting its  proposed date of Jan. 12 for Baker to visit Baghdad and accused it of  suggesting the talks only as a cover for war.  </P> <P> In Frankfurt, Ambassador Howell, looking thinner from the ordeal and with his  gray hair longer, told reporters that his staff left the embassy "with the flag  flying."  </P> <P> "We're very happy to be here. We're delighted that Americans who wanted to  leave did," he said.  </P> <P> Asked if the embassy staff had endured, as reported, a diet of tuna sandwiches,  Howell deadpanned: "No, the bread ran out."  </P> <P> The 50-year-old diplomat declined to speak at length, explaining that "we  haven't had electricity and water, hot water, at night for 110 days. So, we're  going to take advantage of that."  </P> <P> The passengers were booked into a luxury hotel near the Frankfurt airport and  are expected to fly home Friday.  </P> <P> A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad said the compound in Kuwait was left  unstaffed but open and that Iraqi authorities had pledged it would not be  disturbed.  </P> <P> The departure of the American diplomats ended a four-month diplomatic standoff  between the United States and Iraq. Washington had defied Iraqi orders to close  the mission in August.  </P> <P> U.S. Embassy officials at the Baghdad airport said 94 people were on the flight  to Frankfurt.  </P> <P> It was the final U.S.-chartered flight evacuating hostages, and was said to be  the last chartered by any country.  </P> <P> Officials in Baghdad said all foreigners who missed the charter could leave  later by regular flights or by ground transportation.  </P></p>

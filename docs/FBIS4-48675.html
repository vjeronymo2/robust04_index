			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Names as received] </F>   [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP)--The self-proclaimed Republic  of Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia three years ago, on  Monday recognised the newly-proclaimed Yemen Democratic Republic  in the south of the country.    A statement faxed to AFP here from President Mohamed Ibrahim  Egal in the Somaliland capital, Hargeisa, said Somaliland would  recognize the constitutionality and legitimacy of the new  sovereign republic in South Yemen and would place at its  disposal all its support.    Somaliland declared independence after the overthrow of  Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre, but has not been recognised  internationally.    "Being well-placed by our own bitter experience to  understand  and appreciate fully the dilemma which has faced the people and  government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we, the people  and government of the Republic of Somaliland, hasten to  recognize the constitutionality and the legitimacy of the  sovereign republic", the statement said.    "Being un-recognized ourselves, we know that in  international  terms our recognition carries no de-jure benefit for the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, but we place at the disposal of  its government all our support", the statement pointed out.    South Yemen declared its independence from the north on  Friday and on Sunday appointed former Yemeni Vice-President 'Ali  Salim al- Bid as its new president, with the port city of Aden  as its capital.    But Yemen's President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northern, has  condemned Baid, his sacked deputy, as "a traitor" and a  statement from Sanaa hinted on Saturday that the north would cut  off ties with any country recognizing the new republic.    The appointment of al-Bid came on the day Yemenis might have  been celebrating the fourth anniversary of union between the  conservative, Muslim north and the south.</p>

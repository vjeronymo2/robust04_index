			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker under the rubric "Lobbying": </F> "The `Siberian Accord' Demands Revision of Taxes: MASS  Recommends the Government Increase Region's Budget Financing"]    [Text] The economic conference on problems of the  development of Siberia which opens today in Novosibirsk with the  planned participation of Leonid Abalkin, Yegor Gaydar, and  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy subscribes to the plan of the "Siberian  Accord" Interregional Association (MASS): to raise its political  status in order to lobby successfully in the center for the  region's interests, as the local elite groups understand those  interests. Just a month ago in discussing the concept and  strategy of Siberia's development in Moscow, MASS announced that  the economic reforms had not resulted in "stabilization of the  economic situation in Siberia," but, on the contrary, "a number  of base complexes are on the verge of complete disorganization  and collapse." Naturally, the association decided to take on the  "creation of constructive mechanisms for the positive reform of  the economy."    The development of "constructive mechanisms" was above all  focused on changing relations between the federal and  territorial budgets and on making adjustments in tax policy.  Lamenting Moscow's subjectiveness in calculating the income and  expenditures of Siberia's krays and oblasts, MASS proposed a  typical solution--increase the region's state budget financing.  But in fact, in order to remove Siberians' suspicions of one  another on the subject of "whom the Ministry of Finance favored  more," the leadership of the oblasts should have published the  local budgets. On this basis, the question could have been posed  of redistributing within the region amounts already pledged to  the federal budget. But the "Siberian Accord" instead proposed  that the government increase the proportion of value-added tax  (VAT) left to the territories.    Seeming to forget that this proportion had already been  raised starting this year, MASS is prepared to act as the  disrupter of the entire budget design. It proposes to revise the  rates of the personal profit tax, VAT, and income tax. To  decrease them, naturally, but only that part which goes for  republic-wide needs. Apart from demanding that state injections  of capital be increased, the Association gave the recommendation  "to form a special reserve fund for financial support of regions  in the federal budget." But MASS did not indicate, as is  customary in such cases, the source of the fund's formation.    The appeal to the Council of Ministers to revise its decree  No 1233 "On Reappraisal of Working Capital" is no less  surprising. MASS explains its concern by saying that reappraisal  of the value of enterprises leads to a jump in prices of their  output, and after that comes another sequence of nonpayments,  lower profits, and reduced tax revenue to the budget. It is  remarkable that it was precisely enterprises and territorial  authorities which bombarded the Cabinet of Ministers all of last  year, demanding that working capital be reappraised, saying that  otherwise it would be impossible to increase depreciation  deductions and capital investments for developing production.  But now MASS announces: "An alternative to this variant is an  increase in monetary capital in circulation equal to the rise in  prices." In this way, MASS is essentially advising the  government to add the inflation of demand (the rise in prices  through the increase in the amount of money the consumer has) to  the supposedly inevitable inflation of the seller's costs.    But, perhaps, another recommendation of Siberians is out of  competition, to abolish Point 8 of the State Tax Committee  instructions which defines the procedure for enterprises and  organizations to pay tax on profit to the budget. Commodity  producers complain about this instruction because supposedly it  prevents them from lowering prices for goods and output. In  answering such claims made at one of the conferences of  directors, First Vice-President Oleg Soskovets said: "Consider  there to be no such instruction." But the tax organs have  repeatedly caught enterprises for artificially reducing prices  of output (for the purpose of formally reducing profit and  thereby taxes). Frequently Russian enterprises trade at real  prices and list "reduced" prices in the transport invoices. And  as a rule this is not accompanied by any resolution of  nonpayments or any freeing of warehouse space.    On the whole, MASS's approaches to regulating foreign  economic activity, pretentions to price and rate controls on  energy and railroad shipments, desire to revise relations of  ownership between the federal and territorial levels, and  readiness to adjust budget and tax policy confirm that the  "Siberian Accord" is attempting to revive the economic  organization of the 1950s, the sovnarkhoz [regional economic  council].</p>

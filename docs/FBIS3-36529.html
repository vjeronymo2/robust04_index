This is because it will open a new  chapter in the relations between Vietnam and the United States,  and it reflects the process of a new international situation  since the end of the Cold War.    Clinton pointed out that the current decision does not mean  complete normalization of relations between the two sides and  that there still remains the problem of clarifying the fate of  all the missing U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam war. Therefore,  a plan is being set up to establish a U.S. liaison office in  Hanoi.    According to political observers, the lifting of the trade  embargo is nothing but an initial measure in the road for  achieving complete normalization between Vietnam and the United  States. This process itself shows that a lot of time will still  be consumed until diplomatic relations are restored. The  important thing, however, is that the lifting of the trade  embargo was achieved.    The door for carrying out trade relations has opened. Hanoi  is linking the lifting of the trade embargo with the great hope  of introducing U.S. capital. According to Vietnamese  economists' estimates, this will make it possible to enhance the  role of Vietnam in the current international economic-related  system which puts into practice important reforms and  strengthens market organizations.    The Vietnamese side was successful in changing the position  of the Washington administration by consistently overcoming  various barriers. For example, the Vietnamese Government  carried out much work to clarify the fate of all the missing  U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam war and prepared and handed  over original documents regarding this matter to the U.S. side.    The U.S. side is willing to conduct future joint searches to  finish this task. In a word, Hanoi has shown sincerity, ended  the era when bombs and bullets determined the relations between  the two countries, and has shown a good intention.    Promoting economic relations and commercial cooperation is a  top priority. U.S. businessmen who consider the tremendous  potential of the Vietnamese market to be good have expressed  great interest in the development of working relations between  the United States and Vietnam. They were allowed to make  preliminary contacts with their Vietnamese counterparts in  December 1992. Ten representative offices opened. The U.S.  Treasury Department allowed U.S. companies to participate in  economic reforms in Vietnam toward the end of last year. It did  so under the condition that international capital would be  introduced. All the obstacles that had existed for 30 years  have been removed.    Hanoi is not alone in welcoming the lifting of the economic  embargo against Vietnam: Moscow, Beijing, and capitals of other  countries of the world welcome the lifting of the embargo,  saying that this is an example of a sound way of thinking and an  affirmative measure for the future stability and prosperity of  the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

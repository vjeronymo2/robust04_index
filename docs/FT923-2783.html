			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / German economics minister calls for wide-scale reforms MR Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, yesterday called for a comprehensive reform of the country's education and welfare systems, labour laws and enterprise taxation, to restore its international competitiveness. At the same time he appealed for more radical action, including extended investment subsidies, to revive the east German economy and warned that recovery in the east could take at least a decade. In a broad-ranging paper on the ossified structure of the German economy in the 1990s, Mr Mollemann called for legally binding budget controls to restrain public sector spending by both central and local government. He proposed an overhaul of the wage-bargaining system, to provide more flexibility above all in eastern Germany, where mass unemployment is already stoking social unrest and racial violence. Businesses faced with bankruptcy - particularly in the east - must be allowed temporarily to suspend wage agreements to stay in operation, he said. He also proposed that a new law on working time should be introduced, allowing for more flexible working hours, more shift working to use factory equipment more efficiently and greater flexibility in working on Sundays and holidays. He proposed that the retirement age, now 65, should be raised and made more flexible. On the other hand, university courses should be shortened, because students could currently extend their studies almost indefinitely; the norm should be for students to start work by the age of 25, he said. Mr Mollemann renewed his call for a series of enterprise tax reforms and for an overall cut in the peak rate of income tax from 53 to 44 per cent. He presented a generally gloomy view of the state of the German economy, above all in the east. 'We face the total collapse of the social and economic system in eastern Germany,' he said. 'It is impossible to overcome this in two or even in five years. We will need a whole decade.' The minister expressed scepticism about the stimulus to growth which would flow from the German Bundesbank's latest cut in interest rates, of between 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points. Mr Mollemann's said his strategy paper should provide a working basis for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's proposed 'solidarity pact' between employers, unions, central and local government.

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Man in the news: Jurgen Mollemann - Hand that rocked the coalition The banner headline in Bild Zeitung said it all. 'You scheming swine]' it screamed on Thursday morning. The words were supposed to have been those of Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the luckless woman who for one brief day was set to become Germany's foreign minister, before her nomination was overturned in a palace coup inside her own Free Democratic Party (FDP). The target of her purported rage was Mr Jurgen Mollemann, her close colleague as economics minister, her rival as future leader of the party, and the man she considered most to have betrayed her. Mrs Schwaetzer has since insisted that she never used the words but few in Bonn would be surprised that she may have been sorely tempted. In this political hothouse, where conspiracy theorists abound, many believe that the hand of an arch-conspirator like Mr Mollemann was behind the apparent chaos which overtook Germany's ruling coalition during the past week. The other 'old fox' who few believe was blameless was Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher himself, the man who started the whole crisis by announcing his sudden resignation as foreign minister on Monday. Most members of the government and the ruling establishment have done badly from the confusion. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seen again as a weak leader, unable to impose his will on unstable coalition partners; Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the FDP, is under pressure to resign for failing to control his party; Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Christian Social Union, the third partner in the coalition, was simply irrelevant to the whole affair, stuck in Washington at the International Monetary Fund. Mr Mollemann, however, has come out of it with the extra title of vice-chancellor, and nicely placed, it would appear, to take over the party leadership from Mr Lambsdorff whenever he goes. His only serious rival will be Mr Klaus Kinkel, the new foreign minister. It was typical of Mr Mollemann that his latest political initiative, a new move for drastic budget cuts to curb the swelling public sector deficit, should have leaked out at precisely the same moment. In it he hinted strongly at the weak leadership of the chancellor, implied that Mr Waigel had got his figures wrong, and moved swiftly himself to occupy the moral high ground, calling not least for cuts in (western) social spending. Mr Mollemann is a strange mixture: a notorious self-publicist, dapper and glib, who models himself on Mr Genscher, his mentor, and yet has failed to achieve the same popularity. When he was appointed economics minister in January, 1991, the business sector audibly groaned. Since then he has demonstrated a knack for choosing the right issues, showing no fear of confrontation with his colleagues, and thus remaining well in front of the political game. He is still not taken entirely seriously in the Bonn establishment as a copper-bottomed politician, and yet he has risen inexorably through the ranks. Aged 47 (born two months after the end of the war), he trained as a teacher, served his call-up as a parachutist (a bit of machismo repeated in every curriculum vitae), and swiftly became a member of the Bundestag in 1972 at the age of 27. It was 1982 before he was brought into government by Mr Genscher, as his deputy at the Foreign Office. In 1987 he got his own ministry, Culture and Science, and in 1991 - against the opposition, not least, of Mr Lambsdorff - seized the Economics Ministry, the FDP's second most important portfolio. In the short time he has been there, he has succeeded in revitalising a moribund department, grabbing the headlines, and forcing its views on the rest of the government. His civil servants, who regarded his arrival with trepidation, now credit him with a laudable capacity to read his briefs, master the issues and, if he must, exploit them for personal publicity. Thus he plunged in first with Aufschwung Ost - Upswing East - the DM12bn (Pounds 4bn) programme to pump desperately needed extra cash into east Germany. Then he turned round and demanded drastic budget cuts in the west - DM10bn off government subsidies or he would resign - to keep the budget deficit under control. He has also long been the most outspoken member of the government in insisting that a stern line must be held against excessive wage awards - a 'four before the comma', or less than 5 per cent, was his slogan long before Mr Kohl and the rest took it up. Yet the PR is often more impressive than the outcome. The DM10bn in subsidy cuts was watered down drastically in the German Bundestag, and Mr Mollemann never resigned. A much vaunted breakthrough on the Gatt negotiations - when he thought he had turned round the German cabinet, and outmanoeuvred the agriculture minister, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, to throw full German support behind a deal in the Gatt negotiations - has failed to push Mr Kohl far enough to deliver a deal. He is still not that popular with the business community. 'He is too much of a schoolmaster,' according to one Bonn-based lobbyist. 'He is too theoretical and inflexible.' Thus he is seen as responsible for Germany's draconian export controls, including the proposal for customs officers to tap telephones, outraging businessmen and libertarians. He is a risk-taker to the end. The question is whether this week he achieved his breakthrough to the big time, or whether he overstepped himself. Mrs Schwaetzer was bitter because he urged her to go for the Genscher job, and leave the way open for his claim to the party leadership. Yet when the party revolted, he switched sides, and voted for Mr Kinkel. It is Mr Kinkel who may yet prove his undoing. For the new foreign minister is tough and practical, and his job will give him lots of publicity. He does not feel bound to abstain from the contest for party leadership next year, as Mrs Schwaetzer did. So Mr Mollemann may yet be pipped at the post. It would not be for want of trying.</p>

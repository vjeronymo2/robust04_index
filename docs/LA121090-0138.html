			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> X-RAY SUPPORTS AUTHENTICITY OF VAN GOGH WORK;  </P> <P> ART: A SELF-PORTRAIT HOUSED AT A CONNECTICUT MUSEUM HAS BEEN DOUBTED SINCE  1954. THE IMAGE OF AN EARLY SKETCH BENEATH THE PAINT ADDS CREDIBILITY.  </P> <P> Museum officials locked in a battle with an art critic over the authenticity of  a purported self-portrait by Van Gogh say they have new proof, contained in an  X-ray of the painting.  </P> <P> The X-ray, taken at Hartford's Mt. Sinai Hospital, shows the outlines of a  sketch beneath the painting, and officials at Wadsworth Atheneum say the sketch  was clearly done by Van Gogh in the mid-1880s.  </P> <P> "With these scientific results, we now have what I believe is 'the smoking  pistol' -- positive proof that this must be a work by Vincent van Gogh," said  museum Director Patrick McCaughey.  </P> <P> The X-ray and the picture will be exhibited side-by-side Tuesday at the museum.  </P> <P> The authenticity of the 16-by-13-inch painting has been challenged repeatedly  since it was donated to the museum in 1954 by architect Philip Goodwin.  </P> <P> Museum officials have maintained that it is one of a series of gaunt, haunting  self-portraits Van Gogh painted between 1886 and 1888.  </P> <P> Most recently, Swiss art dealer and critic Walter Feilchenfeldt insisted that  the work is a forgery or, more likely, a Van Gogh portrait painted in tribute  by another artist. He said the painting "is not Van Gogh's style."  </P> <P> The painting is to be included in an international exhibition next year.  </P> <P> "The international exhibition is what really propelled us into saying, 'Let's  sort this painting out once and for all,' " McCaughey said. "Let's see if it is  worth $17 million or $1.70 -- $1.70 being the value of the frame."  </P> <P> The museum said the X-ray disclosed a sketch of a fleshy woman in a bonnet. The  woman looks much like the figures in Van Gogh's series of pictures of Dutch  peasants, such as "The Potato Eaters," McCaughey said.  </P> <P> "When the X-ray was turned upside down, there indeed was Mrs. Potato Eater, or  Miss Potato Eater, seated at the pail peeling her spuds," he said.  </P> <P> Impoverished artists like Van Gogh painted over earlier works or painted on  both sides of a canvas to save money.  </P></p>

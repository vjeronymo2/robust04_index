			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Confusion 'reigns in Bundeswehr' DEMORALISATION and confusion, bordering on 'open mutiny', reign in Germany's armed forces, because of repeated budget cuts and open divisions within the government, according an extraordinary public letter to members of the Bundestag. The letter, from the principal personnel committee representing all civilian and military personnel in the Defence Ministry and the Bundeswehr, spells out for the first time the disillusion in the ranks over drastic cuts in both personnel and spending ordered since German unification in 1990. It charges the government with 'chaotic military planning', describing the latest order for a new review of troop strengths and equipment cuts as demonstrating 'unprecedented lack of perspective and unbelievable confusion' at the highest level. The letter appears to criticise both Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who ordered the latest round of extra defence cuts, and Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, fighting to protect his budget from new inroads, after initially agreeing to substantial savings. The two erstwhile close allies are clearly at loggerheads over the defence budget cuts, where savings in the current year totalling DM863m (Pounds 365.6m) have suddenly been ordered to help finance the Chancellor's proposed 'solidarity pact' for east Germany. The letter, described by defence experts as unheard of in the Bundeswehr's history, says the mood in the ranks, and among civilian personnel, 'ranges from open mutiny to sullen resignation because of the latest developments'. Bundeswehr members want to 'know where they stand,' the authors say, because the whole process of garrison closures, and apparently 'aimless reorganisations and transfers' have made it impossible for defence personnel to plan their lives and careers. The latest cuts ordered by Chancellor Kohl, and a review of troop numbers below the present target of 370,000 by 1995 (against 440,000 today), along with a review of the duration of conscription, appear to have been the last straw. The letter says that garrison cuts ordered by Mr Ruhe last week were forced on him, making further changes in military planning at short notice. If Mr Kohl has his way, 'there will be another round of decisions in the foreseeable future, on the structure and size of the Bundeswehr, with further consequences for civilian employees and soldiers'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Bian Guorong (0593 0949 2837) and reporter </F> Liu Jun (0491 6511)]    [Text] Shanghai, 16 May (XINHUA) -- China's largest VSAT  [very small aperture terminal] satellite communications network  on 9 May passed evaluation and acceptant test in Shanghai's New  Pudong District. The modern center which houses the large  satellite communications network is not only a successful  pioneering undertaking in Pudong's construction but also in the  history of international communications construction.    Erected at the southern end of the principal satellite  communications network building is a magnificent parabolic  antenna 12 meters in diameter, pointing directly to the blue  skies and aiming precisely at the No. 5 Zhongxing communications  satellite at 115.5 degrees east longitude over the equator.    The Pudong VSAT satellite communications network can provide  such communications services as data, speech, image, and  facsimile transmission. Among the first group of subscribers to  the network are the Eastern Airlines' booking system, XINMIN  WANGBAO's layout transmission system, and the Shanghai Grain and  Oil Exchange's quotations broadcast and transactions return  systems. The grain and oil exchange's quotations and  transactions returns can be transmitted within 0.5 second and  are being used widely in various parts of the country. The VSAT  satellite communications center provides two options of network  grouping: a star-shaped PES [expansion unknown] network which  transmits mainly data and can also be used for transmitting  speech, and a net-shaped TES [expansion unknown] network which  transmits mainly speech and can also be used for transmitting  data. It is understood that the center is the first in the  world to have the configuration of such comprehensive,  multi-purpose equipment, which has reached the world's advanced  level in terms of both technology and equipment.    The Pudong VSAT satellite communications network was built  with funds jointly raised by the Shanghai Science and Technology  Investment Company, Jinqiao Export Processing Zone, and three  other development zones.</p>

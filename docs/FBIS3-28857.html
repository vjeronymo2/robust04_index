Last week, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed returned the  courtesy. Not since Tunku Abdul Rahman had a Malaysian prime  minister been there on an official visit in 30 years. Such  reserve showed in the modest trade links: the two countries did  no more than [Singapore dollar] $555 million worth of business  in the first nine months of last year. [passage omitted] Talking  to Filipinos in Manila, one gets the feeling that more than a  few do not share an ASEAN destiny. It is not insularity, but an  apartness built on the country's Spanish-American past and  Christian outlook. That is changing, however.    Improved relations with Malaysia are a key element of that  process. This impinges on ASEAN cohesion, as the number of  territorial disputes, apart from the one on Sabah, are a  constant reminder that good neighbourliness cannot be taken for  granted. The Spratlys dispute concerns three ASEAN nations;  Malaysia and Indonesia have not settled the issue of Sipadan and  Ligitan; while Malaysia has not given up its claim on Pedra  Branca. Sabah, lest it be forgotten, is not a closed file.  There are complexities which will take much negotiation and  goodwill to disentangle. Neither Dr. Mahathir nor Mr. Ramos  pretend that a settlement can be had in their lifetime. [passage  omitted] What bodes will for ASEAN is that after three decades,  Malaysia and the Philippines accept that, one, the Sabah  resolution need not be tied to a time-frame, and two, that  economic co-operation should not be held hostage to it. The  Sabah question, as agreed upon before Dr. Mahathir went to  Manila, is now held in suspended animation. [passage omitted]    What is "positive" was what the Mahathir visit was about:  trade and investment links. If there is sustained economic  expansion, no political problem can remain intractable for long.  It was significant that on the Malaysian side, the initiative  came from the private sector which was a big part of the  Mahathir party. The nine memoranda of understanding signed with  Philippine interests cover infrastructure work that the  Filipinos need badly to ignite growth: highways, hotels, power  and water plants, rail systems. Intriguing was the Malaysian  offer of a financing instrument called the Bilateral Payments  Arrangement (BPA) to boost trade. Under this system originally  meant for the Group of 15 developing countries, importers and  exporters are guaranteed payment through the central banks of  trading partners. Malaysia has BPA links with 21 countries with  trade amounting to [Malaysian dollar] $4 billion. It will be a  help to the Philippines. Less clear is the concept of an East  Asian growth crescent covering Mindanao, Brunei, the East  Malaysian states, and eastern Indonesia. If it takes off it  will energise development on a big scale, on a par with the  ASEAN free trade area scheme. The framework and growth  mechanisms will take time to evolve. Conditions are favourable,  however, such as the greatly reduced threat from the Muslim  separatists and jungle guerillas in the Philippines. This may  be Manila's biggest contribution to ASEAN and to itself.</p>

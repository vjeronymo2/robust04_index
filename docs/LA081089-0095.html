			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEARCH RESUMES FOR MISSING PLANE  </P> <P> The Civil Air Patrol resumed its search Wednesday for two men aboard a  single-engine plane that disappeared while on a flight from Southern California  to the Sierra.  </P> <P> The missing pilot, Redwanj Abouhamed of Hawthorne flew out of Compton Airport  sometime Sunday morning in a Piper Cherokee and was supposed to land in Big  Bear or Mammoth within several hours, said Federal Aviation Administration  spokeswoman Elly Brekke.  </P> <P> Abouhamed, who did not file a flight plan, also apparently stopped at Hawthorne  Airport to pick up an acquaintance, John Lazar of Inglewood.  </P> <P> The air patrol's search effort was grounded Tuesday by low clouds and  thunderstorms. By Wednesday, the patrol resumed its search with 19 aircraft  flying over the Sierra at the 11,000-foot level looking for signs of the plane.  </P> <P> On Monday, a dozen CAP search planes from a base in Madera covered about 3,000  miles along a corridor between Fresno and Mammoth. The search began Sunday  afternoon after Abouhamed's wife telephoned the FAA to report that her husband  had not landed as planned in one of the mountain resorts.  </P></p>

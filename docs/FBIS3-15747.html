Speaking to the journalists in Yerevan he mentions the  primary task the Armenian leaders should solve -- to guarantee  the cease-fire. "Then troops should be withdrawn from the front  line and blockade existing in the region should be stopped. And  as the final point -- the discussion of the Nagorno-Karabakh  status at the Minsk conference", said Liparityan. Mr.  Liparityan also mentioned that the withdrawal of the military  groups out of the Lachin humanitarian corridor which connects  Armenia to Karabakh is out of the question.    There should be mentioned, according to Mr. Liparityan,  Turkey wouldn't want to see Russian disjunctive [disengagement]  troops in the zone of the conflict. Nevertheless, the armistice  is impossible without the participation of the peace-making  forces.</p>

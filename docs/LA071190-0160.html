			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FIRST THINGS FIRST MAKE FOR A COMPLETE FIRST AID KIT  </P> <P> Summer vacations are supposed to be fun. But if you haven't taken stock of your  medicine chest or first aid kit lately, you may be in for a nasty surprise.  </P> <P> What should a family first aid kit or home medical chest contain? For the sorts  of cuts and scratches children tend to collect, adhesive bandages in a wide  variety of sizes and shapes are essential.  </P> <P> Bigger scrapes may call for non-stick gauze pads and adhesive tape, as well as  a blunt scissor for cutting tape so you don't have to tear it. A new product  called 2nd Skin goes on right over a blister or minor burn to protect it as  well as keep it comfortable.  </P> <P> Don't mess with iodine or alcohol. Most scratches and scrapes do just fine with  a little soap and water for cleaning. (If you're carting your first aid kit to  out-of-the-way places, a small container of liquid soap and a few cotton balls  can be of use.)  </P> <P> A little dab of Polysporin or other non-prescription antibiotic ointment helps  prevent infection.  </P> <P> Soap and water can also come in handy if someone gets into poison ivy or poison  oak accidentally. Washing thoroughly within five minutes of contact is the best  way to avoid a rash. A premoistened alcohol wipe will also work if water is  scarce.  </P> <P> Sprains call for a cold pack and a compression bandage. Modern cold packs such  as Ace Instant Cold Compress, Jack Frost Instant Cold Pack, or 3M's Cold  Comfort or Cold Comfort Plus don't require refrigeration.  </P> <P> An over-the-counter pain reliever (aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen) and an  anti-itch cream are also essential.  </P> <P> Professional tweezers for removing splinters, stingers, thorns and the like are  hard to come by but well worth the investment.  </P> <P> With a little planning, summer accidents shouldn't have to spoil your fun.  </P></p>

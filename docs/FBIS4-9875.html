			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Moises Perez Mok] </F>   [Text] The Cuban Corporation of Tourism and International  Trade, Cubanacan S.A., currently immersed in a modern process of  structural change, has set itself goals that at the beginning of  the decade were unimaginable.    This was stated during a news conference by Abraham  Maciques,  president of Cubanacan's Board of Shareholders. Maciques said  that in 1995 the island's tourism facilities will be able to  accommodate 1 million tourists and secure $1 billion for the  country.    He recalled that last year Cuba received 640,000 visitors,  according to preliminary reports. These visitors brought in  between $720 million and $740 million to the Cuban economy,  which has been enduring an adverse international situation since  the end of the 1980's.    Of this total, Maciques said, Cubanacan brought in 240,000  tourists and more than $195 million, approximately 40 percent  more than the 1992 figures.    He said: The corporation envisages bringing approximately  250,000 tourists in 1994, mostly from Canada, Germany, Spain,  Italy, Netherlands, and Argentina, without forgetting nascent  markets such as Great Britain and France.    He said Cubanacan is ready to plan bigger promotions for the  next few years because the quality of what it offers has been  steadily improving and this has earned the trust of tourist  agents and foreign partners. This also helps entice tourists to  return.    Polls conducted by Cubanacan among guests point to a 4.6  level of satisfaction on a five-point scale.    Currently, Cubanacan S.A. operates 48 hotels with a total of  7,200 rooms. Fifteen of these hotels function under the mixed  enterprise or mixed management arrangement.    This year, with the opening of the hotels Las Americas, in  the Varadero beach resort; Las Brisas, in the northeastern  province of Holguin; and Cohiba and El Viejo y El Mar, in  Havana; Cubanacan S.A.'s room availability will increase to  8,400.    With regard to mixed investments, Maciques said that by the  year 2000, they will have 8,000 rooms (more than 3,000 in Cayo  Coco alone) operating mostly in working tourist centers.    Development demands participation in joint investments.  Cubanacan S.A. resources are to be used only on highly  profitable enterprises, and both types of investments must take  place in sites where infrastructure of already available (roads,  electricity).    Regarding supplemental hotel services, Maciques reported on  a  plan to restore some installations and to open new ones that  will offer typical entrees at moderate prices.    He mentioned, as an example, El Aljibe, a Havana restaurant  that specializes in chicken, an experience that will be  implemented throughout the country because of its demonstrated  efficiency.    Referring to the new structure adopted at the beginning of  this year by Cubanacan, Maciques said this is part of a process  of improvements by means of which each of the previous managers  (18) opened independent companies.    He stated: None can be unprofitable, and all are suitable  for  serving not only our corporation's tourists but also anyone  requesting our services.    According to Maciques, the new organization will guarantee  more efficiency and quality control, reduce intermediate  structures, and grant more authority to rank and file employees.    Maciques also praised the opening of accounting offices and  the signing of foreign venture contracts for the administration  of construction projects, something without precedent in Cuba.    The first agreement of this type was signed between a  Spanish  group and the Union of Caribbean Construction Enterprises to  complete the hotel Las Americas, in Varadero, with a reduction  of costs and improved quality.    The same concepts will apply for constructing the Coco-Miel  Hotel, in Cayo Coco. This type of agreement allows the island  to acquire up-to-date technology and important construction  know-how.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Watts Blake in Pounds 11m German buy Watts Blake Bearne &amp; Co yesterday confirmed its position as the world's largest producer of specialist clays with a big expansion in Germany, its main market. The Devon-based company, which this week announced a 24 per cent increase in first half profits, is paying Pounds 11m for Martin &amp; Pagenstecher Rohstoffbetriebe (MPR), the ball clay mining business owned by Thyssen, the German steel group. The consideration is Pounds 6.5m cash and Pounds 4.5m of new borrowing. The move comes just two days after WBB unveiled an acquisition strategy aimed at strengthening its presence in continental Europe. Mr David Bowden, finance director, said MPR's operations would be partially integrated into Fuchs-Ton, WBB's German subsidiary. 'Immediate benefits will be obtained through administrative cost saving, and the acquisition is expected to be earnings neutral in the first year,' he said. For the September 30 1993 year-end MPR's operating profits were Pounds 700,000. The enlarged business is expected to contribute more than 45 per cent of group sales, which rose from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 41.8m in the six months to June 30.</p>

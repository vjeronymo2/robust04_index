			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY GIVES AMNESTY TO EMIGRES, DEMONSTRATORS  </P> <P> The new East German leadership declared an amnesty Friday for all those who  have fled to the West and all those who have taken part in peaceful street  demonstrations over the last month.  </P> <P> Since this summer, about 60,000 East Germans have fled illegally through  Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland to West Germany, where all are considered to  be citizens.  </P> <P> The official East German news agency ADN, in announcing the amnesty, did not  make clear how many people might be affected. The order did not state how far  back the amnesty extends, but the broad wording may mean it goes to 1961, when  the Berlin Wall was erected. If so, it would affect many thousands more.  </P> <P> Authorities also said that rules requiring visas or passports to travel to  Czechoslovakia will be lifted next Wednesday. The rules were imposed Oct. 3 to  stem the flow of emigres.  </P> <P> Under the amnesty order, everyone arrested as a demonstrator -- even those  under investigation -- will be released by Nov. 30, according to ADN.  </P> <P> The news agency said the Council of State, the highest ruling government body,  specifically excluded anyone who had used force or advocated the use of force  in connection with the demonstrations, which have swept East Germany in the  last month.  </P> <P> The demonstrations followed the flight of thousands of East Germans who said  they saw no possibility of getting the political and economic reforms that many  are demanding. The demonstrations continued Thursday night, with 100,000 people  rallying in Dresden and lesser numbers in several other cities, ADN reported.  </P> <P> In Bonn, the West German government said it welcomes the amnesty as a positive  step. But chief spokesman Hans Klein said his government believes that most of  the East Germans involved are guilty of no real offense. He said these people  were only exercising their rights.  </P> <P> Still, Klein said, the amnesty must be looked on as a first step toward more  freedom for East Germany.  </P> <P> The amnesty announcement was the latest in a dramatic series of developments,  apparently in response to public pressure, since Egon Krenz, 52, replaced the  ailing Erich Honecker, 77, as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18.  </P> <P> On Friday, the West German newspaper Bild said sources in Moscow indicated that  Krenz will visit Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next week. It said Krenz  will travel to Moscow on Tuesday and that he will see other top Soviet  officials as well.  </P> <P> When Krenz succeeded to the top government and party posts, he was widely  regarded as a protege of Honecker who could be expected to take a hard line  against the kind of political and economic reforms that have been introduced in  the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary and that have been demanded by opposition  groups in East Germany.  </P> <P> But Krenz appears to have charted a more reformist course. A member of his  Politburo met Thursday with opposition leaders, and Krenz has agreed to meet  with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> The amnesty statement made no specific reference to opposition groups such as  New Forum, an organization that was established only recently but that already  claims more than 26,000 followers.  </P> <P> New Forum was outlawed in September, and although the authorities have refused  to accept it, they have made no overt effort to suppress it.  </P> <P> Some analysts interpreted the amnesty announcement as an attempt to limit the  number of East Germans choosing to flee to the West and as an appeal to those  who have already fled and may be unhappy in the West.  </P> <P> Analysts here in Munich said the announcement was a way to suggest that life  will be better in East Germany and that those who were uncomfortable before the  mass flight will find conditions improved if they return.  </P> <P> In all, about 120,000 of East Germany's 16.6 million people have left for the  West this year -- roughly half of them as legal emigrants.  </P> <P> In another development Friday, the party newspaper Neues Deutschland quoted  Markus Wolf, the former East German intelligence chief, as calling for greater  openness and expressing sympathy for some of the people who have gone to the  West.  </P> <P> Wolf was quoted as telling a reporter that "the recovery of trust is demanded  before we can develop further."  </P> <P> But in the same issue, Neues Deutschland criticized one of the founders of New  Forum, the painter Baerbel Bohley, for inviting an exiled dissident to return  to East Berlin. Bohley had said that Wolf Biermann, a folk singer, should be  allowed to return and sing as a measure of the authorities' commitment to  reform.  </P> <P> Biermann has described the Communist Party leadership as "old pigs," and Neues  Deutschland said that if he meant what he said, he has "absolutely no place  among us."  </P> <P> "By what right," it asked, "does Mrs. Bohley invite such a person to the German  Democratic Republic?"  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / RMT had 'no prospect' of winning Railtrack dispute Railtrack lost the propaganda battle against the RMT rail union but won almost everything else, including a refusal to pay for past productivity, according to Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director. Mr Armstrong told the magazine Personnel Management: 'The press and public support for the signalworkers may have given them heart, but the RMT never had a prospect of winning the dispute. They chose the wrong issue to be in dispute on and it was doomed to failure from the start.' Mr Armstrong said that the RMT's mistake was to insist on payments for past productivity. 'No employer in this day and age, and particularly one that is government-owned, can concede an 11 per cent pay rise based on the past', he said. According to Mr Armstrong the turning point came when the RMT agreed to negotiate on both past and future productivity. He said: 'Apart from annualised hours and the inclusion of Sunday in the working week, we have secured everything we were looking for. Sunday working will be on a voluntary basis, but if somebody doesn't volunteer we can roster them to work.' Annualised hours - meaning greater variability of hours within a fixed annual limit - were withdrawn from negotiations by the company in June but Mr Armstrong said he was still keen to use pilot studies to test their suitability for the railways. 'We want to have further discussions with the trade unions,' he said.</p>

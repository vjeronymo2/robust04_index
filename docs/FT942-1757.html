			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Clinton defiant over dollar's fall: US currency steady - Investors urged to concentrate on 'strong fundamentals' President Bill Clinton responded defiantly yesterday to downward pressure on the dollar in global financial markets, urging investors to pay more attention to strong US economic fundamentals. 'This is the first time in 30 years that we have had growth in the economy with no inflation led by investment that will create jobs,' he said. Mr Clinton's remarks were reinforced by upbeat comments on the US economy by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary. Their concerted remarks followed overnight intervention by the Bank of Japan and combined to help the dollar and stock and bond markets. But in Tokyo, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's finance minister, warned that 'rapid fluctuations' in exchange rates 'would do harm not only to the Japanese economy but to the world economy'. The Japanese government had called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the yen's renewed strength. Early today in Tokyo the dollar, which had dipped below Y100 on Tuesday, was quoted at Y101.5, as bankers reported renewed intervention by the Japanese central bank immediately after the opening. The dollar's bright start in Tokyo this morning continued a firmer trend begun yesterday in London, where it closed at Y100.695. In New York it finished at Y100.95. The US currency also steadied against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.6006 in London and DM1.60535 in New York after dropping below DM1.59 in the previous session. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 16.8 up at 3,724.77, its first advance in three sessions. The benchmark US long bond was trading up  29/32 by early afternoon at 86 3/32 . It closed at 86 9/32 , pushing the yield down to 7.397. Mr Clinton gave no sign of wanting to change domestic policies in response to external financial pressures. 'We'll just have to keep working on our fundamentals and know that in the end the markets will have to respond to the economic realities,' he said. The US is in its fourth year of a steady economic expansion. The unemployment rate has fallen to 6 per cent and the annual inflation rate is less than 3 per cent. Most countries are still struggling to emerge from recession. Behind Mr Clinton's words is the confidence that the US economy is less vulnerable to damage from currency volatility than most countries because the share of trade in gross domestic product remains low. Mr Clinton's claim that US economic achievements were being undervalued was echoed both by Mr Greenspan and Mr Bentsen. The Treasury secretary said he was 'concerned by recent movements in the exchange markets'. The US and its Group of Seven partners would 'continue to be prepared to act as appropriate' - a veiled reference to possible concerted intervention by central banks in support of the dollar. Speaking on Capitol Hill, Mr Greenspan said the economic outlook was 'as bright as it has been in decades. Economic activity has strengthened, unemployment is down, and price trends have remained subdued.' Mr Greenspan said many investors were too pessimistic about the outlook for US inflation. Long bond yields were 'higher than they should be' because they embodied an excessive 'inflation premium'. European bond and stock markets took some comfort from the more stable dollar and from Mr Greenspan's testimony. In Frankfurt, the Dax stock market index rose 11.15 in normal trading hours to 1,994.42. After hours, it added another 10 to 2,004.93. In Paris, the CAC Index jumped 26.26 to 1917.04. In London, markets were also given a boost by the publication of the minutes of the May meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The minutes indicated that the authorities saw no immediate need to increase UK interest rates. The FT-SE 100 Index recovered some of its recent losses, rising 20.2 to 2,960.4, while the September long gilt future gained nearly two points.

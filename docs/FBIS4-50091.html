			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- China's great economic  achievement has not only improved people's lives, but also  exercised significant influence on the international economic  structure.    This is the view shared by some well-known foreign  personages  who participated in the 1994 China summit which opened in  Beijing Wednesday.    In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System:  The Role of the People's Republic of China", Peter Sutherland,  director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), said that there was no doubt that China's reform  starting from the late 1970s has yielded good results.    "The reforms have given a far greater role to market forces  and have led to a rapid liberalization of its foreign trade  regime," he said, adding that the Chinese people have benefited  from the reforms too.    "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world  over, including those in China, are keen to see full  implementation of these and other announced reforms," he said.    Great changes have taken place just after the successful  conclusion of the Uruguay round multilateral trade negotiation,  and on the eve of the establishment of the new World Trade  Organization (WTO), the director-general said.    He pointed out that the reforms would help China to finish  the negotiations on the terms and conditions for its rejoining  GATT as early as possible, and to become one of the initial  member states of WTO.    "China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has  contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line  with the world trading system," he said. "Observing the Chinese  economy in the process of reform, one sees that China is  essentially doing autonomously what the WTO would in any case  oblige it to do."    "Given the magnitude of China's economy and the likelihood  that China will assume a leading role in shaping the global  economic environment of the next century, I think it to be of  critical importance that close attention be paid to the manner  in which China proceeds with its full integration into this  newly-strengthened multilateral trading system.    "China's membership would increase the universality of the  multilateral trading system and in other respects reflect  positively on the evolution of international relations."    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said in his speech  that Southeast Asia should have no fear of a wealthy and strong  China.    In contrast, "the Southeast Asian countries would benefit  from a huge market at their doorsteps" since the demands of  China would increase tremendously with its development, he said.    A stable environment is necessary for Asian countries to  catch up with the Western developed ones, Mahathir said, adding  that China had set a good example for other countries in this  regard.    "An anarchic situation is neither going to facilitate the  growth and flowering of a free market, nor help the transition  from a command economy to a market economy," he said.    Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, said in  his speech that the World Bank would continue to support China  in deepening its reform.    Since the quality and stability of the economic growth is  one  of the important elements that would shape China's future, he  said, the World Bank would finance China in support of  macroeconomic stability, reform of state-owned enterprises,  improvement of the infrastructure, environmental protection and  the development of its poor areas.    The World Bank has been China's partner in its reform drive,  he said.    Till now, the bank has supported 130 projects in China,  involving accumulated finances of over 16 billion U.S. dollars.    Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in his speech  entitled "China and the world" that China was playing a more  important role in current world affairs and economic and trade  exchanges, and in 20 years, China would become an economic giant.    For this reason, he said, all important world organizations  including GATT should accept it.    In order to fulfill its target, Schmidt said, China should  be  stable at home and upgrade its infrastructures to empower people  in the inland and the countryside, as well as controlling  inflation.    He also pointed out that the United States should not  interfere in China's internal affairs and that it is not wise to  stop China's most favored nation status.</p>

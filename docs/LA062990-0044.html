			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE PLAN GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT VENTURE  </P> <P> Seeking an expanded role in the global entertainment market, a consortium of  Japanese corporations is poised to announce the formation of an international  media company that will invest in everything from Hollywood movie production to  sports programming.  </P> <P> Media International Corp. will provide as much as $700 million in funding for  an array of entertainment ventures by its fifth year of operation, company  President Takao Yoshiki said. The Tokyo-based company will start with $200  million in capital.  </P> <P> "We realize this is a multimedia society," Yoshiki said. "This company's  purpose is to make partners with European and American media giants as well as  major production houses."  </P> <P> Media International is primarily the creation of a Japanese Broadcasting Corp.  subsidiary known as NHK Enterprises, which has pledged $30 million in capital  to the deal. Other initial backers, Yoshiki said, are Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the  world's largest commercial bank; Sumitomo Bank, another top worldwide financial  institution, and Seibu Saison, a conglomerate that operates airlines,  department stores, supermarkets and hotels.  </P> <P> Yoshiki said 10 corporations will eventually form the core support group of the  company, and Media International will have access to as much as $1 billion  through its backers. NHK has told its potential partners that the company  should become profitable within five years.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts said Media International could become a significant force  in the entertainment industry. David Londoner of Wertheim Schroder, a New York  investment firm, said Hollywood -- especially the independent production  companies -- will welcome the presence of a new investment partner.  </P> <P> At the same time, Londoner said, the Japanese stand to benefit from holding the  copyrights to film, television and cable projects they may undertake.  </P> <P> Traditionally involved most prominently in the equipment end of the business,  Japanese companies have been moving more aggressively into programming lately.  Japanese firms recently have invested in Carolco Pictures and Largo  Entertainment, and Sony Corp. last year bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment  outright for $3.4 billion.  </P> <P> "When Wertheim Schroder did an entertainment conference in Japan last March,  the message came through loud and clear that there was great interest in Japan  in aligning with American film and television producers as a way of securing  Japanese rights," Londoner said.  </P> <P> One of the first places Media International's representatives are likely to  land is Hollywood. Independent producer Thomas Mount, who is familiar with the  Japanese media, said the company will ultimately be "besieged" by executives  seeking funding.  </P> <P> "It is going to have a very positive impact for the flow of motion pictures,"  Mount said. "They have some very ambitious plans and the cash to achieve them."  </P> <P> However, one well-placed entertainment executive warned that certain Japanese  investors have flirted with the concept of Hollywood venture partnerships  before, only to withdraw when Hollywood sought a serious commitment.  </P> <P> "The question is whether they will spend the money," said the executive, who  asked not to be named. "There's no way to know. People will come to them with  stupid deals, and the Japanese are very shrewd about knowing the value of a  dollar."  </P> <P> Autonomy has been another key concern when the Japanese have invested in  American entertainment companies or products. Analysts said that Media  International will encounter strong resistance if it seeks creative control  over projects with American companies.  </P> <P> NHK Enterprises, the Japanese corporation behind the venture, already has  experience in the news and sports programming fields. One consultant who has  worked with the company said that NHK and its partners want to capitalize on  the new opportunities presented by the 1992 opening of the European Community,  economic reform in Eastern Europe and new technologies such as satellite  broadcasting.  </P> <P> "They're finding that they need to have more international lines out," said  consultant Ralph Thomson of International Business Catalysts. "It's shared  risks and shared profits."  </P> <P> Media International's business plans should become clearer in the months ahead.  But initial plans call for the company to act as a partner in international  broadcasting productions, major motion pictures, sporting events and news  programming, in addition to marketing the rights to its products in Japan and  abroad. Yoshiki said the firm might also raise funds above and beyond its  annual budget for projects of special merit.  </P> <P> Media International plans to incorporate formally next Thursday and hopes to  open its doors for business by November. Yoshiki said the firm will have a  staff of at least 50 based in Tokyo. It may also hire staff members and  consultants in the United States and elsewhere, he said.  </P> <P> Those consultants may be needed to help the company evaluate projects and wade  through the choppy waters of entertainment co-ventures. "We're thinking of  getting help from both the United States and Europe," Yoshiki said. "We believe  Japan will play a larger role in the global entertainment market . . . but we  would also like to learn a lot from you."  </P></p>

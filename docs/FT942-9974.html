			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Fall in producer prices boosts US bonds and shares US bond and share prices rebounded yesterday following reports of an unexpected decline in producer prices last month - a sign that the strong economic recovery is not yet putting much upward pressure on inflation. Bond traders also reacted positively to news of an unexpected dip in retail sales. The decline, however, did not appear to indicate any loss of underlying economic momentum because sales figures for March were revised up substantially. Most Wall Street analysts still expect the Federal Reserve to signal another increase in short-term interest rates next week in order to bolster the dollar on foreign exchange markets and prevent rapid economic growth eventually translating into higher inflation. Bond prices rallied sharply in New York early yesterday but later shed some of their gains. The benchmark 30-year long bond was up about half a point in late trading, to yield 7.552 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.8 points higher at 3,652.84. The producer price index fell 0.1 per cent last month and by 0.4 per cent in the year to April, indicating that the recovery is, as yet, putting little upward pressure on wholesale prices. Most forecasters had expected an increase of about 0.2 per cent last month. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.8 per cent in cash terms last month, against Wall Street projections of an increase of about 0.3 per cent. However, the level of sales was higher than expected last month because figures for March were revised up substantially to show a gain of 1.7 per cent rather than the 0.4 per cent reported earlier. In the three months to April, retail sales were 8.6 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Many analysts expect the Fed to signal a half-point increase in short-term rates to 4.25 per cent next Tuesday following a meeting of its policymaking open market committee. Some, however, predict an increase of only a quarter point, in line with the previous three tightening moves. If the Fedopts to send a strong signal, it may announce an increase in the discount rate, the notional rate at which it lends to banks. Increases in the discount rate, known as 'ringing the gong', have a stronger psychological impact than increases in the federal funds rate, which serves as a floor for money market rates. In foreign exchange markets, an increase in US rates is widely seen as a logical counterpart to the cut in German rates announced on Wednesday and the concerted intervention in support of the dollar last week. Private sector economists believe that further increases in short-term rates are also required to slow the rate of US economic expansion and prevent the economy hitting capacity constraints.

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DECISION ON WATER RATE HIKE PUT OFF FOR 60  DAYS  </P> <P> In an unusual break with the Department of Water and Power, the Los Angeles  City Council on Wednesday balked at approving a 6.5% water rate increase  requested by the department.  </P> <P> In an 8-7 vote, the council again put off action on the increase for 60 days to  gather more information. It is the second time in recent weeks the council has  put off making a decision on the matter.  </P> <P> The DWP request became controversial after the city's administrative officer  issued a report saying the increase is not needed because the department has a  $30-million surplus. DWP officials have argued that they need the money to  maintain a high bond rating.  </P> <P> Under the department's recommendation, the average monthly residential water  bill of $21.26 would be increased by $1.25.  </P> <P> Department officials have predicted that if the council denies the increase  this year, consumers will face double-digit rate increases in coming years.  </P> <P> Several council members on Wednesday asked that the DWP and the administrative  office attempt to reach an agreement about whether the hike is necessary, but  Norman Nichols, DWP general manager, argued that he -- not the city's  administrative officer -- has the sole responsibility to recommend increases  under the city Charter.  </P> <P> "What you're telling me is that I can take it or leave it," responded  Councilman Hal Bernson. "Well, I can leave it. That's OK."  </P></p>

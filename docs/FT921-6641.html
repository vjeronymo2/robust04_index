			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (4): President shifts an elephant - The country's political future THE DOMINICAN newspapers were full of the story: would Mami the elephant be moved from her home in a park in Santo Domingo to allow a construction project to go ahead? The answer was handed down by the one man who could decide on the issue: President Joaquin Balaguer. Mami, he decided, should be moved. The popular elephant justified his decision by surviving the shift to a zoo. The story illustrates more than the occasional comedy of life in this country. It shows how many of even the most trivial decisions are made by the office of the president. The man who has held this office for much of the last 30 years, and was an influential figure in the 31-year Trujillo dictatorship which preceded it, is President Joaquin Balaguer. Now 85 years old and blind, the president has said that he will not run again when his sixth four-year term ends in 1994. It is hard to find a Dominican who believes him. For Mr Balaguer's disability should not be mistaken for intellectual frailty. He seems to have lost little of his political astuteness and continues to outflank his opponents. The opposition parties are fragmented and the economy is improving: few people see why, this side of the Rubicon, he should not stand again. The constitution that Mr Balaguer helped to fashion in 1966 allows him to rule his country as a constitutional dictatorship, according to Mr Pedro Catrain, the lawyer and political commentator. Even though the president's Christian Social Reform Party (PRSC) is in a minority, the lower house is rarely able to stand in his way. He signs all the cheques for central government. Every week, he travels round the country to open government projects where he personally distributes largesse such as chickens and baseball equipment to waiting crowds. He is in the long tradition of the caudillo, the Latin American strongman, expert in the exercise and preservation of power. So skilfully has he done this that the other institutions of state have been debilitated, some fatally. This has been positive in the case of the armed forces, which have been allowed to exert influence in a limited way - they dominate, for example, commerce with Haiti. On the other hand, an undeveloped legislative and judicial system will hinder the country's attempts to move into the modern world. Furthermore, it is difficult to see where the country's next leader will come from. The other grand old man of Dominican politics, former president Juan Bosch, is only three years younger than Mr Balaguer. Mr Bosch claims he was defrauded from victory in the 1990 election: the result was certainly close. But he does not appear to offer a great shift in style from Mr Balaguer and in any case is seen as a weakened force, partly because of his advanced age. While he claims the government is illegal, he has been at odds with the deputies of his Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) who, for example, voted with the government to pass budget legislation. Also in opposition, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) is seeking reform of the country's weakened institutions, such as the legal system. While its leader, Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, represents social democratic forces, he faces two handicaps. He is black and the country has never elected a black leader, and his party has suffered from the attention given to the trial for corruption of Mr Salvador Jorge Blanco, PRD president from 1982-86. Yet there is no PRD monopoly on corruption in the Dominican Republic (the highest paid officials and ministers receive an annual salary of about USDollars 3,000) and the trial is seen by some of the president's critics as politically-motivated. In Mr Balaguer's own party, half a dozen potential candidates have emerged. They include Mr Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, an economist; Mr Ramon Perez Martinez, a deputy for Santo Domingo; Mr Jacinto Peynado, a senator; Mr Caonabo Javier Castillo, administrator of the country's reserve bank; Mr Luis Toral, governor of the central bank; Mr Donald Reid Cabral, a former foreign minister; and Mr Carlos Morales Troncoso, the vice-president. While some of these candidates would represent a bigger change from the current style than others, none has the political support to match the incumbent leader. The outlook for Dominican politics is thus one of great certainty - until the moment that President Balaguer goes. After that, what will happen is anyone's guess.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Mutual destruction: Alison Smith on institutions that have outgrown their ownership structure It seems cruel to propose that the principle of 'mutual ownership', where ordinary customers can own the organisation, should go. The term suggests a degree of cosiness in an otherwise cut-throat world where individuals have to deal with large, faceless financial institutions. Take building societies, the mutual organisations which dominate the UK mortgage market. My savings help to fund your mortgage. My mortgage is funded by other people's savings. By becoming borrowers - or opening investment accounts - we become part-owners of the organisation and, so, are entitled to good treatment. Or take mutual life insurance companies, which account for a significant share of the sector. As policyholders and part-owners, we do not have to hand out a separate portion of profits to shareholders. The reality, however, is somewhat different. If customers are treated well by a society or life company it is generally because of fierce competition in retail financial services for new customers, not because they have a one-in-a-million say in the organisation's strategy. Mutual organisations have come a long way - and diversified substantially - since their origins in the 18th century. Many are now financial conglomerates controlling billions of pounds in assets and funds. Control of these organisations by those who own them is so fragmented that it scarcely exists. In short, most of them have outgrown their ownership structure. Mutuals counter that their system of one-member-one-vote is fairer than companies where the size of a shareholder's vote is decided by the size of the shareholding. But their argument is weak: the scattered nature of mutual ownership means that no one has enough of a stake to challenge how the board behaves. Except in extreme circumstances, most members do not bother to play an active part in overseeing the management of a mutual organisation. Meanwhile, the increasing complexity of financial services, and the obscure accounting practices of life companies, discourage members from questioning board decisions, even if they do vote. For example, the Halifax, the UK's largest building society, has 5.5m members. But fewer than 150,000 took part, either in person or by proxy, in decisions at this year's annual general meeting. Similarly, at Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer with more than 2.2m policyholders who are members, only 53 attended its annual general meeting in April. In response to this, the mutuals would argue that their managers' strategies are held to account in other ways: they must attract new customers and satisfy credit ratings agencies. Even the media are not afraid to criticise. Their argument, however, misses two points. First, none of these checks necessarily replicates the interests of those who own the business. Second, public limited companies are subject to similar disciplines - and attract more attention and provide more information because their share prices are quoted on the stock exchange. The mutuals' argument falls apart completely, however, when they try to defend the protection they have against hostile takeovers. Under UK legislation, neither building society nor mutual life company boards are obliged to consult their members about takeover offers they oppose. While the position of shareholders in PLCs is not a financial equivalent of the golden age of Athenian democracy, the model does offer features lacking in mutuals. First, the concentration of votes held by powerful shareholders increases pressure on the board to take account of the interests of the owners, particularly in areas such as efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Second, PLC status frees individuals to decide whether to retain or sell their stake in the organisation. Those who disagree with a PLC's strategy can simply sell and cease to be owners. They do not have to change their life insurance or mortgage in order to do so. Later this month, the government is due to publish a consultation paper on the future of building societies, which will include suggestions on how to make them more accountable to members. Generally, members are not seeking greater accountability - most would be happy if their savings or mortgage organisation were answerable to experts at big institutions. Their primary relationship is as customers, not owners. The Treasury should widen discussion by proposing the conversion of mutual financial organisations to PLCs, except, perhaps, for the smallest. Making members of mutuals effective owners is a lost cause.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim says  that Malaysia's sound economy was unshaken by losses incurred by  Bank Negara [Central Bank] in its foreign exchange [forex]  dealings. He said that Malaysia's reserves were very strong and  that the country's assets which exceed 100 billion ringgit are  very huge in the context of gross domestic product. The latest  figure which showed 76 billion ringgit reserves was quite  progressive. He pointed out that even if the Central Bank did  not trade, the country would still have lost money simply  because of the appreciating ringgit on the back of the robust  economy. Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also finance minister, was  responding to questions by Swedish journalists accompanying  Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on a three-day visit to  Malaysia. The deputy prime minister said that he had in 1992  ordered Bank Negara cease trading in the forex market after  learning that the Central Bank had been incurring losses.  Describing the forex losses of 9 billion ringgit in 1992 and 5.7  billion ringgit last year by Bank Negara as a serious error in  judgment, he said he had instructed the Central Bank at that  time not to excessively trade in reserves. He said that the  Finance Ministry became aware of the losses about one and a half  years ago.    The Swedish journalists also posed several questions ranging  from Malaysia-Sweden bilateral relations to human rights. Datuk  Sri Anwar said Malaysia did not condone abuse of human rights by  any country or government. But at the same time, Malaysia does  not expect the Western countries to insist that certain  countries should observe their rules. He said Western countries  should learn to understand and appreciate the situation in  certain countries in the East, especially Asia. It was true to  some extent that developed countries in the West had a lot to  offer developing countries in the East, but they should also  learn to accept and respect the values and norms of the  countries in the East, particularly in Asia.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / US housing starts up THE Commerce Department yesterday reported a 5.5 per cent increase in US housing starts between November and December, a larger increase than expected and fresh evidence that the recovery is becoming more firmly established, Michael Prowse writes. For 1992 as a whole, starts rose 18.5 per cent, the first annual gain since 1986. Starts rose in all parts of the country last month, except the west, reflecting continuing recession in California. Building permits, a guide to future construction activity, also rose sharply last month to their highest level in nearly three years. The rise in starts follows a mildly encouraging assessment of regional conditions from the Federal Reserve in its 'Beige Book' but found little evidence of job creation.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Nippon Life lifts Lehman stake Nippon Life, the Japanese insurer, is to lift its stake in Lehman Brothers to 12.2 per cent in a deal which values the US investment bank at Dollars 2.7bn. News of the extra investment by the insurer came in a registration statement filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spin-off of Lehman from its parent, American Express. Under the plan, announced in January, American Express will inject extra capital as part of a Dollars 1.25bn recapitalisation of Lehman to strengthen its balance sheet and distribute shares in the bank to its own shareholders. Yesterday, it emerged that Nippon has chosen to exercise an option to buy an additional 3.5m shares in Lehman for Dollars 89.2m, lifting its stake to 12.2 per cent from 9 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The insurer first bought a 13 per cent stake in Shearson Lehman Hutton, Lehman Brothers' predecessor, at the height of the 1980s bull market, and has since had the right to lift its stake back to that level. The investment will cement Nippon's position as Lehman's biggest shareholder, with two seats on the company's restructured nine-strong board. By implication it also puts a value of about Dollars 25.50 on Lehman's shares and valued the whole company at Dollars 2.7bn, slightly more than book value. This is below the Dollars 3.5bn level talked of by American Express executives at the end of January. However, since then the turmoil in the financial markets has hit the share prices of other investment banks. Lehman's profit record has been held back by a higher cost base than its main US competitors. The bank has been working to bring its costs into line with rivals, and is to take a Dollars 30m pre-tax charge against first-quarter earnings to cover cuts in staffing.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Builders to probe conduct of banks BUILDERS ARE to monitor the behaviour of banks, which they claim are unnecessarily forcing businesses into liquidation. The campaign, called Bank Watch, has been launched by the Chartered Institute of Building, which represents more than 30,000 managers and directors of construction companies. The move, announced yesterday, came two days after 18 MPs put their names to an early day motion expressing concern at Clydesdale Bank's 'cynical' decision to call in the receivers at Lilley Group, the Glasgow-based construction company. Mr Julian Barlow, institute commercial director, said that there had been a sharp rise in members' complaints of undue pressure from banks leading to an increase in bankruptcies and liquidations. 'Companies become even more vulnerable when a recession ends and land prices start to rise again and banks can see an opportunity to get their money back from selling assets,' he said. 'We want our members to monitor the behaviour of banks so that we can prepare a dossier which can be presented as evidence to lending institutions, MPs and government ministers.' Lilley Group was put into receivership after a rescue package failed to obtain the unanimous support of its bankers.</p>

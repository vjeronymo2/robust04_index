			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "mer": "DSP/PSD of Switzerland Founded"] </F>   [Excerpts] Fribourg, 4 June -- The Democratic Social Party  [DSP/PSD], which constituted itself as a Swiss political party  in Fribourg on 4 June, does not see itself as a rival to the  Social Democratic Party [SP], but as an alternative. For years,  the party only existed in the form of cantonal organizations.  One of its principles says that only a strong economic sector  can guarantee social peace and progress. [passage omitted]    According to the statutes, the party seeks to create a  social  system that would permit all sections of the population --  particularly the socially disadvantaged and the economically  weak classes -- to "lead a life worthy of human beings." In  this context, the basic political statement says that the  DSP/PSD addresses all those fellow citizens who not only think  in democratic and social terms, but also intend to act in this  sense and spirit. The DSP/PSD advocates a democratic and social  state ruled by the law and the institutions of such a state, as  well as the intellectual, economic, and military defense of the  country. The DSP/PSD advocates a market economy marked by  social justice, by respect and responsibility for man and the  environment. In the implementation of its political goals, it  will not be guided by "utopian political ideas," but will pursue  realpolitik "through continuous reform."    To the surprise of everyone, not one president was elected,  but three -- in the form of a copresidium. In the interest of  maintaining the symmetry of the three cantonal parties, which  are already represented in the government or at least in the  cantonal parliament, Jules Grand (Basel city), Stefan Hosang  (Graubuenden), and Jean-Bernard Repond (Fribourg) were elected.  This organizational structure will be maintained until the next  meeting of delegates. This meeting can agree on a change. For  the time being, the party's office will be in Basel.

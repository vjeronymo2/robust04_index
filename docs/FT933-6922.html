			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Interest shown in RiverBus service ROBSON RHODES, liquidator of London's RiverBus, yesterday said it had been approached by a number of companies interested in operating some of its commuter services on the Thames, which were suspended at the end of last week. 'We hope to sell the business at the earliest opportunity,' the liquidator said. 'We have already been contacted by several potential purchasers and will now begin negotiations in earnest.' The operators decided to close the RiverBus service after a 15-month struggle following the financial collapse of its principal underwriter, Olympia &amp; York, the Canary Wharf developer.</p>

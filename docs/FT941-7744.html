			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Temple Bar Net asset value at Temple Bar Investment Trust, taking prior charges at par, rose 23.6 per cent from 310.9p to 384.17p over the 1993 year. The performance was in line with the trust's benchmark - the FT-SE-A All-Share Index - which improved 23.4 per cent over the 12 months. Attributable revenue dipped to Pounds 7.67m (Pounds 7.82m), reflecting a full term interest cost on the trust's Pounds 25m debenture issue and 'continued weak dividend growth in the UK'. A lower tax charge helped restrict the decline in earnings per share to 13.319p (13.57p). A recommended final distribution of 8.95p lifts the total for the year to 13.55p.</p>

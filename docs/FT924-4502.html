			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Shephard firm on Tec funds DIFFICULTIES in imple-menting the government's guarantee of a job or a training place for all school leavers arose from a lack of capacity among employers in some areas and not lack of central funding, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, told the Commons yesterday. Insisting that there was no shortage of resources, she said they were sufficient to provide 244,000 places while demand was estimated at 216,000. Mrs Shephard said she had written to Mr Ron Leighton, the Labour chairman of the Commons employment committee, explaining how the guarantee was being met. Miss Joan Lestor (Lab Eccles), highlighted the difficulties caused in implementing the guarantee in the Salford area by the growing number of company failures. When Mr Stephen Milligan (C Eastleigh) said 1,000 people in Hampshire were unable to get a training place, Mrs Shephard acknowledged the difficulty faced by employers in some areas. 'They will be helped to meet the guarantee by the end of this month,' she said. Mrs Shephard also emphasised that there was always a 'surge of demand' in the autumn, when young people sought training places. Reaffirming that the government stood by the guarantee, she said adequate resources were available to training and enterprise councils (Tecs) and their Scottish equivalents (Lecs). She undertook to examine any complaints that adequate funds were not available and said the local initiative fund which allowed Tecs and Lecs to develop new ideas in support of training and business growth would be increased by Pounds 12m in 1993-94.</p>

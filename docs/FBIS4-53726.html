			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  discussed ways to reinvigorate the nation's economy with six  former prime ministers, deputy premiers and business leader.    Meeting them over luncheon, President Kim said he would  execute "clean politics" where industries will be able to manage  their businesses without bothering to read the faces of the  government and politicians.    The six elders present at the Chongwadae [presidential  offices] working luncheon were ex-Prime Ministers Sin Hyon-hwak,  Yu Chang-sun and Yi Hyon-chae, ex-Deputy Premiers Kim Chun-sung  and Yi Han-bin, and Chong Su-chang, former head of the Korea  Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    The attendees called for resolute improvement of the  economic  structure with a view to enhancing the nation's international  competitiveness, steady pursuit of deregulation, and preparation  against the sudden collapse of North Korea.    "We should not sit idly by simply because the economy goes  well. We must resolutely improve our economic structure through  technology development and expanded investment," Sin Hyon-hwak  said.    Former Prime Minister Nam Tok-u and ex-Deputy Premiers Sin  Pyong-hyon and Cho Sun were also invited, but they failed to  attend due to their overseas trips and other personal reasons.</p>

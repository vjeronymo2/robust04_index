			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (14): Three-tier structure crumbles - Distribution Channels, a year of change THE past year has seen big changes in the ownership of the companies which distribute computer equipment in the UK. In general, control of the leading companies has moved outside of this country. In the past 12 months Frontline, one of the most successful of UK computer distributors, has been taken over by German distributor Computer 2000, while network specialist QDL has fallen to Micro Macro, a Netherlands combine, and in the past few weeks Software Limited has been taken over by Ingram Micro of the US. These changes of ownership are arguably less important than the changes in the structures of computer distribution channels that have been taking place. A few years ago computer distribution channels in the UK could be defined quite easily. The manufacturer at the top would sell equipment to distributors, who in their turn would sell it on to computer dealers. But more recently this three-tier structure has begun to erode. Pressure on profit margins has encouraged manufacturers to remove the centre distributor tier, and to deal direct with computer dealers, and even with customers. At the same time, we have seen the growth of the super dealer, operations such as Computacenter and Technology which are large enough to deal directly with suppliers, and dealer/distributors. The two types of operation meet in the middle, with dealer-led companies such as Computacenter and Technology becoming, to all intents and purposes, distributors, and with distribution operations such as Rossendale, adding computer dealer operations to broaden their base. Pressure on margins is such that it is difficult to see, in the minds of many analysts, how an operation that deals solely as an intermediary, taking equipment from a manufacturer and passing it on to a computer dealer without gaining any extra profit margin from selling direct to users, can survive. One danger for the trade-only distributor is that the market will split, leaving such companies handling mainly the more esoteric product ranges and lower volume shipments to smaller dealers. As the bigger dealerships are beginning to show, and as smaller distributors which move back into direct sales confirms, large amounts of money can be made through a combination of relatively limited product ranges shipped at high volumes. Mr Derek Lewis, head of Technology, argues that large corporate dealerships such as his own company should concentrate on on two, maybe three ranges of computer hardware. Mr Lewis's company is a member of Comec, one of two big European dealer associations, and the implications of this are clear - if the dealers throughout Europe who are members of Comec decide on an official range of computers, they can drive a very hard bargain, forcing the margins of manufacturers down. This worries Mr Don Pinchbeck, managing director at Epson UK. He feels that 'the reseller who is pan-European can seize power from manufacturers'. Comec and the International Computer Group (ICG), which is the rival association of which Computacenter is a member, can through the combined buying power of their membership overturn the food chain, controlling the manufacturers rather than being controlled. If this happens, Mr Pinchbeck sees computer manufacturers becoming very much like the suppliers of UK supermarkets, having prices, terms and conditions dictated to them by a few all-powerful chains. A possible escape-route, he feels, involves manufacturers learning from the motor industry and moving machines tailored to individual specification straight off the production line. The manufacturer, in effect, would become a systems integrator. Other manufacturers are however exploring different routes to survival. One of the basic planks on which Compaq was founded was its determination not to sell direct, but in recent years, as the power of its equipment has increased, the company has found itself evolving what is in effect a direct sales force that does not sell direct. With the exception of the large chains, a company's individual dealers do not have the resources to sell adequately into what is, in effect, the minicomputer market. If a company will not set up the kind of direct sales force traditionally used to sell minis, it finds itself forced to do an increasing amount of hand holding for the dealers who are making the sales. Compaq UK has in the past few years hired a number of staff from mini manufacturers, and Mr Gian Carlo Bisone, head of European marketing, is no stranger to these techniques. The nature of the market accentuates these problems. Mr Bisone describes the primary characteristic of the dealer channel as being that it has no money, and Compaq pursues intricate schemes in order to inject money into it without the extra cash disappearing in the shape of increased discounts to customers. Training and joint marketing programmes are examples of how this can be done. Other manufacturers are engaged in heavy support programmes for their dealer base, and one possible consequence of such approaches is that dealers  -particularly those who are not part of large associations - will become more closely bound to single manufacturers. These manufacturers may, albeit accidentally, convert their dealer base into what is effectively a direct sales force. In the UK, Apple has traditionally taken a similar approach to Compaq, attempting to keep prices and the level of its dealer expertise high, and taking a highly combative line with discount houses. However, it has created a problem for itself, in terms of sales channels, with its new low-cost range of machines. There are rumours that the company will later this year release a range aimed fair and square at the home/games market which indicates that the problem can only get worse. Selling these without overturning the applecart and forcing down prices on its higher specification machines is a puzzle Apple is still working on. Mr John Sculley, chief executive officer, has made confusing and perhaps ominous references to rapid turnover-style outlets. There is an alternative that Apple will almost certainly reject. If manufacturers in general find themselves facing lower margins on the machines they sell into distribution channels, is it not logical for them to consider reducing the number of tiers in the channels, or perhaps eliminate them completely by selling direct to users? Speaking at a conference in Dusseldorf last month, Mr Billy Ho, Mitac associate vice-president told the company's distributors that, at least for machines that are priced at commodity level, the company would have to face up to a reduction in the number of tiers in the channels. Mitac, a Taiwanese company, is one of the largest computer manufacturers in the world, although its name isn't that well known to users because it has traditionally built for other computer companies. His view was that Mitac distributors worldwide would have to begin to sell direct to users in order to increase sales and maintain profitability, and if as seems likely other manufacturers are thinking along similar lines, the future could hold increased terrors for independent dealers.

Contrary to  some analysts, we wrote that this visit would exert a positive  effect on the trend of Middle East talks, similar to the  previous visits.    The previous visit by Christopher culminated in the signing  of the accord between Rabin and 'Arafat on autonomy for Gaza and  Jericho. The latest visit resulted in setting up a meeting  between the presidents of the United States and Syria, Clinton  and Hafiz al-Asad, in Geneva.    The two presidents are expected to meet in Geneva at the end  of January to exchange views on the Middle East peace talks,  which have been described as a turning point in the Middle East.    This meeting comes at a time of stalemate in the Middle East  talks. 'Arafat's opponents -- who are being supported by Syria  and by the Government of Lebanon and Hizballah who are involved  in this conflict -- have not yet shown any inclination to  compromise. In view of the current situation, if the meeting  between the heads of the United States and Syria takes place and  is successful, it could be considered a turning point in the  Middle East, because we would then witness some changes in the  region.    Syria and its President wish to be considered the leaders of  the Arab world and to have the key to peace or opposition to  Israel in their hands. One of the reasons for Damascus'  opposition to the Rabin-'Arafat accord is the fact that Syria  was forestalled by 'Arafat, who shook hands with Rabin before  Syria could.    If the covert talks between Syria and Israel that have been  going on bear fruit, Damascus will have taken the control of the  key to peace and Lebanon may follow their lead.    If the United States now grants some privileges to Syria and  remove it from its list of supporters of terrorism, it will be  merely because Washington and Tel Aviv are seeking to attract  Damascus into the coterie of the peace proponents along with  other opponents of 'Arafat, including Lebanon. That is why the  'Arafat-Rabin talks are taking place.    At present Syria is the most important supporter of the  opponents of 'Arafat and the PLO-Israel accord. The convocation  of the 10-member Palestinian group in Damascus marks the  resumption of the opponents' activities. Similarly, the  Lebanese Government, which has problems with Israel over its  southern border, is following Syria's policy. In the event  Syria joins the peace trend, the groups opposing 'Arafat as well  as Lebanon will be forced to resolve their problems with the  Zionists and to halt their opposition.    Syria wants the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights,  which have been occupied by the Zionists since the 1967 six-day  Arab-Israel war, after which they were annexed by the Zionist  regime with the endorsement of their parliament. Israel has  given some guarantees to Syria in this regard, but Syria needs  the United States to intervene and endorse these guarantees;  that is why Hafiz al-Asad and Clinton are going to meet and  exchange views.    If Hafiz al-Asad can obtain sufficient guarantees from  Clinton in Geneva, he will certainly join the peace trend  without doubt. In that case, the old Camp David scenario will  be implemented in full, and the problem of the Middle East and  Palestine will be completely resolved, in the opinion of the  United States. Of course, suppression of the Hizballah and the  Islamic movements will be the next stage; and at that juncture,  the governments of Syria and Lebanon will have conflicting  stances.</p>

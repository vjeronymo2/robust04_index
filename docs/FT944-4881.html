			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (4): Fees cut as trade rises - Futures and options Soffex, the electronic exchange for options and futures on Swiss securities, has had a good year in spite of the poor performance of the underlying share market, writes Ian Rodger. And that seems to be mainly because it offers investors the opportunity to move quickly on both the put and call sides. By the end of October, the number of option contracts traded on stocks by its 54 members was 15.3m, 14 per cent more than in the whole of last year. Option contracts traded on the Swiss Market Index (SMI) totalled 5.6m by the end of October, and Mr Otto Nageli, chief executive of Soffex, is forecasting 6.7m for the full year, a 20 per cent advance over last year. Volume in the first 10 months on the futures contract on Swiss government bonds (CONF) was 880,000 contracts, more than three times the 271,000 traded in the whole of last year. 'That is an astonishing figure by Swiss standards, taking account of the limited experience with these instruments,' Mr Nageli says. As a result of the increased volumes, Soffex recently announced fee reductions for next year, including a consolidation of fee zones from six to three. Fees on futures have also been cut, notably the physical delivery fee on the CONF future from SFr5 to SFr2. Soffex introduced a long- term (18 months) option last May. It is on the SMI index, and so far accounts for only a small part of total SMI option trading  -for example, 6 per cent in September. Mr Nageli says the open interest volume - 35,000 at the end of October - is a better indicator of its popularity as it is more of an investment vehicle than one for trading. By contrast, the option on CONF futures, launched in January, has not been a success, with only some 50,000 contracts traded since its introduction. 'It is difficult to get people to buy an option on a derivative,' he admits. The exchange may introduce long-term options on individual stocks, but will not launch any products until the integration with the new Swiss electronic stock exchange is completed next year. Soffex attracted some criticism a year ago for halting its plan to permit cross-border trading, apparently because its directors wanted to postpone expansion until after the planned integration with the Swiss stock exchanges. However, last May, it created a Frankfurt access point through the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) and accepted three Frankfurt-based banks as members. Similar arrangements with brokers in other countries depend on the attitude of regulators to the sharing of jurisdiction. The trend in Switzerland's two other derivative product markets this year has sharply diverged. Participants in the over-the-counter market say that it has continued to grow, but at a more moderate rate than in 1993. As with Soffex, investors can buy products to take advantage of falling prices. 'We are very satisfied with the overall volume,' a Swiss Bank Corporation derivatives trader in Zurich says. By contrast, the listed option market has had a terrible year. The value of listed options traded on Swiss stock exchanges plunged from a frenzied SFr4.6bn as the market reached its peak in January to only SFr756.9m in October. OZ Holding, the subsidiary of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, accumulated a loss of SFr12.6m in the first nine months compared with a SFr21.5m profit in the same period of 1993. Mr Ebner noted in his report to shareholders in October that the market was characterised by low trading volumes and low prices. Analysts say that the listed market is mainly for call warrants, which anticipate price rises in underlying shares.</p>

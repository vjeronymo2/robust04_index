			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Japanese alliance group's name is true to character It is not always easy to pack a message into a name. That is the moral of the national search for a new name, concluded after a tortured debate last night, by Japan's alliance of nine political opposition groups. The alliance, due to transform itself into a mega-party at a mega-party on December 10, settled briefly on an English version of its name only to change its mind twice before announcing a final version, the New Frontier party. It is imbued with more meaning than its apparent blandness might suggest. Party officials had asked the public to fax to Tokyo headquarters suggestions for a title that would evoke 'the newness and freshness of our group . . . and perhaps also imply such qualities as environmental awareness and international responsibility.' The winning offering, chosen yesterday from 100,000 suggestions, sent in by party friends and supporters, was shin-shin-to, the literal translation of which is New-new party. It won the most votes from a poll of the party's 213 upper and lower house parliamentarians, advised by a panel of 15 academics, media folk and artists, including Ms Fumio Hosokawa, a former pin-up girl. It was, officials said, a demonstration of the open style of democracy with which the new party hopes to challenge the backroom ways of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's factional barons. Critics that say New Frontier party sounds pretty similar to the four other existing or recently deceased Japanese parties with 'new' in their names. The party's name could have been worse. Runners-up included the Party of Hope, the New Wind party, the Pure New party and the Human party. Plain New-new party, while snappy, was thought an injustice to the subtlety of the kanji characters of which it is composed, an example of how written Japanese can be as impenetrable to native-speakers as it is to foreigners. The second character of the name means something more than just new - something like progress, or advance, said one of the NFP's political advisers. So it was that the title started yesterday evening as New Progressive party. Officials thought, on reflection, that sounded 'odd' and changed it to New Frontiers party, before Ms Hosokawa's panel finally lopped off the 's'. Endearingly, one of the party's advisers confesses that the second, forward-looking, 'shin' is not entirely appropriate because the NFP is dominated by conservatives - former members of the ruling LDP. Confused? That's Japanese politics.</p>

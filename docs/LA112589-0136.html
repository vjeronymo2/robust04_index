			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'TIS THE SEASON TO SHOP -- BUT IT'S OFF TO SLOW START;  </P> <P> RETAILING: SALES IN THE SOUTHLAND WERE CALLED DISAPPOINTING. ANALYSTS HAVE  PREDICTED A QUIET HOLIDAY BUYING SEASON.  </P> <P> America pushed aside the turkey and trimmings Friday and instead nibbled on the  Christmas merchandise in the nation's shopping malls.  </P> <P> Although thousands of shoppers flocked to the stores, many retailers and  consumers found the turnout -- and appetite for buying -- surprisingly light  for a day that often is the busiest of the Christmas shopping season.  </P> <P> "It's a quiet start," said Leonard Barron, a salesman at the J.R. Jonathan's  shoe store in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, at midday.  </P> <P> Mona Rad, manager of the Petite Sophisticate women's clothing store in the  Glendale Galleria, said: "Before, money was no object. Now they (shoppers) are  watching what they're spending."  </P> <P> The disappointing sales at many stores throughout the Southland and the rest of  the nation squared with the predictions of a number of retail industry experts.  Among other things, analysts have said that shoppers may be getting worried  about signs of a softening economy and bored with the merchandise retailers are  offering this year.  </P> <P> Barbara Bambrook of Anaheim is a case in point. Taking a break from shopping at  MainPlace/Santa Ana, Bambrook and her husband, Gary, a freight driver, said  they plan to hold the line on spending this Christmas by not charging  purchases.  </P> <P> "This year we're only spending what we can afford," she explained.  </P> <P> Taking a break from shopping at the Glendale Galleria, Terry Norton, a  contractor from Burbank, said he expects to spend about 15% less than last year  on gifts for his friends and family.  </P> <P> "The spirit just doesn't seem to be here," Norton said.  </P> <P> His family's Christmas is "going to be nice but it's going to be less. I'm not  going to buy the big-ticket items."  </P> <P> "All year, it's sale, sale, sale," Norton added. "Who wants to go to another  sale?"  </P> <P> All the same, the retailers generating the most enthusiasm among customers  seemed to be relying heavily on sharp markdowns -- a practice that once was  limited mainly to the days immediately after Christmas.  </P> <P> Some of the markdowns stemmed from turmoil in the retailing industry that has  brought such major companies as Campeau Corp. and L.J. Hooker Corp. to their  knees. In New York, for example, shoppers jammed into B. Altman, an old-line  chain that, with the exception of one store, is being liquidated by Hooker to  pay creditors.  </P> <P> Two shoppers at Limited Express in Santa Ana -- Pat Almeida of Santa Ana and  her daughter, Kristi Bowin -- found discounts of 40% on merchandise with prices  already slashed in half. "We bought five pieces -- a skirt, a jumper, a top, a  coat-sweater, a pair of pants -- and three sets of earrings -- all for $117,"  Bowin said. "Everything was on sale."  </P> <P> Those specialty shops with genuine bargains, in fact, seemed to find no  shortage of customers. At L.A. Eyeworks at South Coast Plaza, customers began  lining up at 8:30 a.m. -- 30 minutes before the eyeglass store opened -- to  take advantage of the annual sale that brought discounts as high as 70% and  eyeglass frames for as little as $10.  </P> <P> For the most part, however, the shopping at South Coast and in at least two  other top Orange County malls, Newport Center/Fashion Island and Westminster  Mall, didn't pick up until close to noon.  </P> <P> "People take it leisurely on a holiday," said Maura Eggan, South Coast Plaza's  spokesperson. So while prime spaces could be found at the center's Crystal  Court annex, the main mall's parking lot was packed by early afternoon.  </P> <P> By contrast, at the newly renovated Fashion Island, business was steady through  the day but ample parking could be found. Mall spokeswoman Eileen Bohen  predicted that by the end of the day, 40,000 shoppers would have visited the  Newport Beach mall, which just completed a lengthy remodeling.  </P> <P> Several shoppers at the University Towne Centre mall in San Diego, where the  economy is heavily influenced by military spending, expressed concern over  proposed defense budget cuts.  </P> <P> Paul Fisher, who works at defense contractor McDonnell Douglas in San Diego,  said: "We'll spend pretty much as we always do, although we may stay within our  budget more. We won't be as extravagant."  </P> <P> Bus driver Joe Anderson, shopping at San Diego's downtown Horton Plaza, said he  is cutting back on his Christmas spending. "The rent's going up, the gas and  electricity rates are going up. Things are much too expensive here."  </P> <P> Anderson said he is going to offer his children a choice between a Christmas  present and "a crisp $10 bill."  </P> <P> His prediction: "They'll take the bill."  </P> <P> Aside from trying to attract shoppers with price cuts, retailers also tried to  provide some extra conveniences. Target stores, for example, opened at 7 a.m.  and many others began business at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> "The emphasis is on service," said Linda Cerro, marketing director at Mall of  Orange, where several major stores are adding more gift wrap or box locations,  she said. "They're all trying to provide better service . . . so there are a  lot of prepackaged gifts this year, and shirts and ties that come coordinated  so the customer can grab them and run."  </P> <P> The mall itself has added a pianist and broadened its customer service center  by adding an expanded parcel checking service. "Now we offer everything from  gift wrap to calling taxis to free strollers to (expanded) parcel shipping,"  Cerro said.  </P> <P> Even if the overall trend appeared to be one of disappointing sales for  retailers, there were some hot spots.  </P> <P> By 9 a.m., the big Houston Galleria shopping mall was packed. At the Omni, a  downtown shopping mall in Miami with mostly business and tourist customers,  Jordan Marsh's general manager, Joe Mazloom, reported that "business has been  very good. People seem to be shopping much earlier this year."  </P> <P> There were even signs of hope for retailers in the San Francisco Bay area,  where merchants expressed optimism that the Christmas season would revive sales  that have been sluggish since the Oct. 17 earthquake.  </P> <P> In Manhattan, throngs of eager shoppers moved more quickly on foot than the  city's cabs and buses, caught in the gridlocked start of New York's annual  Christmas season rush. With nearly five inches of Thanksgiving snow, the first  on that holiday in more than half a century, there was no shortage of people in  the Christmas shopping spirit.  </P> <P> Even if sales were sluggish, some of the best part of the Christmas spirit was  apparent at the malls.  </P> <P> Possibly the busiest counter at Fox Hills Mall was a small booth manned by  three volunteers who scurried their way through 50 customers in less than two  hours. And they weren't even selling anything.  </P> <P> It was the Los Angeles County Foster Parent Assn.'s annual Holiday Dream Tree,  and shoppers were lining up to grab colored cards printed with the Christmas  wishes of the area's neglected children. One sample card read: "Age 14. Sex M.  1st Choice: Watch. 2nd Choice: Football."  </P> <P> "We really haven't had problems this year," said Delois George, a Dream Tree  volunteer. "The public really buys gifts for these children. It's been busy  today."  </P> <P> Times Staff Writers Patrice Apodaca, Maria La Ganga, Nancy Rivera Brooks, Linda  Williams and Irene Chang in Los Angeles, Mary Ann Galante in Orange County,  Chris Kraul in San Diego, Lisa Romaine in New York, Liane Hart in Houston, Ann  Rovin in Denver, Tracy Shryer in Chicago and Suzette Parmley in San Francisco  contributed to this report.  </P></p>

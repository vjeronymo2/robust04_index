			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mysterious Meeting"] </F>   [Text] The misgivings caused by the reports about the  capping of the Agni programme, which were not entirely removed  by the Prime Minister's denial in Parliament, are likely to be  strengthened by the proposed "secret" Indo-U.S. parleys on  security issues in London. Coming as they do in the wake of the  Strobe Talbott visit one of whose main objectives was to  persuade India and Pakistan to take a fresh look at their  security perceptions, these developments are bound to raise  questions and even fuel suspicions about a greater and more  direct American involvement in the affairs of the subcontinent  than has been the case in the recent past. This is all the more  so because the United States is known to be unhappy about  India's efforts to attain self-sufficiency in missile  technology, as its embargo on the supply of Russian cryogenic  rockets showed. Washington would also like India to be more  receptive towards its plan for a nuclear-free South Asia. One of  the purposes of the proposed multilateral conference on  disarmament will be to discuss this very issue, notwithstanding  India's long-held contention that non-nuclear pockets are  meaningless when a selected group of countries are allowed to  retain their deadly arsenal. It may well be that the London  meeting will deal with some of these problems. But what is not a  little disturbing is the unusual emphasis on secrecy placed by  the Indian government on the conference.    Subsequent clarifications that this was the fourth meeting  in  a series and a prelude to the Washington summit between Mr  Narasimha Rao and Mr Clinton are unlikely to be fully  convincing. Moreover, the inclusion of a retired diplomat known  for his preference for the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] will be  considered significant. It is, of course, up to the government  to choose its team, but what is nevertheless necessary is that  there should be an element of transparency in the entire  exercise. Even if it is granted that diplomatic exchanges cannot  be conducted in a market place, the government must still inform  Parliament about what is being discussed with a country which  not long ago had irked many people in India with its needlessly  provocative attitude towards a complex and sensitive issue like  Kashmir. There is also a need to reiterate India's position on  some of the contentious issues if only to make it abundantly  clear that there will be no compromises on matters crucial to  Indian security. Since our concerns relate not to Pakistan  alone, the government will do well to pay heed to what the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] leaders said in Parliament about the  "trap" into which India may walk at the five plus two plus two  conference. The point the opposition members made about the  holding of the latest meeting in a third country is also  relevant, for it suggests that neither government wanted too  close a monitoring of the discussions. However, such a  calculation is a naive one in this age of instant  communications. So New Delhi will be well advised to shed its  attitude of secrecy and be more open about the talks.</p>

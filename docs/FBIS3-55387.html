The essence is the same, however. The economics  professors who gathered in Boston from the country's leading  universities gave President Bill Clinton a solid "B."    For his first year of administration, especially in the  sphere of the economy, the young President gets a "four plus" as  though there were no minus point. But the positive notes would  have been even stronger if it had not been for what one  professor called "the green light for President Yeltsin's  vacillations."    The economics professors call the U.S. Administration's new  approach to the rate of economic transformations in Russia  following the parliamentary elections "indulging Yeltsin." Both  advocates of more confident state intervention in economic  regulation (the Massachusetts school) and Harvard adherents of  profound market freedom believe that any delay in switching from  the state plan to the market will lead only to additional  difficulties for people, and will still further compromise the  ideas of democracy.    Believing that during his recent visit to Moscow, Vice  President Al Gore sent the Russian leadership the wrong signal,  Professor Dornbusch called his visit a "complete and utter  disaster."    But speaking at the same meeting of professors, Lawrence  Summers, under secretary of the Treasury, denied that the  administration approves of a "gradual approach" in Russia. He  simply said that President Yeltsin is having to deal with social  and economic difficulties whereby privatization and measures to  switch to the market may be sabotaged by the political  opposition.    However, international notes were muffled at this meeting.  The domestic economy dominated.    "The administration's actions have not only proved  surprisingly fruitful, they have also been very sensible," R.  Dornbusch, the famous academic from the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, told the worthy members of the U.S. Economic  Association.    This high assessment by a representative of this institute  is  not very surprising. From his first days, Clinton began to look  to people and ideas from this famous educational establishment.  The studies of scientists from Massachusetts have been  reflected in many of the White House's economic measures -- from  the national program for the retraining of workers to the plan  for the radical reform of health care.    Naturally, with the advent of this administration, the trend  which held absolute sway in the Reagan-Bush years has been  squeezed out. This trend is exemplified by the venerable  Harvard University, many of whose researchers, incidentally,  came to advise the Russian Government during President George  Bush's term and are still here.    Probably no one objected to the assessment of the  administration given by Lawrence Klein, the most senior  professor of economics at Pennsylvania University and a Nobel  prize winner. He did not intervene in the debate with figures  and formulas but commented on Clinton's first period as follows:  "An excellent spring semester."    But there were arguments about figures. They mainly  concerned the permissible unemployment level. And the reduction  of the defense structure is proceeding by no means painlessly in  the United States.    According to Professor Alan Blinder, the country's economy  will feel quite comfortable with unemployment at less than 5.5  percent. However, this level remains only a goal, since in  November unemployment in the country was at 6.4 percent, and  critics maintain that the trigger mechanism of inflation starts  to operate beyond the limit of 6.1 percent unemployment.</p>

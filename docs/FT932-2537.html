			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Property tenders to be worth Pounds 1.25bn THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced plans to put Pounds 1.25bn of property management work out to tender from 1996, through the extension of compulsory competitive tendering to the management of 4m council houses and flats in England, John Willman writes. The services to be put out to tender include rent collection, allocating properties and arranging lettings, and the enforcement of tenancy agreements. The successful bidders will also be responsible for managing vacant properties, caretaking, cleaning, repairs and maintenance. The government has decided to leave the administration of housing benefit, operation of the right-to-buy regulations and housing the homeless outside the tendering package. Councils will continue to be responsible for these fun-ctions. Local authorities will be expected to divide their housing stock into management units of up to 5,000 homes for tendering purposes. However, authorities with fewer than 7,500 homes can put them out to tender as a single unit. Councils will have to consult tenants in drawing up the tender specification, and will be encouraged to involve them in selecting the winning bid.</p>

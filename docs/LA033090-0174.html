			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENATE HOPEFULS FOCUS ON ABORTION;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN: THREE CANDIDATES SEEKING THE 31ST DISTRICT SEAT COMPARE THEIR  DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES ON THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.  </P> <P> In their only meeting of a hard-fought campaign, three candidates seeking to  replace state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) discussed their  stances Thursday on the politically hot topic of abortion.  </P> <P> During a call-in show on cable television, all three candidates said they  support abortion in the event of rape or incest or to save the life of the  mother. They differed on whether minors should be required to receive parental  consent for abortions and whether laws should prohibit abortions for other  reasons.  </P> <P> Democrat Janice Graham, whose support for abortion rights has been a major  issue in her campaign, said she favors a woman's right to choose abortion in  almost any circumstance. She hesitated, however, about supporting abortion as a  means of choosing the sex of a baby.  </P> <P> Graham also said she supports the distribution of RU-486, a pill developed in  France that can induce abortion without surgery. And she described her  experience with abortion to save a life.  </P> <P> "When my mother was giving birth to me, the doctors came out and said to my  father, 'Which one do you want?' because they couldn't save us both," Graham  said. "My father said he wanted his wife. He made the right choice, but  fortunately for me the doctors were able to save us both."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), the front-runner in the April 10 election,  said he supported abortion in the cases of incest and rape and also to save the  life of the mother. He is opposed to abortion in other cases and supports a  requirement that juveniles be required to receive parental consent before  getting an abortion.  </P> <P> "I support abortion for very limited circumstances," Hill said.  </P> <P> Robert Lewis, a candidate from the American Independent Party, said he supports  abortion rights and believes that existing laws are adequate. He said, however,  that he is opposed to abortion in the case of sex selection or after the first  trimester.  </P> <P> "I don't like the government getting anywhere near my family's matters," Lewis  said.  </P> <P> The three candidates are the winners of a Feb. 6 primary to represent the 31st  state Senate District. The predominantly Republican district straddles the  border between Orange and Los Angeles counties stretching from West Covina and  Whittier in the north to Laguna Beach in the south.  </P> <P> Thursday was also the deadline for the candidates to file their last financial  disclosure statements before the election.  </P> <P> Graham reported that she has raised a total of $28,456 during the campaign and  now has a small debt. Hill reported that his campaign has raised $525,981 since  the race began late last December.  </P></p>

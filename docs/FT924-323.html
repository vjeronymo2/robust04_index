			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / US dispatches Kitty Hawk to Gulf THE US is dispatching the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk from Somali coastal waters to the Gulf in response to Iraqi attempts to penetrate a no-fly zone over southern Iraq, agencies report from Washington. Normally the US has had a carrier stationed in the Gulf-Arabian Sea area but none has been present since the build-up of US forces in Somalia began earlier this month. Pentagon officials said yesterday the Kitty Hawk would arrive in the next day or two, with about 70 combat aircraft aboard along with 5,500 troops. President George Bush and President-elect Bill Clinton say they are united in a determination to enforce the UN-imposed no-fly zone, and they added that it would be a mistake for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to test their resolve. State Department spokesman Joe Snyder said: 'US and allied forces remain on alert and capable of enforcing relevant UN resolutions. We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to respond as necessary to further harassments of UN operations.' He said Baghdad had waged 'a pattern of harassment against various UN operations in Iraq, against (UN) inspectors in the south, and against humanitarian operations in the north of Iraq.'</p>

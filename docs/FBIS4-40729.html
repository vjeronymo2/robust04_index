			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 115 (605) by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] In an exclusive interview with Interfax, the  military adviser to President Ter-Petrosyan and chief inspector  of the Armenian armed forces Gurgen Dalibaltayan said that in  terms of both quantity and quality the Armenian army met the  technical requirements of the Transcaucasian region. But, he  said, the armsrace launched by certain countries of that region  compelled Armenia to work constantly on the technical potential  of its army.    Under the treaty on conventional weapons, Armenia could have  no more than 220 tanks, 220 other armored vehicles, including  135 MICV's, 100 combat planes and 50 combat helicopters. It can  have no more than 60,000 troops.    According to Dalibaltayan, the armed forces were brought up  almost to their full strength and sufficiently well equipped  with weapons and hardware. They were still wanting officers  but, Dalibaltayan said, an all-arms army college was to open in  Armenia this year.    Several think tanks related to the national Defense Ministry  were working on Armenia's military doctrine. The staff under  President Ter-Petrosyan would come out with a draft doctrine of  their own, Dalibaltayan said.    Whether or not Armenia supplied Nagorno-Karabakh with  weapons  and army hardware, was absolutely immaterial, he said, because  in the course of combat operations the Karabakh defense forces  had captured enormous stocks of weapons and hardware, materiel  and ammunition.    A sufficient number of Armenian volunteers went to defend  the  sovereignty of Karabakh, Dalibaltayan said.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JIMMY CLIFF HANGING ON THE VERGE OF VEGAS  </P> <P> Jimmy Cliff, headlining the Palace on Tuesday, found a novel way around his  perennial dilemma of dealing with an audience primed to hear the hits from "The  Harder They Come." He did sing three tunes from the 1972 movie that made him  reggae's first international star, but two of them -- "By the Rivers of  Babylon" and "Johnny Too Bad" -- were Jamaican hits for other artists.  </P> <P> Cliff is currently without an American label, and his nearly two-hour set  before a half-filled house on the first of his two nights at the Palace didn't  seem likely to change that situation. After an effective opening medley that  found Cliff backed only by keyboards, bass and bongos, the arrangements became  a hodgepodge of mismatched elements while the lyrics tackled serious subjects  in puerile, programmatic fashion.  </P> <P> Cliff's athletic stage presence was initially appealing, but his performance  progressively took on the something-for-everyone cast of a reggae artist headed  for a Vegas-style nightclub circuit. The high point was the audience's  unprompted reply to Cliff's melismatic wailing at the end of one song. Cliff  seemed genuinely surprised at the response -- it was one of those rare moments  of uncontrived audience participation that so many performers strive to achieve  with tired routines.  </P> <P> The Austin, Tex.-based quintet I-Tex opened with a set displaying solid  musicianship, little charisma and enough savvy to play off the irony of a band  that looks like country outlaws playing Jamaican-inspired music.DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

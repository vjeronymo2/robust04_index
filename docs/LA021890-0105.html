			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKE WITHDRAWALS LEVERAGE FOR PEACE;  </P> <P> SOUTH KOREA: TROOP CUTS, RATHER THAN BEING THE FALLOUT OF BUDGET NEEDS, SHOULD  BE USED AS PART OF A CONSTRUCTIVE END GAME ON THE PENINSULA.  </P> <P> The pressure is on to reduce U.S. troop strength in South Korea, and Seoul  should be prepared to fill the gap. That is the message Secretary of Defense  Dick Cheney took with him to Korea last week. Rather than simply scaling back  the U.S. presence as the South Koreans take on a greater role in their own  defense, Washington and Seoul should advance the prospects for peace on the  peninsula by linking U.S. troop cuts to improvements in North-South relations.  </P> <P> Cheney and South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon agreed that reducing the  43,000 American troops would be part of a broader restructuring of military  relations in which Seoul will take on a greater share of defense  responsibilities. The Bush Administration announced last month that three U.S.  air bases in South Korea will be closed and 2,000 airmen withdrawn. Additional  reductions of 3,000 personnel, now under review in the Pentagon, would return  U.S. troop strength in Korea to the 1980 level. Budget pressures and concern  over burden sharing may motivate Congress to seek deeper cuts. Last year,  one-third of the Senate voted to withdraw 10,000 troops, and support for the  plan is growing.  </P> <P> The South Korean government and all three opposition parties are not anxious to  see a reduction in the U.S. military presence at this time. Their concern is  not military but political. U.S. troops constitute less than 5% of the South  Korean armed forces and could, under the restructuring, be replaced by Korean  firepower. The symbolic and deterrent role of U.S. forces cannot, however, be  replaced by Koreans. Seoul fears that unilateral reductions would send the  wrong signal to North Korea about the durability of our commitment to the  South.  </P> <P> In contrast to the historic changes in Eastern Europe, 1989 was not a  "watershed year" in Northeast Asia. With more than 1.6 million troops facing  each other across the 38th Parallel, the Korean peninsula remains an anomalous  vestige of Cold War conflict. Nearly 1 million of those troops are under the  control of the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung, one of the few Stalinist  dictatorships to survive the 1980s. Yet the totalitarian North, whose  propaganda has been aimed at the American presence in the South since 1953,  cannot remain removed from world changes for long. The fall of the Berlin Wall  and the prospect of German reunification have special significance in this  nation divided by World War II.  </P> <P> To promote positive change on the Korean peninsula in the 1990s, the United  States and the Republic of Korea should forge a common policy that would use  U.S. troop cuts as leverage to bring about improvements in North-South Korean  relations. The increasing isolation of North Korea in the world community may  provide an opportunity for progress in North-South talks, especially if we  provide an appropriate face-saving vehicle as encouragement. The ultimate  objective would be to withdraw all U.S. forces permanently stationed in South  Korea, providing there is a marked reduction in military confrontation between  the two Koreas, if not concrete steps toward reunification.  </P> <P> The first phase of this policy would involve unilateral reductions in U.S.  troops. The United States and South Korea should make a virtue of necessity by  characterizing the joint decision to reduce the level of U.S. noncombatant  forces stationed in Korea as a gesture of good will toward the North and to  seek a reciprocal and positive North Korean response. Such an approach was  taken by President Roh Tae Woo in his New Year's address when he stated that  the scope of the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercise known as Team  Spirit would be cut by 10%. So far, the North Korean response has been  relatively encouraging. We should pursue a similar political approach to U.S.  troop reductions this year.  </P> <P> After this initial reduction, the second phase would tie further U.S. troop  cuts to meaningful steps by the North to reduce tension and military  confrontation. At a minimum, such measures would include North Korean  acceptance of international inspections of the nuclear-enrichment facility  under construction north of its capital, Pyongyang, as well as steps aimed at  reducing the capability and fear of a surprise attack along the demilitarized  zone. The heavy concentration of forwardly deployed North Korean troops -- as  well as ammunition, fuel and bridging equipment -- along the DMZ is  particularly threatening. Specific confidence-building measures to reduce that  offensive threat and create greater warning time in which American forces could  be reintroduced would provide an opportunity to further reduce our forces.  </P> <P> Such a two-track framework by the U.S.-South Korean security alliance would  establish a forward-looking policy toward the North. It would demonstrate a  continuing U.S. security commitment to South Korea and underscore the political  solidarity of our two governments in the pursuit of reduced tensions on the  Korean peninsula. The alternative of budget-driven reductions or  congressionally mandated withdrawals would do the opposite. There could be no  better "end game" for America's postwar involvement in Korea than to facilitate  improved North-South relations as we move toward withdrawal of our troops in  the South.  </P></p>

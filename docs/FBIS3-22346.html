			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Weapons Are a Disgrace"] </F>   [Text] Ukraine's Green Party [PZU] has disseminated a  statement in support of the decision adopted by Ukraine's  president and Supreme Council on the total renunciation of  nuclear weapons.    The PZU believes that clinging to the nuclear "cudgel" could  lead to Ukraine's isolation in the world community, and the  possession of nuclear weapons today is not valor, but disgrace.    Since PZU members are convinced that the high post of a  public figure is incompatible with militaristic mentality, the  Greens also demand that Minister of Environmental Protection  Yuriy Kostenko, who was against Ukraine's nuclear disarmament,  be dismissed from his post.    The PZU statement was also supported by the Ukrainian  association "Green World," which is concerned about possible  ecological consequences of the careless handling of the  technology by the military. Examples of such cases were quoted  at the news conference held by the association.</p>

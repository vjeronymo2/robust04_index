			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bagrov: "Taxation of Election Campaigns: </F> Election Financing Exempt from Taxes"]    [Text] In a second reading yesterday the State Duma  adopted the draft law "On Making Changes and Additions to  Individual Laws of the Russian Federation on Taxes and on the  Establishment of Benefits for Compulsory Payments to Off-Budget  Funds." The document--although this is not reflected in the  title in any way--discusses regulation of the taxation of  election campaigns. The deputies preferred the submission of  changes to existing laws to that of a draft new law especially  devoted to features of taxation of election campaigns, which was  developed and submitted to parliament by the federal  government.    It is necessary to give due credit to the Russian  parliamentarians: They were up to the mark, demonstrating that  they had a better knowledge of legal norms than the government.  As early as 1992 the Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution that is  in effect now in accordance with which any tax benefits go into  effect only in the event they are stipulated by law on the  pertinent tax. According to this logic, the parliamentarians  were absolutely right in declining the government's proposed  draft law "On Certain Aspects of Taxation in the Conduct of  Election Campaigns in the Russian Federation." The very same  questions--taxes on resources paid into the election funds of  candidates for representatives at various levels of legislative  and executive authority--are resolved in the parliamentary  version owing to the submission of changes to taxation  legislation in effect. The corresponding draft law, which  received the support of the State Duma, was introduced by Sergey  Shulgin, a deputy from the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord] faction and a member of the Committee on the Budget,  Taxes, Banks, and Finances (before his election to the Duma he  was president of Arkhangelsk's Gandvikbank).    Differing with the government on what kind of laws should  regulate the imposition of taxes on election campaigns, the  State Duma was in complete agreement with it on the volume and  addressees of those receiving tax privileges. The action of  these privileges is being applied to "relations that arose since  1 January 1994," and any subsequent elections will be conducted  according to the new rules.    Official justification for the tax privileges is reduced to  the following. The exemption from taxes of the property of  election commissions and associations, as well as the  establishment of privileged taxation of donations of juridical  and physical persons, is occasioned by the fact that these  resources are used for noncommercial purposes. On the other  hand, the privileges free the budget from a significant part of  election costs, including payment for the work of bookkeepers  and finance inspectors.    Formally, this is how it is. But the "noncommercial"  character of investments in one or another deputy of the State  Duma, or the mayor of a large city is highly conditional, as  indicated, for example, by experience in the United States.  There certainly will be no difficulty in getting around the  established "donation" limits. In any case, a legislative base  is being established for the emergence in Russia of funds to  support one or another candidate or political movement and the  more active participation of big business in the "affairs of  politicians," at both the local and federal level. The question  is whether big business itself will realize this.

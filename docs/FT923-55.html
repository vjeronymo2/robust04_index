			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean mines minister replaced A NEW Chilean minister of mining, Mr Alejandro Hales, has been sworn in to replace Mr Juan Hamilton, who has resigned to prepare his campaign for election to the senate next year. Mr Hales, who held the same post in the 1960s, will automatically become chairman of Codelco, the Chilean Copper Corporation, the world's biggest copper company. He is close to the ruling Christian Democrat party, of which Mr Hamilton is also a member. The change comes at a time when Codelco officials are negotiating for a sharp increase in the investment budget for 1993 to make room for the construction of the Radomiro Tomic mine, a Dollars 500m project planned to be producing 150,000 tonnes a year of copper cathodes by 1995. Codelco's 1992 budget was Dollars 430m and officials say they need at least Dollars 600m to develop Radomiro Tomic, the company's most promising new deposit. The mine is Codelco's largest investment since it was nationalised in 1971. Selecting a financing strategy for Radomiro Tomic will be a key decision for Mr Hales. Mr Hamilton had created a special task force, made up of officials from the mining ministry and Codelco, to propose ways to raise cash for the project. The task force will also look into the possibility of divesting assets that are not linked to Codelco's mining activities, including a hospital next to the Chuquicamata mine and the Tocopilla power station, which supplies energy to Chuquicamata and BHP-RTZ's La Escondida copper mine. Mr Hamilton's tenure as minister was marked by several semi-public skirmishes with Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco's chief executive. The latest, which took place last week, was over the appointment by Mr Hamilton of Mr Osvaldo de Castro as vice president of new business, officials in the company say. Mr Noemi's choice for the job was Mr Jorge Bande, at present vice president of planning. Finally, Mr Noemi and Mr Hamilton worked out a formula whereby Mr de Castro will only take on negotiations for the El Abra mine, a promising project for which Codelco needs to form a joint venture.</p>

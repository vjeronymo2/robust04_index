			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Israel by correspondent V. Flyarkovskiy, </F> including recording of interview with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special  envoy of the Russian president -- from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] The Russian president's official representative in  charge of a Near East settlement is now in Israel, holding talks  with the country's officials. It has to be noted that the  Russian envoy's talks with the regional political leaders are  taking place immediately following U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's talks and that the timing is not a  coincidence. Warren Christopher endeavored to soften the  contradictions between Israel's and Syria's positions, without  any tangible success.    [Flyarkovskiy] Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's  special envoy, has ended yet another diplomatic trip round the  Near East. I say another, because recently Russian diplomats  have begun to appear noticeably more often in the region of the  world's most protracted conflict, while Russian mediation has  become even more effective.    Viktor Posuvalyuk acknowledged that the talks between Israel  and Syria were decisive. He expressed a merely cautious  optimism concerning their possible success.    Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was given a special  message from President Yeltsin. However, the Russian diplomat  focused particular attention on visiting the new autonomous  Palestinian area.    [Posuvalyuk] This is the first time in modern history, in  the  history of the Arab-Israeli conflict that Palestinians were  given an opportunity to prove for the first time to everyone  and, first and foremost, to themselves, that they are capable of  managing their own affairs.    [Flyarkovskiy] And your view is that they are coping.    [Posuvalyuk] So far yes, they are.    [Flyarkovskiy] Does Russia plan a more tangible, material  participation now in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho plan?    [Posuvalyuk] We are discussing these issues with the  Palestinians.    [Flyarkovskiy] The point at issue is to give assistance to  the Palestinian side now, first and foremost, is that not so?    [Posuvalyuk] Naturally.

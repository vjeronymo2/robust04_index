			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK BUDGET CRUNCH FORCES FEE HIKES  </P> <P> Responding to what officials called an immediate financial crisis, the City  Council voted 4 to 1 Monday for across-the-board increases of fees ranging from  the cost of an animal license to tennis lessons in the parks.  </P> <P> The vote came after City Manager Mark Lewis told a council meeting that for two  years the city has compensated for shortfalls in its operating budget by  drawing from what is essentially the city's savings account.  </P> <P> "We have both a short-term and a long-term budget problem," Lewis said. "We  don't want to send Monterey Park on a downhill track."  </P> <P> To meet expenses for this year alone, Lewis said, the city will need to take $1  million from its reserve account to shore up a $20-million budget. That will  leave the city with only $1.4 million in reserves.  </P> <P> The increased fees, Lewis said, should boost revenues by $1.2 million in the  coming year. The increases will occur throughout all departments and involve  scores of fees that the city charges.  </P> <P> Lewis also has tentatively proposed sweeping cuts in expenditures, totaling  $2.3 million for the coming year's budget. As an example, Lewis said, the staff  travel budget would be reduced from $108,000 to $20,000.  </P> <P> The cuts and increased revenues, he said, should correct the financial  problems.  </P> <P> If the council took no action, Lewis told council members, the city would have  to reduce its basic services. Lewis notified the council of the budgetary  problems shortly after assuming his post last year.  </P> <P> The council approved a series of new fees as well as increases in existing  fees. In some cases, city officials said, fees have not been increased in a  decade. In addition, they said, there has been no annual review of many fees  that have become outdated. The changes went into effect with their passage.  </P> <P> Among the new fees is one that allows the city to charge drunk drivers for the  costs incurred in their arrests and from the accidents they cause.  </P> <P> The council also instituted the use of parking meters. Parking on city streets  now is free.  </P> <P> But one councilman and dozens in the audience questioned using fees to solve  the problem. "The bureaucracy in this city is going to slurp up (the fees) like  a hungry animal," said Councilman Christopher Houseman, who cast the lone  dissenting vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tight Restrictions'  </P> <P> Instead of increasing fees, he proposed "very, very tight restrictions" on city  expenses. He said city departments "should be put on a very short leash."  Houseman cited the city's cost for legal advice as one example of an expense  that needs to be reduced.  </P> <P> And Marie Purvis, a Chamber of Commerce board member, told the council: "You  better start thinking about the effects of this on the people you're getting  the fees from."  </P> <P> As an example, she cited business licenses. Under the approved changes, the  cost rose from $63 per license to $75.  </P> <P> Sherman Chiang, administrator of the Best Western Monterey Park Inn, argued  about another increase -- the room tax charged hotels and motel guests. He  suggested a 10% room tax instead of the 12% tax that the council eventually  approved. "I understand the city budget problems," he said, but he said a jump  from 8% to 12% was too much.  </P> <P> Increases in the room tax alone, Lewis said, will mean an additional $200,000  in revenues in the coming year. And, he said, a 250-room hotel is in the  planning stages for the city's Los Angeles Corporate Center. With a 12% room  tax, that hotel is expected to add $150,000 in annual revenues.  </P> <P> Mayor Barry L. Hatch and three of his colleagues said the fee increases were  necessary. "We're not trying to stick it to anybody," Hatch said. "We're trying  to keep this city afloat. Something has to give. And we're going to have to do  some belt-tightening."  </P> <P> "I just hope people understand how critical the situation is," Councilwoman  Judy Chu said. "It would be completely irresponsible not to go ahead with some  of these proposals."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parking Meters  </P> <P> And the city manager said the council chose to "focus the burden of these  increases away from the residential taxpayer."  </P> <P> The council did respond to concerns from student leaders of East Los Angeles  College, who were worried about the impact of 50-cents-an-hour parking meters  proposed for streets around the school.  </P> <P> "Please help us students out," said Juan Gaspar, student government treasurer.  </P> <P> The council agreed to eliminate 265 parking meters planned for the school area.  </P> <P> Criticism of city finances came from the firefighters union, which earlier this  month began negotiating for a new contract. The group's three-year contract  expires in July.  </P> <P> "We understand the city is in dire straits," said union President Kevin  Olinger. "But we're stuck in the middle."  </P> <P> Olinger supported the fee increases as a way "to pay your employees a basic  competitive salary."  </P> <P> He also said the union fully supported a proposal for the Fire Department to be  consolidated into the Los Angeles County fire system, because it could save  Monterey Park nearly $600,000 a year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposal Studied  </P> <P> "We're going to start walking the streets and tell people that the city can't  come close to competing with salaries and benefits that the county can offer,"  Olinger said in an interview.  </P> <P> Lewis said he is studying a proposal from the county Fire Department but that  he has questions about whether it would be economical for the city to give up  its department to the county.  </P> <P> Firefighters applauded Houseman when he asked how the contract negotiations  were being handled by Lewis.  </P> <P> Houseman also criticized Lewis for hiring an assistant city manager and an  administrative intern just before Lewis announced budgetary problems last fall.  </P> <P> Hatch defended Lewis, saying that the city manager had done a great job in  drawing the council's attention to the city's financial problems.  </P> <P> Hatch also said that Lewis had cleaned up City Hall. "Bribery was going on in  this community for services rendered," Hatch said. "If you were one of the old  boys, you got treated like one of the old boys. There was politics from one end  of City Hall to the other."  </P> <P> In interviews later, neither Hatch nor Lewis wanted to go into detail about  these allegations. Hatch would only say: "(The bribery) is all water under the  bridge."  </P> <P> Lewis did disclose, however, that soon after he joined the city last August, he  heard rumors about corruption in what was then called the city's Engineering  and Building Division and ordered a Police Department investigation. A police  report, Lewis said, concluded that one building inspector probably took small  amounts of money from several developers in exchange for waiving certain  requirements during the early 1980s. The inspector died in a car accident,  Lewis said.  </P> <P> "It would be unfair to cast any aspersions upon any current member of the city  staff," Lewis said. "This was an isolated individual, an isolated problem."  </P></p>

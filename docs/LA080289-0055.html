			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPLETED RAIDERS CALL OFF SCRIMMAGES  </P> <P> With his team depleted by injuries, Raider Coach Mike Shanahan decided Tuesday  to cancel all preseason scrimmages.  </P> <P> Shanahan, who has a dozen or more players on limited duty because of injuries,  already had scaled back morning practices at Oxnard to no-pads workouts and  decreased running drills.  </P> <P> "In most scrimmages, you lose three or four players to injuries," he said. "I'd  rather see them in game situations working against another team."  </P> <P> Shanahan said it is the first training camp he has been involved with, college  or pro, where no scrimmages were played.  </P> <P> Starting left offensive tackle Rory Graves became the latest in a group of six  Raiders to suffer pulled hamstrings. Linebacker Jerry Robinson was held out of  practice with a groin pull, and tight end Mike Dyal suffered a hip injury.  Cornerback Mike Richardson, a Plan B free agent from the Chicago Bears, was  given a day off because of sore knees.  </P></p>

Regarding the ``identification'' factor, the Licensee notes that the current Enforcement Policy streamlines the applicability of this factor to situations where the Licensee identified the violations and promptly reported them to the NRC. The Licensee argues that, in both cases, following identification of the violation, the hospital thoroughly evaluated the events and promptly provided the NRC with the results in letters to the NRC Region I office, dated December 22, 1992, January 4, 1993, and February 5, 1993. Based on this information, the Licensee believes that full mitigation on this factor is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the ``corrective action'' factor, once the violations were identified, the Licensee maintains it took prompt action to bring the situations into compliance. Immediate corrective actions were implemented to assure that fully safe conditions were restored and that further noncompliance with the NRC's requirements was halted. In addition, as evidenced by the NRC's inspection report dated December 30, 1992, the Licensee maintains that it had already developed proposed long-term corrective actions, ``at the time of the inspection,'' which was the day after the incident was reported. Given this information, the Licensee believes that further mitigation due to this factor is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Licensee maintains it had no prior opportunity to identify the two specific violations, neither misadministration resulted in doses to the patients that exceeded the prescribed doses by more than 20 percent of the total prescribed doses, nor are they believed to result in any significant detriment, and therefore, no escalation is warranted for these factors. In summary, when the circumstances surrounding the violations are fully considered, the Licensee submits that significant mitigation of the proposed civil penalty for Violation II is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Evaluation of Licensee Response Requesting Mitigation of the Civil Penalties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has evaluated the Licensee response and has determined, as set forth below, that the Licensee has not provided an adequate basis for any mitigation of the civil penalty. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the NRC considered the escalation and mitigation factors set forth in the NRC Enforcement Policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the issues provided in the Licensee's response as a basis for mitigation of the penalty, the NRC acknowledges that the Licensee performed an independent assessment on May 10 and 11, 1993, to improve implementation of the radiation safety program. However, this commitment was made only after these violations were identified by the NRC as a result of inspections conducted on December 3 and 4, 1992, and January 26 and 27, 1993, at the Licensee's facility. Nevertheless, the NRC mitigated the base civil penalty for corrective action for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C by 50 percent, the maximum recommended under the enforcement policy. No further mitigation is warranted under this factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the violations in Section I, the Licensee states that the NRC, contrary to established practice in Section VI.B.2.(c) of the Enforcement Policy, used an enforcement action which occurred in 1989 as part of its inspection history to establish a basis for the 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty for licensee performance. The NRC agrees that prior performance normally refers to the licensee's performance within the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer. However, Section VI.B.2.(c) also states that the base civil penalty may be escalated by as much as 100 percent if the current violation is reflective of the licensee's poor or declining prior performance. While the NRC did mention the escalated action issued in 1989 in its April 26, 1993, cover letter to the Notice of Violation, it also referred to an escalated action that was issued in 1992, which is within the two year/two inspection period. Viewed collectively, the past enforcement actions demonstrate a declining trend in performance at the Licensee's facility. Additionally, the escalated enforcement action issued in 1989 involved the Licensee's loss of control of a cesium-137 sealed source and subsequent improper disposal. The Licensee's corrective action for this incident was not broad and lasting, and did not prevent recurrence of a similar violation described in Section I of the Notice issued April 26, 1993, involving the loss of a cesium-137 brachytherapy sealed source. Based on the above, the NRC believes that the 100 percent escalation for Licensee performances, was a proper application of the Enforcement Policy in determining the civil penalty amount of $2500 for the violations in Section I. As for the Licensee's contention regarding identification of Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C, the NRC in the Notice proposed 50 percent mitigation, which is the maximum recommended under the enforcement policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

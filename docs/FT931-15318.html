			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Gatt deal waits on the big guys - EC and US squabble over barrier reduction while the majority watch for movement YET again the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks is being held hostage to the resolution of a squabble between the two big trading powers - the US and the European Community. Negotiators from the other 95 countries involved in the 108-nation Round can only watch, wait and prod the protagonists into reaching an accord, this time on reducing barriers to trade in industrial goods, which will provide the vital framework needed to complete the complex market access negotiations country by country. The US and EC have said they want an outline agreement by Friday, in the hope of presenting President-elect Bill Clinton with a largely 'pre-cooked' Uruguay Round package by January 20, inauguration day. The waiting is all the more frustrating when countries know that, if enough progress towards a transatlantic deal is made within the next few days, their own vital interests are likely to be traded in a frenetic bargaining flurry to beat the US administration's 'fast-track' deadline of March 2. In order to meet that deadline, the entire Uruguay Round package - give or take some of the less crucial bilateral negotiations over improving market access for goods and services - would have to be completed early in February. This is to allow time for the administration's private sector advisory groups to submit their assessments to Congress alongside the text of the Uruguay Round agreement itself. Under fast-track procedures Congress must approve or reject the agreement without amendment. It is fair to say that even countries facing immensely difficult political decisions of their own in the final bargaining sessions are hoping for an early conclusion to the Round. Even if President Clinton asks for, and gets, renewed fast-track authority, a further delay could spell death for the Round as pressure grows for new items to be added and more changes made to already-negotiated deals. This is true above all for Japan and South Korea, which are huge beneficiaries of the open trading system. Both resist any opening of their closed markets for rice and some other farm commodities, as required by the draft Uruguay Round 'final act' compiled in December 1991. But, politically painful as market-opening for rice will undoubtedly be, the economic pain inflicted by a failure of the Round and the resulting increase in trade protectionism would be infinitely greater. The same argument applies to Canada, Switzerland and some other countries which, like Japan and South Korea, oppose the conversion of all farm import barriers into tariffs - 'tariffication without exception'. These objections, trade officials assert, will melt away once the negotiating spotlight is turned on them. Since Washington and Brussels settled their farm trade row last November, Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has been strenuous in his efforts to persuade countries to propose as few changes as possible to the draft 'final act'. He now believes most other nations will not press for amendments of their own if, in the interests of a quick result, the US can be persuaded to withdraw most of the 25 or so changes it has demanded. These relate to issues ranging from anti-dumping to establishment of a new world trade organisation. Even if an unravelling of the Uruguay Round text is avoided, however, tough bargaining lies ahead in bilateral talks on liberalising trade in goods and services. Under Gatt's most-favoured-nation rule, tariff cuts and services liberalisation agreed between the US and EC must be generalised to all Gatt members. But for most countries the US-EC bargain will not cover all the products and services which interest them. Each of these has to be bargained separately, country by country, to produce the national schedules which will form an integral part of the final Uruguay Round package. Among the main problem areas: The US, EC and other trading partners want Japan to make bigger tariff concessions, for instance on processed food products, wood, non-ferrous metals and leather. Japan, for its part, wants the EC to cut duties on electronics goods and the US to cut high tariffs on textiles. Japan and other Asian countries are under pressure to do more to open up their markets for services, especially financial services such as banking, insurance and securities business. Japan wants the US to liberalise its maritime sector but supports Washington in urging the lifting of EC quotas on foreign audio-visual services. Developing countries want big improvements in access to the markets of industrialised nations for their exports of agricultural goods, raw materials and textiles. Rich countries, on the other hand, are pushing poor ones to liberalise their trading regimes faster and to rely less on special treatment. It remains an uncomfortable truth, however, that what 'the big guys' do matters most. Their bilateral tariff deal is not sewn up and the draft 'final act' has not been agreed. The hard bargaining over services is still to come.</p>

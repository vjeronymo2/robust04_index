			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / City share system to cost less than Taurus The new share settlement system proposed for the City will cost about half as much as the Stock Exchange's failed Taurus project - according to details to be unveiled later this week. However, because the proposed Crest system will not be nearly as sophisticated as Taurus, individual companies are likely to have to spend more developing their own computer link-up systems. Specifications from the Crest advisory committee, which is sponsored by the Bank of England, will carry an estimated price tag for building the central system of Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m compared with the estimated Pounds 75m for Taurus. Committee members said they expect the specifications may cause an outcry among smaller firms, particularly those specialising in private client stockbroking, because the costs of linking into the new system may prove prohibitive. 'These smaller firms could well be forced to contract out their settlement services,' one committee member said. Crest is intended to replace the share settlement system which is paper-based, with an electronic system but firms will have the option of retaining share certificates for those clients who want them. But it is believed that the costs of running a separate paper-based system for small private client firms could be more expensive than the clients are willing to accept. Meanwhile, the committee's paper will not discuss the controversial question of who should own the Crest system. The question of ownership will be addressed in a paper to be released in February. The Bank of England says it currently has no view about who should control the system. However there is support within the advisory committee for the Bank of England to run it in the first year or so before devolving the operations to users. The Stock Exchange however is said to be seeking a role for itself - possibly as a part owner of the Crest system on behalf of its members. The Bank of England has said in the past that it does not believe there is a long-term future for the Stock Exchange in share settlement.</p>

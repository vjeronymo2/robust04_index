			<p>BFN     [Text] The meetings of the Jordanian-Palestinian Economic  Committee will end tomorrow. The second day's meetings ended a  short while ago. Details are in the following report by our  political affairs correspondent Shakir Maharimah:    [Begin recording] [Maharimah] The Jordanian-Palestinian  Economic Committee resumed its meetings at the Prime Ministry  today until late this evening. After the meeting, Mr. Ahmad  Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department and head of the  Palestinian side, and Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for  cabinet affairs, minister of information, and head of the  Jordanian side, made statements:    [Quray'] After this long and enjoyable round of talks and  exchange of views with our brothers under the chairmanship of my  brother His Excellency Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, we have prepared  mechanisms with full understanding on both sides to implement  the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement in the economic field. We  discussed basic and important issues that dealt with banking and  monetary issues, trade and customs.    We also set up subcommittees and they will commence their  work immediately as of Saturday [14 May] to follow up the  implementation of the working program. God willing, when the  transitional stage goes into implementation, coordination will  take place on the ground. I believe that since 1967, this is  the first chance for us, as Palestinians, to exercise part of  our powers usurped by the Israeli occupation authorities.    The first and basic reference that we resort to is this  fraternal, brotherly, and friendly country with which we are  linked with distinguished ties and which cannot but include all  the visions and aspirations of our two peoples.    God willing, we shall meet again tomorrow and release a  joint  statement and agree on a working program to implement the accord  signed on 7 January 1994.    [Al-'Anani] The negotiations were held in a businesslike  atmosphere in which issues were discussed in detail. The  discussion of the details of a mechanism took us a long time.  It was not enough to agree on the basic principles. It was  necessary that we work out practical steps on the ground so that  technical experts and specialists in the various sectors could  immediately start implementing the agreement.    A high spirit of cooperation permeated these meetings. Since  our interests are interrelated, they must be organized in a  detailed way so that people and the private sector could take  advantage of the chances available on the ground in view of what  is going on in the Palestinian territories in terms of changes  we will witness on the ground.    In fact, I would like to thank brother Abu-'Ala' [Quray'],  and his friends and colleagues who showed a high level of  response to and understanding of issues that are of concern to  us in Jordan. We found solutions to these issues, which, God  willing, will convince the Jordanian and Palestinian people that  we are on the road to achieving interests. God willing, we  will avoid dangers and seek to achieve joint interests in light  of close relations between the two people.    As my brother Abu-'Ala' said, we will meet in order to sign  what we call a working plan based on the agreement. As he  mentioned, we took a number of priorities into consideration.  These included banking, monetary, trade, and transient issues.  We also discussed the issue of tourism. We shall hold further  meetings to complete the discussion of agriculture, industry,  energy, and any other related issues. Moreover, the  [Palestinian] brothers asked for cooperation in terms of  exchanging expertise and technical cadres, especially since the  required Palestinian institutions are being established. They  received sufficient response from us. [end recording]</p>

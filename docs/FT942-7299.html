			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Row on rail equipment sales Sharp differences between the government and the railway equipment industry on prospects for future sales emerged yesterday. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, offered an optimistic vision for manufacturers, but industry executives said there was overcapacity in the industry in the UK and worldwide. Mr Freeman spoke on a visit to Metro-Cammell's plant at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, to see the GEC Alsthom Metro-Cammell Eurostar trains for the Channel tunnel. 'If we can get co-operation from all sections of British industry and long production runs, we can compete with the best in the world,' he said. Replacement trains would be needed, especially on commuter routes, he added, and he expected the train-operating companies that succeeded British Rail to place orders. He pointed to London Underground's need to re-equip and to the equipment demands of the Jubilee Line and cited demand in countries such as China and Germany. But Mr Bryan Ronan, managing director of GEC Alsthom Transport, said: 'There is overcapacity in the UK. I don't see that changing in the short term.' He added: 'Export markets have always been difficult, cyclical and dominated by national struggles, aid and other political factors.' GEC Alsthom Metro-Cammell, the UK's largest train manufacturer, faces delivery schedules which will peter out towards the end of the decade after it has delivered 19 Eurostar trains and vehicles for the Jubilee Line and the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway.</p>

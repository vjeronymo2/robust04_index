			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is  mapping out a countermeasure after receiving a report from the  inspection team in North Korea, which began its inspection  activities on 18 May, confirming that North Korea has already  begun replacing nuclear fuel rods.    Correspondent Cha Man-sun has this report from Vienna:    [Begin recording] Three inspectors conducted inspection  activities in Yongbyon, North Korea, for the second day. Since  yesterday, the inspection team has examined the counter and  seals and whether the surveillance equipment installed at the  5-mw atomic reactor has been replaced. As a result, they have  confirmed that the replacement of nuclear fuel rods has already  begun.    The inspection team, in particular, has focussed on  examining, with the guidance of North Korean officials  concerned, whether it is possible to take samples from the used  nuclear fuels from the reactor in the course of the nuclear fuel  rods being replaced. As a result, they judged that the  replacement of nuclear fuel rods is now at an initial stage. It  is learned that they have reported this to headquarters.    Well-informed sources disclose that the inspection team has  given its initial report saying that the replaced, used nuclear  fuels are stored in such a way as to make it difficult to find  out from which side of the reactor they have been taken out.    The well-informed sources say that the persons in high-level  policy-making authority at the IAEA are receiving, and are  making a detailed analysis of, daily reports from the inspection  team in North Korea on its inspection activities and the status  of the replacement of nuclear fuel rods. They are discussing,  the sources say, whether to seek solutions through future  negotiations with the North.    These sources predict that in view of the smooth progress of  the consecutive two-day inspection activities, a scheduled,  additional inspection of the radiochemical laboratory will also  go smoothly.

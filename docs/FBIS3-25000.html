According to this communique published in Niamey today by  the weekly LE REPUBLICAIN (close to the Tuareg community), the  next meeting, the date for which was not specified, is expected  to take place in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the very place where  a series of negotiations ended in failure last November.    In an interview with AFP, government spokesman Moctar Diallo  confirmed the authorities' "readiness" in participating in such  a meeting. He hoped that "facilitating" countries (France,  Algeria, and Burkina Faso) would intervene again to help fix the  date.    In its communique, the CRA stressed its willingness to once  again "prove its good faith" but warned that it does not  envisage "signing a new truce" during this meeting. It  criticizes the Niger Government for "not being able to take  advantage" of the truce observed from February 1993 to January  this year "to create the necessary conditions for frank and  sincere dialogue leading to peace."    In the opinion of the CRA, the Ouagadougou meeting "should  allow for the designation of a mediating country, draw up a  timetable and the places of meetings for possible political  negotiations." The communique specifies that these decisions  were made "at a meeting held from 25 January to 2 February in  the Tenere" (desert of northern Niger) in the presence of  leaders of the four movements -- Front for the Liberation of Air  and Azaouak (FLAA); Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of  Northern Niger (ARLN); Front for the Liberation of Tamoust  (FLT), and the Patriotic Front for the Liberation of the Sahara  (FPLS).    At the end of meeting, participants set up an executive  bureau, the "supreme organ" of the resistance, composed of the  following: president, Mano Dayak (FLT leader); vice presidents,  Rissa Ag Boula (FLAA leader) and Mohammed Abdoulmoumine (ARLN  leader); spokesman Aoutcheki Kriska; secretary general, Idil  Ag-Ayaha; social affairs, Assadek Gagidan; and finance, Mohammed  Ewanghe.    The Tuareg community of Niger is estimated at 750,000 -- 10  percent of the country's population. Their rebellion, which was  launched in November 1991, has left 99 persons dead, according  to official toll.</p>

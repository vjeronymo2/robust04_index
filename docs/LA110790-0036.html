			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELMS DEFEATS GANTT IN DUEL OF OLD, NEW SOUTH  </P> <P> Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, icon of ultra-conservatives, defeated Democrat  Harvey Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte, winning a fourth term and snuffing  out his challenger's dream of becoming the nation's only black senator.  </P> <P> With 94% of the vote counted, Helms led 53% to 47%, a comfortable 130,000-vote  margin.  </P> <P> Shortly before midnight, a feisty Helms addressed cheering supporters at a  downtown Raleigh hotel. He hailed a "return to the moral and spiritual ideals,"  lambasted "cheap politicians," the media, his critics and "the mighty liberal  Establishment" and declared that they "have struck out again."  </P> <P> To shouts of "Give 'em hell!" and "Tell it!" Helms, surrounded by his happy  family, declared: "Today, you have given me a mandate to continue to say no,  and I make this covenant with you tonight: If the liberal politicians think  I've been a thorn in their sides in the past, they haven't seen anything yet."  </P> <P> Minutes later, at a nearby hotel, Gantt, clearly disappointed, spoke to his  supporters, calling for unity and continued pursuit of liberal ideals.  </P> <P> "I'm still smiling from way down deep, even though I hurt," Gantt said, as  supporters chanted: "Harvey! Harvey!"  </P> <P> He asserted that he wanted to "appeal to your best aspirations," and said that  "it is still important that we address the problems of our children. . . ."  </P> <P> As his wife, Cindy, sobbed at his side, Gantt said, "I'm going to continue to  hold out hope that one day we'll reach that point in time when we move together  as a community."  </P> <P> While his aides refused to call his remarks a concession, several admitted  privately that it was virtually impossible for Gantt to overtake Helms' lead.  </P> <P> Initial analyses showed that Helms drew heavily from less-educated white voters  and those who are native North Carolinians, while Gantt won support among  newcomers, black voters and well-educated white voters. Analysts had figured  that Gantt needed to win at least 40% of the white votes to win.  </P> <P> The contest ended on a fractious note, as a massive failure of voting machines  caused a judge to order polls in Durham County left open 2 1/2 hours beyond the  scheduled 7:30 p.m. closing time. Officials also ordered crowded polls in  Guilford County opened an hour longer. Both are urban areas believed to be  Gantt strongholds.  </P> <P> While Gantt rushed out to make extraordinary Election Night campaign appeals in  Durham County, Helms campaign officials tried to get the order reversed and  threatened to formally protest the election.  </P> <P> The late maneuvering, including charges of voting irregularities, seemed a  fitting climax in a contest that pitted a black challenger against the  controversial white incumbent who, during his 18 years in the Senate, has  symbolized far-right conservatism.  </P> <P> Both candidates watched the election returns here Tuesday night, after Helms  voted here and Gantt cast his ballot in Charlotte. After voting, Helms stayed  home, but Gantt stumped for votes throughout the day.  </P> <P> Helms, contentious to the end, told reporters after voting that he had just a  few words for Gantt: "Tell the truth, for once."  </P> <P> After casting his ballot, Gantt said: "We always thought we were going to win."  </P> <P> The two men fought a bitter, bruising battle that, in the end, centered on race  and became a metaphor for the nation's emotional confrontation with the issues  of race and racism. More than any other political campaign this year, the  face-off between Gantt and Helms came to represent a struggle between the Old  South and the New.  </P> <P> Gantt, in speeches and advertisements, portrayed Helms as ineffective in the  Senate on a range of issues, including education, the environment and health  care. He supported women's right to choose abortion and criticized Helms for  opposing abortion rights. "It's time for a change," he said repeatedly.  </P> <P> Helms counted on North Carolinians to be content with the status quo, believing  that he could win with an appeal based more on what he disliked than what he  liked. Thus, in his campaign speeches, remarks on the Senate floor, interviews  and ads he castigated homosexuals, liberals, some artists and women's rights  activists.  </P> <P> To the end, Helms refused to acknowledge that his campaign centered on the old  issue of race, insisting that the Senate race simply pitted a conservative  against a liberal, good against evil.  </P> <P> North Carolina was ripe for this confrontation of contrasts. A state of  contradictions, it is known nationally for its Research Triangle, an area that  hums with new technology and new residents who migrated to the state. But it is  also a state that ranks 49th on Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, one that  routinely suffers racial clashes and hate-group activity.  </P> <P> "North Carolina, without question, has these two sides," said Nancy Neale, who  directs the undergraduate social work program at Appalachian State University  and is president of the state chapter of the National Assn. of Social Workers.  "The mean side divides people up, setting off their worst fears. That's what we  had in this race."  </P> <P> The combatants were well-matched archetypes -- the white symbol of power  against the black symbol of hope for power.  </P> <P> Gantt, a 47-year-old architect, was born in Charleston, S.C., one of five  siblings whose father was a Naval shipyard worker. From an impoverished  beginning, Gantt rose to mark several firsts, including becoming, in 1963, the  first black student at Clemson University. He earned a master's degree in city  planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1983 was elected  Charlotte's first black mayor. He was reelected two years later but lost a  third attempt in 1987.  </P> <P> During his Senate campaign, Gantt often cited Charlotte, where 75% of voters  were white, to remind doubters that he had a history of attracting white voters  and defeating white candidates.  </P> <P> None, however, had ever been as willing as Helms to use race in a campaign.  </P> <P> The 69-year-old senator, a native of Monroe, N.C., son of the local police  chief, attended Wake Forest College but never graduated. Among his several  media jobs was a 12-year run as an editorialist at a television station here, a  position that made him famous as a hardball conservative.  </P> <P> Helms parlayed his notoriety as television commentator into his first  successful Senate race in 1972, winning reelection in 1978 and 1984.  </P> <P> Previously, however, his opponents had been white. The 1990 contest, with Gantt  the first black Democratic nominee, left analysts guessing when Helms would  make the contest a racial one.  </P> <P> Helms gambled on making the racial gambit late in the race. Up until October,  he spent little time in the state, working instead on Senate business in  Washington, running advertisements and using fund-raising letters to take  swipes at "the special interests -- the ACLU, the homosexual crowd, the  Hollywood fat cats, People for the American Way, the so-called National  Organization for Women, Planned Parenthood and the union bosses."  </P> <P> Then, with Election Day about two weeks off, and opinion polls showing that  Gantt was leading, Helms turned up the heat on race, in speeches as well as in  advertisements.  </P> <P> "That was a wake-up call," said Thad Beyle, a political science professor at  the University of North Carolina. "That was to tell voters that 'this is an  important race. Come on out.' That resonates with some people."  </P></p>

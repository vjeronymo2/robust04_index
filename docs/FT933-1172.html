			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Insurers applaud warily THE US health insurance industry, which stands to bear the brunt of price controls under the healthcare plan proposed by President Bill Clinton, took a conciliatory approach yesterday, applauding the president's aim of reducing costs and extending coverage. However, leading insurance companies continued to oppose the ceiling on insurance premiums proposed in earlier drafts of the plan. They claimed that the growth of managed care arrangements in recent years has already helped to bring down the costs of healthcare and that price controls would interfere with this process. Met Life, one of the big five health insurers, said it agreed with Mr Clinton's belief in managed competition, but added that his plan 'also contains extensive price controls, payroll-based financing and regulatory health alliances which would make managed competition unworkable.' Even so, the insurers offered support for the aims of the Clinton reform plans. Their conciliatory tone was seen as an attempt to defuse tensions between the US administration and the insurers, which have grown in recent days as the insurance industry has begun intensive lobbying over the plan.</p>

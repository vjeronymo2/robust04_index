			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Arts: Glamourised gormlessness - Cinema FORREST GUMP (12) Robert Zemeckis THE LION KING (U) Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff MINA TANNENBAUM (12) Martine Dugowson FUNNY MAN (18) Simon Sprackling Early in Forrest Gump, before its hero has grown into Tom Hanks, he is chased down a country road by school bullies. The braces on his legs - the boy is ill-developed physically as well as mentally - suddenly fly apart and free him to run like a sprinter. For Forrest Gump read Forrest Gump. This 2 1/2 -hour comedy/fable/history lesson must once have seemed the most handicapped project on the Hollywood lot: an epic hobble across post-war America with a holy fool for hero and a road paved, or potholed, with 40 years of national good intentions and national seizures (Dallas, Vietnam, Watergate). Our Forrest grows up into an Alabama Candide: a man around whom great events happen but who remains blithely unscathed and unimpressed by them all. Would such a movie play in Peoria? Even the original novel by Winston Groom only sold 30,000 copies in hardback. Commercially it has run like the wind: Dollars 270m at the US box office to date - it may topple Jurassic Park as the highest-earning film in history - and an entire nation besotted with Gump wit and wisdom. Like its innocent-messianic hero, who becomes an athlete and spends much of the movie jogging across the land as a torchbearer-without-torch for the human spirit, Forrest Gump the film has thrown aside its leg-braces and left footprints all over Clinton-era America. Indeed Gump may be Bill Clinton, we (and others) opine. One of several ingenious trick-optical scenes has the backwoods boy shaking hands with JFK himself. And surely that was a favourite scene from the Clinton movie scrapbook too. But like the man in the White House Forrest Gump spends a deal of time trying to be all things to all folk. Self-ingratiatingly, and for this viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy. When Forrest overnights at the Watergate Hotel in the early 1970s, after a chat with Nixon (more state-of-the-art opticals), we chortle approvingly as he becomes the first man to blow the whistle on the 'plumbers'. But only minutes before that we are watching him in Vietnam behaving like John Wayne in The Green Berets. As he runs back and forth through a napalm-blazing jungle, finally saving unit leader Gary Sinise, a nightmare war is turned into an arch cameo of Boy's Own heroism. Sinise will adorn the rest of the movie as a double amputee, providing a support paradigm - Gloucester to Forrest's Lear - of grace under pressure in millennial America. But is it grace or just glamourised gormlessness? 'Stupid is as stupid does' is one wisdom intoned by Hanks's dogged Southerner - his face puckered in sage earnestness, his vowels a lugubrious, elastic twang - as he proves that an IQ of 75 does not disqualify you as the moral hero of a nation. Accident is destiny, destiny accident: that is the other saw that keeps buzzing. From the opening credits sequence, in which a feather drifts from the sky down to Forrest's shoe as he sits on a park bench hijacking strangers with his life story (a blend of EL Wisty and the Ancient Mariner), director Robert 'Roger Rabbit' Zemeckis and screenwriter Eric Roth pile on the haphazard while steering Forrest unerringly towards fulfilment. He gets to love a woman (Robin Wright), an ex-flower child whom he saves from the hell of 1960s liberalism. He fathers his own child. He grows rich from the shrimping business. He is, we begin to realise, America herself: that dear, untutored land that redeems itself by its innocence even when it creates tragedy by its ignorance. This rose-tinted mirror held up to the USA by the USA says, 'If we have never truly grown up - never do grow up - nothing can truly be our fault.' If sentimentality were a crime, Forrest Gump would be put away for life. As it is, it will probably be with us for life: the ultimate feel-good film in an age when no one any longer has the courage to feel bad. Moviegoing in late-summer America has been a dangerous activity. Turn away from the idiot savant on the park bench and you will walk straight into the jaws of The Lion King (Dollars 250m and climbing). But this option is more fun. Disney's new animation feature is its first ever based on an original screenplay and has a real freshness of setting and vision. The African wilderness shimmers across the wide screen - do not wait for the video - as the orphaned lion prince Simba grows up to dethrone his wicked uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) who had his regal father run over in a wildebeest stampede. We are all run over by this wildebeest stampede. From where I sat it started in the north-west speaker, surged down the side aisle, roared over the Empire screen towards Leicester Square, then rumbled out in the south-west speaker. Spectacle matches sound: thousands of dust-raising shapes shaking the desert as the camerawork soars and curvettes overhead. The sequence lasts 2 1/2 minutes and took two years to create. Jeremy Irons's voice for Scar probably took two hours and is just as splendid: a wicked George Sanders purr sliding up and down the scale of sarcasm like a cat on a polished bannister. The film loses its magic towards the end, with a gaudy, hurried showdown. We miss the burnished charm with which the film sauntered round its early scenes. Here - and in the middle section where a hip meerkat and doleful wart-hog keep Simba company in the paradise valley of his exile - The Lion King matches the comical and painterly bravura of the great Disney cartoons. Is there such a thing a feel-bad film today? Mina Tannenbaum ought to qualify, but by some proprietary charm formula fails to do so. Mina (Romane Bohringer) is a plain, introverted Jewish girl, tormented by not having her best friend Ethel's vibrant social graces. Ethel (Elsa Zylberstein), also Jewish, is tormented because she does not have painter Mina's depth and artistic talent. Stir in two passive-aggressive Jewish mothers - adding gall to a stew steeped in wormwood - and you have this drama of interconnecting female lives, bubbling and spitting across two caustically observed decades. Screenwriter Veronique Heuchenne and director Martine Dugowson make sardonically merry with the fashions of the 1970s: floor-sweeping trouser bottoms and hats like floppy stovepipes. Then they make menacing with the greedy 1980s, when ambition and love rivalry pulls the girlfriends apart. We could cry 'Woman's picture' and complain that emotion swamps action and that the men are pawns in a parable of sisterhood. But after the runaway patriarchalism of Forrest Gump and The Lion King - where woman's sole function is to be mettle-polisher to the dominant male - Mina Tannenbaum is a welcome reminder that half the planet has its own mind and will and hand on destiny's tiller. Funny Man, a British horror comedy from first-time writer-director Simon Sprackling, is the week's booby prize. If you ever win a round of poker from Christopher Lee, make sure you do not accept his forfeit of an ancestral home. It contains a homicidal 'joker' (Tim James, putty-faced up to resemble a Jimmy Savile from hell) whose delight is picturesquely to murder you and your friends. Sliced heads; pierced eyeballs; electrocution; burning. All the fun of the auto-da-fe. And between murders the film returns to its normal idling state: a benighted, terminal catatonia. Wait for the video. And then keep waiting.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LOST CONTINENT TRAVELS IN SMALL-TOWN NORTH AMERICA BY  BILL BRYSON (HARPER &amp; ROW: $9.95)  </P> <P> Although Bill Bryson was born in Iowa, he's lived much of his adult life in  England, which enables him to write about the American heartland with both the  contemptuous familiarity of a native and the bemused curiosity of an outsider.  His account of driving the highways and byways of the Midwest, South and  Northeast is very funny, if a bit scatological.  </P> <P> What saves this smart-aleck travelogue from the sniggering cynicism of P. J.  O'Rourke's accounts of foreign countries is the author's profound love for the  land and its beauties. A description of the tatty roadside communities in the  Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee sums up Bryson's attitude: "America has  never quite grasped that you can live in a place without making it ugly, that  beauty doesn't have to be confined behind fences, as if a national park were a  sort of zoo for nature."  </P></p>

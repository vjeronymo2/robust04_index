			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bank of Finland sells Tampella stake THE IMPROVING fortunes of Tampella, the Finnish engineering group, have prompted the Bank of Finland to sell more than half its remaining stake in the company to domestic and international investors. The disposal of 18m shares reduces the bank's stake in Tampella to 23.6 per cent from 50.6 per cent, and raises FM443m (Dollars 76m). It represents a further diversification of the company's ownership base after the bank sold 25m shares to investors in New York, London and Stockholm for FM600m in August. Prior to that it held 88 per cent of the company. Tampella was acquired by the Bank of Finland, the Finnish central bank, as part of a broader rescue of Skopbank in 1991. The group has shown a strong recovery since then, following extensive restructuring and cost-cutting which has left it focused on power and drilling operations. In the first eight months losses after financial items were cut to FM65m from FM317m in the same 1992 period.</p>

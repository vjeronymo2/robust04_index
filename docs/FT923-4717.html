			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World News in Brief: The 10p piece in your pocket A smaller 10p coin (shown left, actual size) will be introduced on September 30. It is similar in size to the old 5p, but a little larger. The new coin will complete the break with pre-decimal coinage which began in 1971. The Royal Mint said most ticket and vending machines would take the coin soon after its issue.</p>

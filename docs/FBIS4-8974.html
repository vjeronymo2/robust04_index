			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mladen Kevo: "All of Milosevic's Ministers"] </F>   [Text] The newest Serbian Government headed by  "Kninite" Mirko Marjanovic is only the logical continuation of  Milosevic's red camarilla, which has been on the march across  the Balkans for seven years, leaving ruins and corpses in its  wake.    "We will preserve the sound dinar, we will create a market  system, we will crush inflation, there will be no printing of  money without backing, we will quickly increase production, we  will help the `borderlands,' there will be no loans for the  unqualified, we are encircled--but we will persevere and emerge  even stronger than we were before the sanctions." With these  words, a slightly milder variant of the speech from the 5th  Congress of the KPJ [Communist Party of Yugoslavia] in 1948, the  "mandatary for forming a Serbian government," Mirko Marjanovic,  sold a demagogic haze to the Serbian parliamentary deputies and  to the Serbian public. This "gentleman" with 50 years of party  service, a native of Knin, a Belgrade scholarship recipient at  red universities in Moscow, is now the main smuggler of gas from  Russia for the second winter in a row, through the company  "Progres," of which he was the director.    The gentlemen did not explain how he "will not print money  without backing" while the budget of the "Armed Forces of  Yugoslavia" is $700 million and the "superdinar" has backing in  gold and foreign exchange amounting to 230 million German marks;  nor did he explain exactly what "there will be no loans for the  unqualified" means in a country from which all qualified people  among them and 350,000 young people have long since fled head  over heels.    Even a cursory glance at the team that will lead the  country,  the "ministers," provides an indication of what this latest  Serbian government will be like. The man concerned with pushing  this government's proposals through parliament will be socialist  fossil Dragan Tomic, a person who with a trembling voice, as  "president of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of  Belgrade" at the time, announced Milosevic's first rallies in  1987 and 1988 at the "source." There is Zoran Sokolovic  "Pirocanac," for several years now Serbia's top policeman, a  person who has performed immeasurable services in suppressing  all attempts at "popular happenings" that are against  Milosevic's will. His sphere of activity will remain the  truncheon. There is Ratko Markovic, a professor at the School of  Law in Belgrade, known for his writing of the so-called Zabljak  Constitution, a piece of legal hanky-panky through which  Montenegro became Belgrade's captive without the right to appeal  and remedy, a "jurist" for whom the Orthodox church in Vienna is  plenty of proof that Vienna is an "old Serbian city." There is  Slobodan Unkovic, the former chancellor of Belgrade University  and chairman of one of the former sessions of the Serbian  Assembly, known for having submitted his own irrevocable  resignation midway through a session over which he was  presiding, with the words: "Colleagues, I cannot go on!" There  is also Radovan Pankov, who will lead one of the key areas, the  "Ministry for Serbs Outside Serbia" (translation: "ministry for  the borderlands"), and with Kertes the leader of the "yogurt  revolution" in Vojvodina, the former party leader in Backa  Palanka (the place from which the occupation and deportation of  Ilok was conducted), and one of the ideological thugs of the  Milosevic regime.    The sphere of information has been entrusted to Ratomir  Vica,  the former manager of RTV [Radio and Television] Serbia, and  there is also the director of the "Red Star" soccer club for  many years, Vladimir Cvetkovic. His club has long since lost its  radiance, but nonetheless Cvetkovic, as minister of sports, is  still a "rising star." This team will have at its disposal as  flank support the good services--and it will need them--of Brana  Crncevic, who needs no special introduction, Milorad Vucelic,  the director of TV Serbia and ideologue of the "red chetnik  movement," the unique Margit Savovic, as "federal minister for  human rights," Mihalj Kertes--about whom no one knows exactly  what he does, although many have experienced how it does it, and  Radmilo Bogdanovic, Serbia's former top policeman. There is also  Bora Jovic, who is less and less in demand, and there is Zeljko  Simic, our great friend from the Geneva Declaration, and there  are retired and active generals.    What is actually present here is the entire apparatus of a  crumbled state that has been completely useless for several  years now. Each of them could gain a certain role at a certain  moment. The number of roles is unlimited, but they are all of an  episodic nature. The latest convocation of the Serbian  government is only the logical continuation of Milosevic's red  camarilla, which for seven years now--amid war cries--has been  on the march across the Balkans, leaving arson, ruins, and death  in its wake for tens of thousands of members of other nations.  These are "all the free comrades" who will leave only after they  have literally spent the last para and pfennig of all the  possible reserves of the former Yugoslavia. Even then, however,  they will not leave willingly, and someone will have to ask them  to give up power. Naturally, "ask" them using their methods....</p>

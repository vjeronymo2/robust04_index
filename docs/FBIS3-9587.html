At a news conference he failed to comment at length on the  activities of his "prime minister" Bujar Bukosi in Washington,  where this man had requested support from U.S. officials for  separatist demands for the secession of Kosovo and Metohija from  Serbia, but stressed that these activities were "within the  framework of regular visits to and contacts with the United  States."    The DSK president welcomed the Belgian foreign minister's  visit to Tirana, dubbing as "press speculations" hints that  Willy Claes would convey to Albanian President Sali Berisha the  European Union's stance on the inviolability of borders and its  position that Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija] Albanians can seek a  solution only within the context of autonomy.    Not ruling out the possibility that Claes and Berisha could  examine all options for resolving the Kosmet issue, Rugova  declared that, as "president of Kosovo," a title he had bestowed  upon himself, he would take into account the will of the  Albanians expressed at the referendum.    This, he said, means "an independent and neutral Kosovo"  which, in his view, is "a compromise solution acceptable to both  Albanians and Serbs."    He described the Yugoslav Government's decision not to allow  foreign missions in Kosovo as "confirmation of a stubborn and  damaging policy pursued by the Serbian authorities."    Speaking about the German authorities' intention to deport  several thousand Yugoslav refugees, mostly Albanians, Rugova  said that he had received official assurances that this would be  done "as painlessly as possible," but he failed to elaborate on  what this meant.</p>

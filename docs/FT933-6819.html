			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Haeco profits up strongly as sales climb HONG Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), a Swire Pacific group company, yesterday announced an 18 per cent increase in net profit for the six months ended June. The result was HKDollars 213.8m (USDollars 27.4m), up from HKDollars 180.5m in 1992. Turnover increased by 10 per cent to HKDollars 1.01bn. This was attributed to heavy utilisation of the company's airframe maintenance and engine overhaul facilities. Earnings were also boosted by a maiden contribution from the group's 26 per cent-owned Australian aircraft maintenance company, Asta Aircraft Services, which had been a consistent lossmaker. The interim dividend is going up to 30 cents a share, against 27 cents in 1992.</p>

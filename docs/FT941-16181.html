			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Pound hits six-month high against the D-Mark Sterling touched its highest level for six months against the D-Mark yesterday as the German currency weakened and investors bought pounds in the expectation that the UK will decide against an early cut in interest rates. Ahead of today's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, the pound rose to DM2.5981 in London and threatened to break through the key market barrier of DM2.60. In New York it closed at DM2.5925. While growing evidence of a strengthening consumer-led recovery and fears of increased factory prices have damped expectations of an early interest rate cut, some foreign exchange dealers reason that the UK will have to act if the pound strengthens much beyond DM2.60. The pound later slipped in London to DM2.5944, up from Monday's close of DM2.5883. Against the dollar it eased to Dollars 1.4913 from Dollars 1.4955. But its recent strong performance prompted some exchange dealers to speculate that lower interest rates are still on the UK policy agenda. Currencies, Page 35</p>

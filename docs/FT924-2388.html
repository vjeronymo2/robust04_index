			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Long View: Ministry of silly rules CASUAL READERS of bond market reports must wonder what sort of a mad world they have stumbled on. On one day this week, for instance, market reporters were explaining that US government bond prices had risen because of the strength shown by recent economic data, while UK gilt-edged prices had drifted lower in view of indications of emerging British recovery. Spot the contradiction: the latter explanation is the more conventional, as bond investors tend to lap up gloom - unless things get so bad that war, social unrest or hyperinflation threaten returns. The challenge at home, meantime, is the debt mountain which must be financed by the British government; long-term interest rates have been edging up in the past month. It is not easy to see where Pounds 50bn-plus of gilts can be sold. The total cash flow of big investment institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies is only about Pounds 40bn, and foreign investors have stopped buying gilts. One possible answer, put forward particularly by leading monetarists such as Tim Congdon, is that we could take a leaf out of the US book and sell them to the banks. Over the past four years, US banks' holdings of US government securities have risen by nearly Dollars 300bn. There is a fascinating story here. If the US succeeds in its against-the-odds recovery from the horrors of full-blown debt deflation, most of the praise will be due to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Early in the 1930s, the US banking system contracted disastrously, but Greenspan now has pulled out all the stops to prevent this happening again, not only by bailing out busted banks but by giving the whole banking system an opportunity to expand its balance sheet in a highly profitable way. Thus, banks can borrow through the money markets at 3 per cent and buy treasury securities yielding 5 or 6 per cent. Weakness in private sector loan demand has not mattered. It is true that, to follow such a strategy, you have to be indifferent to some rather wild swings in the external value of your currency. You also have to worry about what might happen when the recovery comes. There are at present some huge speculative positions in the US government securities market, notably on the part of the leading Wall Street investment banks; and, if short-term interest rates were to start to rise, there could be some massive unloading of government bonds. At this stage, however, Greenspan appears to be winning. In British parlance, the Americans are 'underfunding' their deficit on a very large scale by failing to find non-bank investors for a large proportion of the paper being issued. The British government, however, is labouring under the self-imposed discipline of 'full funding,' which means that purchases of government paper by banks do not count towards financing the public sector borrowing requirement. One consequence, as Congdon says, is that whereas American banks have 22 per cent of their assets in government loans and securities, UK banks have only a minuscule 3 per cent in that category - but they have 87 per cent in UK private sector lending, of often rather dubious quality. Now, full funding versus underfunding is arguably the world's most obscure debate. In fact, so long as we were in the exchange rate mechanism, the US strategy was out of the question, anyway, because short-term interest rates had to be kept higher than gilt-edged returns. But we have now floated our way towards an upward-sloping yield curve, not yet as steep as the American one but already offering the banks some interesting possibilities, which they are oddly slow to pursue. But we need motive as well as opportunity. The trigger point could come soon. As it happens, the authorities have actually been overfunding recently because of their purchase of billions of pounds sterling from George Soros and other grateful speculators. The money markets have been quite tight and sterling has strengthened. Through the winter, the government will be underfunding temporarily to counteract this. Further ahead, though, the pressure on the authorities will build, and the government could at some stage be desperate to get away its latest Pounds 2.5bn auction. A relaxation of the full funding rule would give the long-dated part of the gilt market a useful, if temporary, tonic. Funding through the banks would be concentrated at the short-dated end. But you would then have to believe that an underfunding government would, however inconvenient it might be, change readily to another policy - one of overfunding - once the economy was expanding and private sector credit demand was serving to maintain an adequate rate of monetary growth. Here is the nub of the problem, for an arbitrary and arguably silly rule like full funding might at least be a valuable way of keeping a wayward finance ministry under some sort of control. The principle was introduced by former chancellor Nigel Lawson when he abandoned broad money growth targets in 1985 as a means of giving assurance that the public sector would not generate inflation. The British government has, nevertheless, had a particularly poor record on monetary policy since the mid-'80s. The likelihood that it will cope skilfully and responsibly with the monetary consequences of an economic recovery during 1993 or 1994 seems remote. The switch to underfunding will probably happen at precisely the wrong moment. What about Bill Clinton and those US treasury bonds? With so much speculative capital riding the bond markets, there are considerable dangers. The prospect of a big spending push by the new president has raised blood pressure among bond investors. However, if GDP already is climbing in the third quarter at a 3.9 per cent annual rate, as statisticians claim, Clinton could keep most of his powder dry. But you would be unwise to believe everything you read in bond market reports.</p>

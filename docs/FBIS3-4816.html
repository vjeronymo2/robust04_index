The changes were measured on the central bank's wholesale  price index, which stood at 93.5 against the base of 100 for  1990.    Domestic wholesale prices alone were unchanged from the  previous 10 days because higher prices for oil, coal and  textiles were offset by lower prices for steel.    Compared with year-earlier levels, domestic wholesale prices  were down 1.9 percent.    Export prices were unchanged from the previous 10 days in  terms of currencies in which they were contracted, but up 4.7  percent from a year earlier.    In yen terms, export prices were down 2.5 percent from the  previous 10 days and down 6.2 percent from a year earlier.    Import prices were down 1.6 percent in yen terms from the  previous 10 days and down 12.9 percent from a year earlier.    In terms of currencies used for signing contracts, import  prices were up 0.1 percent from the preceding 10 days but down  2.9 percent from a year earlier.</p>

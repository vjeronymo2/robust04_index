			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Britain to drop project for new Pounds 3bn N-missile: RAF hit as government warned more cuts may cripple services THE GOVERNMENT is expected next week to shelve plans for a new nuclear missile for the Royal Air Force which would have cost up to Pounds 3bn. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is set to make the announcement on Monday at the start of a two-day Commons debate on defence. The decision means the RAF faces losing its nuclear mission after its current WE177 bombs become obsolete. Mr Rifkind is also expected to outline the government's views on the future of the royal dockyards including moves towards private-sector ownership, probably from 1996. The dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth are now managed by private-sector companies under contract. Savings from these measures are seen as going some of the way to responding to Treasury pressure for further cuts in defence spending. The Treasury is believed to be seeking a reduction of about Pounds 1bn in the defence budget, currently Pounds 23.7bn for next year. This would be in in addition to cuts of Pounds 1.05bn over two years, imposed last November. The Ministry of Defence argues that the armed forces cannot sustain further cuts unless Britain reduces or abandons some of its defence commitments in the UK, Europe or overseas. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the Commons defence committee, warned yesterday that more reductions could cripple the services. Lord Bramall, a former chief of defence staff, called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to intervene against further personnel and equipment cuts. The decision to dispense with the new missile, which would have been a joint effort with either France or the US, reflects both the squeeze on spending and the dramatic change in the strategic situation since discussions began almost six years ago. It appeared increasingly unlikely that Britain would be able to test a warhead for the missile, because of the US moratorium on testing and forthcoming negotiations on a global ban. Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have opposed the new missile. Funding for the air-launched weapon - known as the tactical air-to-surface missile or TASM - was included in the MoD's secret long-term costings. However, this sum is understood to have been much less than the Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn overall cost estimated by experts, and the savings will come in the medium rather than short term. The two missiles being considered as the basis for the project were the Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (Slat) made by Martin Marietta of the US, and the Air-Sol Longue Portee, an extended-range version of a missile already in service with the French air force. An earlier candidate, a nuclear version of Boeing's Short-Range Attack Missile, was cancelled by the US in 1991. Aerospatiale, the state-controlled French company which has been working on the ASLP project, said yesterday: 'It is very unlikely that the French government will continue alone.'</p>

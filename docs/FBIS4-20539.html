			<p>BFN     [Text] Aerospatiale and SAFT [Portable and Fixed  Accumulator Company] have created the Aerospatiale-Batteries  (ASB) Company, whose main activity will be the design,  production, and marketing of thermal batteries, which are  essential components of autonomous energy supply systems of  tactical missiles in flight.    Anticipating an annual turnover of 80 million French francs,  ASB, 71.8 percent of which is owned by Aerospatiale, will become  the largest company in Europe and the second largest in the  world in this sector, after the U.S. company Eagle Picher.    Thermal batteries are also used in aeronautics and space  applications and in power supplies of security systems.  Aerospatiale Espace et Defense has ordered a thermal battery  from ASB for supplying power to a system designed to avoid all  risks of collision between the Ariane 5 launcher and its  strap-on boosters at the moment of separation.</p>

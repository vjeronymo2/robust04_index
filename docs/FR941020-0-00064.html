			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 27, 1988 (53 FR 43584), OSM amended the permanent program regulations governing permanent and temporary impoundments at surface and underground mining operations. The 1988 rules incorporated design and performance requirements for impoundments and spillways that were based on MSHA criteria and SCS classification for Class B and C structures. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The 1988 rules also authorized the approval of sediment ponds that rely primarily on storage to control the runoff from the design precipitation event, as opposed to relying on both principal and emergency spillways. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Earth Dams and Reservoirs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Release No. 60, Revised October 1985, as amended in October 1990 and distributed via Amendment 1, January 30, 1991, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service Engineering Division defines three classes of dams, Class (a)._Dams located in rural or agricultural areas where failure may damage farm buildings, agricultural land, or township and country roads. Class (b)._Dams located in predominantly rural or agricultural areas where failure may damage isolated homes, main highways or minor railroads or cause interruption of use or service of relatively important public utilities. Class (c)._Dams located where failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to homes, industrial and commercial buildings, important public utilities, main highways, or railroads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 30 CFR 816.49 of the 1988 rules on impoundments was challenged by environmental groups who incorrectly interpreted that the 1988 rules were based only on MSHA criteria. In its decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NWF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 88&hyph;3345 (D.D.C. August 30, 1990), the court noted the issue involved the interplay of three laws and three Federal agencies charged with writing regulations to carry out those laws. Each of the laws governs water impoundments, but with different goals in mind. In addition to SMCRA, the laws are: (1) the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, Pub. L. 83&hyph;566, and rules issued under it by the SCS, including technical standards for the design and construction of impoundments found in Technical Release Number 60 (TR&hyph;60) ``Earth Dams and Reservoirs,'' and Practice Standard 378 ``Ponds''; and (2) the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act and rules issued under it by the MSHA. Section 515(b)(8)(B) of SMCRA has a mandate to ensure that impoundments meet the stability requirements of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The court found that the SCS standards referred to in the preamble to 30 CFR 816.49(a)(3)(i) are, as the Secretary noted, the SCS Class B and C dams. Furthermore, the court stated ``[i]ndeed, in the Secretary's view, he has provided greater protection in this rule than does SCS because he mandated the stricter design standard when an impoundment meets either SCS's qualitative standard for Class B and C dams or the MSHA's size standard, which covers more impoundments than does the SCS's looser size standard.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NWF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , slip. op. at p. 65. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The court did note that a plain reading of the preamble may result in some ambiguity. To clarify this issue for all water impoundments design, construction, and performance, OSM proposed regulations to reference specifically both SCS Class B and C impoundments and MSHA impoundments in all rules at 30 CFR 780.25 and 816.49 where impoundment-related criteria are found. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29774), OSM proposed to amend its permanent program regulations governing permanent and temporary impoundments at surface and underground mining operations. In addition to soliciting public comments and providing an opportunity for public hearings upon request, OSM provided a 146-day comment period. The comment period was extended beyond its original 60-days in response to a request for an extension and to coordinate this rulemaking with OSM's evaluation and decision on a petition to initiate rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM received a letter on September 12, 1991, from the Joint National Coal Association and the American Mining Congress (NCA/AMC) Committee on Surface Mining Regulations, as a petition for rulemaking. The petitioners requested that OSM propose rulemaking which incorporates a ``statutory'' distinction between temporary and permanent impoundments as it pertains to the incorporation of standards issued under Public Law 83&hyph;566 including TR&hyph;60. The petition to initiate rulemaking was published on October 21, 1991 (56 FR 52494). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM received 11 comments on the proposed rulemaking and 3 comments on the petition from 11 organizations, including State regulatory authorities, environmental groups, representatives of the coal industry, and professional organizations. No public meeting was requested and none was held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

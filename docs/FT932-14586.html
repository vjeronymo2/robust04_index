			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Food and Drink: Appetisers NOW IS a good time to buy sea kale. The leaves - waxy, blue-green and coarsely toothed - are tastiest when young and should be steamed and eaten with melted butter and flakes of freshly grated Parmesan or eaten raw in salads. Michael Paske grows it on his Grantham, Lincolnshire, farm following roughly the same methods used by Victorian gardeners. The cut fresh vegetable is available by mail order until the end of July; a standard pack of 500 gms costs Pounds 6.50, inclusive of post and packing. It is also available at Waitrose supermarkets at Pounds 1.45 for a pack of 135 gms. Ring 0400-50449 to order.</p>

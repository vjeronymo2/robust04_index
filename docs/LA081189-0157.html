			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FRESNO PLANS STADIUM 'SKY SUITES'  </P> <P> Cal State Fresno plans to install luxury "sky suites" that will cost users up  to $30,000 a year as part of an expansion of the school's football stadium.  </P> <P> The 34 sky suites would seat up to 20 people each or a total of 680 of those  who will fill the nearly 14,000 new seats that would increase the capacity of  Bulldog Stadium to about 44,000. Cost of the sky suites would range from  $10,000 to $30,000, with the highest-priced ones closest to the 50-yard line.  </P> <P> If the sky boxes are built, they would be among the few in the nation at a  college stadium, Scott Johnson, Fresno State's sports information officer, said  Thursday.  </P> <P> "They're pretty much found on the pro level," Johnson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO ASKS U.S. TO PROBE ACTIONS OF BORDER PATROL  </P> <P> The Mexican Embassy has filed a complaint with the U.S. State Department,  asking for an investigation of two border incidents last month in which one  Mexican youth was run over and killed by a Border Patrol vehicle and another  was shot and wounded by a Border Patrol agent.  </P> <P> Marcela Merina, spokeswoman for the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, on Tuesday  categorized the action by the embassy in Washington as "a show of concern about  these incidents along the border" and said the complaint, filed Friday, was not  an official diplomatic protest.  </P> <P> The first incident occurred Aug. 20 in the predawn hours when Luis Eduardo  Hernandez Hernandez, 14, was run over by a Border Patrol vehicle less than a  mile west of the San Ysidro port of entry.  </P> <P> In the second incident on Aug. 27, Pedro Garcia Hernandez, 15, was shot once in  the stomach by an agent who said the youth had grabbed a "softball-sized" rock  and was going to throw it at another agent. Like the previous incident, the  shooting occurred just west of the San Ysidro port of entry.  </P> <P> "Regarding the first of the two incidents . . . this is not the first time that  a Mexican citizen (has been) run over by a INS (Immigration and Naturalization  Service) vehicle when trying to escape from the U.S. Border Patrol," the  Mexican complaint said. "With regard to the second, the response of the INS  agent, to maim or kill, was clearly out of proportion to the threat of having a  stone thrown at him."  </P> <P> Luis, who was from the Mexican state of Jalisco, died while trying to enter the  United States with his 15-year-old brother. The two were en route to Los  Angeles to reunite with their father. Border Patrol officials said the vehicle  that killed the boy was traveling 15 m.p.h., but a lawyer representing the  family said it was being driven recklessly at high speed.  </P> <P> Pedro, a Tijuana orphan, lived in an abandoned car near the border and said he  was just walking in the area when he was shot. He denied throwing any rocks.  </P> <P> Merina said that Mexican officials have also asked the State Department to  investigate another incident that occurred less than two hours before Pedro was  shot. In that incident, three U.S. journalists witnessed a Border Patrol agent  use his vehicle's public address system to taunt and shout obscenities at  hundreds of immigrants waiting along the border near where the youth was shot.  </P> <P> Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg said the taunting incident is under  investigation by the office of the inspector general. San Diego police are  investigating the other two incidents, but the Border Patrol cleared the agents  of any wrongdoing.  </P></p>

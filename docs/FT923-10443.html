			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Lotus gears up to peddle innovative design concept - John Griffiths analyses commercial prospects for the hi-tech cycle that has fulfilled British Olympic hopes LOTUS Engineering, the consultancy design and engineering arm of General Motors' British sports-car subsidiary, is looking for a partner to produce and distribute a roadgoing form of the 'supercycle' with which Chris Boardman of the UK has won an Olympic gold medal. It wants versions of the LotusSport pursuit cycle used by Boardman, known as the Windcheetah, on world markets by early next year. It would offer a more traditional riding position but would incorporate the basic concept of a one-piece moulded monocoque frame. Failure to do so may risk losing the benefit of the unprecedented publicity for the machine. 'We could lose the market to makers of replicas which might look the same but lack its integrity and performance,' Lotus said yesterday. Lotus plans to build a very limited number of machines over the next few months at its Group Lotus headquarters in Hethel, Norfolk, which has extensive facilities created originally for sports car production. The machines will be built for top competition cyclists and will cost at least Pounds 5,000 each. Lotus might go on to build up to 1,000 somewhat less expensive units a year  -forgoing carbon fibre at Pounds 330 a kilogramme and titanium at Pounds 150 a kilogramme - within its existing facilities. It is mainly interested in finding a partner to which it can either license the manufacture of a much higher volume of cheaper machines, a subcontractor capable of building them - or taking part in a joint venture that might lead to purpose-built facilities being created at Hethel. Lotus Engineering does not expect initial derivatives of the 'supercycle' to be sufficiently cheap to challenge manufacturers such as Raleigh in the conventional cycle market. The cycle is seen as presenting a potential challenge both to conventional racing and quasi-racing cycles and to the fad for 'mountain' bikes. Lotus lays claim to having done substantial development work on the cycle, and has invested some Pounds 125,000 in it. But it acquired the rights to the machine from its creator, Norwich-based engineer Mr Michael Burrows, who had spent several years trying to interest cycle manufacturers in his concept.</p>

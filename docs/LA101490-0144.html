			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEDICATION HELD FOR MONUMENT TO FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> A national monument etched with the names of 1,238 firefighters who have died  in the line of duty since 1981 was dedicated Saturday at a ceremony that  recounted the tales of fallen heroes.  </P> <P> President Bush signed legislation in August designating the 9-year-old monument  at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg as the official national memorial to  career and volunteer firefighters who died on the job.  </P> <P> "While many local communities and states honor their fallen heroes, this  memorial stands as a lasting national tribute to those who have answered their  last alarm," said Olin L. Greene, administrator of the U.S. Fire  Administration.  </P> <P> About 200 people, including state, local and national officials and  firefighters from across the country, attended the ceremony held at the  seven-foot-tall, pyramid-shaped limestone monument.  </P> <P> "In recent years, many people have bemoaned our country's lack of national  heroes," said Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who shepherded legislation through  Congress to get the memorial dedicated. "What they fail to realize is that we  do have heroes in every fire hall across this land."  </P></p>

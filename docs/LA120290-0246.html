			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I would like to express my disappointment about "China Beach." They have  changed the format and it's like coming into a book in the middle without  knowing what went on before. I sure wish the producers would get the show back  on track before it's too late.  </P> <P> Toni Jacobson, Monterey Park  </P></p>

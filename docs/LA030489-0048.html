			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS HAVE NO DEFENSE FOR THEIR POOR DEFENSE  </P> <P> Once again, the Kings have made the trade (they think) will bring the Stanley  Cup to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> I think that's seven years in a row now!  </P> <P> Rogie Vachon should know, better than anyone else, what makes a goaltender and  his team successful: defense.  </P> <P> A goaltender is only as good as the people playing in front of him.  Unfortunately for the Kings' goaltenders, the people in front of them are  really good. The problem is that they are always wearing the wrong jerseys.  </P> <P> THOMAS FOURNIER  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

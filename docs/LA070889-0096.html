			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVANGELICALS AIM FOR YEAR 2000 AS TARGET DATE FOR SPREADING FAITH  </P> <P> Evangelicals, a growing force in Christianity, open a global conference next  week to refine strategies for spreading the faith, some aiming for it to be  offered to everyone by AD 2000.  </P> <P> That widely asserted target sometimes is considered more as a stimulus than a  potentially accomplishable task. But the fervor for working at it is mounting  in many church quarters.  </P> <P> "The Countdown Has Begun" goes the title on a book of interdenominational  planning discussions held early this year in Singapore. But the mission's  success was seen to require some course corrections.  </P> <P> "We see afresh that cooperation and partnership are absolute necessities if the  Great Commission is going to be fulfilled by the year 2000," the participants  said.  </P> <P> Up to now, they said, "pride, prejudice, competition and disobedience have  hindered our generation from effectively working at the task of world  evangelization."  </P> <P> The "Great Commission" refers to biblical instructions attributed to Jesus to  present his message to all peoples. Evangelicals have a special passion for  proclaiming that message and eliciting belief in it.  </P> <P> Advancing that task beyond any particular time frame is the objective of the  International Congress on World Evangelization, which is meeting Tuesday  through July 20 in Manila.  </P> <P> Evangelist Billy Graham had been scheduled to give the opening address, but  canceled the Manila appearance in favor of extending his "Mission '89" in  London, his office said.  </P> <P> More than 4,000 evangelical-minded Christians of both mainline, historic  churches and smaller evangelically oriented groups in 190 countries are  expected to make the Philippines gathering one of the largest of its kind.  </P> <P> It has been dubbed "Lausanne II," a successor to a similar gathering in  Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, which was convened by Graham's organization and  spawned a continuing, interlinked movement.  </P> <P> The Rev. Leighton Ford of Charlotte, N.C., chairman of the Lausanne committee  that is sponsoring this year's congress, says the session will address new,  crucial issues that are affecting evangelization.  </P> <P> "Secularism is rampant and we're suffering from a lack of evangelical  cohesion," he said.  </P> <P> Planners say participants are coming both from major Protestant and Orthodox  churches in the World Council of Churches and also those outside it, plus some  Roman Catholic evangelization specialists.  </P></p>

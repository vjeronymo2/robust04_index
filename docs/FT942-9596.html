			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK rejects French compromise Britain and France yesterday held high-level talks in an attempt to defuse the crisis over access to Orly airport, write Paul Betts in London and John Ridding in Paris. But British Airways and Air UK insisted they would launch services to Orly on Monday in defiance of a ban by the French government. France is understood to have offered a compromise by suggesting it was prepared to open Orly to UK carriers at the end of June. However, Britain insisted that UK carriers had 'the right' to fly to Orly on Monday, after the European Commission's ruling last month ordering France to open the Orly-London route immediately. UK officials said Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, and Mr Bernard Bosson, his French counterpart, were expected to hold telephone talks last night in an effort to resolve the dispute. BA group managing director Robert Ayling said last night that if the airline was not allowed into Orly it would consider going to the French courts to seek compensation from the French government.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Bethlehem posts loss of Dollars 39.2m WEAK demand and mounting costs have lead Bethlehem Steel, the second largest US steel manufacturer, to unveil a Dollars 39.2m loss after tax in the first three months of 1991. In the same period a year ago, the company made a profit of Dollars 21.3m. Bethlehem warned it expected to report a further deficit in the second quarter of the year, despite 'a slight seasonal upturn'. 'While there are some signs of stability and potential recovery for the economy . . . the outlook remains uncertain because of high unemployment, credit constraints and the recent strengthening of the dollar,' the company said. But the Pennsylvania-based company said it was still studying the possibility of a collaborative venture with British Steel. The venture, announced in outline earlier this year, would involve the UK company in taking over and reorganising the US group's subsidiaries which make structural and rail steels. Yesterday, Bethlehem said that, as part of a feasibility study, talks were being held with the United Steel Workers Association 'concerning the joint venture's requirements for competitive labour costs'. Bethlehem had warned it would probably post a first-quarter loss, although it did not specify the extent of the expected deficit. Bethlehem said the basic steel division turned in an operating loss of Dollars 26m, against a profit of Dollars 29m a year ago. Steel-related operations made an operating loss of Dollars 7m, against a Dollars 4m deficit in the first quarter of 1990. As a result, the overall loss at the operating level reached Dollars 33.3m, compared with Dollars 25m profit last year.</p>

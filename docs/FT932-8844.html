			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: Restrictions on parallel imports Sir, The proposal being put forward to remove the restrictions on parallel imports in UK copyright law is both inappropriate and indiscriminate ('They're picking up bad vibrations', May 13). It is inappropriate because the restrictions are no more than a logical extension of the copyright owner's basic right to ban unauthorised copies, that is copies which infringe the owner's copyright on his or her work. Lifting the restrictions implies a more wide-ranging review of copyright principles than has been canvassed - or admitted by the critics of the restrictions - so far. It is also indiscriminate. Why should the music industry be deprived of a right currently enjoyed by all UK copyright holders? It is essential to the wealth of many of the industries that rely for their livelihood on adequate copyright protection that unlawful imports can be restricted. Until this inconsistency has been resolved, one must suspect that reform of copyright law is the wrong target for those concerned by high CD prices.

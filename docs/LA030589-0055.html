			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'FLEMING IS NOT A BAD SCHOOL. WE'VE JUST HAD BAD LUCK.';  </P> <P> TRAUMATIZED SCHOOL ON THE MEND  </P> <P> Though only a few miles from some tough Los Angeles neighborhoods where crime,  gangs and other big-city problems are common, Fleming Junior High in Lomita is  the kind of place where nothing ever happened.  </P> <P> But in the last 15 months, students have been traumatized by a rape and two  shootings -- one student was killed, another wounded -- as well as the  unexpected death of their principal. Fleming administrators cannot recall as  turbulent a period in the school's 32-year history.  </P> <P> The litany of tragic events began in November, 1987, with a ninth-grade "ditch"  party, when about 25 teen-agers -- many of them older students from other  schools -- cut classes and went to the home of a Fleming student while his  parents were away. The alcohol-fueled party ended with the gang rape of a  15-year-old female Fleming student. Three high school students were charged  with rape or attempted rape, and two Fleming students were arrested on  suspicion of rape but were not charged. The victim eventually transferred to  another school.  </P> <P> Last October, 15-year-old Fleming student Cesar Chavez was shot to death in a  gang-related drive-by shooting in Compton. Although the incident occurred  off-campus, students were devastated by the death of their classmate.  </P> <P> Then, on Feb. 23, Adam Mendoza, a ninth-grade student and reputed gang member,  was shot and injured on campus. Police said the 16-year-old student flashed  gang hand signs at passengers in a passing car, who fired at least five shots  at Mendoza, striking him once in the shoulder.  </P> <P> The Mendoza shooting happened only just days after students and faculty were  shocked by the sudden loss of the school's principal, Patrick Cragin. The lanky  6-foot, 11-inch administrator died at age 48 of a heart attack he suffered  while watching his daughter play in a volleyball game in Nevada.  </P> <P> School administrators and faculty members, including counselors and the staff  psychologist, have rallied to help Fleming's 1,350 students cope with the  crises.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We've Just Had Bad Luck'  </P> <P> "It's like so much to bear all in one year," said ninth-grader Vashia Rhone,  14. "Fleming is not a bad school. We've just had bad luck."  </P> <P> The incidents, in particular the sudden deaths of Cragin and Chavez, left  students shocked and disbelieving, administrators said.  </P> <P> On the day of Chavez's funeral, dozens of students got permission to leave  campus and attend the funeral Mass across the street at St. Margaret Mary  Catholic Church. Many students donated money to help his family pay funeral  expenses.  </P> <P> Some students at first refused to accept the principal's death, said Assistant  Principal Don Wilson. "There was almost disbelief that he was here that Friday  and was gone that Tuesday," he said. "A student came up to me and said he  didn't believe it. He said, 'I know you're joking.' "  </P> <P> After Cragin's death, "students were very sad," said Assistant Principal  Constance Rupert. "They still come into the office and ask if he's really  dead."  </P> <P> "It was like it wasn't real," said ninth-grader Jennifer Skoda.  </P> <P> The concept of death "really isn't real" for many junior high-age students, but  students are gradually coming to accept it, said school psychologist Shamim  Ibrahim, who counseled some students after the deaths.  </P> <P> After the shooting last month, "we had some boys and girls who were crying,"  Ibrahim said. "Mostly the students were concerned for his (Mendoza's) safety,  whether he lived, whether he was seriously injured."  </P> <P> Some students fear the violence they have heard about in other areas is  encroaching on Lomita, and on their school.  </P> <P> "It was shocking," said Ivy Walker, 13, "because it's the kind of thing that  happens at other schools."  </P> <P> "It's just spreading," said student body President Craig Valenzuela, 15. "I  don't think you're afraid until it happens right in front of you."  </P> <P> Parent Jeff Baker, president of the School-Community Advisory Council, said  most parents are aware that some Fleming students are gang members.  </P> <P> Most Fleming students come from feeder schools in Lomita, Harbor City and  Torrance, including Eshelman Avenue Elementary in Lomita, Harbor City  Elementary School and Halldale Avenue Elementary and Meyler Street Elementary,  both in Torrance, Fleming officials said.  </P> <P> After last month's on-campus shooting, parent concern for their children's  safety has increased, said Baker, who graduated from Fleming in 1971 and has a  son in the seventh grade there.  </P> <P> Nearby gang activity "does spill over, although the immediate area around the  school is basically a quiet neighborhood," Baker said. The potential for  violence, he said, "is one of those things a lot of Fleming parents didn't put  a lot of thought into until it happened."  </P> <P> Although the school does not have an on-campus guard, Fleming parents may  request such security in light of last month's shooting, Baker said.  </P> <P> "We feel the incident couldn't have been prevented by having campus security,  but it could have aided in apprehending someone faster," Baker said. Los  Angeles Unified School District police arrested a reputed gang member the day  of the shooting on suspicion of attempted murder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Principal  </P> <P> Fleming's new principal is James Marshall, formerly assistant principal in  charge of discipline and security at Steven White Junior High in Carson.  </P> <P> During an interview on his first day at Fleming last Thursday, Marshall and  other administrators discussed security changes at the school. One new rule  prohibits students from lingering on Fleming's front lawn before and after  school, administrators said.  </P> <P> Students also are no longer allowed near the playground fence during physical  education. That is where gang hand signs were exchanged last week between  students on campus and passengers in a black car from which the shots were  later fired at Mendoza.  </P> <P> Administrators will increase campus patrols, using portable radios, and they  will continue to enforce dress codes prohibiting gang clothing and colors,  Marshall said.  </P> <P> "Our schools are safe and we'll take whatever measures necessary to keep them  that way," Marshall said.  </P> <P> At least one student concerned about his safety has requested a transfer. Such  requests will be handled "on a case-by-case basis," Marshall said.  </P> <P> But other students said they are not fearful and hope the trauma is over.  </P> <P> The school's flag had been flown at half-staff since Cragin's death. When  students arrived at school on Monday "the flag was at full mast again," said  Vashia Rhone. "It was like a cloud had lifted."  </P></p>

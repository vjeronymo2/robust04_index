			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Israel quick to establish trade relations ISRAEL and China are moving swiftly to establish trade and business ties, following the visit by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, to China last month. Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest banking group, yesterday said it had established correspondent banking relations with China during a high-level Hapoalim mission to Beijing. The bank said the relations would help Israeli and foreign clients of Hapoalim wishing to invest in and trade with China. Bank Hapoalim's announcement followed the signing in Jerusalem of a memorandum on agricultural co-operation between Israel and China. The memorandum, signed by Mr Liu Jiang, China's agriculture minister, and his Israeli counterpart, Mr Yacov Tzur, provides for the establishment of a standing Chinese-Israeli agricultural committee, exchange of experts and information, the strengthening of a joint training programme and the establishment of a joint Israeli-Chinese model farm near Beijing where Israeli agricultural experts can demonstrate Israeli technology to Chinese farmers. During Mr Jiang's eight-day visit to Israel, which ends tomorrow, a Dollars 1.5m deal was also concluded between Plastro G'vat of Israel and Beijing Plastic to sell Israeli irrigation equipment to China. Chinese technicians are already learning about the irrigation technology at Kibbutz G'vat. Mr Jiang said Israeli irrigation equipment and other agricultural technology would be especially helpful in western China, which has a similar climate to Israel's. 'Your irrigation systems can contribute a lot to advance the co-operation between the two countries,' he said. Israeli officials said strengthening economic ties between the two countries was a result of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. China has always supported the Palestinians and held up ties despite establishing diplomatic relations with Israel two years ago. Mr Dan Proper, president of the Israeli Manufacturers Association, who accompanied Mr Rabin to China last month, said yesterday further trade deals and joint ventures were in the pipeline, especially in advanced agricultural technology and irrigation, communications, telephones and electronics, food conservation, and chemicals such as potash.</p>

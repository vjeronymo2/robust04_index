			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / In a state of resignation: Robert Graham asks what lies ahead for Italy and Berlusconi Europe's first experiment of a media magnate in politics ended acrimoniously yesterday, when Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi handed in the resignation of Italy's 52nd postwar government. Mr Berlusconi, the owner of the Fininvest business empire who decided to become a politician in January, had been in office only 226 days. For those enamoured of statistics, he was the 28th longest serving premier since 1946. He was forced to resign to head off the defeat of his battered rightwing coalition in parliament. Defeat became inevitable last weekend when Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and one of his two principal partners in government, decided to table a motion of no confidence. Mr Bossi's defection, even though it split the League, left Mr Berlusconi without a working majority in both houses of parliament. The next step will be up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. He has to decide whether to sustain the life of the present legislature or to impose elections on the country for the third time in four years. Every option carries serious risks for the future political and economic stability of Italy. Perhaps the most destabilising would be a snap election with Mr Berlusconi heading a caretaker administration. Another election would automatically take a chunk out of the nation's life. Between dissolving parliament and voting in a general election, 60 days must pass. It then takes up to two months for the government to be formed, a confidence vote to be passed and the necessary parliamentary commissions to be staffed. Mr Berlusconi was asked to form a government on April 28, one month after the general elections. His cabinet team was ready 13 days later and another week passed before all the confidence votes in the two houses were concluded. A quick dissolution of parliament after Christmas risks leaving Italy with a weak caretaker government for five months, and there is no clear picture of who would constitute the next government: alliances are so fluid. The League is splitting; Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia has no coherent structure and even less ideology. Of the bigger groupings, only the former communist Party of the Democratic Left on the left and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance on the right have well-defined positions. Amid shifting political allegiances, the country's mood is probably still centre right. But the outgoing government has had little time and even less will to tackle a number of serious issues that will impinge on early elections. The most important are electoral reform, the conflict of in-terest between Mr Berlusconi's ownership of Fininvest and his position as a politician, control of the media - especially television, the confrontation between the executive and the judiciary over corruption investigations, and the pensions reform needed to tackle Italy's budget deficit. Going to the polls with the existing electoral system will encourage a confused agglomeration of parties, rather than coherent coalitions with common platforms. The electoral laws, approved in August 1993 as a result of an earlier referendum, introduced a compromise of first-past-the-post voting and proportional representation. All the parties agree that Italy should drop proportional representation. But divisions remain, especially in the Berlusconi camp, over whether to adopt a single round of voting or a second run-off as in France. On the conflict of interest, Mr Berlusconi has time and again been confronted with problems arising from his ownership of Italy's second largest private group, which is involved in a range of economic activities - not least publishing and television. He is also under investigation for alleged corruption while running Fininvest. A further reminder of these problems came yesterday, when his younger brother and close busi-ness associate, Paolo, was sentenced to 10 months in jail for bribery in connection with refuse treatment contracts. Mr Berlusconi has proclaimed his innocence, while telling colleagues he believes he will be sent for trial by a vindictive Milan magistrature. His own judicial position is unlikely to be clarified during an election campaign. Another worrying aspect of a snap election would be the outgoing administration's control of the RAI television and Mr Berlusconi's dominance of the commercial networks. The television screen will be the battle-ground for the hearts and minds of the electorate; and the current opposition could be denied equal opportunity. There is also a financial dimension. The 1995 budget, approved this week, is already out of date, and additional measures will be needed to find L20,000bn or more in the first half of the year. This is bound to worry the markets - as will the likely slippage in the June target for completing reform of the costly state pensions system. Against this background, President Scalfaro will want to see if a new parliamentary majority might be feasible. This could be difficult, however, with Mr Berlusconi and his allies, who represent close to half the deputies, opposed to such an idea. Failing this, Mr Scalfaro will probably try to appoint an interim 'techno-political' government, to ensure that Italy can go to the polls with revised electoral laws and free from chaos on the financial markets. In resigning rather than waiting for the outcome of the no-confidence vote, Mr Berlusconi has sought to force the president's hand in favour of elections, as early as March if possible. The outgoing premier even told parliament that any failure to go to the electorate after Mr Bossi's desertion would be defrauding the voters. Mr Berlusconi's only real chance of political survival lies in pressing for early elections. He could hope for a sympathy vote. Already he is making direct appeals to the people: he says all sovereignty resides in the voters, implying that the television audience rather than parliament should be the real judge of his government. His other allies - the MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini and the small Christian Democratic Centre - have stood solidly behind him. He will also pick up support from dissident members of the League. But it is questionable how long they will wish to be associated with a man who has shown himself lacking in leadership and political skill. And if he were returned to power, he would face the same problems he inherited eight months back, but magnified by his initial failure.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: WHETHER IN CLASSIC MODE OR SEXY, LACE HOLDS ITS ALLURE  </P> <P> Naughty or nice, lace is all over women's wear.  </P> <P> One can find it adorning the neck of a prim Victorian blouse or stretched over  bare skin in a sexy bodysuit.  </P> <P> This season, designers have made good use of the fabric's versatility. Some  have turned out skirts, jackets, blouses and even shorts constructed entirely  of lace. Others add just a wisp of ornamental lace to accent a collar or hem.  </P> <P> "Lace has a lot of different moods," says designer Jessica McClintock of San  Francisco, who has made lace a trademark of her tea and party dresses.  </P> <P> "I never tire of lace," McClintock says. "I find it to be the most interesting  kind of fabric. I can always find new ways of using it, whether it's over color  or as a see-through touch."  </P> <P> Her designs feature collars, insets, hems and cuffs of Venise lace that give  the clothes a sweet, old-fashioned look.  </P> <P> The Jessica McClintock boutique in South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, Costa  Mesa, carries her latest collection of suits made of floral tapestry fabric  with lace collars; silky pastel dresses with wide lace collars, cuffs and hems;  and linen suits with just a touch of lace bordering a jewel neck.  </P> <P> "Lace is perfect for romantic occasions, especially weddings," McClintock says.  "Right now it's important for just a simple cocktail dress. It's softer than  sequins and a little easier to wear. I recently attended a fashion show in New  York City, and one-third of the audience was in lace cocktail dresses."  </P> <P> McClintock designed a simple black evening jacket covered in Alencon lace with  rhinestone buttons down the front -- a sophisticated look for night. The jacket  comes with a sheer black chiffon skirt and sells for $420.  </P> <P> Her tan linen jacket, with cream-colored lace bordering a jewel neck and  covering the flaps on two lower front pockets, illustrates how lace details add  a touch of femininity to a suit. The jacket, which comes with a straight linen  skirt, costs $255.  </P> <P> As long as it's used with restraint, lace won't look frilly or girlish.  </P> <P> "Sometimes people plaster lace or frills on something so the outfit looks  cheap, young or overdone," says Nancy Johnson, who recently opened a boutique  at I. Magnin, South Coast Plaza. "The dresses end up like little wedding  cakes."  </P> <P> She prefers to add a touch of petit point lace around the collar of a classic  suit, drape lace around the shoulders and the high waist of an evening gown, or  add scallops of crocheted lace to a linen dress.  </P> <P> While McClintock and Johnson cater to conservative dressers, others use lace in  unconventional ways to please a more flamboyant clientele.  </P> <P> The hottest outfit at the ENL Gallery and Boutique in Corona del Mar is a  western-style lace shirt and pants. The shirt, for $215, is made of white  cotton lace, except for strategically placed linen inserts on the front pockets  and collar. For added glitz, it has rhinestone buttons down the front and on  the cuffs and pockets. The pants, for $175, are lace with a linen lining and  fit like a second skin.  </P> <P> "They're hard to get into, but when you do, you look great," says Esther  Leiner, manager of ENL. The outfit, by Marcy of Florida, also comes with lace  shorts or a miniskirt and can be ordered in black.  </P> <P> "It's very dramatic," Leiner says. "We can't keep it in stock. People love it  because it's very sexy but understated. They take it on cruises or to fancy  western parties. One woman wore it to her reunion at Stanford."  </P> <P> The lace collection attracts women of all ages. Leiner sold one outfit to a  75-year-old woman.  </P> <P> Lace, as anyone who has seen Madonna lately can attest, may not be suitable for  grandmothers or little girls.  </P> <P> Jakeez in Irvine carries sexy styles in stretchable cotton lace that show off  toned bodies. There's an off-the-shoulder long-sleeved top, made entirely of  white stretchable lace that has double-thick lace panels across the front to  keep it from revealing too much, available for $153.  </P> <P> The boutique also has a black lace halter top for $109, lace leggings for $83,  a body suit of black stretch knit with long lace sleeves and a lace back for  $96, and a long lace skirt with small accordion pleats for $225. Customers are  mixing up the lacy pieces with skirts, suits and blouses.  </P> <P> "It's a softer, romantic look," says Debbie Chuckas, manager of Jakeez. "Now  the play is on legs, and by wearing something like lace leggings, you're  covered, but it's still sexy."  </P> <P> Some see lace as part of an overall trend toward the softer, more relaxed looks  that have kicked off the '90s, a rebellion against constricting pinstripe  suits.  </P> <P> "It's time for women to come back and be feminine," says Jan West, area manager  for the five Westminster Lace stores in Southern California, including the  South Coast Plaza store and a new store in Brea Mall.  </P> <P> "Lace makes you look like a lady. We all work, but it's nice (if you're wearing  a suit) to have a little lace in the pocket or a camisole showing."  </P> <P> The shop has Victorian-style blouses of white cotton or linen with high necks  and lace medallion insets, white linen skirts with hems bordered in bobbin  lace, suits with jackets that have scalloped necklines and hand-embroidered  cutwork and cotton lawn dresses with elaborate cutwork on their capped sleeves  and hems. Some of the dresses are copies of antique styles.  </P> <P> "They're timeless," West says.  </P> <P> Although the latest fashion trends have added to the popularity of lace, the  ornamental fabric has been prized since its appearance during the Renaissance.  In 16th-Century England, cutwork lace was so greatly valued that Mary Tudor  forbade anyone below the rank of baron to wear it.  </P> <P> Westminster Lace imports its handmade lace from 24 different countries,  according to West.  </P> <P> Handmade lace has a subtle, uneven texture that makes it more desirable than  machine-made lace.  </P> <P> "The eye automatically registers when something is finely made. It sees the  tiny stitches and imperfections," Johnson says. "It's the difference between a  fine oil painting and a print."  </P> <P> Because they're using lace in such great quantities, however, many designers  including McClintock and Johnson supplement handmade lace trims with less  expensive Venise, considered the best of the machine-made varieties.  </P> <P> "I've seen a big change in the lace industry," McClintock says. "The equipment  has been updated. Now American domestic lace has improved to the point that  it's perfectly rich-looking." Ninety percent of the lace used in her designs is  now produced in the United States, 10% is made in France.  </P> <P> Despite the latest lacy looks, designers who have long been loyal to lace say  it will never go out of style.  </P> <P> "Fads come and go, but lace itself is classic," Johnson says. "It's an art  form, so it will continue forever."  </P></p>

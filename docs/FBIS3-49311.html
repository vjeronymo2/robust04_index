			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, January 7 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb  President Radovan Karadzic on Friday evening expressed readiness  to make territorial concessions to the Bosnian Moslems in some  areas, which are of less important for the Serb people, in order  to arrive at a peace agreement.    Bosnian Serbs have measured how much they can yield at the  next round of peace talks on the future of the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina scheduled for January 18 in  Geneva, and that they "do not want a compromise when the  statehood of the Serb republic is in question or its unification  with other Serb lands," Karadzic said in a statement to Radio  Studio S of the Serb republic.    Although Bosnian Serbs and Croats had secured Bosnian  Moslems  the required third of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the latest round of  talks in Geneva and Brussels last month, Moslems again rejected  the peace accord on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three  ethnic republics, saying they were not satisfied with the  "quality" of the land.    Regarding the forthcoming Geneva talks, Karadzic said that  he  hoped they would be successful and also indicated that "enemies  of Serbs are not devoted to peace and are not serious in the  talks."    "The Austro-German bloc wants the war to continue and are  constantly encouraging the Moslems to demand a unitary Bosnia,  while the rest of Europe is against this," Karadzic said.    Commenting some statements to the effect that the United  Nations protection force (?would withdraw) from Bosnia, Karadzic  assessed this as a kind of pressure on the Moslem side. The  international community actually wants to warn Moslems that the  withdrawal of the peace-keepers would leave them all alone to  face the Christian majority, which they could not bear, he said.    Speaking about the NATO summit scheduled for January 10 and  11 in Brussels, Karadzic said that he expected new threats and  pressures on the Serb side, although experience acquired so far  indicates that methods of pressure, only on Serbs, can achieve  nothing.    "The Atlantic treaty has been left without its business and  its rival--the Warsaw Pact, and it is now trying to justify the  funds of its tax-payers and its existence," Karadzic said.    "Such behaviour is very dangerous for us, since they see us  as a great threat to European security. NATO must justify the  large costs of the military-industrial complex which is behind  it," Karadzic said.</p>

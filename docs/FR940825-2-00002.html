In developing this program, the Secretary is required to establish a NOSB. The purpose of the NOSB is to assist in the development of standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary on any other aspects of the implementation of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current NOSB has worked to develop recommendations to the Secretary to establish the initial program. It is anticipated that the NOSB will continue to work on recommendations for refinements in the program and the ongoing review of substances considered for organic production and processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A member of the NOSB shall serve for a term of 5 years, except that the Secretary appointed the original members of the NOSB for staggered terms of 3, 4, and 5 years. The terms of four members of the current NOSB, who were appointed for 3-year terms, will be completed on January 24, 1995. A member may serve consecutive terms if such member served an original term that was less than 5 years. However a member of the NOSB, with 3 years of service, seeking reappointment may only be reappointed for 3 years in accordance with 7 U.S.C. 2283 (c) which states ``No person other than an officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture may serve more than six consecutive years on an advisory committee, unless authorized by the Secretary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nominations are sought for the positions of Farmer, Handler or Processor, Retailer, and Environmentalist.

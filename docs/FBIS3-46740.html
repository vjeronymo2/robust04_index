			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The ruling coalition agreed  Wednesday [5 January] to modify a proposed legal requirement  that the Diet refuse to allocate House of Representatives seats  to miniparties that failed to muster 3 percent of valid votes  cast at the most recent national election, coalition officials  said. The agreement came at a meeting of the executives of  seven coalition partners at the coalition's political reform  headquarters, the officials said.    Both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japanese  Communist Party [JCP] have been demanding that the controversial  provision be removed from a government-proposed package of four  political and electoral reform bills.    The electoral bill calls for replacing the current  511-member  lower chamber with a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation system with an  additional 226 seats distributed on a nationwide basis.    The so-called "3-percent requirement" would oblige the Diet  to deny miniparties that failed to win 3 percent of eligible  votes any seats that would be appropriated to bigger parties  that met the requirement in proportion to the number of votes  they had mustered in single-seat constituencies. The provision  also means that unless a party has the record of winning 3  percent of votes in the most recent national election, it is not  qualified to receive an official subsidy to finance its  political activities from a proposed fund of 30.9 billion yen.    Earlier in the day, Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of  political reform, first dropped the hint that the coalition may  accept an opposition demand to soften the 3 percent requirement.    The LDP and JCP have argued that such a provision would  undermine the diet's ability to translate into national policies  the desires of voters who placed their trust in miniparties that  failed to garner 3 percent of eligible votes.    Yamahana told the House of Councillors' special committee on  political reform, "The most crucial thing is to legislate the  package. We will do our utmost by responding sufficiently to  arguments between the ruling coalition and opposition camp."    The committee kicked off the new year's first deliberations  after an eight-day recess, but the No. 1 opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) boycotted the session. In a meeting of  committee managers earlier in the day, the LDP demanded that the  resumption of debates be postponed until Thursday, parliamentary  sources said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the committee session  that reconvened in the morning the LDP's boycott is "very  regrettable."    "It is our heavy responsibility to settle the political  reform matter in order to revive public trust in politics," he  said.    The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to complete debate on  political reform at the committee "by January 14" even if the  LDP continued to boycott the committee sessions, coalition  officials said.    The package cleared the House of Representatives on November  18, but deliberations had stalled since then due to a  parliamentary row over the opening of Japan's rice market and a  payoff scandal involving Hosokawa.    The LDP has alleged Hosokawa took a 100 million yen  unreported payoff from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking  firm. Hosokawa dismissed the allegation, saying it was a mere  "loan" he claimed he had repaid.    Hosokawa has staked his political career on enactment of the  reform package in the current Diet session, due to end January  29.    Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist, told  a  meeting of the executives of Shinseito, of which he is  co-leader, that the coalition should seek to push the package  through the upper house "by January 20, even if its passage were  delayed."    "If parliamentary proceedings went without hindrance, we  would be able to secure its passage through the House of  Councillors plenary session on January 17," he said.    "The most serious point would come on January 20 if its  passage were delayed," said Ozawa, who is widely regarded as the  most powerful behind-the-scenes figure in Hosokawa's coalition  government.</p>

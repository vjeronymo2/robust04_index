			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slide as hopes of interest rate cut recede A LARGER-than-forecast rise in monthly retail sales, an unexpected fall in weekly jobless claims, and poor retail demand for new 30-year bonds unsettled fixed income investors yesterday and sent Treasury prices tumbling. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 1/16 at 101 1/16 , yielding 7.900 per cent. The two-year note was also sharply lower, down  3/16 at 99 15/32 , yielding 5.128 per cent. The day's economic news was good for the economy but bad for the bond market. The Commerce Department said retail sales had risen 0.6 per cent in January, a modest increase but bigger than forecast. An upward revision in the December numbers - from an originally reported 0.4 per cent decline to a 0.1 per cent gain - was also a surprise. The sales data, allied to a 13,000 drop in weekly state unemployment insurance claims, poured more cold water on hopes for another cut in interest rates. JAPANESE government bond prices surged after a leading politician in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party called for an immediate cut in the official discount rate. Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party, said interest rates should be cut by half a percentage point to 4.0 per cent in order to stimulate the economy. His comments immediately raised hopes that the Bank of Japan would lower the official discount rate, and prompted a rally in government bond prices and a fall in short-term interest rates. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue moved from its opening of 5.51 to close at 5.395 per cent on short-covering of positions by dealers. Short-term money market rates eased as a result of a larger-than-expected funds injection by the Bank of Japan. The unsecured overnight call rate traded mainly at 5 per cent, down  3/32 a day earlier. UK government bond prices started on a firm note, helped by the release of unemployment and average earnings figures. However, weakness in the US Treasury bond market later pulled gilt prices down to close unchanged or slightly lower on the day. Underlying average earnings rose 7.25 per cent in the year to December on a seasonally adjusted basis, after rising 7.5 per cent in November, and provided good news on inflation for the gilt market. UK unemployment rose a provisional, seasonally adjusted 53,000 in January to 2.6m, or 9.2 per cent of the workforce, up from 9.0 per cent in December. The rally in gilt prices enabled the Bank of England to sell more of its new gilt issue, the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012. Traders estimate about Pounds 750m of the new issue has been sold so far this week. But the combination of new supply and the fall in the US market pulled prices down. Trading volume in the Liffe gilt futures contract was higher than usual at over 33,000 contracts. The contract, which opened at 98.06, reached a high of 98.10 before falling back to 97.30. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 slipped from 116 15/32 to 116 13/32 . WEAKNESS in the US Treasury bond market pulled German government bond prices slightly lower in a dull day. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.17 and traded at around 88.13 by late afternoon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ronald Brown hosted a dinner party here this evening in  honor of visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and his party.    In his welcoming remarks, Brown said he hopes Zou's visist  will mark a new beginning of U.S.-China relations.    He said the two countries have a lot in common and how their  relations will develop is something that has a great bearing on  both American and Chinese peoples.    It is his belief that with the joint efforts by both sides,  the difficulties that exist at present can be overcome, Brown  said.    In reply, Vice-Premier Zou said his current visit is aimed  at  keeping the momentum of high-level contacts between China and  the United States and exploring, together with U.S. leaders and  friends from the industrial and business community here, ways to  expand economic and trade cooperation between the two countries  and pushing ahead bilateral relations in all fields.    When the world is making the transition from the old pattern  to a new one, he noted, economic considerations are becoming an  increasingly important factor in international affairs.    As the largest developing and the largest developed  countries, China and the United States have great  complementarity in the economic and trade fields, he said,  adding that these favorable subjective and objective conditions  have afforded Sino-U.S. economic relations and trade a broad  prospect for development.    China's economy, he continued, is entering a period of high  growth and its tremendous market potential is being tapped. In  face of the huge China market, people of vision and businessmen  of different countries are considering and formulating their  strategies from a new perspective in order to meet the  increasingly fierce competition, he said.    Zou expressed his sincere hope that the foresighted people  in  the U.S. industrial and business community will seize the  current historic opportunity to expand their business in China.  "What is more, I hope the U.S. Government will render more  support to its people in their efforts to compete in China and  create necessary conditions for them," he stressed.    He described it as the duty of the leaders of the two  countries to give top priority to the fundamental and long-term  interests instead of being swayed by a single, fleeting event.    So long as the two governments abide by the principles  enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the  principle of enhancing mutual confidence, reducing trouble,  increasing cooperation and refraining confrontation, Sino-U.S.  relations will register a greater development, the Chinese  vice-premier said.    Zou arrived in Washington last weekend to pay an official  visit. He is the highest-level Chinese leader to visit the  United States in five years.</p>

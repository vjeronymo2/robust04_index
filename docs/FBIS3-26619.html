In terms of the rural areas, an important issue is how to  continuously increase peasants' income through reform and  development. Comrade Xiaoping says the criterion for evaluating  our work is mainly to see whether it helps develop the socialist  productive forces; whether it helps strengthen the comprehensive  national power of the socialist state; and whether it helps  raise people's living standards. If we use this criterion to  measure our rural economic work, then I believe that while the  rural economy has achieved substantial development in recent  years, peasants' income has, however, not been raised  correspondingly, and their incomes are not in keeping with  economic development. Seen from the last five years of 1989 to  1993, the net annual income of peasants, allowing for price  rises, only increased by an average of 2.2 percent yearly. This  is far less than the 5.5 percent speed required by the target of  becoming well-off. Without peasants' income increasing,  people's living standards cannot rise, and they will not have  the enthusiasm necessary for building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Thus we cannot even begin to talk about the  development of productive forces and the strengthening of  comprehensive national power. Man is the decisive factor in our  great socialist cause. As far as the rural areas are concerned,  the decisive factor is the enthusiasm of the 800 million  peasants. If we have this enthusiasm, then there is hope for  our rural economic development and modernization of agriculture.  However, if peasants' income increases slowly and rural  purchasing power remains low, then the market for industrial  products will not be able to open up and expand in the  countryside. The potential of the large Chinese market is in the  countryside, among the 800 million peasants. Therefore, an  increase in peasants' income and a rise in their purchasing  power is an major issue determining the development of China's  market for industrial goods and the entire national economic  development. The party Central Committee and the State Council  are very concerned about this and, at the central agricultural  work meeting held not long ago, listed increasing peasants'  income as one of the major goals of rural economic development.    How to increase peasants' income? According to the  experience of the last 15 years of reform and opening up, apart  from increasing the party's and state's agricultural input and  improving the policy environment so as to adapt better to the  conditions of rural development, I believe three major changes  are needed in terms of agriculture and rural economy itself in  order to develop that economy and increase peasants' income.    The first major change is to rely on science and technology  to raise per-unit grain per mu output, constantly increase total  output, boldly adjust the industrial structure, and vigorously  increase the production of meat, eggs, milk, fruit, vegetables,  and other cash crops on the premise of satisfying the needs of  the country and the people. This is not only needed for  increasing peasants' income, but also required by the Chinese  people if their living standards are to be raised as they work  toward a well-off life. This change has already obtained  successful experience in many places. For instance, Jiangxi  Province has stabilized its total grain output above 50 billion  jin by raising per-unit yields, and thus freed up several  million mu of fields for fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, and  milk, achieving great success and increasing peasants' income  substantially. In other places it is the same. This is a  successful experience for the Chinese rural areas overall.  Compared with 1978, the per-mu grain yield for 1992 over the  whole country rose 197 jin. Because of this, while 200 million  mu was taken out of grain cultivation, total grain output rose  by 275.8 billion jin, which created the possibility of  increasing the cultivation of cash crops and restoring forests.  In accordance with the feature of China's resources structure  of having a large population with little land, while developing  land-saving farming, one must utilize sideline products, such as  the stalks of crops, to develop grain-saving animal husbandry.  One must also guide farming itself to reform from a two-tiered  structure to a three-tiered structure. In the past, farming  meant grain crops; later we added cash crops; now we again add  crops for animal feed. The growing of crops for animal feed will  become independent of farming and will produce animal feed  directly to develop animal husbandry. This will be much more  efficient than what we do now, which is to wait for corn to  ripen and then make it into animal feed. I recently visited  Germany. The Germans mash up large quantities of corn in the  field, while it is still green, to feed cattle and milch cows.  Some places in China now are doing the same. We can give full  play to our advantage of having rich farm labor resources and  exploit and use our land comprehensively to develop many kinds  of food and nutrition resources for people's consumption. That  is to say, apart from farming the 1.5 billion mu of cultivated  fields, we must also develop nonfarmland resources such as  uncultivated land, unused water, barren hills, beaches, and  courtyards to increase the effective supply of food.    The second major change is to vigorously develop the  processing industry, with agricultural products and by-products  as raw material, and the transportation industry on the basis of  discarding the traditional unitary farming and breeding  industry, so as to develop a close linkage and mutual promotion  of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. Successful  experience has already been gained in this in many parts of  China. We should summarize, spread, persist in, and develop  this experience. The agriculture of most of China basically  remains at the level of producing raw materials. On this  foundation, we should develop processing and circulation as two  necessary links of agricultural production, then the economic  efficiency of agriculture will be substantially raised, and a  broad employment outlet for rural labor will be opened up. In  terms of production management, we should organize industrial  chains according to the sequence: Trade, industry, and  agriculture. To put trade first means putting marketing first,  that is, to put the market in first place. Processing should be  conducted according to market needs, and raw material production  conducted according to processing needs. With an increase of  farm products and processed goods and the expansion of  transactions, the old state and cooperative commerce can no  longer meet the need. Thus we must actively cultivate new means  of transportation and marketing and encourage large numbers of  peasants to leave farming and breeding, get organized, and enter  the fields of circulation and services, to develop tertiary  industries in the countryside.    The third major change is to guide the farm products  processing industry and other nonfarming industries into a  relatively concentrated and regional development, so that the  development of township and town enterprises is linked with the  construction of small rural towns. Based on the rational  distribution of existing small towns, one should turn the large  number of rural laborers into nonfarming industries, at the same  time gradually concentrate them in small towns in a planned and  organized fashion, and create possibilities for them to sever  their ties with the farmland. This is not only the demand of  industrial development itself, but is also needed for  large-scale operation in agriculture. The relative  concentration of industry will generate huge demand and drive  the development of tertiary industry, and hence lead to the  development of tertiary industry. The relative concentration of  secondary industry and tertiary industry will result in the  gradual development of rural small towns. Thus, nonfarming  industry's development in the countryside will not only achieve  economic results but yield social development at the same time.  The new leap forward in China's agriculture depends on the  development of nonfarming industry in rural areas and its  combination with small towns. For agriculture to have high  productivity and increase peasants' income substantially, one  cannot rely only on raising prices. That is only one aspect.  The main way out is to transfer rural labor away from the  fields toward small towns and to operate agriculture on a large  scale. This change is a long and gradual process. It cannot be  done by rushing headlong into mass action, or by creating a  "small town fever." The correct method is to actively guide the  peasants to progress steadily.    According to current practice, the first change has already  obtained general success, and the experience should be  summarized, persisted in, and further developed. The second  change has obtained some effect in some areas and accumulated  certain experience that needs to be disseminated. The third  change has already appeared in the coastal regions and suburbs  of large cities; it requires investigation and study and summing  up of experience so that guiding principles and policies that  have the nature of a law can be promoted to guide the  realization of this change in places having the necessary  conditions. I believe that the realization of these three major  changes is the road one must take to develop rural economy and  increase peasants' income.</p>

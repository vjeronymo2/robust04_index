			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US trade benefits policy 'a success' US policy of linking improvements in labour and intellectual property rights in developing countries with the tariff-free benefits granted under the US Generalised System of Preferences has yielded 'substantial results', according to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. In the last year the US has monitored worker rights in 10 countries and intellectual property disputes in eight. These countries could lose their GSP benefits unless they show improvement in the two areas. Mr Kantor said five of 10 countries reviewed for labour violations had made enough progress to be dropped from the list of scrutinised countries. They five countries are: Bahrain, El Salvador, Fiji, Oman and Peru. El Salvador, for example, enacted a reformed labour law in close consultation with the International Labour Organisation, and violence against workers was found to have abated. Oman has joined the ILO and asked for its assistance in drafting a new labour code. Five countries which made less progress will remain on the US review list. These are: Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Maldives, Pakistan and Thailand. Eight countries reviewed for their intellectual property protection were found to have made 'important gains'. Egypt, Guatemala and Cyprus were dropped from the review list, while Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, Poland and Turkey remain on the list.</p>

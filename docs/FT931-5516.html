			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Boddington A 30 per cent profit increase from a regional pub group greeted by a 6 per cent rise in its share price suggests an unfashionable degree of consumption from both drinkers and investors alike. There were some specific reasons for Boddington's improvement: a 53-week financial year and higher investment income from its 20 per cent stake in fellow pubs group, Devenish, clearly helped. But Boddington's rise also confirms a more general truth: that running pubs these days can be far more profitable than brewing beer. By selling its brewery interests and reinvesting the proceeds in developing decent pubs with high margin foods and designer beers, Boddington has markedly improved its profitability. Even though Boddington reduced its pubs portfolio by 34 outlets and saw its beer volumes fall 4.4 per cent, this division still lifted profits by almost 10 per cent. Diversification into restaurants, drinks wholesaling and nursing homes has further boosted income. The trick has been learned by others, most notably Devenish, which Boddington failed to acquire in 1991. Devenish's own success in realising retail profits suggests Boddington has lost its main chance. This makes a share placing rather more likely than a return bid.</p>

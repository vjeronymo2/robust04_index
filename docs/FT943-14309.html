			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Local authorities 'used reserves to avoid capping' Local authorities in England and Wales drew on their reserves to an unprecedented extent last year to avoid having their budgets capped by the government, figures from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show today. Total use of reserves rose from Pounds 531m for the financial year 1993-94 to Pounds 819m in 1994-95. In some areas spending from reserves was all that stopped councils from exceeding the level at which they would have been 'capped' by the government under legislation to stop authorities from setting too high a council tax. In inner London, total budgets were only Pounds 55m below the level at which they would have been capped, and Pounds 56m of reserves had been used. In outer London Pounds 64m of reserves were used to keep budgets only Pounds 52m below the capping level. Overall reserves are equivalent to 7.3 per cent of overall annual expenditure. However, this varies across the country. In the north-west, reserves are only equivalent to 4.4 per cent of expenditure, while in the south-east outside London and in East Anglia the figure is 10.2 per cent. The government was successful in containing council tax rises, with only a 2.1 per cent increase on last year, according to the institute. The average council tax for houses in band D is Pounds 580.33 in England (Pounds 350.32 in Wales), while the average bill for all English households was Pounds 473.28 (Pounds 283.80 for homes in Wales). Local authorities were worried that this draw on reserves could not be sustained. Mr John Blundell, head of finance for the cross-party Association of District Councils, said: 'Clearly what councils are trying to do is keep spending on services. I would have thought it unlikely that local authorities could use a similar take from reserves to support services next year so the financial squeeze will be greater.' Mr David Thomas, the institute's head of local government, said: 'The government's financial equation for local authorities appears to have worked. What the figures do not show are the actions each has had to take to achieve their financial targets.'</p>

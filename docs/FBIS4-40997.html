			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 21 Jun -- The Russian-U.S. exercises  ended today on the shores of Slavyanskiy Bay in southern  Maritime Kray. Marine subunits from the Russian Pacific Fleet  and from the crew of the American amphibious vessel Dubuque,  which has been visiting the Far East, participated in the  exercises.    Two columns of "amphibians" landing from the Russian and  U.S.  vessels met precisely at midday at a crossroads that led to a  previously prepared training ground. After receiving orders  from the command point, they marched rapidly to the training  site, where, according to a plan developed by representatives of  the Pacific Fleet headquarters and the Dubuque command, it was  necessary to immediately clear up the consequences of a  hypothetical earthquake.    In the "natural disaster" area, which lay in ruins, a  support  group was already at work and equipment was being used.  Powerful machines that had been carried off the vessels started  moving the rubble and putting out fires. A flow of the "dead"  and "injured" started arriving at the evacuation points, where  they were put on helicopters and immediately taken to hospitals.    But the most interesting and exciting moment was the landing  of the assault force. A stormy wind and waves created serious  obstacles for the assault force, but the Russian armed vehicles  and the U.S. amphibious vehicles carried out the assault across  the water barrier and easily "captured" the prescribed area of  land. Their reward was praise from the leaders of the exercises:  Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov, deputy commander of the Pacific  Fleet, and David Baze, brigadier general of the U.S. Navy [name  and title as received].    Both sides believe it is necessary to regularly carry out  exercises like these on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, both in  Russia and in the United States.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: Shame about the maestros - Vienna Philharmonic While Austria waits patiently for confirmation of its entry into the European Union, the country's leading orchestra has already crossed the threshold. Since last year the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra has committed itself to an annual European series of concerts, taking it regularly to Paris, Berlin and the Royal Festival Hall in London. At the start it must have looked a foolproof project. The orchestra could play the role of Austria's cultural ambassador, exporting music of the highest quality around Europe. Unfortunately, people who thought they were being guaranteed concerts which were automatically superior have had a cruel disappointment. Nothing that the Vienna Philharmonic has done so far has lived up to memories of its visits in the 1970s and 1980s with conductors such as Bohm, Jochum and Bernstein. This is not the orchestra's fault. The standard of its playing remains at the top of the league, but the feted maestros that it has brought with it seem unable to draw from the players anything beyond technical excellence. The effect is like window-shopping in Karntnerstrasse, Vienna's premier street. The symphonies and tone poems are dressed like mannequins in the finest orchestral clothes, the cut exquisite, the textures luxurious, the quality simply the best, but the music within remains as lifeless as any shop-window dummy. Any one of our British orchestras would be proud to have a violin section that could phrase the opening of the slow movement to Schubert's Sixth Symphony as elegantly as the Vienna Philharmonic does. The balance of the wind on the movement's final chord was hardly less impressive. But even this unexceptional symphony should have some inner life. Zubin Mehta's performance vied with Levine's Brahms of last year as the most deadening in the five concerts to date. Mehta's taste is for musical extravagance. Maybe the Schubert was only included to give the audience some respite between two works of massive excess, Wagner's Overture to Rienzi and Strauss's Sinfonia domestica. The Strauss employs one of the largest orchestras ever used. Mehta knows how to marshal gargantuan forces like these and the performance was saturated in lush textures, glorious climaxes and de luxe ensemble. In the end, however, this concert left the intellect sleeping, the heart unmoved. Perhaps it is unfair to ask that a work as overblown as the Strauss should yield any deeper rewards, but probing a score's depths has never really been Mehta's forte. In none of the concerts that I have heard in these series has this marvellous orchestra penetrated to the heart of a great piece of music. Somewhere there must be a conductor who can show them the way. The VPO's next concert in London is on April 25</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Economics: US recovery prospects remain market focus INVESTORS in financial markets will keep a watch on this week's US data for signs of whether recovery in the world's largest economy is slowing down. The market's expectation is that today's US retail sales figures for March will be weak, with many forecasters looking for only a small rise in sales on the month. The pessimism is partly the result of recent weak figures for sales in US stores. The recent net drop in the US non-farm payroll figure for March has also raised concerns that the sharp upturn in US economic activity seen in the last quarter of 1992 did not follow through to the first quarter of this year. In the UK, the main figures this week will be the industrial production data and the manufacturing output data for February, due out tomorrow. There has been much debate in the UK press about the extent to which Britain is enjoying an economic recovery. Analysts in financial markets expect that the industrial production figures will show a slight rise after recording a fall of 0.4 per cent in the month to February. Later in the week, the focus in the UK will fall on the retail price inflation figures for March. Analysts believe that these figures, due out on Friday, should reinforce the favourable trend to UK inflation shown in recent months. The latest RPI figure showed that the headline inflation rate was at 1.8 per cent in the year to February. Investors in France and Germany will keep a close watch on the money market operations of both countries' central banks. The strong performance by the French franc in recent weeks has raised expectations that the authorities in Paris will lower their intervention rate, currently at 12 per cent. By contrast, expectations of large cuts in the cost of Bundesbank lending to German commercial banks have been somewhat disappointed in recent weeks. Highlights of the week are as follows. In brackets are the median market expectations for the numbers concerned, according to data provided by the MMS business information company.

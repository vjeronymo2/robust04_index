			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union warning to Timex strikers STRIKERS at the Timex company's plant in Dundee have been warned by their trade union that it may expel them if they break the law in the course of the dispute. In a letter sent to each of the 340 strikers Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said: 'Failure to obey the instructions of the union's executive council will render you liable to expulsion from the union.' Since the beginning of the Timex strike 12 weeks ago the union has been determined not to be involved in any unlawful action which would threaten its own funds. Nevertheless the AEEU is going to unprecedented lengths to protect itself from the dangers of litigation. Mr Laird told the Timex strikers loss of union membership would lead to withdrawal of the Pounds 30-a-week strike pay and other facilities. He added that they could also lose their right to complain about unfair dismissal by the company before an industrial tribunal if the union expelled them. Mr Laird says in the letter: 'The executive council is seriously concerned at reports received over the last few days about the escalating situation.' Nevertheless, hundreds of the strikers' supporters have visited the picket line outside the plant and others have held cash collections for them. In an earlier letter Mr Laird told the strikers that any picketing that took place outside the Timex plant had to be undertaken 'only by those who were formerly employed by Timex and the union's officials and limited to six people. Today the Scottish TUC is debating the Timex strike and a large contingent from the strikers is expected to lobby the delegates in Glasgow. Tomorrow the AEEU's national committee will discuss the strike at its annual conference. Next week both the company and the union will present their cases before the Commons employment committee. The dispute aroused controversy after the company dismissed all its employees for refusing to co-operate in a new working practices agreement involving lay-offs and replacing them with a substitute workforce. Timex has been unwilling to accept the intervention of the independent conciliation service Acas to resolve the dispute.</p>

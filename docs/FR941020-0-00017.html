			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission rejects the pipelines' contention that Standard H in its entirety is unnecessary due to an absence of complaints about abusive discounting practices and the existing requirements of Part 284. As discussed earlier, the Commission has received complaints of affiliate abuses, and the need to prevent preferential discounting is a fundamental premise of the regulations. Given the pipelines' incentive to favor marketing affiliates, a separate requirement that pipelines contemporaneously make the same discounts available to non-affiliates as to affiliates is necessary and not unduly burdensome. Public disclosure of affiliate discount information also is still necessary to inform non-affiliates of available discounts and to permit the market to monitor affiliate transactions. As discussed below, the Commission rejects the pipelines' contention that the current Part 284 discount reports are sufficient to replace the posting requirements under Standard H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, however, is persuaded by the rehearing petitions that its posting requirements under Standard H did not strike the proper balance between the interests at issue here. The Commission, therefore, will grant rehearing and revise the posting requirement so that the information about affiliate discount transactions will not have to be posted until 24 hours after gas flows under the discount transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The change to the posting requirement will not affect the pipelines' obligation contemporaneously to provide non-affiliates with the same discounts provided to affiliates. Any pipeline offering a discount to an affiliate will be required to make a comparable discount contemporaneously available to all similarly situated non-affiliated shippers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also is making some minor changes to make the posting easier for shippers to use. The Commission is requiring posting of the time period for which the discount applies and the maximum rate applicable to the transaction. These two data elements previously had been included in the posting requirement under former &sect;250.16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the parties point out, the Commission's prior orders were not clear as to when posting should be required. In Sunrise Energy, the Commission interpreted the prior regulations as not requiring pipelines to provide notice of discount negotiations with affiliates. On the other hand, in Colorado Interstate, the Commission held that to comply with the prior regulations, pipelines had to post offers made during negotiations on their EBBs in addition to posting the final offer. In Order No. 566, the Commission followed Colorado Interstate and required posting of discount information when an offer to an affiliate was made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has decided that this requirement does not strike the appropriate balance between the need to provide information about affiliate discounts and the need to ensure that affiliates can compete on a relatively equal basis with non-affiliates. Pipeline marketing affiliates should be able to compete in the market on the same terms as non-affiliates to the maximum extent possible. The Commission is concerned that if information about affiliate discounts is provided during the negotiating process, such information could provide non-affiliates with a competitive advantage over affiliates. As the pipelines contend, non-affiliates could use the posted affiliate information to try to interfere with an affiliate's negotiations with a customer. Non-affiliates are not subject to a similar risk, because they are not required to disclose information about the deals they negotiate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, the Commission is not persuaded by the pipelines' contention that posting is adequate if it is delayed until the month after the affiliate has transported gas under the discount transaction, as is the case under the current Part 284 reporting requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Posting the month after the transaction is too late to permit the market to monitor current affiliate transactions or to enable non-affiliates to obtain discounts during the same time period as affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 284.7(d)(5)(iv) (filing required 15 days after close of the next billing period). In addition to finding that the Part 284 reports are not filed timely enough, the Commission finds other reasons for concluding that these reports cannot substitute for the Standard H EBB postings. The Part 284 reports do not provide some of the data required by Standard H, such as delivery points and terms and conditions of the discount, information which is needed for non-affiliated shippers to determine whether potential discrimination has occurred. And, the Part 284 reports are not posted on pipeline EBBs so shippers cannot obtain easy access to this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The time that gas flows appears to establish an appropriate posting trigger. It ensures that affiliates will not be competitively disadvantaged during the period when deals are being negotiated. At the same time, it permits the market to actively monitor current affiliate transactions to quickly ensure that undue discrimination has not occurred. And, the posting is early enough so a similarly situated non-affiliate still has the time to request and obtain a discount for its transportation during essentially the same time period as the affiliate. While alternative posting times also might achieve these goals, the point at which gas flows is a reasonable choice because it is a concrete event that can be easily verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that posting when gas flows means that non-affiliates will be negotiating deals with potential customers without knowledge of discount offers to affiliates for which the non-affiliates may be eligible. But the Commission finds that this result is necessary to strike the proper balance between providing for disclosure of affiliate discount information and the preservation of competition between affiliates and non-affiliates. The primary purpose for requiring posting of affiliate information is not to provide non-affiliates with information that may be competitively useful, but to protect against undue discrimination against non-affiliates. Posting at the time gas flows achieves that purpose without the potential for providing non-affiliates with competitive advantages over affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, non-affiliates will not be without protection in the period prior to the posting. Pipelines still will be under an obligation to make discounts offered to affiliates contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliates. The non-affiliates also will know the level of discounts provided to affiliates during the prior month, and they can use this information, along with other market information, to negotiate discounts with the pipelines. If a pipeline fails to provide a non-affiliate with a discount, the posting requirement will enable the non-affiliate to examine almost immediately whether a denial of a discount amounts to discrimination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grant of rehearing makes resolution of the pipelines' arguments concerning the APA's notice and comment provisions unnecessary. Posting will be required only after the discount transaction is consummated, which is the posting time the pipelines contend was the requirement under the previous regulations and the NOPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Ministers yield on technology curriculum The government has admitted that the national curriculum in technology is unworkable and will allow schools to drop it two years earlier than planned. Technology - which includes craft subjects such as woodwork and metalwork - will remain a compulsory subject, but from September schools will be allowed far more discretion over how it is taught, and which skills should be covered. The move is an admission that the current syllabus for technology, one of the curriculum's four 'core subjects' and one of the government's educational priorities, has failed to improve standards. Employers, academics and teachers have attacked the arrangements as unworkable. The syllabus forces children to cover a wide range of disciplines, and therefore makes it impossible to specialise in individual skills. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, who has been charged with revising the entire national curriculum, will announce new proposals for technology next month. These are likely to strip out most of the compulsory requirements while maintaining a requirement for pupils to study woodwork or metalwork. The new approach cannot be implemented in all schools until September 1996, but schools will now be allowed to apply to introduce a modified version of this curriculum in September this year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research last year said the technology syllabus led to 'great difficulties in teaching' and left less academic children 'disadvantaged and demotivated'. It suggested that higher-quality work could be encouraged by allowing children to specialise.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: OMV and Verbund to merge UNDER A reorganisation plan for Austria's state-owned industrial companies, the government is planning to merge OMV, the oil company, with Verbundgesellschaft, the largest utility. The move would create an energy group with a turnover in excess of Sch85bn (Dollars 4.2bn) and would help relieve the financial strains at Austrian Industries, the state holding company which owns 72 per cent of OMV. Verbund itself is 51 per cent controlled by the government, with the rest of the company's equity publicly owned and listed on the Vienna bourse. Verbund is expected to acquire at least 50 per cent of OMV, which is worth about Sch10bn at stock market prices, although Walter Fremuth, Verbund chairman, has said he would pay less than market value for the OMV stake. The deal would give Austrian Industries a much needed cash injection and bolster the group's plans for a public flotation in 1993. These have been threatened by heavy and continuing losses at AMAG, the group's aluminium offshoot. Analysts believe a slimmed-down Austrian Industries reduced to its remaining steel, aluminium and engineering activities, would pose less of a problem in terms of profit prospects, borrowings and investment attractions in the event of a public issue of shares. But the loss of OMV would constitute a setback for Austrian Industries chairman Hugo Michael Sekyra, who until recently had hoped to float the group as a whole on to the Vienna bourse. However, the merger of OMV and Verbund has still to cross a number of hurdles, notably the tangled webb that constitutes the Austrian political scene. The planned reorganisation is the brainchild of the new minister of transportation and nationalised industries, Viktor Klima, a Social Democrat and former OMV executive. In contrast, Verbund is under the control of the ministry of economics, which is the in hands of the opposing conservative People's Party.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA CUTS UNIVERSITY ROLLS BY 30,000 IN BID TO CURB DISSENT  </P> <P> China's government, further clamping down on intellectuals and education after  crushing the student-led pro-democracy movement, said Friday that 30,000 fewer  students will enter universities this fall.  </P> <P> Chinese sources said Beijing University, a traditional hotbed for political  dissent and a center of the recent movement, was singled out in the cutback.  First-year enrollment will be slashed to 800 from 2,000, and no new graduate  students will be admitted, the sources said.  </P> <P> Government television quoted a State Education Commission spokesman as saying  the overall number of students entering universities this fall would be reduced  to 610,000 from 640,000.  </P> <P> Teaching and living conditions could not be kept up and some graduating  students have been unable to find or hold down jobs, the education commission  was quoted as saying in explanation.  </P> <P> The report suggested that some academic programs have strayed from the  Communist Party line.  </P> <P> "Some subjects, for instance the humanities, are not well defined," the  spokesman said. "They must be reorganized to serve the needs of socialist  construction."  </P> <P> Political education had become a weak link and students of all disciplines  "were imbued with bourgeois ideas of every description," the spokesman added.  "Political terms such as democracy, freedom and human rights are much in vogue  among students."  </P> <P> Universities were centers for the democracy movement that spread across China  in April and May. The movement was crushed June 3 when the army fired on  unarmed crowds in Beijing, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands.  </P> <P> In Hong Kong, 18 journalists of the pro-China newspaper Wen Wei Po resigned  Friday in support of the newspaper's director, Lee Tze-chung, who was sacked  for condemning the crackdown. Under Lee's direction, the Hong Kong paper had  published a number of articles describing the military attack on student-led  demonstrators.  </P> <P> Almost 3,000 people are confirmed to have been detained and at least 29  executed for their roles in the unrest.  </P> <P> China's most prominent dissident, Fang Lizhi, was dismissed as vice chairman  and council member of the Natural Dialectics Research Society, an independent  scientific research organization, the Beijing Daily reported.  </P> <P> Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, have been sheltered at the U.S. Embassy since  June 7 despite China's demands they be handed over to face charges of  "counterrevolutionary" crimes.  </P></p>

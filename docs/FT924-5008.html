			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Hard costs of child care - Keith Wheatley meets a woman who combines a top job at Price Waterhouse with running her own childcare consultancy HELEN Jameson is a mother used to measuring costs. As an accountant, she works in a senior management role with the capital markets section of Price Waterhouse. As an entrepreneur, she is one half of Lilliput, a consultancy focused on all aspects of non-parental childcare and running its own nursery in a former Bible-printing works in Hackney. This is a business dealing every day with an attitude problem. 'There's a perception in this country, shared by the government, that child care should be cheap,' says Jameson, a maths graduate from Newnham College, Cambridge, and mother of Emma, aged two, with a second child due in January. 'So people either cut corners to keep costs down or the whole business of child-care ends up outside the formal economy - cash wages to nannies who have no National Insurance contributions. Everyone with a child knows the scenario.' Charges at the Lilliput nursery, opened two years by Helen and her partner Madeline Watson, range from Pounds 95 a week for a rising-five to Pounds 148 for a child under two. There are 15 children, with room for 30. Demand is strongest for under-two places, but the age structure of the nursery roll must remain balanced. 'Any mother tends to think that running a nursery will be just an extension of home skills, but to run it as a normal profit-making business is very challenging,' says Helen, 35. 'It's a highly regulated environment and because of that there is relatively little scope for economies of scale. 'More children means more staff. In addition you have to compete with a subsidised voluntary and public sector group of nurseries.' The nursery, in east London, currently needs a manager, four nursery staff and a cook / housekeeper. As Lilliput's first nursery it is trading at an operating profit. It took around Pounds 40,000 in capital to get it up and running; a mixture of private investment from the two women and finance from the National Westminster Bank. Helen was a high-flier at Price Waterhouse but found that, what she describes as, 'its traditional Up or Out company culture' began to make unacceptable time demands on a young woman probably destined for a partnership if she had not also wanted to start a family - and her own business. When Helen told PW what she wanted to to, she thought they would tell her it was all or nothing and to pack her bags. To her surprise, they asked her to work three days a week at the practice - leaving her two days for her business. 'I guess their reasoning was that it would add to my experience,' she reflects. 'I certainly feel that it has added to my skills base and how I approach my work. It's made me far more entrepreneurial.' Initially Helen and Madeline concentrated on offering a consultancy service to companies thinking of offering child-care to employees, and tendering to manage workplace nurseries. This strategy had the advantage of using the client's capital rather than Lilliput's. However, they found themselves coming second in the bid process to competitors who already had at least one nursery up and running. 'It was a credibility thing, I suppose. At least if we did it we would know if our costings were right or wrong,' said Helen. 'It was also a chance to set up a model of what a nursery could be.' The issue of workplace nurseries has undergone some revision in recent years. In the mid-80s it seemed to be on the agenda of every caring, sharing employer. Now many are not sure if children and the office are such a good mixture - for either side. 'Amongst predominately male management there's an unspoken fear of the creche on the third floor,' said Helen. 'Workplace nurseries are expensive and not always appropriate. We like to demonstrate to the employers we consult for that there are many routes you can take in helping staff with childcare. 'In London most parents find their own commute to work bad enough without inflicting it upon their children. But in provincial and rural settings it can work very well.' In many countries, child-care is a large and profitable service industry. The US has some very big nursery operators, often regarded with some trepidation by the inheritors of a rather different tradition in the UK. Nevertheless, Helen believes Lilliput can grow without become a child-processing centre. 'I think we will see small chains of nurseries in this country, and I hope we can grow to that sort of scale. At present it's very much a cottage industry,' Helen said. She points out how much a reputable 'brand-name' in this field could reassure anxious parents. It seems to be a field ripe for setting uniform standards and procedures; then licencing ownership and operations? 'Franchising is not a route I'm happy about,' said Helen. 'Child-care is a terribly personal service.' Lilliput, 1 Kilmarsh Rd, London W6 OPL, Tel 071-267-8641 Fax 081-741-8334.

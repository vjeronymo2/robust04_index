			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PREGNANCY DOESN'T SLOW DOWN NBC NEWSWOMAN  </P> <P> She's 8 1/2 months pregnant. It's snowing. And she's just spent several hours  on a train. Just exactly how is Mary Alice Williams feeling?  </P> <P> "Fine," she answers in a voice octaves higher than her measured network news  tone.  </P> <P> Never mind the words. Her expression tells all. She rolls her icy blue eyes,  wrinkles her nose and grimaces. It's an expression you'd never see on NBC,  where Williams, 40, is a correspondent and substitute anchor.  </P> <P> "These last couple weeks are really rough," said Williams, who was visiting  Baltimore this week to to speak at the Maryland State Employees Conference. "I  had made the commitment before I was pregnant, and you can't just back out. But  we are pushing it."  </P> <P> Her life has been in a state of flux for the past nine months since she  accepted a position with NBC. The decision meant leaving the safe environs of  Cable Network News, where she had worked for a decade and earned the title of  vice president. Just weeks after beginning at NBC, she and her husband Mark  Haefeli learned they are expecting a baby. And last month, "Yesterday, Today  and Tomorrow," the controversial news show she co-anchored with Maria Shriver  and Chuck Scarborough was canceled.  </P> <P> "Nothing is predictable," she says wistfully.  </P> <P> Williams' pregnancy came as a surprise since she had been told by doctors she  couldn't conceive.  </P> <P> Her initial reaction? "Shock and terror and elation," she says.  </P> <P> She plans to work right up until going into labor and is uncertain how much  maternity leave she will take.  </P></p>

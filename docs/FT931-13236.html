			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / People: Added to health quango KPMG partner Sheila Masters (right), whose three year stint as finance director of the National Health Service put the wind up many health service managers, has been appointed to the NHS Policy Board. The government has used the recent departure from the board of Sir James Ackers, following his resignation as chairman of the troubled West Midlands Regional Health Authority, to strengthen the non-executive element of the 16-strong quango. Masters, 43, is one of two accountants appointed to the board which advises Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley on NHS policy. The other new member is Tim Chessells, 51, a former partner of Arthur Young, who is chairman of the London Implementation Group, set up to investigate the options arising out of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report on London's health services. Set up four years ago in a bid to make the NHS more business-like, the policy board's aim is to help set strategy and objectives and monitor the performance of the service through the NHS management executive. In its early days, its non-executive members were mainly industrialists such as Sir Graham Day and Sir Ken Durham. However, they have since departed and been replaced by new faces such as Peter Gummer, chairman of the Shandwick public relations group, and Kate Jenkins, a former personnel director of the Royal Mail. The other non-executives are Sir Roy Griffiths, a former deputy chairman of J Sainsbury, Sir Robert Scholey, the former British Steel chairman, and Professor Cyril Chantler, the clinical dean of Guy's and St Thomas's medical schools, and one of the first doctors to embrace the government's controversial health service reforms.</p>

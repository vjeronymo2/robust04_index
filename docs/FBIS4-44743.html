Carl Zeiss Jena is part of the development.    The factory sale of reflecting telescopes was almost a  matter  of routine in Jena. But it was different for the 13th 1-meter  reflecting telescope--not only because the signing of the  contract in 1991 "coincided with the founding of the Carl Zeiss  Jena GmbH company," as managing director Dr. Elk Littow recalls,  but because it also meant the entrance of the Jena group into a  new generation of technology.    With this telescope Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH is supplying the  optical ground station for SILEX, the semiconductor  intersatellite link experiment of the ESA. It is intended to  create a prototype system for optical data transfer between  satellites. By the end of 1995 the first ground station in  Europe will be constructed in the mountains of the Spanish  island of Teneriffe at a height of 2,500 m. It can produce a  data link from the ground to a geostationary satellite using  optical frequencies.    For ESA program director Anthony Dickinson, SILEX is an  important step for the further development of commercial space  travel. "No civilian space communications system has previously  used laser light as a data link or makes use of the advantages,  such as significantly higher data transfer capacity, good  protection from interference and surveillance, and extension of  the available frequency range for information transmittal."    This is becoming increasingly important. After all, the  radio  frequencies available in space have been heavily taxed. At the  same time, power demands and size of facilities would be  reduced, so that deployment on small satellites becomes a  possibility.    Zeiss's participation in this innovation came just in time  to  save the 13th telescope and the attached housing with a diameter  of 12.5 meters from landing on the scrapheap. The system had  really been developed for astronomical observations and intended  for the USSR. The individual components had already been  completed, but the Russians could not purchase the telescope  because of lack of cash.    A visit from the general director of the German Agency for  Space Affairs (DARA), Jan-Baldem Mennicken, came to the rescue.  The Thuringians were attentive to the fact that the European  Space Agency (ESA) wanted to grant equal opportunity to  companies and institutions in the new Federal Laender in their  projects. The Jena group put this offer to the test by offering  their system for the SILEX experiment. They redesigned the  equipment under contract to DARA and fitted it with the most  modern drives and control systems.    For its assignment had changed. In the SILEX experiment a  new  technological ESA data satellite, the geostationary ARTEMIS  satellite, will be deployed. It receives data by means of  classical microwave staellite transmission. These will be  transmitted from the SILEX laser-optics communications system to  the telescope.    In tests, the ground station with the Zeiss telescope is to  simulate a future user satellite. The first real satellite which  is to use the laser-optics terminal of ARTEMIS will be the  French earth observation satellite SPOT-4. Generally it can only  transmit imaging data to the next ground station for no longer  than 10 minutes from its orbit at an altitude of 700 km.    This means loss of time: data carriers from stations  overseas  must be transported great distances for evaluation. SILEX, on  the other hand, will always make uninterrupted links between  SPOT-4 and its control center in Toulouse possible, as long as  the satellite is within range of ARTEMIS, located 36,000 km  above the equator. The data relay link to ARTEMIS is maintained  when SPOT-4 flies over more than half of the land surfaces on  earth.    The data rate of SILEX is 50 Mbits per second. ARTEMIS  distributes the data received from observation satellites  directly to users in Europe.    For this purpose ARTEMIS and SPOT-4 are equipped with 25-cm  diameter telescopes for sending and receiving. These are  supplied by Jena's former rival and current project partner,  Carl Zeiss Oberkochen. Mirrors and structural telescope parts  are not manufactured from the lightweight material graphite  epoxy, but because of the required accuracy in measurement they  are made of Zerodur from Schott, which has no thermal expansion.    DARA managing director Prof. Heinz Stoewer sees in SILEX--at  present the only advanced civilian project in optic satellite  communications--new dimensions for the communications industry,  "one of the most important branches of the economy for the  future." He says that Germany cannot afford to do without such  high technology or to rest content with vanishingly small market  shares in the long run. The civilian market for satellite  communications will triple in the next 10 years, from $10  billion to $30 billion. "German industrial firms are important  sources of innovation. There is the chance for them to achieve a  leading position in this area."    The Zeiss people in Oberkochen, who have sufficiently proved  their competence in space projects with the development and  manufacture of the optics for the X-ray astronomy Rosat  satellites, are involved. The Jena group, too, has something to  offer: the former collective combine was included in important  Soviet space travel projects. Developments like the  multispectrum camera in the 70's and astronavigation systems for  satellites in the 80's are among their achievements.    Now the DARA contract was "enormously important for the area  of astronomical equipment which is currently being  restructured." Along with the new arrangement in the Zeiss  Group, Jena has also assumed corporate responsibility for this  systems area.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, April 6 (AFP) -- A retired senior army  officer has accused the regime of General Sani Abacha, who  seized power in Nigeria last November, of betraying the people  and sacking officers who sought democracy.    Lieutenant General David Mark, a former aide to previous  military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, told the weekly Lagos  magazine TELL that he and 16 other officers had been retired  "because we supported democracy and we were totally opposed to  another extended period of military intervention." "Abacha's  regime qualifies for a space in the Guiness Book of Records as  the greatest betrayal of the century," Mark said, in the first  public comment by any of the soldiers retired after the defence  minister took power.    Mark, a former state governor and subsequently a  communications minister, described the army-backed government as  a "betrayal of the people, betrayal of hope and aspirations for  all Nigerians and a coup against democracy."    He and a group of other officers had supported a planned  transition to democracy under Babangida, Mark said, denying that  the group had requested that the former head of state should  annul the presidential election held last June 12.    Babangida plunged Nigeria into political chaos when he  annulled the poll, which Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the  now defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) claimed to have won.    Abacha, who was the military strongman in the Babangida  regime, was the "main beneficiary" of that annulment, which  threatened to bring civil war or disintegration of the Nigerian  federation before the military staged a comeback, Mark said.    An interim civilian administration which took over from  Babangida when he stepped down last August 26 lasted for less  than three months before Abacha took power and scrapped all  elected political institutions, with the SDP and the rival  National Republican Convention. The new regime claimed  nevertheless that its tenure would be brief.    Mark said that when it became obvious that the interim  government could not manage the affairs of the nation, a group  of military officers, including Abacha, his deputy, General  Oladipo Diya, and himself "reluctantly decided to intervene."    The three possible options considered were to give the  government military backing to enable it to conduct a new  presidential election, or go for a six-month "full military  regime" during which the poll would be organised, or install a  "diluted military regime" for not more than one year, at the end  of which a vote would take place. Though most members of the  group favoured the first option, the present regime chose to  adopt the last option, but plans to stay in power for five  years, Mark charged.    The army authorities have recently placed restrictions on  the  17 officers, including seven generals, retired after Abacha  seized power. Most of them had participated in the bloodless  palace coup that brought Babangida to office in August 1985.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Safra Republic rises 31.5% to Dollars 121.6m Safra Republic, the Geneva-based international private banking group controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, has reported consolidated net income of Dollars 121.6m for 1993, 31.5 per cent higher than in 1992. The directors are recommending a 22 per cent increase in the dividend to Dollars 2.75 a share. Net interest income grew 10.4 per cent to Dollars 140.2m after loan loss provisions increased 30 per cent to Dollars 81m, reflecting an improvement in both lending volume and spreads. Trading income jumped 31 per cent to Dollars 27.3m and commission income soared 74 per cent to Dollars 58.8m, thanks to the growth in earnings from group investment funds and other off-balance sheet client portfolio assets. Profits on securities were up 9.6 per cent to Dollars 29.7m. Total assets at December 31 1993 stood at Dollars 11.3bn, 9.1 per cent higher than a year earlier. A 6.4 per cent decline in client deposits to Dollars 5.9bn was more than offset by a 140 per cent jump in bank deposits to Dollars 1.4bn. Shareholders' equity stood at Dollars 1.28bn at the year end, 13.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Some Dollars 90m of the increase came as a result of Safra adopting a financial standard (SFAS 115) requiring it to state securities at fair value.</p>

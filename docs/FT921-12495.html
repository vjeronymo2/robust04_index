			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unilever arm plans 10% job cuts in restructure CHESEBROUGH-POND'S, the US consumer products arm of Unilever is 'streamlining' its product line and planning a reduction of up to 10 per cent in its workforce. The rationalisation will result in a fourth quarter charge of about Dollars 35m, (Pounds 19m) against operating profits. On the product side, Unilever said that the emphasis would on reducing the number of product sizes, rather than cutting out particular product lines. It said that this was still under review, and declined to give specific example. On the employment front, Connecticut-based Chesebrough could shed up to ten per cent of its workforce, currently put at about 3,400. The first step in this process would involve a voluntary early retirement programme. Unilever said that the rationale for streamlining was economic - a desire to keep costs as low as possible. Chesebrough products include Pond's cold cream and Vaseline skin care products, to the Brut brand of men's toiletries and Close-up toothpaste.</p>

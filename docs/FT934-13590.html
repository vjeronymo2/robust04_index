			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Waldegrave kept in dark, Iraq arms inquiry told MIDDLE EAST specialists at the Foreign Office failed to pass on vital intelligence reports that would have enabled their minister to resist pressure to allow Matrix Churchill machine-tool exports into Iraq. As a result, Lord Justice Scott said yesterday, Mr William Waldegrave, then Foreign Office minister, had gone to a crucial meeting 'armed with a bow and arrow when he should have had a Kalashnikov'. The arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard that the November 1989 meeting between Mr Waldegrave, Mr Alan Clark, then defence minister, and Lord Trefgarne, trade minister, was held at a time when ministries were at odds with each other over exports to Baghdad. Mr Stephen Lamport, the former assistant head of the Middle East department at the Foreign Office and now deputy private secretary to the Prince of Wales, acknowledged that his department had received intelligence reports from GCHQ, the government communications centre, warning that Iraq's missile programme was being equipped with British machine tools. However, those warnings had not been used to brief Mr Waldegrave for the meeting held to discuss Matrix Churchill's applications to export lathes to Iraq. Instead Mr Waldegrave had gone to the meeting with a briefing paper drawn up by a middle-ranking official who had joined the Middle East department a few weeks earlier and had not initially had clearance to view the GCHQ material. As a result, the briefing by Mr Simon Sherrington, an assistant desk officer, had been based upon new information from the Secret Intelligence Service that contradicted the earlier warnings. The SIS told Mr Sherrington it was 'inclined to believe' statements by Dr Safa al Habobi, then Matrix chairman and now Iraq's oil minister, that the factory he ran in Iraq was used solely for post-war reconstruction. Mr Lamport said the intelligence report had 'pulled the rug' from under the Foreign Office, which had wanted to reject the export application. He said there had been no illusions about Iraq's procurement programme and its efforts to involve British companies. Lord Justice Scott suggested to Mr Lamport that in not giving his minister the earlier warnings, Mr Waldegrave had been left without crucial ammunition. Mr Lamport said that many conversations were taking place at the time 'so ministers were not, in a sense, coming to it cold'.</p>

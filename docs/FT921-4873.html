			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Forward thrust at Rolls-Royce FT-SE Index: 2,538.3 (-20.1) The story that came out of Rolls-Royce yesterday was certainly not that of a defensive company humiliated at the hands of British Airways. Chairman Lord Tombs is a wily old bird, of course, and employed unusual openness in his effort to show that last year's widely publicised order setback was in contrast to progress elsewhere. Even so, it is hard not to be impressed by his forecast that civil engine deliveries next year will be more than double the number achieved in 1987, by the steady growth in Rolls' market share, and by the relentless if inescapable attack on costs. Investors should always bear in mind that engine salesmen are among the world's great optimists, and ought to brace themselves for at least another year when Rolls' industrial power tail will wag the aerospace dog in profit terms. That said, the shares look an interesting bet on the recovery and even with a lower yield look more exciting than the likes of BICC and GKN, which also maintained their dividends this week. Increased payouts look a long way off in those two companies, but given a fair wind there is just a chance that Rolls might get its cover back above two times in 1993. Demand for spares will ultimately receive a boost from the bigger installed engine base, as well as a cyclical kick. The company is wisely not setting any store by 1992, but given the 9 per cent growth in monthly traffic which its old friends at BA reported yesterday compared with February two years ago, Rolls might conceivably be too prudent this time.</p>

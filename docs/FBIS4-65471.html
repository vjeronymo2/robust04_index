			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem </F> Brundtland by Othar Ruehl in Oslo; date not given: "Russia Is a  Great Nation, We Have To Take It Seriously"]    [Text] [Ruehl] If Norway is to become a member of the  European Union [EU] in 1995 -- along with Sweden, Finland,  Austria -- there will be a fundamental change in the political  structure and internal balance of the union envisaged by the  Maastricht union. Will the union be less cohesive?    [Brundtland] I do not think so. That is because at its  meeting in Lisbon, the EU Council decided that the expansion  should proceed on the basis of the existing balance. However,  there will, of course, be new discussions once a country is  admitted. We will enter such discussion without any  preconceptions.    [Ruehl] But does this expansion toward the north and  northeast not mean that there will be a geopolitical change,  especially for Russia?    [Brundtland] Yes, because if one views such a move from a  historical angle, against the background of the Cold War, then  northern Europe was geographically and militarily close to the  focal point of East-West confrontation, if only because of  Russia's access to the Atlantic and the USSR's strategic  complex, the North Sea Fleet, and the submarines that could  launch missiles based at Kola. The "northern balance" in the  Cold War became apparent after Norway and Denmark joined NATO in  1949, while Sweden and Finland remained neutral. That was how  everything was settled. With the collapse of the Soviet empire,  this eastern barrier disappeared and the road to the West was  opened up. All of northern Europe now has the possibility of  embarking on the EU path, so that it can then have a common  border with Russia, one that will include Norway's border with  Russia in the north and the entire Russo-Finnish border. This  is now part of the European reality. However, if one looks back  to the time when the Soviet Union still existed, then one also  realizes that all the countries here in the north had good  relations with Soviet Russia; trade, cross-border traffic, and  relations in general were good. That will also make future  European policy vis-a-vis Russia simpler. The three northern  European countries will make a significant contribution in this  respect.    [Ruehl] So, you share a view that is widespread in Moscow,  namely, that an expansion of the EU could be a way of pressuring  Russia? Some would see it as an advance staged by the Western  bloc of states or, in any event, by a strong military grouping.  For example, the head of the Russian intelligence service,  Primakov, spoke of the dangers of the West's offensive military  capacity in connection with NATO.    [Brundtland] I do not think that such views reflect current  Russian thinking about West Europe. The Russians have the  experience of cooperating with Norway, Finland, and Sweden.  This has enabled them to develop confidence in the northern  European countries, in the fact that those countries desire to  live in peace in the region along with Russia, without  confrontation and to the exclusion of no one. With the "Barents  initiative," Norway made a proposal for the further development  of regional cooperation that was taken up by Russia. The  proposal envisages cooperation in the fields of business,  ecology, technology, and culture -- cooperation extending beyond  borders and involving the northern European countries, Russia,  the United States, and the EU. Russia understands a positive  initiative of this kind. Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that  it would be advantageous from the Russian viewpoint for Norway  to be a member of the EU. Some people were surprised by that,  but I was not.    [Ruehl] Would that also apply to an expansion of the EU in  the north and in the Baltic region?    [Brundtland] As a NATO member, Norway is an associate member  of the Western European Union [WEU]. We also want to become  full members of the WEU as soon as we have joined the EU. That  also depends, of course, on how the Norwegian people vote on the  admission treaty. We want to be able to function fully in both  organizations, because we cannot be only members of the EU or  alternatively, only members of the WEU. Norway will then be an  active partner in the common foreign and security policies  envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty and contribute to their  development. That is our goal.    [Ruehl] Does this mean that Norway will also advocate  enhancing the status of the WEU as a "European pillar" within  NATO? Should one try, in the course of expanding the EU, to make  more of the WEU than has been the case so far? The WEU has in  fact already assumed the tasks of the alliance's European group  of partners and has established direct relations with NATO in  Brussels.    [Brundtland] I am not sure about that question until we are  in the EU. At this point, I cannot judge how different roles  should best be assigned to the EU and WEU in the future. I want  to see how things function within the EU. One must also  consider the fact that the European partners in the EU cooperate  much more closely within the EU than within the WEU or NATO.  The EU foreign ministers meet each other more often, more than  once a month, which means that political consultations at the  governmental level are the most frequent within the EU. These  meetings mean that there is an ongoing dialogue and a process of  reaching agreement. There is no doubt that this central  relationship within the EU will be the basis of common policy  and will have a vital function in determining European security  interests and security policy tasks. At the head of government  and foreign minister level, the European governments formulate  common NATO policy and represent the decisions made by their  countries with NATO in the same way as they do within the EU in  the case of European affairs. This is the background against  which one must consider what is left for the WEU as a "European  pillar." Countries and their governments are always the key  elements.    [Ruehl] To ensure its security, Norway has in the past  primarily relied on the United States and Great Britain to  protect NATO's northern flank and has insisted on an adequate  U.S. presence on the northern flank with the provision of  reinforcements from the United States and the U.S. Atlantic  fleet for crises deployment in the Norwegian Sea. Has something  changed for Norway in this respect following the end of the  Soviet Union or does Oslo still always look across the Atlantic  to the distant west and count on a strategic umbrella and a  military commitment on the part of the United States?    [Brundtland] We are still of the opinion that the  transatlantic bond should not be weakened. In Europe, one would  no longer have security or would not have security at the same  level if this bond were weakened. One can say that as a  Norwegian, but also as a German, a Briton, and even as a  Frenchman, which is something that the French have incidentally  recognized in the meantime. The Norwegian Government has  constantly lobbied the U.S. Administration and the Congress in  Washington to maintain, not reduce the U.S. military presence on  Norway's coastline and northern flank. In view of reductions in  the military budget, particularly the U.S. one, and the  restructuring of the U.S. Armed Forces, we have been emphasizing  the fact that the transatlantic link and U.S. military forces  are still needed. The alliance's strength and Europe's security  is based on the sum total of European and North American defense  efforts.    [Ruehl] Should this support be extended to the Baltic and  eastern Central Europe by expanding NATO eastward?    [Brundtland] I think that we should leave things in the form  that was decided on at the NATO Council meeting in January. The  offer of Partnership for Peace [PFP] to all European countries  that do not belong to NATO, which also means all the countries  to the east of the alliance, makes it possible to hold  discussions with everyone about their specific circumstances,  and on the basis of the actual situation of each country, look  at a given country's security needs, at what obligations it can  assume, and what contributions it can make. In any event, there  will be a bilateral relationship between a given country and  NATO and not simply a security guarantee issued by NATO. NATO  made that a precondition for these new partnerships before the  offer was made in Brussels. It is a good solution.    [Ruehl] Do you consider the PFP to be an experiment or a  fixed program, a model enabling NATO to organize European  security beyond alliance territory?    [Brundtland] I view it as a flexible process that will allow  experience to be acquired. Now that some countries have  accepted the offer, a certain dynamic can be set in motion that  will parallel the expansion of the EU. The process will take  several years and create a network of bilateral ties between  NATO and other states.    [Ruehl] This leads one back to the question of a special  security partnership between NATO and Russia. President Yeltsin  and Foreign Minister Kozyrev have expressed concern that a new  form of confrontation might not necessarily come into being, but  that a new dividing line might appear in Europe, one created by  the West. Kozyrev even warned France against reviving the 1920's  policy of a "cordon sanitaire to isolate Russia."    [Brundtland] Well, that is one aspect of an analysis of the  situation in Europe. NATO started a discussion about these  issues, about the relationship to Russia, and the result was the  January council resolution with an offer that also applies to  Russia so as to prevent the appearance of a new dividing line  between Europe and Russia. Earlier Russian statements conveyed  concern and expressed warnings about pursuing a policy that  would exclude Russia. Nothing of that sort occurred in Brussels  in January. That is why the PFP has also been offered to  Russia. No new barriers should be erected.    [Ruehl] With regard to security, President Yeltsin always  returns to the same point: Russian participation in a special  relationship with NATO and, incidentally, a bilateral  relationship with the United States, one between two nuclear  superpowers with a great military potential. Evidently, he  wants more than the partnership offer, something very special,  something appropriate to Russia's significance and not the  expansion of NATO to cover the territory of the former Warsaw  Pact. He has been talking about the "geopolitical balance" in  1990, which should not be changed in a way that would be to  Russia's disadvantage. He has also proposed a "joint security  guarantee" given to other states by both NATO and Russia instead  of admission to NATO, and he has taken up what Clinton said  about a "strategic partnership with Russia."    [Brundtland] In its declaration, the NATO Council avoided  potentially negative aspects in that sense. This period of  history is not one in which one could have a division of power  in Europe, a "condominium" between two superpowers, or the  creation of "strategic spheres of interest." The days of empire  and hegemony are over, as Yeltsin himself said. However, the  rejection of such ideas does not mean that one should fail to  take account of Russia's history and interests. Indeed, it  means that one must take account of Russia's interests with  respect to economic development, to participate in European  institutions and international agreements such as the GATT  customs and trade treaty, and to have an input into the kind of  "mixed economy" that we have in the West. That is because none  of us lives in a "capitalist society." In our free market  economies, we have a public sector alongside a private sector.  The East European countries, including Russia, could develop in  line with this model of a "mixed economy."    [Ruehl] Let's stay with this model. As part of the EU,  what could northern Europe do in the Baltic region?    [Brundtland] Our goal is to develop and consolidate  democracy. That applies to all the East European countries, but,  of course, also to Russia, with which we live in the same part  of Europe. Our own security needs dictate that we support the  development of democracy and a cooperative attitude on the part  of Russia toward its neighbors, beginning with the Baltic  states, whose development we are also assisting and that also  look toward northern Europe. The northern European countries  have a democratic tradition, one composed of a social democracy  along with a "mixed economy," in which the state is also active.  This could provide a model for the East European countries.  Europe must view the opening up of the East as a historic  challenge. The EU now has the possibility of acquiring a truly  pan-European significance -- to go beyond a single market and  political union -- and to become more than just a customs and  monetary union for an economic region, although that in itself  is already of great significance. That is of even greater  benefit to the countries of East Europe, because only  cooperation can settle problems with Russia pertaining to the  present situation and history and thus create a community of  neighbors between whom, just as in West Europe, there can be no  confrontation. Of course, it is not easy to balance interests,  but we can conclude compromises. We will make an effort to  achieve that.    [Ruehl] Thus, should Russia become a G-7 partner?    [Brundtland] That is difficult to say today, especially if  one is not a member oneself. In a certain sense perhaps; it  depends on the arrangements that are made. In any event, Russia  is a great nation that must be taken seriously and must  participate in discussions about the future of the world  economy. That is in our common interest, because we are all  involved in developing a democratic society. We are already  cooperating with Russia in the north and in the Baltic region,  and Germany and Poland are also involved in that cooperation.    [Ruehl] Irrespective of that, what is your opinion of a  "strategic partnership with Russia," which has also been offered  by NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner?    [Brundtland] We all have an interest in a good relationship  between the United States and Russia, which also involves  bilateral relations between the two superpowers and especially  cooperation with Russia participation on the UN Security  Council. This should also be given a multilateral institutional  configuration, covering Russian relations with the EU and NATO  as well as Russia's position within the CSCE.    [Ruehl] We would like to turn to the subject of Bosnia now.  What conclusions are to be drawn from Western policy on the  collapse of the Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflict there and  from what NATO has done?    [Brundtland] The main problem in the EU as well as in NATO  was that the most important partners did not agree on a common  analysis of the causes of the conflict, criteria for action, and  common interests in good time. That also had an impact on the  Security Council.    [Ruehl] If one views all these things together: What are  the implications for European security and the role of various  organizations, for example, the CSCE, or the WEU and NATO?    [Brundtland] As far as the application of CSCE rules and  principles and the oversight of situations and developments are  concerned, the CSCE has a positive role. However, in the case  of preserving or establishing peace, authority lies with the UN  Security Council, which is alone in having the authority to  decide on the use of force and sanctions and to issue a mandate  for specific political or military operations. The United  Nations is the only organization that has a mandate from all  nations to act in the name of international security. Outside  the bounds of collective security, NATO can only act with a UN  mandate, that is, in the service of NATO.    [Ruehl] Through its actions, has the West not played into  the hands of the parties to the conflict?    [Brundtland] The problem is that when this tragedy began,  the United States and the most influential nations in Europe  were unable to agree on a common assessment of what was at  stake. Differing views were expressed for too long a time, and  the parties to the conflict played these differences off against  each other, going along with one European opinion on one  occasion, then switching to another European view or that of the  United States in order to gain advantages. I hope it has now  been realized that it is necessary to adopt a common stance  based on a joint assessment of the situation and a joint concept  for a policy. The alliance summit resulted in the unanimous  adoption of basic principles on Bosnia. The difficulties  involved in reaching agreement and deciding on joint action did  indeed -- to answer your question -- play into the hands of the  various parties to the conflict. They used that opportunity in  dealings with the EU and UN Security Council. We have been  taught a lesson, a very bitter one, I believe.</p>

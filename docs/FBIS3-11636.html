			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy yesterday announced  that he is willing to sign the Chapultepec (Mexico) declaration  on freedom of the press that was signed by representatives of  the continent's free press. The president visited this  newspaper and affirmed that no means of communication will be  closed nor censure imposed during his government.    Wasmosy visited ABC COLOR at 0745. At that time, company  employees were commemorating the 10th anniversary of the closing  of the newspaper and the 5th anniversary of the day it was  reopened.    The president brought his greetings to our newspaper and  said: "In the consolidation of democracy, I think that freedom  and democracy are closely linked. Therefore, without your  needing to ask me about it, I can assure you that I have broad  shoulders and consider criticism positive, even though I  sometimes think it unfair. The best way to consolidate  democracy is to respect total freedom of the press."    Referring to press freedoms in our country, the president  said: "Time and the readers will have the final word in choosing  which is the most credible source. This is like passing through  a fine sieve, because the truth moves slowly, but it prevails in  the end. I thank you for your constructive criticism. That is  the best way to cooperate with the government."    The president said: "In a democracy, responsibility does not  lie on a single person's shoulders; in a democracy everyone is  responsible. We must agree on the kind of Paraguay we want, and  work for it. We must avoid doing things that are not very clear  and which perhaps seek transitory victories, or revenge, or  somehow distort what we really want for our country."    "Newspapers must help the public form an opinion. We must be  conscious that our rights end where other people's rights begin.  I think there is no better way to solve our problems than  through dialogue and consensus," the president said.    In metaphorical language the president then added: "I will  take advantage of this opportunity to say that democracy is like  the decreasing water level of a lake. At first you do not see  what is below. For instance, we cannot see what is lying on the  bottom of Ypacarai Lake. We might find stones or mud. As soon  as the water level starts dropping the problems that were always  there and accumulated through time start coming to light.  Today, thanks to the fact that people can talk, we can launch  full investigations into all those problems."    In an forceful voice, the president then said: "Therefore,  and without needing to ask me about it, you may rest assured  that the press will not be censured, and no newspaper will be  closed during my administration. You are witnesses that today  no radio or television station is harassed, and I believe no  journalist is being persecuted."    "When someone asked me for help and protection for a  journalist in Pedro Juan Caballero I ordered that protection.  We gave him all the guarantees. So you can rest assured. I  have come here to give you this message so that you may rest  assured. During my government no freedom will be curtailed,"  the president concluded. It was a short but very important  speech.    Asked about his attitude with respect to the Chapultepec  declaration, which was signed by some heads of government such  as Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Guatemalan  President Carlos de Leon Carpio, Wasmosy said that he would sign  it with pleasure, because he considers freedom of the press to  be essential for democracy. Without it you cannot govern,  Wasmosy said.</p>

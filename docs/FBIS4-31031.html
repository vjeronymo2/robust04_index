			<p>BFN     TRADE VOLUME IMPROVES: The National Board of Statistics has  announced a slight improvement of Romania's foreign trade  activities over March 1994, although the volume of trade  exchanges is still low and the balance of trade over the first  term of the year is still registering a deficit as a consequence  of the crude oil imports. The March exports with payment in hard  currency totalled approximately $495.2 million, which is 63  percent more than in February 1994 and 34.2 percent more than in  March 1993. The March imports with payment in hard currency  totalled approximately $439.4 million, that is, 24.2 percent  less than in March 1993. Over the first three months of 1994  exports totalled $1,080 million, of which 51.9 percent went to  developed countries, 29.7 percent to developing countries, and  18.4 percent to transition countries. Romania's major export  partners were Germany, Italy, Turkey, and France.

Concerning  exports, Moucha mentioned good ties with a Ukrainian company to  which Roman-made tractors are being exported, the only tractors  that manage to cross Siberia at extremely low temperatures. "We  intend to set up a joint venture with a French company  authorized by Renault. We already have a contract signed with  that company for the import of motors and product integration.  There is also a significant demand for our coaches equipped  with Renault engines or with other engines, which have proved to  be competitive on European highways," Moucha added. Among the  Romanian truck factory's partners Moucha also mentioned Cuba, to  which 22,000 trucks and diesel engines have been exported over  the past years. "Cuba wants to re-equip 12,000 of its ZIL-type  trucks, replacing their gasoline engines with diesel-oil-fuelled  engines that are delivered by the Roman Ltd company. The  factory also supplies cast iron parts worth $2 million annually  to a German company and several other components to the United  States and France," the manager of the Roman Ltd concluded.

The interview  was attended by Mugur Isarescu, governor of the National Bank of  Romania, and by Traian Chebeleu and Misu Negritoiu, presidential  advisers. After the interview, Robert Favarger told journalists  he came to Romania to get acquainted with the state of the  economy here and that he had meetings with many prominent  figures. He said the meetings preceded the signing of a loan  agreement between the UBS and the National Bank of Romania on 6  May. The contract, he said, was a clear proof of the fact that  international banking institutions have a vested interest in the  development of the Romanian economy. National Bank Governor  Mugur Isarescu said the agreement "means the breaking of the  last financial isolation in the sphere of private capital  investments." (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1335 GMT 5 May 94)    SWISS BANK LOAN: The Union Bank of Switzerland-UBS, one of  the biggest private Swiss banks, granted a $60 million loan to  Romania.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0732 GMT 6  May 94)    BALL BEARING PRODUCTION: After a slump in the first years  that followed the fall of the communist regime, ball bearing  production is registering a comeback. The largest and oldest  Romanian manufacturer, RULMENTUL of Brasov produced 23.6 million  bearings in 1993 -- a 25 percent production increase compared  with the previous year. The factory also managed to increase  its exports by 26 percent. This year the factory plans to  manufacture 27 million ball bearings. Other contracts currently  under negotiation with partners from all continents may boost  production even further and increase the share of exports to 80  percent. The fact that Romania was granted most favored nation  status has brought the U.S. market back among the top importers  of Romanian ball bearings, and it may even place first this year  among the factory's customers, with orders for some 15 million  pieces. Other partners for RULMENTUL's exports are England,  Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore,  Argentine, Brazil, and Venezuela. This will regain the Brasov  factory the position of seventh/eighth producer of ball bearings  in the world and the third to fourth place in Europe. In this  context, it is worth recalling that the factory has recently  obtained an important credit for technological updating from the  Japanese company Koyo, guaranteed by the Japanese Government.

The main subject of  the talks was the intensification of the bilateral cooperation  and the new opportunities for trade exchanges. Ion Pasol,  assistant-director of the Asia-Oceania Department of the  Romanian Ministry of Trade, said that the development of the  traditional Romanian-Chinese relations were mainly focussed on  Timis County, Western Romania, as well as on the sectors of the  light and medicine industries.

The Germans will contribute 1.5  million marks in the next four years to the program that will  materialize in 50 centers all over Romania. (Bucharest ROMPRES  in English 1326 GMT 7 May 94)    TRADE FIGURES: "For the first time after December 1989,  Romania's trade in the first quarter of 1994 has registered a  relatively balanced evolution and the biggest volume of exports,  about $1.1 billion," Mihai Berinde, head of the Foreign Trade  Department of the Ministry of Trade, said in a recent interview.  The best results were scored in March, when exports amounted to  $500 million, that is a 34.2 percent increase over the similar  period of last year. Mihai Berinde considers that "conditions  exist for Romania to increase its exports to the European Union  and EFTA markets by at least 10 percent. The American market,  following the redemption of the most favored nation status, will  absorb some 20 percent more goods as compared to the Romanian  exports there last year." The Romanian official said that "the  Eastern market is also being regained," with the Russian  Federation and Ukraine having returned to the first five places  in Romania's foreign trade list. Free zones of mutual interest  are expected to be created with the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  and Bulgaria. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0732 GMT 10 May 94)    DEVELOPMENT AGENCY REPORT: The annual report issued by the  Romanian Agency for Development (ARD) states that participation  of foreign capital in Romanian companies amounted to  $144,419,780. The report proposes a number of concessions to be  granted to the large foreign investors. ARD President Nicolae  Jantea said the agency had undergone a structural change in  1993. The ARD has registered 8,683 companies with foreign  capital worth over $144 million in 1993. The agency supplied  information and assistance services to prospective investors in  the fields of banking, commercial, insurance,  telecommunications, services, trade, and so forth. The ARD  proposed some amendments to the law on foreign investments. If  they are approved, the foreign companies with a nominal capital  smaller than $1,000 will not receive certificates of investors.  On the other hand, the companies investing more than $10,000  would benefit from a set of facilities such as exemption from  tariffs on raw and auxiliary materials, and lower income taxes.  The facilities would be considerably larger for long-term (14  years) productive investments over $50 million, which integrate  more than 60 percent of their production volume into the  Romanian economy and export over 50 percent of their production.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1058 GMT 10 May 94)    TRADE WITH BRAZIL: The volume of trade between Romania and  Brazil stood at $54.4 million in 1993. Romanian imports, mainly  iron ore and manganese, totalled $51 million dollars, which  shows a trade deficit for Romania. As a consequence, a major  objective for 1994 is to increase Romanian exports of tractors,  farm machinery, and automobiles. Romania has already penetrated  the Brazilian market with products such as passenger and freight  cars, power transformers, and building materials. (Bucharest  ROMPRES in English 0933 GMT 11 May 94)    PRIVATIZATION OF TOURISM: "Without being a supporter of  statistics myself, I feel that privatisation has already started  and has even reached such a pace capable of leading to the end  of the process scheduled for the beginning of 1996, when most of  the touristic companies are to become private," Romanian  Minister of Tourism Matei Dan told the business journal  PERIODICAL. "Economic analysts can assess that Romania has  witnessed a stable economic flow in the past two years,  recording about 6 million foreign tourists arriving in, and 10  million Romanian citizens getting out," the Romanian minister  said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0734 GMT 12 May 94)    COMPANIES WITH FOREIGN CAPITAL: There were 112 companies  with  foreign capital of over $1 million in Romania at the end of  April.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0839 GMT 12 May 94)    CAPITAL INVESTMENT: Sources in the Romanian Ministry of  Industries say the investment effort in industry went up 35  percent in 1994, reaching $1 billion. However, to trigger a  fast revitalization of all industrial sectors would take $3  billion, and the total cost of the process is put at $15  billion. "It is clear for everybody", CRONICA ROMANA notes,  "that the most important thing now is to find solutions for  capital injection in view of updating the industry". "We are  vitally interested in attracting foreign capital", said  Industries Minister Dumitru Popescu. "We have promoted a bill to  this end for the attraction of investors bringing funds of over  $50 million since we have had enough of petty investors".

"By this free  zone, Galati city can become one of the important turntable of  Europe for the flow of goods," said the Galati County deputy-  prefect. He said also that the decision to establish the zone  was grounded mainly on the Galati Port's ideal transit position  in the vicinity of the border with the Republic of Moldova and  with Ukraine, thus with direct links to the CIS market, with  direct links to both the Eastern and Western Europe, plus  possibilities of links through the Danube and the Black Sea with  the Middle East.

The purpose of the Korean delegation's visit to Romania  is to discuss the development of cooperation with its  representative in Romania, ANA Electronic. That relationship is  evidenced by a factory that assembles electronic products in  Romania, and is capable of producing 100,000 color television  sets annually. The assembly line will be ready for commission  by the end of June this year. After the meeting with the  Romanian president, the head of the delegation said that the  main topics related to Samsung's cooperation projects in  Romania, which permit multiple expansion opportunities, mostly  in the production of basic electronic sub-assemblies, and that  other programs were yet to be developed between the Romanian  manufacturer and its South Korean partner. (Bucharest ROMPRES  in English 1352 GMT 13 May 94)    ELECTRONICS: There is a revitalization of Romanian  electronics, writes the daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. That sector's  exports in 1993 amounted to $165 million. The privatization of  the electronics industry has started yielding fruit. Seventy  joint ventures with foreign capital were set up, including 48  production units, with the remainder handling trade activities.  The major investors are France, 11 companies; Italy, eight; and  Germany, six. Activities include: 20 design, marketing, and  consulting services, 10 producers of consumer goods, and eight  telecommunications.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English  1705 GMT 17 May 94)    MINISTER ON IMPORTS, EXPORTS: Minister of Industries Dumitru  Popescu stated in an interview: "Romanian industry has always  had traditional partners in Europe and Central Asia, and it has  developed various forms of international economic cooperation  and foreign trade such as: import of technology and equipment  from developed European countries, particularly in machine  building, chemistry, metallurgy and so on; export of industrial  finished products to European and Central Asian countries  (metallurgical, chemical and petrochemical products, tractors,  machine tools, bearings, building materials, etc.); turn-key  projects by Romanian companies together with leader European  companies for complex objectives in Central Asia (a good example  being Iran); export of services in the industrial field --  consulting, technical assistance -- in Central Asian countries  and construction-installation works in Europe. Exports to those  areas, out of Romania's total exports, account for 39 percent to  countries of the European Union and for 15 percent to Central  Asian countries. Imports from the above-mentioned areas, out of  Romania's total imports, account for 42 percent from European  Union countries and for 5 percent from countries in Central  Asia. Romanian industry is currently undergoing a transition to  a market economy, which requires certain measures for its  restructuring, modernization, and redevelopment, concurrently  with measures for stepping up its privatisation." (Bucharest  ROMPRES in English 0552 GMT 18 May 94)    SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: "Two percent of the gross domestic  product would be enough to finance the national programme for  research and development and to complete its projects," said  Minister of Research and Technology Doru Dumitru Palade. He is  of the opinion that half of the 2 percent could come from the  state budget and the other half through direct contracts with  beneficiaries of the work carried out by scientific research  units. In this context, Doru Dumitru Palade mentioned that "the  most severe issue" confronting Romanian scientific research is  financing. Referring to the priorities in Romanian scientific  research, the Romanian minister indicates as the main fields  ecology, health care, agriculture, silviculture, food industry,  information technology, communications, and transportation.

(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1612 GMT 20 May 94)    TRADE WITH POLAND DECLINES: Poland presently holds a modest  place on the list of Romania's major trade partners after  ranking third until 1989. In 1993 the volume of trade was put  at merely $63 million. In an attempt to discover the causes  leading to this situation, a ROMPRES editor turned to the  commercial counselor of the Polish embassy in Bucharest,  Grzegorz Matusiewicz, and to Mircea Toader, a director in the  Romanian Ministry of Commerce. The Polish diplomat sees the  situation as due to "a reform in economic instruments and the  fundamental changes in the economic policies of Poland and  Romania after 1989." "We consider that as far as Romania's debt  of 47.1 million rubles is concerned, it could be repaid in  Romanian products, for which Polish partners are showing  interest," the Polish diplomat added, adding that "in the  beginning, part of it could be covered by promotional  activities." "The Romanian market is showing the same interest  in Polish investments as other markets do." In turn, Mircea  Toader showed that "the idea that came out of the talks with the  Polish partners was that the future of our bilateral economic  relations depends on the debt's being written off. We wish to  return it in the supply of goods. We consider it necessary to  reach a free trade agreement. If not, the level of customs  duties could become an extremely heavy burden on Romanian-Polish  trade, Toader said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1920 GMT 20  May 94)    WESTERN LOANS VIEWED: In an article entitled "The West Has  Released Credits to Romania" the daily ADEVARUL of 23 May  comments on the significance of the new credits, which top the  $1 billion mark, cautioning, however, that the country's foreign  debt thus reaches about $4.3 billion, and wonders whether the  government will at long last trigger the economic restructuring  with this money. After the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has  granted the first installment, worth $316 of the Stand-By  Agreement, the World Bank released a restructuring loan worth  $175 million. At the same time the Group of 24 assessed at its  Brussels meeting that loans worth over $1 billion should be  given to Romania in 1994, including the credits from the IMF,  the World Bank, and the group of 24 itself. Adding to the money  already issued by the respective financial bodies last week,  there is a new long-term loan worth $250 million from the World  Bank for the restructuring and privatization of industry and  banking, which will be released next October. ADEVARUL says  that this avalanche of credits marks a change in the West's  views on Romania, being matched by an appreciation of the  government's and the national bank's financial-economic policy.  (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0859 GMT 23 May 94)    APRIL FOREIGN TRADE: According to a release of the National  Statistics Board, Romanian hard currency exports amounted to  $475 million in April, that is 3.9 percent less than in March,  but 94.6 percent higher than in April 1993. Imports increased  to $467.1 million, that is 6.3 percent more than in March and  56.6 percent more than in April 1993. Overall imports for the  first four months in 1994 totalled $1,409.2 million. The import  figures for the first four months of this year do not include  the 2,677,800 tonnes of imported crude oil (worth some $241.2  million), since customs clearing documents for these imports  have not yet been completed. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1300  GMT 25 May 94)    LARGE SCALE PRIVATIZATION: Iacob Zelenco, president of the  National Privatization Agency announced that large scale  privatization in the economy will actually start on 1 July.  Selective privatization will be replaced by an increased public  offer of commercial companies put out for sale. The offer will  cover whole sectors of the economy that can go private at a fast  pace: consumer goods, tourism, trade, building materials,  medicines, and cosmetics. Sectors with common characteristics  are taken into consideration for this action: the production is  based on domestic raw materials and is mainly designed for  domestic consumption; there is a fast circulation of capital and  no financial problems as a rule; and the branches are also  attractive to foreign investors. The mass privatization will  probably start on 1 July this year, when the National  Privatization Agency and the World Bank experts are expected to  have completed the necessary preparations. (Bucharest ROMPRES  in English 0915 GMT 27 May 94)    SAVINGS CURB INFLATION: The wise interest rates policy  implemented by the National Bank of Romania in the past few  months has increased the citizens' trust in depositing their  domestic currency earnings with the banks -- the only exception  being the state savings system known as CEC [expansion unknown].  This policy has determined a spectacular ninefold growth of  bank savings from 20 billion lei in November 1993 to 178 billion  in April 1994, which is indicative of the confidence the banks  have earned among the average depositor. The situation has had a  two-fold effect on inflation. First it curbed the tendency to  purchase and hoard goods and convertible currency as protection  against the depreciation of the leu. Second it provides the  national economy with a noninflationary crediting pipeline. This  new development has facilitated the return of the domestic  currency market to normal, leading to the natural death of the  dual exchange rates operating until not so long ago: the first  one on the official bank and exchange offices market, and the  other one the black market. This also signals the start of a  process of price normalization, which always depends on the rate  of exchange.

Such a  spectacular leap would not have been possible without the recent  agreement concluded with the IMF, which has helped the Romanian  economy come out of its predicament. The progressive growth of  Romanian exports and of public confidence in the monetary and  currency policies of the National Bank of Romania have boosted  the deposits of local residents with the merchant banks to  $1,087 million by the end of April 1994. Compared to an  aggregate $13 million personal savings in Romanian banks prior  to 1989, individual deposits in hard currency in Romanian banks  now exceed the figure of $250 million. The overall cash  availabilities at national level stand at $1.5 billion, an  amount that can cover three months' imports. All these positive  developments, particularly in the foreign trade activity, are  also reflected in the country's balance of foreign payments,  where the deficit has been cut from $414 million dollars to $36  million within one year. A contribution to this remarkable  improvement was made by direct investments of foreign capital,  which grew to $102 million dollars in the first quarter 1994  from $25 million in the equivalent period last year.

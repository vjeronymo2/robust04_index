			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: The samba philosophers - As the Festival of Bahia opens in London, Antony Thorncroft finds Brazilian culture is the antithesis of the Road-to-Rio image Mangueira is the Manchester United of the fiercely competitive Rio de Janeiro samba schools. It has won most first prizes in the annual carnival parades. When its colours of green and pink were seen sashaying down the streets of Rio at February's carnival the crowds went from mad to delirious. On four extravagantly decorated floats Mangueira was honouring 'Os Doces Barbaros'. There stood singers Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa and Maria Bethania, the 'sweet barbarians', or more accurately the 'Four Great Bahians'. Bahia is that province of Brazil which points out towards Africa. Its great city Salvador, the country's first capital, was the bittersweet landfall for millions of black slaves. It has remained black Brazil. It is also the place which spawned the four singers who have revolutionised not only Brazilian music, but also Brazilian culture and politics over the past generation. On June 1 the Four Great Bahians, along with 50 dancers and drummers from the Mangueira School, will perform at the Royal Albert Hall, a climacteric ending for the first Festival of Bahia in London which opens tomorrow with an art exhibition at the Barbican. Foreign festivals in the UK are ten a penny. The Bahian onslaught is different because it unleashes on London not just the artists but also the philosophers of a culture almost completely unknown in Europe. What links the four singers with Brazil's most distinguished artist Carybe, its leading writer Jorge Amado and the veteran photographer, Pierre Verger, both of whom will be speaking at the ICA from May 16-18, is that they are wrapped up in candomble, the ancient religion of west Africa which the slaves tenaciously clung to and which survives in its purest form in Bahia. Also appearing at the ICA is Mae Stella, one of the most prominent Ialorixas (priestesses) in Salvador, who preserves the ancient mysteries and acts as sage and magician. The Portuguese took the easy way out with candomble: they just linked the African deities with Christian saints and fuzzed the issue. But in recent years ethnicity has hit Bahia hard. Mae Stella rejects syncretism, the fusion of Christianity and candomble, and the young blacks look to African rituals, African rhythms and African religion as an expression of their massive contribution to a Brazilian society which still largely marginalises them. But it is not only black Bahians who seek an alternative history and society. Military rulers exiled Gil and Caetano to London around 1970. When they returned they remained revolutionaries. They were fierce opponents of the Carmen Miranda, Road to Rio, exotic-cabaret image of Brazilian culture. They took the true Bahian-African contribution to world music - the samba - and shook the nation up with the rock rhythms and electric guitars that they absorbed from watching the Rolling Stones at the London Lyceum. They lit the fuse. The isolated Brazilian culture was opened up. The movement was dubbed Tropicalism, and aimed to make the people of Bahia feel happier with their origins. It soon conquered the whole of Brazil. The next wave of musicians added contemporary African rhythms to samba and rock, with axe (meaning energy) music. Also coming to London is Araketu, which began as a carnival band in Salvador but now pushes the new wave of Tropicalism, using the Yoruba language and African drumming in their songs of racism and everyday life. They are much more than militant morris dancers, and in their black pride there is strong commitment to candomble. But for Araketu, which began in a poor suburb, the black political strain is stronger. Their appearance at Club Bahia in Vauxhall on May 7 is the chance for the devotees of Latin music with an edge, a fast growing clique, to get the real thing. It is the older generation that is more engrossed with candomble. Caetano wears round his neck the symbol of his personal orixa, or god, who is determined by the fall of the shells from the hands of the priestess. You see a similar necklace on Amado, and on Verger, the 92 year old ethnographer turned photographer, who gives the intellectual justification for why these successful artists from the white middle-class should find their spiritual home in the rituals of black Africa. In his simple home in a poor area of Salvador, surrounded by his American disciples, Verger talks of a life-long search for philosophical peace. He rejected Buddhism because the pact between the rich man giving to the poor monk pandered to the egotism of both. He believes that candomble, where there is no hell nor retribution, where the gods are manifestations of natural forces like fire, water and hunting, and death is followed by re-incarnation through your descendants, has the basic answers. He has spent 40 years researching the links between Africa and Brazil and finds that the believers in candomble are more at ease with life. Carybe may be more of a sceptic but he has portrayed the gods in paintings and sculptures, on display at the Barbican, while Amado, who looks to Shango, the god of fire, lightning and justice for protection, has used the legends in his picaresque novels of Salvador life. The African gods are very much of this world so hardly interfere with the pleasures of life. There will be plenty of exuberance in London next month. But the commitment is real. Gal Costa is a popular singer, the Shirley Bassey of Brazil. During her latest, controversial show she advances to the front of the stage and bears her breast. It is not a provocative gesture. It says 'do not run away from the basic political issues, the black question. Confront the truth, your origins'. The Bahia Festival is fun - with an edge. Festival of Bahia. May 1-June 1, sponsored by West Merchant Bank, Petrobras, Tenenge Holdings, Varihert g, Government of Bahia.</p>

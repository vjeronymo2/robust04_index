			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by Mirko </F> Galic, newly appointed director of Croatian television, at the  Presidential palace in Zagreb on 28 May; prerecorded questions  posed by various political personalities -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Galic] The topic of our conversation with  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is what is happening in  Croatia and what will happen in the future. Good afternoon, Mr.  President.    [Tudjman] Good afternoon, Mr. Galic. Let me first  congratulate you on the appointment to the very responsible  position of director of Croatian TV.    [Galic] Thank you and welcome to the Croatian TV program, in  which our viewers and political party representatives will ask  you questions. The first question is prompted by the events  themselves. This year, Statehood Day coincided with a crisis in  the Croatian parliament, which has not been solved and which  will, in a way, be dormant during the celebrations. Could you  tell us -- so far you have not voiced your opinion either as the  party leader or the head of state -- whether the assembly will  start a session with all deputies, and whether the crisis and  the blocking of the parliament will be overcome immediately  after the Statehood Day holiday?    [Tudjman] You see, I think that the crisis has already been  overcome because those who wanted to cause a parliamentary and  constitutional crisis did not succeed. They did not manage to  cause a rift in the majority party. Seeing that this failed,  there was no crisis on the scale the scenario-makers wanted.    You said that I had not voiced my opinion. That is not  entirely true because before the sessions of both chambers of  the assembly I invited party leaders -- both of the HDZ  [Croatian Independent Democrats] and the opposition parties --  and asked them -- in state interests -- to solve the crisis  created by the defection of the presidents of the two chambers  and the creation of the new party. I pointed out to them that  the stability of the democratic system was in the interest of  the Croatian state. It was precisely with the stability of its  democratic system that Croatia has gained confidence of the  important international players, but the world also needs a  stable Croatia. [sentence as heard] Considering the  circumstances in which we live and the tasks that the Croatian  state is facing, in dealing with all issues we should bare in  mind this demand by both the Croatian people and the world.    I told our most influential politicians that it would be in  the interest that the crisis which arose -- not the one they  wanted to create -- be overcome. I think that a positive  solution has been reached. Not only because the majority party  has retained its majority in both chambers, so the parliamentary  system can continue to function, but also because the division  inside the opposition party failed. There are rifts in all  parties, but the opposition parties have now adopted a more  reasonable approach, not only to the problems of solving the  parliamentary crisis, but also to the whole of the state policy.  Consequently, I believe that after Statehood Day that crisis  will be solved formally as well.    [Galic] You tried -- this is why you summoned all party  leaders -- to reach a certain accord on some important issues of  Croatia's political system and political activities. Is that  one of the guidelines of your political activity, especially now  when Croatia must have, one the one hand, stability, and on the  other social and political unity in the country?    [Tudjman] These have been my commitments and my policy, not  only now but since we started creating democratic Croatia. We  need the highest possible accord, since we are still facing the  occupation of certain areas of Croatia. But we also need a  stable government and stability in the parliament.    We should not forget that the fact that we have had a  majority government and an accord on all important issues was a  precondition for our victories. We should therefore not give up  on that and not forget that it was precisely due to our firm and  stable democratic system that we could have achieved all the  successes in relation to the aggression, the economy and the  international acceptance of Croatia as an important factor not  only in solving the crisis on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia, but also as one of the most important factors in  creating a new international order in this part of southeastern  Europe.    [Galic] There have been a lot of suggestions about what  could  happen if the parliamentary crisis is not solved, if the ruling  party becomes a minority -- which has not happened -- if the  opposition continues with its demands -- which also seems not to  have happened. Still, generally speaking, theoretically, as the  party leader and head of state you have two ways of exerting  influence on the crisis. One, you can influence your party.  Two, you have the constitutional power to suspend the  parliament and call elections in the event of a huge crisis.  Have you ever considered doing that because that has been  speculated on in the public? Under what conditions would you  possibly agree to that or do it yourself?    [Tudjman] You see, there is an old saying in Zagreb: What  would be if it would be. I would not like to speculate on this.    In any event, I would make a decision in the interest of  Croatian democracy, the free democratic Croatia, the Croatian  state. If the rift had succeeded, naturally, we would have  tried to solve the stability of the future government within the  parliament. Failing that, it is certain that I would use my  constitutional power and address the nation to explain to them  the problems and causes of the parliamentary crisis, what tasks  Croatia faces and what we must do.    I had faith in the Croatian people since the first  parliamentary elections in 1990. We held elections in 1992 and  in 1993 when we did not have to, but we wanted to strengthen the  democratic system and prove to the world that we are a country  that wants to get out of the old socialist, communist system as  soon as possible. I had faith in our people then, and I would  have it now. I also believe that if that situation had arisen  -- if we had to go, if I had had to take other steps -- we would  have come out of it democratically strengthened, not weakened.    Let us have a look at the world. In parliaments where there  is not one majority party, but different parties and different  ideological approaches, where there are coalition governments --  in many countries, from the Baltics to the Black Sea and the  Adriatic the communists are coming back to power or there are  coalition governments -- they are helpless in solving not only  political, but also economic problems. Precisely because we  have had a stable government and a majority in the parliament,  we have managed to achieve all the successes we have achieved.    I have said this once before. For me as the president of the  republic, it would be simpler if I did not interfere in  inter-party relations. However, I state with all responsibility  that if we did not have the majority party, we would not have  been able to pursue this policy and achieve political and  economic successes, both internally and on the international  scene. This is why I invited the party leaders and asked them  to solve this crisis so that we could address our main problems  as soon as possible.    [Galic] We will now hear the first opinions. We have  recorded many questions by citizens and political party leaders.  We will now hear the first opinions and questions by party  leaders in connection with the current crisis in the parliament.    [Mira Ljubic-Lorger, of Dalmatian Action] It is sad and  almost tragic that after two years as a deputy in the Croatian  Assembly, this is the first time that I can ask the president of  the state a question. However, here is my question: Mr.  President, do you not think that it is high time you stopped  thinking what else we could take away from Croatia, but that we  -- headed by yourself -- started thinking what we could give or  give back to Croatia? In my opinion, we should give it  primarily freedom, democracy, and tolerance.    [Tudjman] Mrs Lorger, I will answer your question by  repeating part of it. It is sad that you ask such a question.  If we have given anything to Croatia in the past four years,  then we have given it freedom and democracy, despite the war of  aggression against Croatia and despite the fact that they wanted  to prevent the creation of the independent Croatian state.    We have not achieved everything that we wanted because this  is a continuing process, but in the opinion of objective outside  observers -- some not even favorably inclined to Croatia -- in  many areas we have achieved more than many other former  socialist and communist countries have done.    [Galic] The second question is by your former party  colleague  Slavko Degoricija.    [Slavko Degoricija, of Croatian Independent Democrats] Mr.  President, can you use your influence to reduce the stubborness  of some Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] negotiators in dealing  with the current parliamentary crisis? Can you also use your  influence to calm the media war and stop the spreading of false  information and petty swindles until we overcome the crisis?    [Tudjman] It has been shown before that I really can  influence the decisions and behavior of representatives and  deputies of the majority party, and not only theirs. Still, we  should admit that it was the majority party that -- in the  interest of Croatia -- displayed flexibility and goodwill during  the negotiations to overcome the staged parliamentary crisis as  soon as possible. It did this in order to remove all objective  reasons which might lead to the worsening of Croatia's position,  the aggravation of internal problems and problems on the  international scene, to the obstructing of the liberation of the  occupied areas of Croatia, and to the clipping of Croatia's  potential to exert an effective influence on solving the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the world expects us to do.    Concerning the media war, neither I nor the majority party  have a considerable influence on the work of any paper, daily or  weekly. Many objective foreign observers -- not only from the  media, but also from diplomacy -- say not only that there is  enough democracy in Croatia in that respect, but that there is  in fact too much anarchy, which is incompatible with better  cultural relations in the civilized world.    [Galic] Here is the third question in this section:    [Ivan Jakovcic, of the Istrian Democratic Party -- IDS] Mr.  President, do you intend to have any influence on the attitude  of the state leadership to Istria, taking into account the  stands of Istrian citizens who -- as we all know -- voted in a  referendum in favor of the program of the Istrian Democratic  Assembly?    [Tudjman] It goes without saying that I as the head of state  will do everything in my power to see that the will of Croatian  citizens is respected, but at the same time I will do everything  in my power to ensure -- especially in the case of Istria -- the  implementation of the Croatian state policy. As we have  witnessed in the past, Istria was occupied by fascists, the  Croatian people in Istria suffered enormous losses in the war  against fascism and in fighting to join the Croatian motherland.  Since you mentioned the last elections, we must not ignore the  fact that the program of the IDS certainly had its positive  points which ensured that the IDS obtained a majority, but at  the same time that it supported the interests of those factions  or tendencies which could threaten the survival of Istria within  Croatia. With its ideas about a transregional Istria, about the  demilitarization of Istria -- against the background of  ever-present irredentist and neofascist factions which have  recently emerged in Istria, Rijeka and Dalmatia -- the Croatian  policy must take measures to protect Croatian interests as a  whole, i.e. to protect its territorial integrity. The Croatian  policy will of course protect every county and especially  Istria, because of its historic background and the  confrontations we are witnessing today.    [Galic] The second topical issue -- which gives rise to a  question -- and about which there is no need to consult either  political party leaders or the citizens, is the introduction of  the kuna as the Croatian national currency. All opinion polls  showed that there was hardly a single voice against it, everyone  was satisfied or even proud that Croatia was getting its own  currency. There were only questions about its name -- whether it  should have been kuna or kruna or perhaps even krona. They say,  Mr. President, that you had a decisive influence on the name of  our currency. What do you think about these objections? Are  they well founded or not?    [Tudjman] Perhaps my influence was decisive. I am not  denying it and I am also not shirking the responsibility for  this. Initially we decided to have a kruna [crown] instead of  the politically and economically compromised dinar. But after a  discussion we decided that -- since other countries in Europe,  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Finland, Iceland use a  crown as their currency -- we agreed to call the Croatian  currency in the independent democratic Croatian state by the  name which existed in history. Kuna [marten] has been a means  of payment in Croatia since long ago -- its existence has been  recorded since the 11th century, 1018. The marten features on  the coat of arms as the main symbol of the Croatian kingdom of  Slavonia which was once synonymous with the entire Croatia. Why  shouldn't we therefore accept this distinctive name which is a  special feature of Croatia and which shows that Croatia had its  own currency from Istria to Cres, the currency also used in some  other countries, in Russia and somewhere in the west. So why  not kuna, when it had already existed as a means of payment.  There were attempts to introduce kuna after the creation of the  Croatian province [banovina] in 1939, but it was opposed by both  Yugo-unitarists and Yugo-integralists in both Zagreb and  Belgrade. The fact that the kuna was introduced in the NDH  [Independent State of Croatia -- Nazi puppet state] and suffered  the fate of the NDH and the Axis is not the reason for not using  it now, because Germany had the mark, France the franc and Italy  the lira and none of these countries have changed their national  currencies.    [Galic] Are you not afraid that in the west, in the  countries which have not always been favorably inclined to  Croatia, that there can be interpretations which could harm  Croatia?    [Tudjman] As you can see, in serious circles in the west  there are no objections. There is some opposition on the part  of some individuals who have never accepted the reality of the  free, sovereign Croatia. It is very interesting that in Croatia  itself there is no opposition. Only two or three people dared  express this publicly, as opposed to, I believe, 98 percent of  the Croatian people.    [Galic] Do you think that the introduction of the kuna could  hamper agreements and the negotiations with the Serbs, the Serbs  who do not accept the Croatian state? Will that be an  additional reason for them to say: The Croatian kuna will not  find its way into Serbian pockets?    [Tudjman] Serbs in Croatia must understand one thing: They  are a minority here, and they must recognize Croatia as their  homeland. They can take an equal part in it -- Croatia will  guarantee them this -- but they cannot, as they did in the past,  impose solutions on state policy and, least of all, on the name  of the Croatian national currency.    [Galic] Mr. President, you personally advocated  rapprochement, negotiations, and the normalization of  Croatian-Serbian relations, both in Croatia and between the  Republic of Croatia and Serbia or Yugoslavia.    [Tudjman] Yes, I have been advocating that for a long time.  I have written about this subject as well, and even today I  believe that the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations is  necessary in order to solve the problem of the occupied areas of  Croatia and to create preconditions for the normal life of the  Serb ethnic community in Croatia. The normalization of  relations between Croatia and Serbia on the basis of mutual  recognition is also necessary. That is in the interests of both  Croatia and Serbia, and that is an important prerequisite for  creating a new international order in southeast Europe. Without  that there can be no lasting peace, and if this untenable  situation remains -- and it cannot remain forever -- it would be  detrimental for both Croatia and Serbia.    In my books -- in "The National Issue in Europe" and in "The  Wastelands of Historic Reality" -- I have given examples. The  Scandinavian countries fought each other for centuries until the  beginning of this century, until 1905 when they finally  recognized each other, and the Scandinavian peninsula is today  the model of friendly relations of the Scandinavian countries  and of the respect for differences between ethnic and national  minorities in certain countries. It is also the model of  democracy -- we could perhaps agree -- in the most perfect  sense. About 20 years ago I expressed the hope that once we  would see -- I used this particular word -- the Scandinavization  of the Balkans. No future can be built on mutual hatred between  Serbs and Croats and on the wish to exterminate one another.  Besides, there is the philosophy that nations and people start  acting wisely when they use up all possible [sentence unfinished  as heard].    In that context I also gave the example of Germany and  France. There are no two other nations in Europe which fought so  many wars as Germany and France in the last century and this  one. The relations between Germany and France are nowadays such  that these two European powers are the backbone for the creation  of the European Union [EU]; the EU in which no European nation  will be created, but a Europe which will be a homeland to all  peoples and all states.    Consequently, I believe that reason will win and that  Croatian-Serbian relations will be normalized. It would be good  if this happened without another war.    [Galic] In order to introduce Scandinavia-like relations in  the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and for relations  between Croatia and Serbia one day to resemble the relations  between Germany and France, both sides should aspire toward  that. It does not seem that the Serb side, the negotiators from  Knin, truly wish to bring the process of normalization to an  end. Some people want to know -- and I will ask you, Mr.  President -- whether Croatia is perhaps giving in too much, and  not obtaining in return what it is giving, or what it is  prepared to give.    [Tudjman] First of all, let me say whether Croatia is giving  in too much. The problem could be reduced to the question of  why we accepted the UN-protected areas at all.    We accepted the peace forces at the end of 1991 when we  wanted to get out of the war in which one-third of the Croatian  territory was occupied, and in which that territory was  destroyed like Vukovar and Gospic, Dubrovnik, and Konavle. At  that time we did not have our army, forces, or friends in the  world who would help us continue the war and prevent the rest of  Croatia from being completely destroyed -- Osijek, Sisak,  Zagreb, Zadar, Sibenik, Split, Rijeka, Varazdin and so on.  Therefore, at that moment and under those circumstances,  because of the objective balance of power in the territory of  the former Yugoslavia and in the world, we agreed that the peace  forces should be deployed in those occupied areas.    However, the basis was that these areas are Croatian areas,  and that only the status of the Serb population in Croatia needs  to be solved. Therefore, that was the reason for doing it, and  some people have forgotten why it happened. It is not that the  Croatian policy was lenient, but the objective circumstances  forced us to do that.    After that, things developed the way they did. In talks with  Serbian leaders, including [Serbian President] Milosevic and  [former FRY President] Cosic, we aimed at creating preconditions  for what we have already discussed -- the historic necessity to  overcome all differences between Serbs and Croats.    Our explanation was that it should be clear that both Croats  and Serbs in the South-Slav union, in the former monarchist and  then socialist Yugoslavia had their own intentions -- and not  all of those intentions were idealistic. It was with the help  of the Yugoslav idea that the Croats wanted to rule Serbia,  counting on being more civilized and more progressive. They  failed to do that, but the Serbs used the Yugoslav idea to  impose their hegemony. On the other hand, the Serbs did not  manage to destroy the Croatian nation or establish a permanent  rule over Croatia either through the idea of a Greater Serbia or  a Yugoslav idea -- which they turned into a means of their rule.  Therefore, conclusions should be drawn and the problem of  normalizing relations tackled.    In my talks with the Serb leaders, both Cosic and Milosevic  agreed that it was necessary and in the interests of both  nations to normalize relations. It was along these lines that  we opened representative offices in Zagreb and Belgrade.  However, the Serbian representatives -- who Belgrade said would  pursue the policy of normalizing relations -- have recently gone  to extremes and spoken of Krajina as a separate state, which is  a stupidity. Croatia will never agree to that, and the world  will never accept that because the world has nowhere given  minorities the right to self-determination.    The initial Serb theory was that if the Croatian nation had  the right to self-determination and if they could proclaim their  independent, sovereign state, then the Serbs had the same right.  Yes, but there is a small difference. The Serbs are in the  Croatian state, on Croatian territory which has never been part  of Serbia. They are a minority here and, under international  provisions on which the international order is based, minorities  do not have the right to self-determination, while nations have  that right.    Currently the relations are quite tense, but they are linked  to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any event, now  we will see. If the Serb representatives from Knin to Baranja  fail to accept the gradual normalization, if they continue to  oppose Security Council resolutions guaranteeing Croatia's  territorial integrity, Croatia will not be willing to extend the  UN mandate and it will have to use all means to reintegrate the  occupied areas of Croatia into its constitutional and legal  system.    [Galic] Judging by some recent moves by the Croatian  authorities, it seems that, as you have said, Croatia wants to  bring to a head the issue of extending the mandate to the UN  peace forces because it is obvious that further extension will  create the situation commonly referred to in the world as the  Cyprus-style situation, that is, a division which could be  permanent. Croatia will not accept that. Do you feel there is  a danger that the world would want to, or might recognize that  Cyprus-style formula in Croatia? How will Croatia react to that?    [Tudjman] It would be possible to find in the world, and  even  in official circles in some countries, people who would be in  favor of applying the Cyprus-style model to Croatia because they  do not accept an independent Croatia and because of the pressure  exerted on Croatia. However, what is important is that nowadays  Croatia has Security Council resolutions and that we have clear  statements by the most influential international players -- from  the main world superpower United States to the EU, and even to  Russia -- on recognition of Croatia's borders, and that the  Serbian problem needs to be solved within Croatian borders.    Therefore, if in the current circumstances, refusing to  allow  the application of the Cyprus-style solution to Croatia, as you  said, we must take, then, we can count on, and I hope that the  world will understand that such a situation can no longer be  tolerated, and that we will have on our side not only the  world's democratic public opinion, but also the important  international players [sentence as heard].    [Galic] As you will see from the questions Croatian citizens  are asking you, the Croatian public wants to know about that  problem. [Unidentified Croatian Army soldier] Mr. President,  as a Croatian soldier, I would like to know when we will have  internationally recognized borders for our Croatia.    [Tudjman] I would be happy if I could give a date. But, as I  said before in response to earlier questions, we are determined  to start the process of implementing Security Council  resolutions. Specifically, the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  should start implementing Resolution 769 on the control of the  borders, and Resolution 871 on the gradual reintegration of the  occupied areas of Croatia should start being implemented. If  this does not happen, it is certain that, relying not only on  250,000 refugees from those areas, but also on the whole of the  Croatian nation -- and nowadays we also have the army which is  ready to fulfill its tasks -- we will have to start the process  of liberating the occupied areas.    [Galic] Another Croatian soldier wanted to know the same  thing.    [Second unidentified Croatian soldier] Four years ago the  Croatian banner unfurled in Zagreb. Can you promise us that it  will unfurl in Knin before Christmas?    [Tudjman] I hope so. Besides, I have promised that to some  Croatian people who were born in Knin and who remember that  after the Second World War Croats accounted for half the  population of Knin; now there is not a single one. I also  promised Croatian basketball players that I would invite them  for dinner in Knin. I hope I have fulfilled all my promises so  far. The question is when it will happen. That does not depend  entirely on me, but I am convinced that I will fulfill that  promise of mine as well, and that the Croatian banner will fly  on the fortress of Knin, on Zvonimir's royal city.    [Galic] One more question please.    [Josip Ivankovic, poet] How many more poems about Vukovar  will I still have to write? I have said that I will write the  lyrics for every record of the Zlatni Dukati band until Vukovar  is free.    [Tudjman] Yes, Vukovar is a symbol of Croatian resistance,  of  the Croatian struggle to establish the independent Croatian  state. Vukovar is a symbol of the untamed aspiration of the  Croatian people to be their own masters, the masters of every  inch of the Croatian land. It is absolutely certain that there  can be no dilemmas about our return to Vukovar. We are to sing  and fight until that day.    [Galic] Croatian politicians, representatives of political  parties, are also interested in the Croatian-Serbian relations  -- as we will see in the next two questions.    [Milan Djukic, of Serbian People's Party] President Tudjman  often sends messages to the Serbian people in Croatia offering  hospitality. Isn't this a proof that Serbs are foreigners in  their own homeland and isn't this a support for those forces in  Croatia who wish to divide Serbs into loyal and disloyal? My  question is -- does President Tudjman, as the president of all  his citizens, really think that in this way he can reintegrate  the UN-protected areas into Croatia by peaceful political means  and at the same time secure lasting peace and good  Croatian-Serbian relations in this region?    [Tudjman] You see, Mr. Djukic, you and I have already talked  about it, and I have said it publicly, both on official  occasions and unofficially: The problem of Serbs in Croatia is  very complex because in former Yugoslavia, both the kingdom and  the socialist Yugoslavia, Serbs had a fully privileged status in  everything, a ruling status; and not just in former Yugoslavia,  since Hungary also used Serbs to support their rule and impose  hegemony over Croatia. There is a saying which is historically  and politically true: Knin ruled Croatia, its finances and its  police, and also other things. With the establishment of the  independent democratic Croatia, all this had to change. Right  from the beginning, though, we held -- on the basis of our  democratic orientation and on the basis of our knowledge -- that  a lasting peace cannot be created amid the dissatisfaction of  the majority of people. We offered Serbs all civic and  national-ethnic rights. I personally sent for Professor  Raskovic [former leader of Serb Krajina] to have talks with him  and tell him -- let's agree on what you Serbs in Croatia really  want -- because Raskovic was at the time a representative of the  civic Serbian party as most Serbs in Croatia did not recognize  those Serbian representatives who belonged to the League of  Communists or who were members of the Croatian parliament. I  said -- if you as the true representatives of the Knin Serbs do  not recognize them, then you should put forward your proposals.  Let's organize our relations in a democratic and correct way.  You know what happened instead. The Serbs accepted the arms  forced upon them by the Yugo-communist army. They have been  provided with arms in those areas which Belgrade wanted to  include in greater Serbia and in which Belgrade wanted to  involve the Serbs in a struggle against the democratic  authorities. This is the problem here, and not the lack of  willingness on the part of the Croatian Democratic Union to  grant the Serbs in Croatia all the rights they are entitled to.    And something else: The Serbs have become the tools with  which to bring down the democratic authorities in Croatia, and  to threaten the recently won freedom. And for conquering  Croatian areas to -- as they had indicated in their maps -- the  Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line. The Croatian democratic  authorities treated the Serbs in Croatia in an extremely  tolerant and democratic way. The Serbs remained at the Croatian  university, their representatives remained in the government and  the parliament. Admittedly, the relations changed within the  police. Instead of 70 percent, the Serbs now make up some 7  percent of the police force, according to the latest figures, in  particular in the most sensitive departments. This was changed  [laughs]. But the Serbs in Croatia were given conditions for  normal life.    And let us remind ourselves, when wars break out between  countries and nations we see -- for example when the war was  declared between the United Nations and Japan all ethnic  Japanese were detained in special reception centers, or should I  call them camps, their property was taken away from them. And  they could clearly not threaten the American authorities and the  American state to any significant extent, as it was the case in  the armed rebellion of the Serbs in Croatia. We are still  discovering explosive and weapons dumps, left here in Croatia by  both military and civilian secret services which masterminded  the action to bring down the Croatian authorities, in which the  Serbs in Croatia were involved.    Therefore, the Croatian side should not be seen as guilty  for eveything. The Croatian side is the least guilty of all and  the Serbs must understand that. The Serbs must aspire toward  the attitude expressed by [scientist Nikola] Tesla: He is a  Serb, but Croatia is his homeland; he respects it and he will  have all the rights guaranteed. The Serbs will have more  representatives from Knin and elsewhere, as nowadays they  already have representatives in the parliament, the Croatian  Government, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and so  on. This is something for which conditons should be created on  both sides.    The lies to the Serbian population should stop. Two big  deceptions: One that this independent, democratic Croatia is the  continuation of the NDH, and the other that at least 600,000 to  700,000 were executed in Jasenovac in the NDH. As you know,  greater Serbian imperialists and hegemonists who cannot accept  any form of Croatian identity have set that figure as high as  1.5 million.    Let me tell you, Mr. Djukic and the Serbian public, during  the Second World War altogether 597,000 people died on all the  fronts in the whole of Yugoslavia. This includes ustashas, home  guards, chetniks, Germans, Muslims, Slovenes, and Macedonians --  597,000, and this is already a huge figure. Why should they now  build their policy toward the independent democratic Croatia on  this and deceive ignorant Serbs from Knin to Baranja by saying  that they cannot live with Croatia because the Croats killed at  least 600,000 to 700,000 people in Jasenovac alone. This is  something that should be settled once and forever.    There should be new foundations for life which the  democratic  world wants today and which, as I have just said, have been  achieved on the Scandinavian peninsula where a Swede in Finland  or Norway enjoys the same rights as all other citizens. We are  ready for that. Besides, you have proofs for that as well as  those from Zagreb University who are spreading such lies and are  partly contributing to solving the problem of Serbs in Croatia  in a political and democratic way [sentence as heard].    [Galic] There is another question on the same issue.    [Ivica Vrkic, of Croatian People's Party] Mr. President,  what  do you think about the proposal I put forward to Prime Minister  Velentic that a new round of talks with the Serbs be held in  Mostar? We would thus make a concession to the Serbs -- to hold  talks on the territory of a third country -- and at the same  time, Croatian state interests would not be harmed because the  talks would be held in a town which is a symbol of the struggle  for the survival of Croats outside Croatia, and which is also  under the international protection of the EU.    [Tudjman] Your idea is quite interesting. However, the talks  with Serbs in Croatia will not be held anywhere outside Croatian  state territory.    [Galic] One of the most difficult and most complex problems  of the Croatian state today is the large number of its refugees  who still cannot go back to their homes which are destroyed,  occupied, or confiscated. People we have talked to and polls we  have conducted show that impatience is rising and that the  Croatian authorities will probably have to deal with that  impatience more often in the near future.    [Tudjman] I fully understand the dissatisfaction of the  Croatian people driven out from the occupied areas. After all,  speaking about them, we must bear in mind that they are not only  refugees, but also witnesses of the sacrifices they and their  families suffered in those areas. They were witnesses, they  watched members of their families killed, evicted from their  centuries-old family homes, humiliated. Those people are full  of wrath and hatred, and we have had to invest huge efforts to  placate them and convince them that we will ensure their return,  even to destroyed homes; that we will help them restore their  family life, rebuild their villages, and not only Croatian ones  because Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Ruthenians have also  been driven out. Their dissatifaction is justified. Their  demands and our promise to ensure their return have been delayed  too long.    Therefore we are currently at the stage when we will take  steps to ensure their return with the help of the international  community, and -- as I said -- if we fail to obtain effective  assistance from the international community in doing that, it is  certain that the 250,000 refugees and the whole of the Croatian  people will stand up with the Croatian army to liberate those  areas and enable those people to return to their villages and  destroyed towns -- Vukovar and Dubrovnik -- and live normal  lives.    [Galic] The following questions raised by our refugee  citizens illustrate this best:    [Unidentified refugee] I want to know, since we cannot  return  -- whether we can ever return is a major question, well, if we  cannot return I want to know what kind of plans the president  has for us refugees. There is a large number of us. Does he  plan to resettle us, for example, in some Serb villages, so to  speak, I mean the houses abandoned by the Serbs who lived there?  Does he plan to put us up there? Does he plan to secure some  accomodation for us anywhere? Homes and jobs, that is what we  need.    [Tudjman] We have to create conditions for your return.  Until then, we have so far been doing our best to give you the  best possible accomodation in line with our conditions. We  opened all our hotels. It is a perfectly certain fact that it  is not normal, namely, that our refugees have difficult housing  problems while somewhere there are abandoned houses.    It is important nevertheless that we direct all our efforts  and political activity and that we carry out concrete  preparations so you can return to your homes. Until then you  might find a job through local authorities and your own  initiative and you can feel the same way in your Croatia as you  do in your homeland. Consequently, you have a right not only to  life but to education and development. Precisely because you  were driven out of Croatian territories.    Rest assured that we will succeed in this. This is the  entire Croatian people's task, not only in the homeland but in  the diaspora, too.    [Galic] Let us hear another question.    [Second unidentified refugee] My first question, the most  important question for all of us from Vukovar is about the  missing. What about them? When are we going eventually to hear  true reports? All we hear is rumors.    [Tudjman] Dear madam, you see, in addition to the 7,000  people who have been registered as dead, Croatian soldiers and  civilians fighting the Yugoslav communist aggression and then  the Serbian aggression. First, we had a list of 14,000 missing  people. This number of missing people has been gradually  reduced through our efforts and negotiations with the Serbs on  the release of Croatian prisoners. We have now ended up with a  list of 7,000 missing people. Unfortunately, today we have to  conclude that it is likely that most of these victims of the  aggression and bestiality of the chetnik hordes who attacked  Croatia, there is a slim chance that a large proportion of these  7,000 missing are still alive.    However, in keeping with international norms and the Red  Cross principles, it is not possible yet to establish what has  happened to individuals. In any case, this testifies to the  fact that the Croatian people have suffered a great deal, not  only the fighters, soldiers who defended, who in fact had  emerged from civilians as fighters for Croatia's defense. The  Croatian people as a whole have made great sacrifices in its  struggle against the Yugo-communist and Serbian aggression.  This is yet another reason why we must as soon as possible  solve this problem of missing people in particular, we must as  soon as possible finalize negotiations and solve the problem of  occupied territories. Only at that point it will be possible to  reveal the whole truth.    [Galic] Another question please.    [Third unidentified refugee] Mr. President, we young people  from Vukovar want to return as soon as possible to Vukovar. We  do not want to wait any longer for anything. We want to have  our own homes. If you have some solution, please tell us. We  cannot go on like this any longer.    [[Tudjman] I was in Vukovar in late August 1991, at a time  when it was no longer possible to enter Vukovar in a normal way.  I had to take country roads so I could visit those who were  still defending Vukovar. I will return to Vukovar with you.    [Galic] The last question on this issue.    [Branko Pek, secretary of the Refugee Association] Mr.  President, you and other party leaders have often been promising  that refugees will soon return to their homes. Having patiently  waited for three years, the refugees are embittered with both  Croatian state policies and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  as their promises have not materialized. In those eastern parts  of Croatia an exodus took place at an even earlier stage and  those people never returned. Is there any danger of the same  happening to the Croat refugees?    [Tudjman] I have, by and large, already given you my answer  to this question. We can indeed feel dissatisfaction with the  UNPROFOR. The UNPROFOR has not carried out its major duties.  But this is not a case of the UNPROFOR, as it is, not wanting  to do so. We have to be objctive towards members of UNPROFOR  units. Understandably, the UNPROFOR has various ways of  relating to our problems, to the Croatian people and the Serbian  population. What is essential, though, is this -- the UNPROFOR  has carried out one of the key tasks. When we agreed to, and  when the United Nations sent its protection forces, this put an  end to the war between Serbia-Yugoslavia and Croatia. Likewise,  thanks to the UNPROFOR we secured the withdrawal of the Serb  army, the Yugoslav Army from the Dubrovnik area and Prevlaka.  This was not only a result of our armed operation, which was  the most important element, but of diplomatic activity, too,  including the involvement of the peace force.    These are some things that the UNPROFOR should be given  credit for, so to speak. However, the UNPROFOR has not managed  to disarm, the UNPROFOR in its capacity as a peace force was in  fact not tasked with disarming Serbian paramilitary formations.  On arrival the UNPROFOR was tasked with keeping the peace. The  Serbs opposed this. Not only did they oppose the disarmament of  their paramilitary formations but they carried on with ethnic  cleansing.    As far as we know, since the UNPROFOR's arrival about 650  Croatian people have been killed in the UNPROFOR-protected  areas. They have been killed by the Serbian occupation  authorities in these areas.    [Galic] Do we know how many people have been driven out of  these areas over this period?    [Tudjman] In this period, I do not know the exact figure,  but  Croatian people have been constantly driven out. From this  point of view we cannot understandably be satisfied with the  UNPROFOR. To this effect we have demanded that the UN Security  Council give wider authority to the peace force and,  consequently, the power to exercise this authority.    So far these efforts of ours have not been successful. In  the course of these efforts we have nevertheless secured  resolutions such as those on guaranteed borders, on the need for  a gradual reincorporation of these areas into Croatia. We are  now in a period when, in order to solve the refugee question and  not only the refugee question but because of its entire national  and state life, because of the restoration of communications etc  -- Croatia will have to take steps to enable refugees to return  and to reincorporate these areas either with the help of the  peace force and the international community or on its own.  Today, the world will have more understanding for these  justified demands from Croatia.    [Galic] The next major topic to discuss on the occasion of  Croatian Statehood Day is Bosnia, the situation there,and  Croatian policy on Bosnia. After the Washington agreement and  the supplementary agreement in Vienna were reached, the roots of  the Croat-Muslim confrontation seem to have been eliminated and  Croat-Muslim relations have reached a new phase, a phase of  great cooperation, where conditions are to be created for  co-existence within Bosnia-Herzgovina, a federation of Croats  and Muslims, and, to a certain extent, coexistence with Croatia,  in the confederation.    Do you, Mr. President, believe that, after what has been  achieved at the diplomatic level, conditions have been created  to eliminate the Croat-Muslim confrontation, if not forever then  for a considerable period of time?    [Tudjman] Everything you said is true. The problem of  Croat-Muslim relations and [pauses], if you look at it as a  whole, the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina is objectively the most  complicated problem in the world today, for the very reason that  three nations are confronting each other, and not only three  specific nations but also three civilizations. The state [of  Bosnia-Herzegovina] was, when it was created and later  throughout its history, not only an area of competition on an  ethnic basis between the Serbs and Croats, but also an area  where Muslims existed first as a separate religious and later  ethnic community and where attempts were made to create a  Greater Serbia by including the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  where attempts were also made by certain fundamentalist circles  from abroad to create a base in Bosnia-Herzegovina for an  extreme fundamentalist policy in the center of Europe.    [Galic] Was this realistic? Was it possible?    [Tudjman] As was proven in real life -- it was not possible,  but the danger, the tendency was there. As we are speaking  about this, it would be difficult to understand that the world  as it is and a disunited Europe could allow Serb aggression of  the kind we saw -- if it had not been for the world fearing this  danger that you have just asked about. There have been even  some specific studies about this, both in the east and in the  west. Some Muslim leaders, despite saying that they were  fighting for a secular state, have given statements to the  effect that they will create a state in Bosnia governed by  Islamic laws, whether others like it or not. You know that this  is also a civilizational problem of today's world, that the  largest number of Islamic states want to have normal coexistence  with other civilizations, but that there are also those who call  for a jihad, a holy war to destroy other civilizations.    But, let us get back to concrete things. The Croatian policy  from the beginning wanted to protect the Croatian identity as a  whole in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As you know the Croatian identity  is most compact in western Herzegovina, but it is also present  in central Bosnia, Sarajevo, and in Bosnian Posavina, in the  whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or in its largest part. This is  why we accepted, and not only accepted but also instigated -- I  personally did, the first proposals on a system of cantons, then  on the resolution of the crisis based on the division of Bosnia  into provinces. Understandably, we helped the formation of the  Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna when the republic of Srpska was  practically already a separate entity, and when the Muslim  leadership also accepted the idea of the creation of a separate  Muslim republic.    As you know, that agreement with the Serbs was signed and  made public. Naturally, by pursuing such a policy and helping  the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, through the Croat republic of  Herzeg-Bosna, we managed to prevent the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina from falling into the hands of a greater  Serbia, and then to defend the Croatian areas even in central  Bosnia.    There have been proposals that we can annex western  Herzegovina to Croatia immdiately, which I rejected, because I  considered the Croatian areas as a whole, especially the threats  to the Croats in central Bosnia.    With such a policy we did not passively accept, but we  brought about the Washington agreement [as heard]. We did not  have to be forced to sign it, regardless of the fact that some  individuals, even in Croatia, do not understand that. As I  said, the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina is truly complex, and  some people even in Croatia speak about a unitary humanitarian  Bosnia. Some would like to annex only a part of Bosnia, and so  on. However, in our policy Croatian national and strategic  interests coincided with the interests of the Western world.  The understanding that the Muslims can survive only in an  alliance with the Croats also prevailed among the Muslims, in  the Muslim leadership. That was the basis of the agreement.    [Galic] Do these agreements and the principles of the  agreements from Washington and Vienna guarantee the realization  and protection of Croatian national interests and Croatian state  interests?    [Tudjman] Absolutely. Why? Because on the basis of the  constitution and the constitutional principles of the  federation, it is the first time that the Croatian people in the  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is in fact -- judging by  the signed agreements and the opinion of international law  experts; there is a document signed by American Professor Dr  (Boyle) analyzing the whole agreement over 26 pages and in 121  articles and proving that the federation, and especially the  confederation, are ensuring an absolutely equal status for  Croatia [sentence as heard].    Therefore, the Croatian national entity -- both here in  Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- should always remember the  heritage which speaks about and warns that the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina have always been in a subjugated position.  They were first under Serb hegemony when they were pushed into  the background and eliminated even physically from  Bosnia-Herzegovina. And, recently, they have been under Muslim  hegemony.    Therefore, the Croats must understand that the constitution  on the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation grants them an equal  position, and that they can no longer be placed in an unequal,  subjugated position because of the equality there, and  especially because of the confederation.    After all, neither the Croats in the Croat republic of  Herzeg-Bosna nor we here would accept the agreement, the  proposal by the United States and the important European  players, if it had not been for the link between the federation  and the confederation. That confederal relation between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia guarantees that the  Croats there can be completely equal, and that they will be  responsible for governing Bosnia-Herzegovina in the direction of  the interests of today's democratic world and for linking  Bosnia-Herzegovina with western civilization through Croatia,  despite some extremist trends.    [Galic] Some uncertainty and even fear is present among the  Croats over the issue of what will happen to Croats in the mixed  cantons, the cantons which have been declared mixed but have a  Croatian majority. Medjugorje is a certain example where such  concerns are present, Medjugorje which is to be part of a mixed  canton.    [Tudjman] First of all, full equality is also guaranteed in  mixed cantons. In those municipalities of the mixed cantons  where the Croats are in the majority -- no Muslim or any other  authority can be imposed, or any symbols etc. This very example  of Medjugorje being in a mixed Mostar-Neretva canton shows that  this canton, because of Medjugorje, will be more likely to be  known as more Croat rather than as more Muslim, for the whole  world knows of Medjugorje. I was myself surprised by how many  people came to Medjugorje even in the war conditions, from as  far as America, Canada, and Indonesia. This example shows that  this canton will not be less Croat than it is Bosniak-Muslim.    [Galic] What will actually happen with Bosnia? Some people  think, and a lot has been said about it in public, that there is  some secret, or I do not know what kind of agreement, between  you and Mr. Milosevic on the division of Bosnia and that  everything else is just a game. Many have denied this, and many  have spoken about it. I would like you to answer this question  -- is there any truth about the alleged agreement on Bosnia with  Mr. Milosevic?    [Tudjman] There has been no agreement with Milosevic or  anyone else. Except for an agreement with [Bosnian President]  Izetbegovic [laughs]. At the time when it was being said that  the Bosnian crisis should be resolved through a union of three  republics, I signed an agreement with Izetbegovic, now I can say  a secret agreement, on cooperation between the Croat and Muslim  republics within the union, and on a confederation between these  two and Croatia. This was even signed. There has been no  agreement with Milosevic, either written or verbal. I did have  talks first with Milosevic and then, a few days later, with  Izetbegovic, and then all three of us met. This was before the  war flared up in Bosnia, when Yugoslavia had disintegrated and  Bosnia was on the agenda. My view was: Gentlemen, let us try to  prevent a war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for this war will have have  even more terrible consequences than in Croatia. I said then:  There are two possibilities to resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina  crisis. One is the confederal solution which would satisfy all  three nations, the other one is the division. There is no third  option. So, let us try a politically acceptable solution for  all three nations. There is no ideal solution in such  complicated conditions. This was the gist of my talks with  Milosevic, my talks with Izetbegovic, and the talks between all  three in Split. And there is nothing else to add.    And where are we today? We were in a position to create a  union of three republics. Let us be completely open: The  prevailing opinion among the most responsible circles of the  world politics was that the creation of three separate republics  in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not suitable. In some future the  republic of Srpska would probably join Serbia, and the Croat one  would join Croatia, and a separate Muslim one would remain, as  we have mentioned a few minutes ago.    A proposal was then made, acceptable to us -- since it  resolved the problem of Croats in general and the strategic  interests of the Croatian state -- to create the Bosniak-Croat  federation. And now the question of borders remains. As you  have seen, at the latest ministerial meeting the world did not  accept the 58:42 division. The position of the European  ministers and Secretary of State Mr. Christopher is that the  divison should be 51:49. In my opinion such a division should  be executed and the republic of Srpska should then remain in  some loose union with the federation, as a transitional solution.    In my opinion a solution will be found at some kind of a new  Berlin congress. In a letter to President Clinton after he took  office, I said that the United States should take over the  leading role, since the European countries were not united as  regards this, that an agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not  be easily reached, and that international circles would have to  make a decision to even, if it needed be, impose peace -- to  prevent a war which could in this area assume a proportion of a  war between civilizations. Not only a third world war, but --  bearing in mind constant involvement of some radical, Bolshevik  or Orthodox circles, on Serbia's side and a manifestly open  desire by some Islamic circles to get involved on the Muslim  side. Croatia has been and remains in favor of finding a  political solution as soon as possible, to achieve peace and  create conditions for a stable future international system in  this area.    [Galic] Would Bosnia within this concept remain in its  pre-war borders?    [Tudjman] Now, a solution is being sought along these lines  but everyone is saying that this is a transitional solution.    [Galic] It seems that the Washington agreement, which was  after all signed under U.S. patronage or under considerable U.S.  influence, has resulted in relations between Croatia and the  United States being elevated to a level they never reached  before. It was you who was talking about special relations,  about partnership between the United States and Croatia. Does  this U.S. background, this U.S. support for Croatia, regarding  both Bosnia and Croatia in particular, determine in a way the  character of Croatia's foreign policy, of the Croatian state and  its international status? Is the United States our main ally or  partner in the world?    [Tudjman] Well, I think, yes. In other words, by pursuing  this policy of ours, a principled policy from the point of view  of protecting Croatian interests, and by bearing in mind  international circumstances, we won not only the sympathy of the  United States as the world's main power but also its friendship,  something that is our greatest success. The Washington  agreement crowned this policy. The United States indeed regards  Croatia as a key factor in the implementation of this policy.  Yesterday, I received not only President Clinton's  congratulations on statehood day but also his separate letter  about their wish to carry on with our mutual efforts to solve  the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    At the same time on the other end of the world there is a  country such as China, the world's superpower with the largest  population. We are also developing economic and cultural  relations in the spirit of friendship. Our policy has created  allies and friends in Europe too, not just among those who are  traditionally inclined toward us but who demonstrated a great  deal of misunderstanding as regards our complicated position,  our involvement, so to speak, in Bosnia-Herzegovina....    [Galic, interrupting] Are you referring to Germany?    [Tudjman] Yes, Germany among others. Even Germany was  eventually convinced by my peace initiative of 1 November last  year and particularly by my meeting with the Muslim leadership  in Bonn, i.e. in St. Petersburg, when it was revealed what we  were offering and when there were no grounds any longer for  casting suspicion on this Croatian policy which had been  continuously of such a nature, which wanted peace and  cooperation with the Muslims and offered solutions.    Hence, I would say yes to your question, yes we maintain  friendly relations with the United States in all spheres, not  only regarding the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina but in the  economic sphere, the political sphere and all other spheres.  But we also have friends and allies, precisely thanks to our  principled character. You know how the Vatican supported us.  The Washington agreement enabled us to create conditions for  the development of friendly economic relations with Islamic  countries.    Consequently, in recent days Croatia has achieved indeed,  your colleague, our ambassador Hido Biscevic in Ankara has sent  a letter to me saying that there is a document that Turkish  President Demirel, he is a statesman of great experience, has  said that the world is witnessing, with surprising satisfaction  and even admiration, how Croatia has been managing to win  friends and that its policy has contributed to some prospects  for a solution to this complex crisis [sentence as heard].    [Galic] One of the party leaders will ask you a question  about the relations between Croatia and the other former  superpower.    [Boris Kandare, of Croatian Party of Rights] I would like to  ask you what influence the Russian Federation and its policies  will have on future political events in the Republic of Croatia  and in Bosnia-Herzegovina and how you personally intend to  resolve this burning issue?    [Tudjman] This is a good question. Russia, whether the  Russia of Peter The Great, Ivan The Terrible, Stalin or Yeltsin,  remains an Euro-Asian power which will have permanent influence  in the world and even in this part of the Balkans -- although I  do not consider Croatia a Balkan state, but a state of southeast  Europe.    Russia's presence here is felt through Serbia and through  its influence over the Orthodox population of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and Croatia. The recent changes in Russia showed that the  Russian policy is felt to such an extent that other  international circles, Europe and the United States, have to  acknowledge it.    I can say with satisfaction that the official Russian policy  has played a positive role in the attempts to resolve the crisis  in the former Yugoslavia and the Serb question in Croatia. It  was in my presence in Belgrade that a Russian representative  proposed to Milosevic to recognize Croatia. The Russian  ambassador to Zagreb has been to Knin and has said that the  Serbs in Croatia have to resolve their relations with the  Croatian authorities within Croatia. The influence of the  official Russian policy is now positive. But, on the other  hand, there are some extreme circles in Russia, both from old  Bolshevik ranks and from radical Orthodox ones, who have  supported and continue to support Serbia's imperialist policy.  Yet, it is to be expected that Russia will continue with its  positive policy. But also -- Russia's positive democratic  position remains in the context of Russia's desire to secure its  sphere of influence in this part of the world.    As far as we in Croatia are concerned, we have to  acknowledge the positive role Russia has played in attempts to  resolve the problems in the former Yugoslavia. We also have  very intensive economic relations with Russia. As a country  which wants to have friendly relations with all countries in the  world we should try to develop our economic and cultural  relations with Russia as much as possible. Despite its desire  to have Serbia in its sphere of interest Russia will want to  have good relations not only within the Orthodox world, but also  with what used to be called the western Slavs.    All in all, we have to be not only pragmatic, but we must  also remember that cultural links between the Croatian and  Russian people existed [a long time ago] and that understanding  for the Croatian problem is reflected in the attempts by Russian  diplomats to support a right solution.    [Galic] You said Croatia is not a Balkan country and this  will certainly be accepted by everyone. Croatia is a European  country. How will the process of Croatia's integration into  European organizations and systems -- political, cultural,  economic, etc -- develop by the end of this year? Is it  realistic that the Council of Europe is the first step? Is  Croatia determined to fight for full European status?    [Tudjman] Absolutely. After the Washington agreement not  only the Germans but also U.S. representatives explicitly said  that Croatia has been accepted as a constituent part of the  western world, western Europe. But we must be realistic here.  Regardless of changes of government, some lasting components  remain within European countries, which would like -- as they  wanted to preserve Yugoslavia -- to create some new regional  alliances. For this reason some did not want to have Croatia as  it is. Until 1991 they did not want to have Croatia at all --  and some very influential circles wanted Croatia to be defeated.  When we managed to survive they worked on producing changes in  Croatia which would take Croatia into some new regional  alliances in the former Yugoslavia.    Because of the spheres of influence, not only between Russia  and Europe and Russia, Europe, and the United States, but also  within Europe -- you [Galic], as a man who lived in Paris for a  long time, know very well that there is significant difference  between Paris, London, Bonn, and Rome...[Tudjman pauses] Croatia  is absolutely on its way to the EU. Not only is it on its way  but, as I have mentioned, Croatia is an important factor in the  creation of an international order which will guarantee that no  new twists will happen in this turbulent area.    [Galic] A country like Croatia, which is neither in a state  of peace nor war, must use up a great proportion of its  potential on financing its refugees, organizing its armed  forces. At the same time its economic potential is not fully  utilized. This certainly creates many social problems, some of  which you will see reflected in our citizens' questions.    [Unidentified pensioner from Osijek] Mr. Tudjman, would you  and your wife be able to survive on a pension of 750,000  [Croatian dinars] if your household bills totalled 450,000  [dinars]?    [Tudjman] Dear madam, this is too little. We cannot be  satisfied with this. We must and will do everything to increase  our incomes, our salaries. Then again, let us be realistic, let  us be proud, both you and I and all Croatian citizens of having  weathered all of this, everything we have weathered. In Croatia  no one went hungry. There has been no shortage of fuel in  Croatia. There has been no shortage of anything in these  wartime circumstances.    Your [pension] and my salary are still better than in any  former socialist country with the exception of the Czech  Republic and perhaps Slovenia which is far above....[Tudjman  pauses] Consequently, in these changes which were brought about,  which we had to survive, understandably, we had to weather all  kinds of things, particularly what Mirko [Galic] has just said,  that we had to create an army under unfavorable circumstances.  War in every country, in a country such as Croatia in  particular, because it was occupied as a whole in the beginning  and than one-third was ruined. [sentence as heard] It is a  miracle that we have managed even in this economic sphere to  avert starvation and poverty. As soon as we get out of the war,  and even now we are already increasing salaries.    Private enterprises, private initiatives are being launched.  The tourist trade is being restored, and so on. We are heading  for higher living standards. One thing is essential, though.  Today we have our Croatian authorities who have no other task  but to take care of the well-being of Croatian citizens. In  other words, we have now created a situation in which your and  my toil and effort and that of the Croatian people is no longer  drained down the Sava and the Danube to God knows where.  Croatian people can find jobs where they could not before -- in  the Croatian Army, the Croatian diplomatic service. Now, our  destiny, our future, the issue of what kind of salaries we will  have and what kind of culture and science, is in our hands.  Rest assured that we are doing our best to get the most capable  Croatian people involved in resolving these problems.    [Unidentified refugee] Refugees find it extremely hard to  find a job. They would like to work.    [Tudjman] A job? I am puzzled, I am puzzled indeed to learn  that refugees who want to work -- every refugee should want to  work -- cannot find a job. In Croatia we are already facing a  shortage of labor, a shortage not only in construction companies  but in the tourist industry, too. Consequently, in this  context, there are problems which we ourselves, the Croats, are  responsible for. This is what we have to overcome.    So far I have only heard of obstacles facing those who want  to return from abroad. I have had to intervene in a huge number  of cases to enable people from the diaspora to take part in the  privatization process, to buy these former socialist facilities  that belong to no one, and to help them in finding jobs. In two  cases the returnees went back to Australia and Canada after  having experienced a cold welcome here. It was my intervention  that brought them back. Let this be known.    I have only heard of such cases in which people from abroad  face obstacles to finding jobs. Understandably, there are also  positive cases. I know of some hundred young people from the  diaspora who are not only employed in their own companies but  who have found jobs after returning from abroad. One of thes  people is a man who was born in Argentina. He works now for the  Privatization Fund.    I have not, however, heard so far that you refugees are  facing obstacles. On this occasion I appeal to all Croatian  people in business life and the administration to give Croatian  refugees, above all, a chance to find a job. People will find  this burden of refugee existence less painful if they work, if  they are occupied, if they know that they are useful rather than  being a burden. Consequently, this is our shared issue.    Dear madam, not all things in Croatia are as they should be.  This is not only a matter of political revival, of the  implementation of the economic revival we have achieved. We  must also bring about a moral revival, a moral restoration so to  speak, so that we can create the preconditions for Croatia's  integrity. For, in its history, this Croatia has never been a  unified state. There are still regional tendencies. There is  still mistrust, say between Dalmatians and Slavonians, or  between Herzegovinians and Istrians, and so on. Consequently,  we must overcome these regional features within the Croatian  national entity that we have inherited from the past as soon as  possible. Regional allegiances most certainly have an influence  on whether someone gets a job or not.    I, for one, have intervened on a great many occasions. I do  everything so we can achieve a state of harmony among the  Croatian people that is demanded at this historic juncture. We  have just established the Croatian state. It should be  consolidated. Its stability in international terms will depend  on this as well as on its stability in terms of finding the best  solutions for all internal problems. There are problems in  every country, in every society. Particularly so in our  newly-created state because of, as I mentioned, leaving the  Yugoslav and socialist hell.    [Galic] There is another similar question.    [Unidentified female soldier] Mr. President, has Croatia  come  to the point where a Croatian soldier who has been in service  since 1991 is living on 360,000 [Croatian dinars] a month? That  is a shame!    [Tudjman] I do not know your case precisely. If you are  referring to a soldier who is capable of working and who is  willing to work, then 360,000 is less than a living wage and  society, our state, should find a solution for him to have a  wage which we can guarantee. Our average wage is about 300  [German] marks, and in many firms as much as 500, 600, 700 and  even over 1,000 marks is paid. Therefore, it depends on  resourcefulness, and sometimes, if someone is not capable of  solving his problems, our social services should help him. In  this particular case, if we are really talking about a soldier,  I simply do not understand it.    [Galic] Political parties are also interested in social  policy. You will see that party leaders are asking about the  social situation in our country, our society.    [Mato Arlovic, Social-Democratic Party] What will be done to  improve the social, financial, and equal status of workers and  pensioners? Which measures should we take to improve the  standards of living of a man, a worker, and his family -- at  least to ensure respect for human dignity and the dignity of the  family? This is my question. I believe that if the  fragmentation of society continues, it will -- and it has  already started doing so -- slowly start affecting the unity of  all citizens, which could have serious implications on the  security of the state.    [Tudjman] Of course, it is a task of the authorities to deal  effectively with all social problems. However, in that respect  we are limited by circumstances. As long as we have to earmark  the main part of the budget for the creation of an armed force,  an army; as long as we have to support an army three times  larger than we would normally need; as long as we have to invest  money in the establishing of our diplomatic service, which is  not cheap either; briefly, as long as we do not come out of the  isolation in which we have been so far, the possibilities of the  state authorities are limited.    However, there has always been and there will always be the  fragmentation of society. The state authorities should exert a  positive influence, but that problem should certainly not be  addressed by socialist and self-management phraseology and by  giving promises and granting rights without a realistic basis.  If we opted for a free market, we should respect the laws of  the free market, including resourcefulness or the lack of it.  Of course, some will become rich, some will go bankrupt. We  cannot avoid that, especially during the period of [ownership]  transformation.    But, I agree that precisely for these reasons the state  authorities have a greater responsibility to alleviate the  position of those in society who are most at risk -- pensioners  and others -- in order to enable them to live a normal life and  to create conditions for all classes, all segments of the  Croatian people for the first time to take part in the  rebuilding of their homeland.    [Galic] Mr. Pankretic will ask you a question in his own  way.    [Josip Pankretic, Croatian Peasants' Party] Since you have  appropriated land from the conglomerates as state land, the land  has been abandoned. None of the state-owned land along the road  from Sesvete to Vrbovec has been sown with corn, and it was not  sown last year either. People in the villages wonder why the  state does not sow corn when we do. That causes problems for us  because my peasants do not sow either. Seeing that you own that  land, would you please say something about that?    [Tudjman] Dear Pankretic, you cannot help acting as if you  are in an electoral campaign. First of all, we have not  appropriated any land for the state, but we have been looking  for ways of privatizing former socialist large farms without  threatening production.    I visited Romania recently where they took rash steps and  reduced production by 50 percent, and the people were hungry, so  they had to return the land. Therefore, we, the state, have not  appropriated the land, but we tried to keep up production, and  at the same time to privatize the farms.    I can give you the same answer as before: We have had such  success that there has been no hunger, but I am sure that we can  do more for villages. I know very well that the Croatian people  have survived because of village life and the peasants.  Conditions should be created for the farmers not to leave  villages, but to stay there. We should create conditions, as in  Denmark for example, for the farmer to be lord of his land.    [Galic] Many people will say that a huge, maybe the  greatest,  treasure of Croatia is its people, very resourceful people. Are  they well deployed, appointed to the right positions? A party  leader will ask you that.    [Jozo Rados, Croatian Social-Liberal Party] With all due  respect to the political experience of the president of the  republic, but stressing that his experiences stem from the  communist system -- both as a brain behind it and a dissident  against it -- and acknowledging that he is a scientist, I  personally believe that the human resources of the Republic of  Croatia should be deployed in a better way. I know how  difficult and strenuous it is to create and govern a state.  But, there are opinions in the public that many mistakes made  by Croatian policy came about because the large volume of work  and many tasks have been too much for the strength of one man.  I would like to hear the president's opinion on these thoughts.    [Galic] Mr. President of the Republic?    [Tudjman] It seems that Mr. Rados is speaking here as a  party  representative. I affirm that Croatian policy has made no  strategic mistakes either in politics or in the economy, either  internally or in the international sphere. On the contrary,  causing surprise, admiration, and bafflement on the part of some  people, it has made achievements precisely because it had a  leadership, it knew what it wanted, and it mobilized all the  intellectual potential -- regardless of party affiliation -- to  solve both political and economic problems.    One of the most complex tasks was the creation of the  Croatian Army. From what, and against which odds did we create  it? We managed to defend ourselves and create a force to which  the enemy will have to give serious consideration. Look at  Croatian diplomacy, look at those people. They are professors,  scientists, doctors of sciences, people who have contributed to  the victory of Croatian state policy and who are respected in  the world. In the economy, where are those economic experts who  have been left out?    So, we have achieved much, thanks primarily to a good  personnel policy. Of course, more can and must be done, but we  must create a climate in the whole of Croatia's public life in  which there will be a clear difference between state interests  on the one hand and party political -- let me not say petty  political -- interests on the other hand. Speaking about  Croatian state interests, no party differences should be seen in  the activities on the international sphere. In the  international sphere we should be united in defending the  Croatian state and Croatian state interests. That means giving  support to those who people voted for and entrusted their  confidence in, and, I dare say, those who have justified that  confidence and brought Croatia to the point where internally it  has one of the most stable systems compared to other former  socialist countries, and in international relations it has been  recognized and has won the friendship of the most important  international players.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Vontobel soars 64% to SFr40m Vontobel, the Zurich-based private banking group, said its consolidated net income soared 64 per cent last year to SFr40.1m (Dollars 27.6m). The directors are recommending a 48 per cent rise in dividends to SFr20 per bearer share and SFr4 per registered share. The group has revealed for the first time the size of its assets under management, SFr21.5bn, of which half are managed on a discretionary basis and half are from private clients. The Vontobel family, which has no heirs, has given some SFr6.8m worth of the company's bearer shares to its 500 employees. The main contributor to profits growth was the doubling of trading income to SFr61.6m.</p>

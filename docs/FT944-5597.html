			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: SmithKline awaits results of expansion trial - Whether the UK group has the winning strategy is the big question SmithKline Beecham, the world's sixth biggest drugs company, seems to be hooked on change. Last week, it announced yet another Dollars 1bn-plus deal. That made four - almost Dollars 8bn-worth - in six months. But perhaps it is about to kick the habit. Mr Jan Leschly, the group's energetic chief executive, wearily declared last week that the corporate hyperactivity was probably over for the moment. 'We have got the components in place we need to do what we want to do,' said Mr Leschly. 'What's next is to make sure the investments in synergy and restructuring work.' His approach had won the approval of his peers across UK industry. SmithKline Beecham was this week voted the fourth most admired company in the US, up from ninth two years ago. But in the context of the international pharmaceutical business, its strategy is more questionable. The sector has exploded into corporate action this year. More than Dollars 25bn has been spent since January, with many deals bigger than anything SmithKline has done. American Home Products paid almost Dollars 10bn for its American Cyanamid acquisition. Switzerland's Roche forked out Dollars 5.3bn for Syntex, a Californian drugs manufacturer. But SmithKline has now declared that the pieces are in place for it to achieve its goal of becoming an integrated healthcare company as opposed to a specialised drug maker. The plan was formulated in 1993. A team of executives prepared a '10-three-one' strategy. This involved forecasting the business environment a decade from now and devising three and one-year plans to position the company for that future. The review was prompted by the growing strength of the drugs industry's customers. The gap between those who delivered healthcare - doctors and hospitals - from those who paid for it - governments and payers of health insurance premiums - appeared to be closing. For example, governments in Germany, Italy and the UK are seeking to limit the range of drugs that can be prescribed. The trend is clearer in the US, where healthcare spending may hit Dollars 1,000bn this year. Much of the cost burden falls on companies which pay insurance premiums for employees. They increasingly use specialist companies called health management organisations (HMOs) to drive tough bargains with hospital chains, doctors' practices and drug companies. A favoured technique is to tell doctors they can prescribe drugs only from an approved list. The SmithKline team determined the industry's winners would be those which could deal directly with the real customers, the payers. SmithKline therefore had to offer disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and advise on the best way to deliver these to patients. To do that companies would have to be much bigger, leaving room for between six and 10 'mega global players', says one SmithKline executive. Each of the four transactions this year is designed to create a broadly based company able to offer products to the payers. In May SmithKline spent Dollars 2.3bn on Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services. Nominally a drug distributor, DPS is a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) which manages lists of approved drugs for 300,000 US doctors looking after almost 11m health insurance policy holders. SmithKline also signed a minimum six-year collaboration with the former owner of DPS, United Healthcare, one of the largest HMO chains in the US. In August, it paid Eastman Kodak of the US Dollars 2.9bn for Sterling Health, a specialist in branded medicines sold over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Governments are encouraging the use of OTC drugs because patients pay for them directly. In September, SmithKline sold Sterling's US brands to Bayer of Germany for Dollars 1bn. This was partly to help cut SmithKline's Dollars 3.5bn debt and partly because it was already strong in US OTC. Getting stronger might have attracted the attention of the US anti-trust authorities. Finally came last week's Dollars 1.45bn sale of the company's animal health business to US rival Pfizer. Debt was pushed down further and animal health was seen as disposable in a plan to become a health management company. In addition, SB's research and development operations on both sides of the Atlantic have been transformed since Dr George Poste succeeded Dr Keith Mansford as head of R&amp;D in 1992. The company has dropped several research programmes - including gastro-intestinal medicine, the field that had produced Tagamet, its best-seller of the 1980s. It now concentrates on drug discovery in five areas: the central nervous system, heart and lungs, anti-infectives, inflammation and tissue repair, and vaccines. And, since announcing a Dollars 125m link-up in May 1993 with Human Genome Sciences, it has become a leader in gene discovery. Since SmithKline also has a diagnostics equipment arm, the company can claim to offer an integrated healthcare service from diagnosis through drug development, manufacture and sales to the management of the patients. But there are question marks over the plan. Mr Ian Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at stock broker Lehman Brothers, says the fashion for buying PBMs - Eli Lilly paid Dollars 4bn for another, called PCS, in July - is fading. He says they may have cost too much. SmithKline paid 57 times annual earnings for DPS, which will hurt the company's earnings per share for at least two years. Nor can SmithKline take maximum advantage of the PBM links because of a ruling made by the US Federal Trade Commission in Lilly's deal. The FTC was concerned that PCS had commercially sensitive data on drugs it distributed that were manufactured by Lilly's rivals. Last month, Lilly was forced to erect Chinese walls between the PBM and the rest of the company to block the flow of sensitive information. SmithKline quickly said it already had such Chinese walls in place. Nevertheless, says Mr Smith, access to such information was one of the planks on which SmithKline justified the high price it paid for DPS. The success of its chosen strategy will easily be measured. Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs market, has made no acquisitions yet. Only one is like to have picked the right road. Additional reporting by Clive Cookson</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Borrowing rule change for housing market MEASURES to revive the deeply depressed housing market were announced by the government yesterday, aimed at helping people faced with mortgages larger than the value of their homes. The changes follow weeks of talks between building societies, the Treasury and the Building Societies Commission, the industry watchdog. Home owners, many of whom are unable to move because their properties are worth less than their mortgages, will now be allowed to borrow up to Pounds 25,000 in unsecured finance from their building societies to use as top-up finance. Until now building societies have been unable to lend more than Pounds 10,000 without a property as security. The government is also easing the conditions under which mortgage customers can obtain income tax relief if they move home. Mortgage interest relief will continue to be claimable when a home owner moves to another property but retains the original mortgage. The changes will affect millions of homeowners whose houses have fallen sharply in value since they bought them because of the downturn in the housing market. Building societies and insurance companies will now have to hold talks to see how these moves affect mortgage indemnity cover, the insurance which protects the top 10 or 15 per cent of the loan if the borrower gets into difficulties. The changes were announced by Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, who said they would provide a 'modest but useful stimulus' for the housing market. Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, said the new measures were unlikely to have much impact. 'Today's announcement will be modest in its effect and don't expect it to produce any significant results,' a spokeswoman said. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at the City stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, denounced the proposals. He pointed out that there seemed to be little demand for top-up loans from Abbey National and the clearing banks for people with so-called negative equity. Many large building societies are currently battling to maintain their capital strength and profitability despite a large number of bad debts. Mr Wriglesworth said he thought it unlikely that some building societies would risk weakening their capital strength by engaging in more unsecured lending. C&amp;G mortgage rate cut, Page 9</p>

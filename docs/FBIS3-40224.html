These images, to be used for development and exploration of  agricultural, forest, mineral, and water resources, were  captured with a high-resolution side-looking synthetic aperture  radar (SAR) and other advanced instruments carried on board the  Canadian CV-580 aircraft flying at an altitude of 5,500 meters  and having an imaging range of over 8,000 square kilometers. The  current cooperative project with Canada, in addition to the  aforementioned radar imaging flights, also included a symposium,  data processing and analysis, and academic interchanges. Chinese  scientists and engineers commented that the project will  inevitably improve the nation's technological level in radar  remote sensing, and scientists on both sides expressed  satisfaction with the successful implementation of the plan  flights.</p>

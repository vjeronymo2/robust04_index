			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL FACES MONEY SQUEEZE, OKS TAX INCREASES;  </P> <P> BUDGET: PACKAGE WILL INCLUDE A 10% LEVY ON PARKING FEES. BUSINESS TAXES AND  TRASH COLLECTION CHARGES ALSO WILL RISE.  </P> <P> Facing what officials call the tightest financial squeeze in years, the Los  Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to impose a package of tax increases that  will tap the pocketbooks of millions of residents, commuters and business  owners.  </P> <P> Among the tax hikes, which were proposed by Mayor Tom Bradley, will be a  first-ever 10% levy on parking, as well as boosts in business taxes and trash  fees.  </P> <P> Council members also agreed to across-the-board cuts in salary expenses that  went even deeper than Bradley's $3.6-billion 1990-91 budget. They took the  action in response to reports from financial analysts who said that the mayor's  plan, coupled with sluggish revenue increases, could trigger a $100-million  deficit and a severe financial crisis next year.  </P> <P> Whether layoffs would occur was not immediately clear, but Bradley said his  budget would lead to reductions in after-school programs, tree trimming,  library book purchases and summer swimming programs, as well as higher fees at  golf courses and the city zoo.  </P> <P> Some council members expressed optimism Wednesday that departments could absorb  the 6% reduction in their salary requests -- 2% more than Bradley proposed --  without serious disruption.  </P> <P> Under the council proposal, three large agencies that supply critical services  -- police, fire and sanitation -- were held to only a 1% cut in salary  accounts. Thus far, money remains in the budget for 400 new police officers and  115 new paramedics.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the Finance and Revenue Committee, said  the actions constituted a "balanced diet" for city government "that will  prevent us from having to go on a starvation liquid protein diet" next year.  </P> <P> "We're spending beyond our means and that has to come to a stop," Yaroslavsky  said.  </P> <P> His comments were echoed by other council members, most of whom agreed with the  grim financial assessment and budget-cutting proposals drawn up in recent weeks  by the budget committee.  </P> <P> But Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who voted against the across-the-board cuts in  salary requests, charged that the budget-cutting talk was "malarkey." He said  that even with the council actions, most departments are "still receiving  substantial increases."  </P> <P> The tax increases, which will go back to the council for final approval, would  raise an estimated $59.3 million in new revenue. The parking tax would add a  10% fee to the cost of most parking in the city and generate $22.5 million in  new revenue. In addition, the city business tax on gross receipts would  increase 10%, and a special levy to pay for trash trucks would double from  $1.50 per month per household to $3.  </P> <P> The tax increases were approved on lopsided votes on the first full day of  detailed council hearings on the mayor's budget, which despite the warnings of  fiscal problems is up $417.2 million, or 13%. Further wrangling over additional  cuts -- and funding for various officials' pet projects -- is expected to  continue at least through the week before a final budget is approved.  </P> <P> During a public hearing Wednesday morning, reaction to the new and increased  taxes was largely negative.  </P> <P> Gill Barnett, president of a firm that operates garages around the city, said  people are "confused and upset" about the proposed 10% parking tax and that the  city has made little effort to explain the tax to the public. He said he  believes that the mayor and the council are moving too quickly on the matter.  </P> <P> "I think the public would be outraged if they knew this tax is going to go into  place," Barnett said.  </P> <P> Some council members said they hoped questions about the fairness of the  parking tax would be addressed before the final ordinance is approved. The tax  is based on the amount paid by the motorist.  </P> <P> Critics point out that many downtown city employees, executives and  professionals have parking that is subsidized by their employers -- and their  tax would be far less than, say, workers who must pay the full cost of their  own parking.  </P> <P> "It falls disproportionately heavy on (some) workers," said Councilman Robert  Farrell, who voted against the tax.  </P> <P> Other officials acknowledged that there may be inequities, but said the  benefits of raising revenues and encouraging use of public transit and  car-pooling were the paramount considerations.  </P> <P> In other action, the council voted to use $250,000 in federal poverty funds to  pay for an expanded AIDS education program. The money includes $50,000 for  distribution of needle-cleaning kits and condoms to intravenous drug users, who  are at high risk of contracting AIDS.  </P> <P> The AIDS funds were not part of Bradley's original budget proposal, but the  mayor later forwarded a departmental request to the council along with his  endorsement of the request.  </P></p>

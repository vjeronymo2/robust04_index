			<p>BFN     [Text] Melbourne, June 1 (XINHUA) -- A joint press  statement on Australia-China economic cooperation was released  here today, praising highly of the China trade and investment  forum being held here.    The press statement pointed out that the forum, the largest  ever held in Australia, "reflected the importance the Australian  and Chinese Governments placed on developing the bilateral trade  and economic relationship."    The joint press statement was released at the forum by  Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan and visiting  Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang of China's Ministry for Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation.    Gu led a largest Chinese trade delegation, consisting of  more  than 100 businessmen from 20 out of China's 30 provinces and  municipalities, who have brought with them over 500 projects,  worth 7 billion U.S. dollars.    The two officials held that the forum has created an  opportunity to deepen and strengthen the economic relationship  between the two countries."    The two-way trade has increased rapidly in recent years. In  1993, the trade volume between the two countries enjoyed a  record high of 3 billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent over the  previous year, according to China's official figures.    Latest Australian official figures indicated that China has  become the 6th largest trading partner of Australia and  Australia has become the 10th in China's largest trading partner  list.    The two sides agreed that the current trade and investment  levels were only a small proportion of what would be achieved as  the economic relations matured.    "The development of the economic relationship would be  assisted by trade and economic regions both countries were  pursuing and by the formalization of China's status in the  GATT," the statement said.    The two ministers reaffirmed that in line with the  understanding contained in the Australia-China Trade and  Investment Framework Agreement, the two sides will continue to    -- Take a purposeful and systematic approach to removing  trade and investment barriers;    -- Maintain MFN as a basis for trade between the two  countries;    -- See an early settlement of China's GATT status;    -- Encourage closer integration of mineral, agricultural and  raw materials processing sectors; and    -- Encourage further visits by ministerial-level trade  delegations and senior government and business officials.    The two officials believed that economic complementarities  between the two countries have created potential for ventures  and projects in areas of raw materials and mineral process as  well as manufacturing and services.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Lord Donoughue accused on Maxwell stock lending THREE directors of Mirror Group Newspapers, who were also pension fund trustees until December 1991, told a Parliamentary Select Committee yesterday they did not know assets were disappearing from the pension fund. Mr David Shaw MP asked the trustees if they had been told why Lord Donoughue resigned in July 1991 from the board of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-controlled company which managed most of the MGN scheme's investments. In December 1991, Lord Donoughue said publicly he resigned after Mr Maxwell refused to tell the trustees about BIM's stock lending. He said he believed it had been proper but was concerned it was occurring without his knowledge. 'Would you say that following vigorous exchanges, Robert Maxwell and Lord Donoughue appear to have come to an understanding that Lord Donoughue should leave the company in the full knowledge that something was wrong without blowing the whistle?' Mr Shaw asked Mr Ernest Burrington, a trustee of MGN's pension fund until Mr Maxwell's death. 'The answer must be yes,' Mr Burrington replied. In a letter from his solicitor in December 1991, Lord Donoughue said he became aware that BIM was lending stock without his knowledge and asked it to cease. By July, he asked Mr Maxwell to notify all pension fund trustees of its occurrence. He resigned two weeks later. Astonished MPs, Page 20 NatWest clash, Page 20</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Alexander Szandar and Rainer Poertner in Brussels; date not  given: "A Unique Opportunity"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Secretary General, the  nationalists and the fascists are gaining followers in Moscow  and old enemy images of the evil East are reemerging in the  West. Is a new Cold War emerging?    [Woerner] I hope that we can prevent this by means of a  policy that makes the available alternatives clear to Russia:  Either it continues the reforms and follows the path of  cooperation with us or it risks that the world becomes dark  again. NATO wants the first alternative and, together with  Russia, it wants to establish a new European security system.    [DER SPIEGEL] It seems likely that the frontlines will  become more rigid again. Fascist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is  threatening the Germans and others with complete destruction.    [Woerner] Even though Mr. Zhirinovskiy achieved a  considerable number of votes at the elections, he does not  determine the guidelines of Russian policy. These are still  determined by President Yeltsin, and he is not interested in  confrontation.    [DER SPIEGEL] He is also becoming increasingly aggressive  and nationalist in his statements.    [Woerner] We see that, too. However, one does not know to  what extent he is serious about that or just triying to  safeguard himself against the right. It is clear that close  cooperation, for which we are striving, is incompatible with the  revival of an expansionist Russian foreign policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] But it would probably help NATO to get out of  the identity crisis in which it has been mired since the  dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.    [Woerner] The NATO summit will prove that such a crisis does  not exist. The alliance has never been as popular as it is now.  There are many countries that want to get in, but no countries  that want to get out.    [DER SPIEGEL] There is a lot of quarreling about where NATO  is supposed to be heading. The British and the Americans want  to return to the origins as a purely military alliance. The  Germans see the alliance primarily as a political instrument to  stabilize Eastern Europe.    [Woerner] There will always be differences of opinion about  the course because we are a democratic alliance. I am sure that  the summit will confirm the classical role of the alliance and,  in addition, define two new ones. First, we need crisis  management and the safeguarding of peace beyond the NATO borders  and, second, the projection of stability toward the East.    [DER SPIEGEL] At the moment, the alliance offers a rather  miserable picture in this respect.    [Woerner] I strongly object! It is not a miserable picture  if one switches from confrontation to cooperation with all  former opponents within the period of just two years. This is a  virtually revolutionary change.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why did the alliance not seize the opportunity  when Yeltsin said in Warsaw in August that he is not against  NATO membership by the Poles, Hungarians, or Czechs?    [Woerner] We are acting in line with our own standards and  not on order. Furthermore, Yeltsin talks differently today than  in Warsaw. He has changed his course.    [DER SPIEGEL] And NATO promptly refuses to take in new  members.    [Woerner] Our course is determined by ourselves and not by  Mr. Yeltsin. I am energetically in favor of taking in some of  the states in Central and East Europe. They are so clearly part  of the West in cultural and historical terms that one must  anchor them there. This is our historic mission. I hope that  the alliance will resolve at the summit that it is basically  ready for expansion.    [DER SPIEGEL] There will neither be a schedule nor criteria  for new members. In reality, no one in the West is willing to  give security guarantees to Warsaw or Budapest at the moment --  especially not the nuclear power United States.    [Woerner] You are right: At the moment, we are not willing  to give a schedule or criteria for membership. There will be no  security guarantee at the summit. But, I think some countries  will get it over the course of time.    [DER SPIEGEL] There is only the question of when?    [Woerner] This remains open at the moment. The Americans --  whom you just mentioned -- are very serious about a security  guarantee, because if they give one, they fulfill it. However,  they are also certainly willing to expand the alliance -- but in  a way that does not offend the Russians.    [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, Moscow does have a veto right?    [Woerner] We do not give a veto right to anyone. However,  it is certainly understandable that we do not want to do  anything now that would promote a radicalization in Russia or  pushes the country out of a gradually growing Euro-Atlantic  community during a very sensitive period of history. History  and future generations would not forgive us for that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Therefore, NATO offers everyone who wants to  get into the alliance a lot of topical ointment, called  Partnership for Peace?    [Woerner] Why topical ointment? We offer a substantive  package of specific cooperation, with which some states can  prepare for membership without offending others.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your package is a fraud. It just contains  plans that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council had already  announced in December.    [Woerner] That is not true; we go far beyond that. First of  all, Partnership for Peace means making the doctrines and  defense structures and the budgets and operational concepts of  the partner states compatible with ours in such a way that this  will result in better cooperation or, under certain  circumstances, even membership.    This includes joint exercises and, selectively, joint  training. In my view, later on there will be technological  cooperation concerning equipment. I see a very broad range here  -- over a long period, of course.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Central and East Europeans think this is  too little; they feel left in the lurch by NATO.    [Woerner] It makes me angry that not only here but also in  East Europe people constantly talk in extremes. The issue is  not the wrong alternatives: security guarantee or security  vacuum. The security situation of these states has already  improved as a result of the current cooperation with the  Atlantic alliance. We have stated again and again that their  security is a matter close to our hearts. Anyone who thought of  touching them would have to think very thoroughly about what  reaction he would have to expect from the alliance.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you have understanding for Czech President  Vaclav Havel? He says: Nonexpansion by NATO at the moment  would be a fatal mistake, a giving in to chauvinist forces in  Russia and encouragement of imperial ambitions.    [Woerner] I understand Vaclav Havel's line of arguments. It  differs from mine only in some aspects. However, he exaggerates  the conclusions. On the contrary, we do not reject these  states. They can embark on the path that will one day lead to  membership.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does this offer apply to all states to the  east of the old NATO, including the still-nuclear power Ukraine  and the Baltic states? Lithuania has just formally requested  acceptance into the alliance.    [Woerner] Partnership for Peace is aimed at everyone who is  interested. There will come a time when we will differentiate.    [DER SPIEGEL] After all, the fear is that the European  continent will be divided into spheres of influence as in the  past: here NATO, there the former Soviet Union, and the rest  remains an unstable Europe in between?    [Woerner] NATO does not establish spheres of influence, nor  will it promote the establishment of such a sphere by others.  Our concept is cooperative security for all of Europe.    [DER SPIEGEL] A relapse into a policy of power and alliance  as in the last century is feared.    [Woerner] In contrast to the period at the beginning of this  century, now we have two international instigations that can  prevent the threatening relapse -- the European Union and the  Atlantic alliance. They are facing two historic tasks: first,  establishing the new overall Europe by including the largest  European power of today and tomorrow -- that is, a strategic  partnership with Russia; second anchoring the new democracies in  Central and East Europe in the structures of the West.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are these not very contradictory goals?    [Woerner] Why should this be mutually exclusive? Of course,  it is always the task of the statesman's skill to make sure that  both processes take place harmonically and are coordinated. For  this we need diplomatic skill, cautiousness, flexibility, but  also leadership. After all, the alternative is that this Europe  will fall apart and old categories of power policy will become  dominant again. We have a unique historical opportunity, which  one can also ruin or fail to seize.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do we absolutely need NATO and the Americans  for that?    [Woerner] Yes, they provide the geopolitical balance -- even  in a cooperative relationship with the Russians. On the other  hand, the alliance is necessary also for the current balance in  West Europe, because otherwise the old question: "Who controls  whom?" in Europe might occupy first place again.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you seriously believe that NATO and the  European Union will be able to master these tasks?    [Woerner] Who else?    [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the fact that even there the forces of  disintegration are growing?    [Woerner] I do not dream of denying that. In view of the  current historical transition periods and the disappearance of  the great enemy, the centrifugal trends are increasing. So far,  we have managed to come to grips with that, and I think that we  will be able to do that in the future as well.    [DER SPIEGEL] What is the strategic partnership between the  West and Moscow supposed to look like?    [Woerner] The alliance does not yet have a complete concept  for that. However, I can give you my personal opinion and cite  some elements of cooperation, which should be a part of it:  first, worldwide safeguarding of peace; second, the attempt to  prevent or master nuclear disasters; and third, preventing the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This will be an  enormously important field. For this purpose, one day we could  establish joint crisis control centers to counter future  threats, such as terrorism with nuclear or chemical weapons.    In addition, there should be more intensive strategic tasks  and the respective national security interests should be  respected, which should not be confused with the establishment  of spheres of influence.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not follow the proposal by  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that the NATO Cooperation  Council should be given far more authority, from consultations  in crises to the duty of assistance?    [Woerner] Even though the NATO Cooperation Council is being  developed further, the focus must not shift to it to such an  extent that the actual NATO would be just an appendage.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would this be so bad?    [Woerner] It would deprive the Cooperation Council of its  actual support. Many of our partners would oppose that. One  can ruin the alliance in two ways. Either one prevents it from  taking over new tasks in addition to its important task of  defending its own alliance area by military means or one turns  it into a collective security system just like the CSCE.    [DER SPIEGEL] Therefore, you are praising NATO as an  international peacemaker?    [Woerner] We have been that and we will remain that.    [DER SPIEGEL] How does that fit in with your constant  complaints that the alliance failed in its first operation  outside the alliance area, in the former Yugoslavia?    [Woerner] I have said that the international community has  failed. The alliance has only a modest share in that, because  then the Europeans were not able to come to grips with the  Balkan crisis; they did not turn to NATO but to the United  Nations. The United Nations still holds the responsibility.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the UN Security Council, it is precisely  the same states that have a say as in NATO.    [Woerner] You forget that there are still other influential  members. I only cite Russia and China.    [DER SPIEGEL] But they are not the ones that made a solution  to the conflict fail, but it was the different interests within  West Europe and the United States.    [Woerner] I would have to say a lot about that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Please do.    [Woerner] No, no. I do not want to pin the blame on one  single state. To my deepest regret, their international  community did not act in time and not energetically enough. We  could have prevented a lot of misery.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that after the disaster in  Yugoslavia and the experiences of the UN mission in Somalia, the  NATO states will once again manage to rustle up the political  will for major blue helmet operations?    [Woerner] I very much hope that they will learn the  appropriate lessons. There is no lack of that. I also hope  that the allies will not lose courage now to participate in well  thought-out, well-planned operations for safeguarding peace  under a unified command. Giving up would mean throwing out the  baby with the bath water.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Balkan war and Somalia have shown that  nothing goes when the Americans do not want it. Does NATO  dwindle to being the deputy sheriff of the United States?    [Woerner] If that, then the sheriff. But joking apart: The  United States is still playing -- thank God -- an important  role. Without American leadership very little is happening in  Europe -- at least up to now. On the other hand, in particular,  our summit will give the Europeans the opportunity to strengthen  their influence within the Atlantic alliance and, possibly, also  outside. There is only the question whether they will find the  strength and cohesiveness to seize this opportunity.    [DER SPIEGEL] For a long time, the Americans did not want  that.    [Woerner] Correct, but today they are interested in having  the burden eased by a Europe that is capable of action not only  politically but also militarily.    [DER SPIEGEL] Europe is still very far away from that.    [Woerner] As a European I say: unfortunately. But things  can get better.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Americans want to foist another task on  the alliance, namely stopping the proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction, if necessary by force.    [Woerner] Why do you say "foist"? Is it not in everyone's  interest to counter these dangers in time?    [DER SPIEGEL] We think that this is a problem that can be  better solved by politicians and diplomats than by the military.    [Woerner] Political and diplomatic efforts are certainly  most important. However, you cannot ignore the fact that  nuclear weapons and other mass destruction means continue to  proliferate in this world -- despite all the political and  diplomatic efforts. You cannot simply say that this is not also  a military problem. This would mean closing one's eyes to  reality.    [DER SPIEGEL] Should NATO send troops when the Libyans or  the Iranians develop nuclear weapons?    [Woerner] Just think of what would have happened if one had  not put a stop to Saddam Husayn. NATO must be permitted to  think about what is going to happen if such weapons were to be  used against its members and whether there is a financially  feasible protection, for instance, against individual missile  attacks.    [DER SPIEGEL] Who, specifically, is threatening NATO at the  moment?    [Woerner] There are a number of states that are acquiring  missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, or at  least intend to do so. I do not want to list them individually  here. Why not? Of course, I could name them, but I have no  intention of doing so.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Woerner, at a dinner in October, you told  the NATO defense ministers that you had to live solely on rice  and carrot juice. Are you now permitted to eat something more  substantial again?    [Woerner] May one not make a joke anymore? But if it  reassures you: yes. However, I will still have to remain on a  diet for some time. I feel okay with it and I think it helps.    [DER SPIEGEL] There were efforts to replace you earlier  because of your failing health.    [Woerner] The opposite is true. There were fears that I  would resign after the summit. However, I have been elected  until 1996, and I intend to work my full term of office --  provided God preserves my health.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Woerner, thank you for this interview.</p>

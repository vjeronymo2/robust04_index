And do you prefer one means to  another?    [Sa'id] As military men and a military organization we plan  our work, and we intend to win the battle for which we have  planned by every means. We are trying to apply all available  means to achieve victory. We are bound by what was mentioned in  our first statement on ways of toppling the regime and by what  was mentioned in the Democratic National Grouping's charter in  this connection. The charter stressed the need to topple the  regime by all available means, including civilian and military  means. Our job, as the grouping's military arm, is the latter.  In Sudan's history civilian means were used twice: once to  topple the regime of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim 'Abbud (1964) and (former  President Ja'far) Numayri (1985). The Army intervened after the  masses' participation. That scenario will continue.    The statement we addressed to the Sudanese forces inside the  country as the Legitimate Command of the Sudanese Army said that  we should work together to topple the regime. It means that,  since we addressed individuals carrying arms, these arms should  be used to topple the regime. Of course, it would be better if  the aim can be achieved through peaceful means. However,  individuals who are carrying arms can use these arms.    We do not expect our battle with the regime to be easy. And  we will use all our strength from both inside and outside the  Army, and we will use the people's factions in the capital and  the other cities to settle the final battle. We have our own  military plans, but I cannot talk about them. However, I can  say that we are about to topple the regime by all the means  available to us.    [Daw-al-Na'im] Are you coordinating in this connection with  the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM]?    [Sa'id] We discussed this coordination in the first meeting  with the movement's leader, Colonel John Garang, and his aides,  which was held in November 1990. There was a point which we had  to clarify, namely that we are the legitimate commanders of the  Armed Forces. And as you know, the movement is in a state of  war with the Armed Forces, whose commanders are supposed to be  us. Here comes the contradiction, because we do not want the  Armed Forces to be defeated by the movement while we are seeking  to topple the regime in Khartoum. This position was clear, and  the movement's leaders appreciated it. This leads us to stress  that we are not betraying the Armed Forces, revealing their  plans, or talking to the brothers in the SPLM about the points  of weakness or strength in the Army. We only discuss with them  coordination for the sake of toppling the regime, each side  using its own method. And we cannot stop them from continuing  the ongoing war, nor can they drag us into their war against the  regime. [passage omitted]    [Daw-al-Na'im] It is often said that any military attempt to  restore democracy in Sudan could turn into a civil war. Is that  what you want? And what guarantees are there to prevent that  happening?    [Sa'id] There is no possibility of civil war breaking out in  the event of a confrontation with the regime's forces. Against  whom is that civil war supposed to be fought. The regime arms  the militias to help it survive. It is the regime which is  calling for a war of that kind. But we are aware of that and do  not believe that a civil war is going to break out if we  confront the regime, even if this confrontation is military.  [passage omitted]    [Daw-al-Na'im] In your first statement you urged Sudanese  Army personnel to rebel against the regime, but that did not  happen....    [Sa'id] We urged officers and soldiers to support  legitimacy, not to rebel. Because they did rebel when they  joined President 'Umar al-Bashir, or when he deceived them. We  urged them to return to legitimacy, not to rebel again. As for  the scale of their response to our appeal, it cannot be  measured. However, we can talk about the reaction to this  appeal. This reaction was reflected in the strict surveillance  measures applied by the regime against officers and soldiers.  For example, it prevented them from leaving their units,  tightened security control over them, even inside their barracks  and homes, and prevented nonserving officers entering the  barracks to finalize some matters, as used to happen before.  And large-scale changes were made in the military leaderships  in the capital, with these being replaced by cadres from the  National Islamic Front. And officers whose loyalty was deemed  suspect were moved to the war zone in the south, and a large  number were dismissed. All this clarifies the scale of the  response, which did not crystallize clearly because the regime,  with all the capabilities at its disposal, managed to confront  this move. This is why I believe that the appeal we addressed  encountered a great response and can be exploited at any time.  The fact that we have not seen anything tangible does not  necessarily mean there is no response.    [Daw-al-Na'im] The information available to the media says  that no serving officers have joined you, and that all members  of the organization are nonserving officers.    [Sa'id] A small number of serving officers have joined us.  And I cannot say that there is a large number of them. The  reason for that is the extensive measures taken by the  government.    [Daw-al-Na'im] A special court is currently looking into the  case of the bombings which the government says were part of a  plan to undermine stability and overthrow the regime. What is  your link with that operation?    [Sa'id] We did not have any involvement in the so-called  bombing case. I do not deny that we know some of the defendants  in the case. And of course, the regime was bound to associate  our relationship with these defendants and the case in order to  prove our involvement. By virtue of my 25-year experience in  the Engineer Corps I cannot plan a naive operation like that,  because it is difficult to obtain explosives from outside the  country and there is a lack of them inside. [passage omitted]    [Daw-al-Na'im] Have you carried out any military actions  against the regime over the past four years?    [Sa'id] We have not carried out any action that satisfies  our aspiration. We have planned actions, but they have not been  carried out for one reason or another. We know that four years  is a long time and causes boredom for those who would  participate in actions of that kind. But the circumstances are  not helpful. We are discussing the possibility of taking action  with our own capabilities. International conditions and the  opposition's circumstances are responsible for this situation.  We have not had a base from which to act, or sufficient aid.  And I believe that all these obstacles will soon disappear.  And I am optimistic that the regime will be toppled by an armed  action, and that all aid will arrive soon.    [Daw-al-Na'im] A disagreement erupted inside your  organization recently. What is the nature of the differences,  and what is the scale of the split?    [Sa'id] The nature of military political action requires a  degree of flexibility -- which sometimes leads to the  intervention of some parties, hence the disagreements. Like  other political forces, we have not been spared that disease.  However, thank God, our brothers in the military establishment  who differed with us joined the Legitimate Command willingly,  and they have offered a great deal. So the discipline exists,  regardless of our differences. Military discipline exists and  we respect one another. The disagreement needed to be tacked  and, thank God, has been contained.

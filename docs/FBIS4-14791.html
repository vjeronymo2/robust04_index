			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Ingush President Ruslan  Aushev called on Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and the chairmen of both houses of Russian  parliament to "take urgent and effective measures to normalise  the situation and restore law and order in the region" in order  to "prevent a new and more bloody conflict between the peoples."    The appeal said that in March 1994 the situation in the zone  of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict had worsened sharply and  continued to deteriorate. The Ingush leadership blames the  Ossetian side and believes that the work to "heighten tension in  the region is well organised and guided."    A crowd twice stopped an Ingush funeral procession which  headed for the cemetery in the village of Krasta in the Prigorod  district of North Ossetia on Wednesday. The arrival of Vladimir  Lozovoy, head of the temporary administration, and four generals  did not stop them from attacking the procession with stones.  Many were injured, several cars were damaged.    Meanwhile, the North Ossetian parliament extended on  Thursday  the state of emergency in the Prigorod, Pravoberezhniy and  Mozdok districts for another two months. No decision to this  effect has been adopted by the Russian president or the  Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament, so  far.</p>

Zakharenko, </F> plant protection division, RASKhN: ``Under Discussion in the  Russian Academy'']    [Text] In light of the abrupt decline in industrial  production of pesticides and microbiological plant protection  resources, the plant protection division of the RASKhN [Russian  Academy of Agricultural Sciences] raised the question ``On the  Status, Prospects for Development and Organization of Low-Volume  Regional Production of Microbiological Plant Protection  Resources'' before the bureau and the presidium of the RASKhN.  It was discussed thoroughly on 28 September and 15 October 1992  respectively.    Organizing regional production of microbiological resources  for Russia is important in connection with the departure of the  Progress Plant (Kazakhstan), the Zaporozhye and Novgorod-Volyn  (Ukraine) and Ungeny (Moldova) plants, and some scientific  research institutions--the VNIIBMZR [All-Union Scientific  Research Institute for the Biological Method of Plant  Protection] (Moldova), and the VNIIGINTOKS [All-Union Scientific  Research Institute of Hygiene and Toxins] and the Biotekhnika  VNIITs [All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Ecology  Center] (Ukraine)--to other sovereign states, resulting in a  worsening of scientific support and deliveries of  biopreparations. Given an annual demand of 35,000-40,000 tonnes,  Russian agriculture receives 10,000 tonnes from biological  plants and laboratories and uses biopreparations over an area  5.5-6 million ha, corrected to a single application per ha--that  is, only around 5 percent of the area of plowland and perennial  plantations.    Under the conditions of a market economy, in the absence of  proper consideration of natural and economic conditions and the  health of plants on agricultural land, the monopoly on  industrial production of biopreparations has been found to be  insufficiently effective. Difficulties in determining marketing  strategy and studying the demand for biopreparations resulted in  the fact that even with extremely low production volumes, unsold  biopreparations that are losing their potency have accumulated  at warehouses of Russia's sole plant in Berd, and at warehouses  of the Selkhozkhimiya Association.    The noted shortcomings of monopolistic, large-scale  industrial production could be surmounted by combining it with  more-flexible regional production adapted to local conditions  and producing in low volumes. The concept of such production was  developed by scientists of the Russian Agricultural Academy, the  Ministry of Agricultural Production, the Russian Ministry of  Health and specialists of the GKNT [State Committee for Science  and Technology]. The planning and establishment of low-volume  production on standard equipment using standard procedures in  industrial-type biological enterprises is proposed by this  concept.    The scientific and organizational groundwork for reaching  these objective has been laid in Russia.    1. Scientific institutions working in the field of plant  protection have developed new, promising preparations  corresponding to or exceeding the best foreign analogues in  their effectiveness, and the technical conditions of their  production and use were developed on the basis of the results of  research carried out within the framework of the  ``Biopesticide'' project of the GNTP [State Scientific-Technical  Program?] ``Agricultural Production Processes of the Future,''  and within the framework of fundamental and priority applied  programs. For example jointly with other organizations the VIZR  developed mikoafidin T, entoks, afidol, verticillin M and  aleytsid, which are highly effective in protecting plants from  aphids, the spider mite and whiteflies; alerin B and C for  protection against agents of root rot, blight, fuserial head  blight and powdery mildew. These preparations have no analogues  in world plant protection practice.    2. Original procedures have been developed for making fungal  preparations--boverin, verticillin, trichodermin and rizoplan,  bacterial preparations based on Bacillus turingiensis  baktorodentsid, and viral preparations. Production procedures  have been introduced in biological production laboratories. In  particular, trichodermin is being produced by 90 laboratories,  verticillin by 35, and boverin by 5 with a production volume of  up to 5 tonnes. However, the absence of equipment is reducing  the quality of the procedures for producing the biopreparations.    3. Experimental industrial production of practically all  known means of obtaining biopreparations (subsurface,  surface-subsurface, surface) on standard equipment at pilot  plants using progressive procedures is being perfected.  Production of metabolite preparations is being organized at the  Etoks Experimental Production Enterprise (St. Petersburg),  production of the biopreparations alerin B and alerin C obtained  by a subsurface procedure is being organized at the Shchelkovo  Biological Works (Moscow Oblast), and production of preparations  obtained by a subsurface-surface procedure is being organized at  an experimental production operation of the VNIIF [All-Union  Scientific Research Institute of Phytopathology] (Moscow Oblast).    Production of viral and microsporidial preparations (out of  parasitic protozoans) is to begin in 1993 at experimental plants  of the SK NIIF [not further identified] and the VNIIF;  production of preparations consisting of entomopathogenic  nematodes and their symbiotic bacteria (nemobakt) is to begin at  the Kolpino EPP [not further identified] (Leningrad Oblast).    Pilot facilities were introduced in 1992 at the Kolpino EPP  to perfect production of mikoafidin and entoks out of  entomopathogenic fungi for use against aphids; of aleytsid and  verticillin against the orange whitefly at the Leto PNO [not  further identified] (Leningrad Oblast); of the viral preparation  virin-GYaP against the coddling moth at the SK NIIF; of  trichodermin in the city of Kirshi (Leningrad Oblast).    Experimental industrial production of the indicated  preparations at pilot facilities is the first phase of  establishing standard low-volume production of microbiological  plant protection resources.    4. Seventy-nine biolaboratories, 13 biofactories, 41 oblast  plant protection station shops, 159 greenhouse laboratories, 56  farm and interfarm laboratories, 13 small enterprises and 10  cooperatives are functioning within the Ministry of Agricultural  Production. The Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production has  begun the work of providing modern equipment for low-volume  production of biopreparations to biolaboratories and  biofactories. In 1992 the Sochi, Voronezh, Krasnodar, Mary and  Kirov biolaboratories were equipped with fermenters with  capacities of up to 1 m[.sup]3[/], separators, and other  equipment for the production of liquid fungal and bacterial  preparations. This work would have been more effective, had  there been closer contact between specialists and scientists of  the Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production and the Russian  Agricultural Academy, and had they carried out coordinated  programs.    The presidium of the Russian Agricultural Academy has  determined the direction of scientific and technical support to  organizing regional low-volume production of microbiological  plant protection resources. Reaching scientific objectives in  stages was proposed within the framework of the GNTP  ``Agricultural Production Processes of the Future'' and the  ``Plant Protection'' sector program of fundamental research. And  namely:     -  conducting marketing research to substantiate the demand  for microbiological resources for agriculture, and feasibility  studies on low-volume production and its location;    -  searching for and creating promising strains of  microorganisms  producing microbiological plant protection resources, and  developing new preparations on their basis;    -  developing the principles of creating all-purpose mechanized  lines (units, modules) for large-scale breeding of insects;    -  creating genetic selection methods of selecting fungal  producer  strains that would work under the conditions of subsurface  fermentation;    -  creating artificial nutrient media for entomopathogenic  microorganisms;    -  developing the methods and principles of  creating optimum preparative forms;    -  developing regulations on  producing new microbiological resources adapted to regional  production of agricultural crops;    -  improving and creating  commercial forms of biopreparations intended for specific  purposes--for seed treatment, for plant spraying and for soil  application;    -  developing methods by which to assess the quality of  microbiological resources, and unified standards in application  to regional production;    -  planning individual, basic and standard  models of regional low-volume production operations;    -  developing  ecological and economic criteria of using microbiological  preparations and regional procedures of their use.       Fundamental research aimed at finding microbiological  resources is to be continued in scientific research institutes  of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Ministry of  Health, as is applied experimental design work aimed at creating  microbiological preparations at the State Scientific Research  Institute of Applied Microbiology.    There are plans for supporting specific financing of  fundamental research aimed at creating experimental industrial  low-volume production operations, and for revamping the research  base and developing experimental industrial facilities for  low-volume production operations in the VIZR, VNIIF and SK NIIF.

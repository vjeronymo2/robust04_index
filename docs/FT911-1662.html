			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Nikolai Demidenko - Wigmore Hall Sternly impressive and evidently tireless, this pianist delivered a well-filled programme last night. Enterprising, too: for such a virtuoso to begin with three of Chopin's early, slighter polonaises was bold, even if the great Polonaise-Fantaisie was to follow, but to play both Liszt's Variations on 'Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen' and the ferocious Scherzo and March after the interval looked like tempting fate. It wasn't, of course - there is no doubt that Demidenko can play absolutely anything, and for as long as you like. It is unusual for a performer of such strength and lethal attack to be a remarkable colourist too. Each of those early polonaises had its own delicate tints, even the sturdier middle one (the posthumous no. 16 in G-flat), and in their lacy precision there was no hint of a mailed fist waiting to crash through. Some honest winsomeness wouldn't have come amiss: salon charm is half the point of this music, and Demidenko's lovely effects were very sober. With the Polonaise-Fantaisie he established a far broader scale and drew its elusive curves in long trajectories. It was hugely refined, but not actually exciting (which may perhaps be right). Two or three of Prokofiev's twenty Visions fugitives were too extravagantly brilliant not to be exciting; but for the most part their glint was cool and crystalline, without mischief or irony. That may be right too, as Prokofiev's chosen epigraph - Balmont on 'rainbow colours' - suggests, and certainly Demidenko's range of controlled hues was fascinating. He uses the pedal with rare imagination. Chorales eventually turn up in both the Liszt pieces mentioned, and he found deep, weird sonorities for them; I haven't heard their like. In the endless Variations he shifted instantly to a new sound for almost every one, never dropping a stitch - and, as in the diabolical Scherzo and March, with the wayward forms of the music kept rigorously taut. The latter piece is saturnine and baleful to the point of parody, and more than any other music here it seemed to satisfy Demidenko's temperament perfectly. Yet between these monstrous pieces he placed 'Francis of Assisi Preaching to the Birds': breathlessly soft and feathery, no inapposite glitter in the places where pianists generally can't resist it. Amid that marvellous texture, the Saint's gentle sermon was sculpted with devotion - but without conveying anything much like tenderness. I bet Liszt used to wring everybody's withers with it. Demidenko is a disconcertingly cool customer.</p>

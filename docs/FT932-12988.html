			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Norway gas talks may hit impasse TALKS between Britain and Norway resume today on the ratification of a NKr20bn (Pounds 1.89bn) gas import deal agreed two years ago amid fears that they may have reached an impasse, Karen Fossli writes. The deal involves National Power, the electricity generator, buying 2.2bn cu m of gas over 15 years from the mid-1990s from GFU, Norway's gas negotiating committee. National Power wants the gas to fuel two power stations to produce 1,300MW of electricity. The deal would require an amendment to a treaty to allow new gas to flow through the Frigg pipeline which runs between the Norwegian North Sea Frigg gas field and St Fergus in Aberdeenshire.</p>

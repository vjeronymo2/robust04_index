			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Turkish Karabakh call TURKEY has called for the United Nations Security Council to intervene in Nagorno-Karabakh, amid intensified fighting in the disputed Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan. Under growing domestic pressure to side with the Moslem Azeris, Turkey warned Armenia not to make any move to redraw the borders, following reports of the fall of the last Azeri stronghold. The latest fighting shatters a ceasefire brokered by Iran and signed in Tehran on Friday by Azerbaijani President Yagub Mamedov and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosian. Officials confirmed Turkey had sent a letter to the UN after making a strong comment on the conflict, which has claimed more than 1,500 lives over the past four years. 'We want the UN to send observers to Nagorno-Karabakh and start working on a ceasefire. . . The Republic of Turkey will not accept the redrawing of the borders by the use of force,' said Mr Erdal Inonu, Turkey's deputy prime minister, after an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday. Turkey's warning follows renewed hostilities over the weekend and news that Armenian forces had taken control of Shusha, a strategic Azeri town overlooking the regional capital Stepanakert. Azerbaijan said yesterday it was battling to retake the town, in the mountainous Caucasian region.</p>

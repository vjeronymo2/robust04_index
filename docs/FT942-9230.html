			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Whitbread Having restructured its capital in a way that would permit it to raise equity on the market, Whitbread has ironically ended up with virtually no gearing. Though yesterday's results were in line with expectations, the 2 per cent fall in its share price may reflect the company's reticence about how it intends to use this balance sheet strength. Capital spending will increase by around Pounds 100m a year, allowing the group to capture continuing growth from its hotels and pub retailing businesses. But the extra outlay will simply prevent Whitbread from piling up cash; it will not absorb its considerable borrowing capacity. The questions are thus whether and when the market will start to show sustained signs of impatience. There are grounds for suggesting Whitbread can afford to wait. The cash inflow from the sale of its regional brewing stakes will not dilute earnings this year. Growth elsewhere will continue to offset weakness in brewing. The decision not to buy Chef &amp; Brewer shows an aversion to over-paying for acquisitions. With Sir Michael Angus and Mr Peter Jarvis at the helm, Whitbread promises sensible and well-articulated strategic decisions. Just the same there is a worrisome hint of drift. Whitbread says it wants to remain in brewing, which generates a lot of cash. But transfer pricing changes will reduce the stated return on brewing and may make other parts of the business more attractive targets for investment. Strategic dithering will make the comparison with Scottish &amp; Newcastle doubly unflattering if the latter's acquisition of Chef &amp; Brewer turns out to be an unqualified success.</p>

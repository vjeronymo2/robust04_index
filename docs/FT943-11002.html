			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Enforcement of EC directives clarified  -European Court The European Court has clarified the rights enjoyed by individuals when a member country fails to implement a directive within the prescribed time limit. Where the provision in the directive is sufficiently precise and unconditional, it may be enforced in two ways by a national court. An individual may enforce directly such provisions only against the state or emanations of the state. Individuals may not rely directly on provisions of a non-implemented directive against other private parties. But, in the latter instance, national courts must interpret national laws as far as possible to achieve the result envisaged by a directive in its wording and objective. The ruling was given in the context of proceedings in Florence brought by Miss Paola Faccini Dori to set aside a court order requiring her to pay for an English language course she had been sold on Milan central station on 19 January 1989. As a consumer who had bought the language course away from the seller's premises she had renounced the contract after a few days relying on the 1985 directive on contracts made away from business premises. The directive provided that such contracts must be subject to a cooling-off period of at least seven days. The directive, which should have been implemented by December 23 1987, had not yet been transposed into Italian law. The Italian courts asked the ECJ whether the relevant provisions of the directive could be relied upon by one private party against another provided they were sufficiently precise and unconditional to be enforceable by an individual against the state. The Court first held the directive's provisions were unconditional and sufficiently precise to be enforced directly in a national court by an individual against the state. The ECJ then held that the reasons for allowing an individual to enforce rights conferred by a directive against the state or public authority could not be extended to permit enforcement against another private party. The reasons were member countries must not be allowed to take advantage of their own infringement of Community law to the detriment of private citizens. The Court refused to extend this case law to situations involving two private parties since it would mean the Community had been empowered to create immediate obligations for private parties by means of a directive. The Court held such a power can be exercised only where the Community is competent under the Rome treaty to issue a regulation (which has general and directly binding application). Under the treaty, directives were only binding on the objective to be achieved but left the member countries a discretion as to how that was done. But the Court emphasised national courts must interpret any applicable national law so as to achieve the purpose of a directive to the fullest extent possible, even when national law predates the directive. The ECJ also confirmed the principles established in its leading decisions on national courts' enforcement of Community law. (Von Colson, Marleasing and Miret). It explained that where the result intended by a directive may not be achieved through interpretation of national law, member countries are obliged to compensate individuals for any damage they have caused through a failure to implement a directive (Francovich). Three conditions must be satisfied: the directive must envisage that rights be conferred on individuals; the contents of the rights must be identifiable from the wording of the directive; and there must be a causal link between breach of the obligation and the damage suffered. In the case in question, the ECJ said there was no doubt the directive on contracts negotiated away from business premises conferred rights on individuals; the minimum extent of those rights could be identified from the directive's wording. The Court indicated, in the event of damage to a consumer which could be shown to have been caused by the member country's breach of its obligations to implement the directive, the national court must guarantee the right of consumers so damaged to obtain compensation according to national law on liability.

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Resources wasted through energy policy Sir, Mr David Porter's call for more competition in the European Energy market is to be welcomed (Letters, August 31). However let us hope that moves to introduce more competition take account of the grave defects of energy deregulation as witnessed in the UK since electricity privatisation. The UK experience has seen the introduction of a system that gave the generators a broad portfolio of generating plant but no guaranteed market, and the regional electric companies secure markets but no plant. The commercial decisions that stemmed from this - the dash for gas - effectively did for the UK coal industry because, although in the main cheaper than gas, the generators' mark-up rendered purchase from this source by the regional electricity companies unattractive. Valuable coal resources and coal generating plant have been squandered on the back of this policy to the detriment of the consumer. Similarly, let us hope that any moves to greater energy price transparency in the European Union allows for equal treatment between fuels, as compared to the UK situation where the government's regime provides a substantial and anti-competitive subsidy to nuclear energy through the non-fossil fuel levy. Indeed, this leads to the sad fact that the UK purchases French nuclear electricity at substantially higher costs to the consumer than would be the case without the non-fossil fuel levy.

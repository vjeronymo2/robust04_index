			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Beijing to step up Gatt drive China this week steps up its efforts to secure crucial US backing for its membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade during talks to be held in Geneva. Mr Long Yongtu, China's Gatt negotiator, said Beijing's latest package presented in talks last month with the Americans contained significant concessions, especially in the proposed phasing out of non-tariff barriers on agricultural products. Officials in Beijing are describing as 'crunch time' the latest round of discussions on China's application to re-enter Gatt and become a founder member of its successor body, the World Trade Organisation. The US, which has been entrusted with responsibility for negotiating terms for China's Gatt entry, has said Beijing still has some distance to go before it fulfils requirements. US official have been focusing on the 'national treatment' issues under which Gatt contracting parties are expected to accord one another similar market access privileges. American negotiators have been complaining about China's reluctance to agree to a timetable for reciprocal access to such areas as services, including banking and insurance. The US wants to avoid repeating what is known as the 'Japanese mistake' under which the US contends that Tokyo was allowed into the world trading body on 'soft terms' enabling it to maintain its closed trading system. China last month presented a 900-page proposal for discussions with US officials. Negotiations are expected to last through October. Western officials doubt negotiations can be completed in time for Beijing to be a founder member of the WTO, if that body comes into effect as planned at the beginning of 1995. But China, which was an inaugural member of Gatt in 1949 before withdrawing in 1950 after the communists came to power, is insisting that its growing weight as a trade power makes it imperative that it be admitted to the world trading body. Mr Long, a vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, said China's new Gatt package included undertakings to phase out the remaining 784 items covered by non-tariff controls. He said China was not seeking special privileges in the new world trading system. Beijing has proposed that as a developing country it be allowed a transition phase to tailor its economy to Gatt requirements. The US has shown little enthusiasm for this proposal, but is expected to agree to such an arrangement in the end.</p>

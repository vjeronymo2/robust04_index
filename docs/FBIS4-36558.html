			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 9 Jun (MENA)--Sudanese Foreign Minister  Husayn Abu-Salih has affirmed the depth of Egyptian-Sudanese  relations and the importance of maintaining these relations at  the proper level to benefit the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples.    In an exclusive interview with MENA in Tunis, where he is  attending the meetings of the OAU Ministerial Council, Abu-Salih  said that at times this relationship becomes strained or tense.  This is the case now, when it has reached a "saddening" level,  but we must do everything possible to maintain this relationship  at an appropriate level.    The Sudanese minister stressed that the issues under dispute  between the two countries, including Hala'ib, are quite simple;  finding a solution to this issue will be much simpler than  anyone expects.    Abu-Salih criticized the media in the two countries, saying  that the media should be positive instead of indulging in  vituperations that do not serve the two countries' interest.    He said that the current tension between Egypt and Sudan was  caused by the two countries' foreign ministers failure to hold a  meeting as scheduled. He underlined the need to hold this  meeting in Khartoum "to demonstrate the Sudanese Government's  stand to the Sudanese public."    He expressed full confidence that he and Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa will work together to resolve all the  disputes between the two countries. He stressed the need for  confidence between the two countries and for this not to be  hampered by "some simple events, such as when Khartoum Province  took over some houses that belong to Egyptians there." He said  that the image of the Sudanese Government must be changed.    Speaking about the Hala'ib problem, Abu-Salih said: We do  not want to complicate this problem, because the relationship  between Egypt and Sudan is too great to allow this issue to move  from a "bilateral framework into international forums."</p>

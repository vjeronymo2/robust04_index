			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (1): Trembling monoliths - Unprecedented changes are occurring in the supply of electricity in Europe. Public utilities are being forced to produce power more cleanly and efficiently, and to clean up their commercial act by giving up their cosy monopoly status EUROPE'S power companies are coming under increasing, and probably unstoppable, pressure to compete. They are also having to manage their businesses under unprecedented public scrutiny. Europe's growing population not only wants its utility companies to provide better services but also wants a bigger role in decisions affecting that provision. Later this year France will engage in a public debate on energy. Germany is already in search of a political consensus on nuclear power which, once attained, will have profound implications for the future of coal. The UK government, having hurriedly produced a coal review after a public outcry over mines closures, will launch a nuclear review later this year. In these debates, and others going on throughout Europe, environmental considerations will play a far larger role than they would have done in previous decades. The Rio de Janeiro earth summit last year set a series of targets which are forcing countries and their electricity companies to re-think the balance of fuels which go into the electricity market, with gas playing an increasing role and coal facing inexorable decline. To help cope with all these changes, electricity companies cannot rely on the large volume growth that has sustained them in previous decades. In east Europe demand is depressed by the closure of uneconomic industries and expected growth in consumer consumption will have to await economic recovery. Western Europe can look forward to only limited growth. According to the International Energy Agency, an arm of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, electricity growth in industrialised countries is likely to be around 2 to 2.6 per cent a year for the rest of the decade. Faced with stagnant markets in their own countries, companies are looking abroad. In Britain, where the most significant progress towards liberalisation has been achieved, electricity companies plan significant expansion outside their national boundaries. National Power plans to invest Pounds 1bn abroad by the end of the century. PowerGen is part of a consortium which is close to winning a contract to build a 400 megawatt power station in east Germany. In other examples of trans-European investment, RWE, the German utility, in May bought a 4 per cent stake in Endesa, the Spanish company which had previously bought 2 per cent of its shares. Last year Tractebel of Belgium bought a 3 per cent stake in Iberdrola, Spain's second largest electricity company. The aim is for joint ventures and pooling research resources, rather than mergers. Nonetheless such alliances are likely to grow as the European electricity market is opened up for greater competition and provides greater opportunities for investment. The pressure to liberalise comes from an alliance of politicians and large industrial companies who no longer see the production of electricity as a natural monopoly and who believe that more competition can result in lower prices. Although its more radical measures are fervently resisted in some countries, it is strongly backed by the European Commission. Trade in electricity between European countries already exists and indeed has grown to about 10 per cent of the total in recent years. But it is invariably between one state and another. Electricity companies which want to sell power to industrial companies in another country find it virtually impossible. Those pressing for liberalisation say the barriers are erected by monopolies, to protect their markets. The industry says it is a special case. Unlike virtually all other commodities, electricity cannot be stored. This, together with its strategic importance for each country, makes it unsuitable for the normal laws of the market which other industries have to face, say the producers. The main issue which divides the community is 'third party access', a means of giving companies a right to the use of another country's electricity network to sell to industrial companies. Opposition from utilities, backed by their governments, has forced the Commission to reconsider earlier plans. It is considering measures which would force companies to justify why they refuse another company access. Meanwhile, the debate appears to have softened the attitude of virtually all the players. France, whose Electricite de France is the most obvious monopoly, is likely to consider in its energy review this year whether liberalisation steps should be adopted. But liberalisation is by no means confined to the European Community. Norway three years ago introduced market reforms which allowed electricity consumers to buy directly from producers and which made it more difficult for municipalities to use their electricity interests to finance other activities. Prices have fallen since. In Finland, measures have been adopted to ensure that Ivo, a state-owned company which makes about 40 per cent of the country's electricity, does not cross-subsidise its generating and engineering businesses from the grid system which it owns. Ivo hopes to be privatised in the next few years, in part so that it will be able, with private capital behind it, to play a larger part in the European electricity market. Attempts to throw off state shackles are also being made in countries previously dominated by the Soviet Union. Russia is looking at allowing private sector, including foreign, funds to help build the electricity sector. The Czech Republic has already decided it needs foreign aid to develop its industry. CEZ, the dominant Czech producer which was partially privatised through the sale of 30 per cent of its capital last year, estimates it needs to invest Dollars 5.7bn in the next few years, and can only do so if foreign funds are tapped. Although investment in new plant accounts for much of the total, about Dollars 1.9bn is needed to pay for air pollution equipment demanded by stricter environmental laws. This highlights a problem for all electricity companies, particularly those with a high coal burn. Environmental problems are most acute in east Europe, where governments and companies are having to cope with years of neglect by their predecessors. Enormous question marks hang over the safety of nuclear power stations built with Soviet technology; and big bills are accruing on the mess caused by the failure to clean up after opencast mining, particularly of lignite coal. The cost of cleaning up after lignite mines in east Germany, for example, is about DM30bn. This consideration, together with problems over sulphur and carbon dioxide emissions, is behind a move away from coal in some European countries, notably the UK. In the UK the move is helped by plentiful supplies of gas. Other countries are less fortunate. States formerly in the political shadow of the Soviet Union are reluctant to commit themselves to gas imported from Russia, because they want to loosen their ties with that country and because of fears about its political instability. It was partly for that reason that the Czech Republic this year chose to go ahead with building a second nuclear plant in spite of public fears following the Chernobyl accident. Other countries, including Germany and Spain, will not even allow some of their already constructed nuclear plants to make electricity, let alone build new ones.</p>

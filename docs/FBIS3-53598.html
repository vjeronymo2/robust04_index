			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Position That Needs Implementation"] </F>   [Text] We strongly welcome the U.S.-Russian statement  emanating from the Clinton-Yeltsin summit in Moscow yesterday.  The statement emphasized the eagerness of the cosponsors of the  Middle East peace conference to realize just, comprehensive, and  lasting peace in the region on the basis of international  legitimacy resolutions led by Resolutions 242 and 338 and the  principle of land for peace.    The importance of the statement lies in the fact that it was  made on the eve of the summit between U.S. President Clinton and  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, which will be held in Geneva  tomorrow. Political circles attach much importance to this  meeting in paving the way for serious and substantial progress  in the faltering peace process. Also, the meeting comes in the  wake of the ongoing problems facing the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations on implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza  and Jericho.    The statement's emphasis on the principle of just and  comprehensive peace based on Security Council Resolutions 242  and 338 clarifies the course of the peace process on all its  tracks. These tracks are facing Israeli rejection and maneuvers  regarding a comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue.  Israel evades commitment to Resolutions 242 and 338, which call  for its full withdrawal from all occupied territories, including  Jerusalem, and recognition of the Palestinian people's  legitimate right to self-determination on their soil.    Israel's attempts to evade its commitment to this principle,  and its positions that conflict with the Declaration of  Principles it signed with the PLO which calls for full Israeli  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and its attempt to deprive the  self-rule areas and their crossing points of any vestiges of  Palestinian sovereignty are the strongest evidence of Israel's  intentions and rejection of a comprehensive solution and the  international and legal terms of reference of such a solution,  as well as its contempt for the cosponsors of the peace  conference and the peace process as a whole.    If we take into consideration Israel's despicable rejection  of even declaring commitment to withdraw fully from the occupied  Syrian Golan, its placing of impossible conditions on the  negotiations on the Syrian track, and its insistence that  Damascus should define its concept of peace, we will conclude  that Rabin's government is following a policy of maneuvering and  deception regarding the achievement of serious progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track. Israel is also placing similar conditions  on Lebanon to obstruct implementation of Security Council  Resolution 425, which calls for immediate withdrawal from  occupied southern Lebanon.    Therefore, the U.S.-Russian statement is a positive prelude  to the Clinton-al-Asad meeting in Geneva tomorrow, which will  establish the bases for activating an effective and influential  U.S. role in forcing Israel to heed the will of the  international community, UN resolutions, and the principles on  the basis of which the Madrid peace conference was held, and to  which the cosponsors were committed, and which they emphasized  in their latest statement.    The Arabs are not prepared to relinquish their land and  rights after they have offered all they can to render the peace  process successful. Washington and Moscow should not be  satisfied with mere statements, and should play their role as  cosponsors of this process, otherwise, the statement will be no  more than worthless ink on paper.</p>

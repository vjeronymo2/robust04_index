			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Decision due on Afrikaner 'homeland' SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional negotiators are today expected to decide whether to grant the right-wing Conservative party's demand for Afrikaner self-determination. Police kept up pressure on the right yesterday by arresting 21 people in connection with last Friday's armed siege of the constitutional conference centre. If the 26-party negotiating forum rejects the Conservative party's demand for a separate Afrikaner homeland - or at least a highly autonomous Afrikaner state within a federal South Africa - the party may quit constitutional negotiations permanently. The decision to pull out could be taken today or later in the week when the 208-delegate Negotiating Forum meets. Such a decision could prove a turning point in South African politics. The heavily armed and well organised white right has made clear that it would fight for an Afrikaner homeland, if it cannot achieve their demands through negotiation. Last night right-wingers were threatening retaliation after police said they had arrested 21 members of right wing groups. They refused to name those detained, but said more arrests - up to 300 - could be expected. However the African National Congress condemned the action as insufficient. It demanded the arrest of the protest leaders: Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, Conservative party leader, Mr Eugene Terreblanche, head of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), and Gen Constand Viljoen, Afrikaner Volksfront leader. Police said Mr Terreblanche - who openly led his men in the destruction on Friday - was not being sought. They said it was difficult to identify his role, despite the fact that hundreds of witnesses watched him lead the way as an AWB armoured car drove through the glass front of the conference centre. The government and the ANC are clearly keen to prevent a Conservative party walkout from the talks, fearing right-wing radicals could jeopardise a future constitution. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, said in a television interview: 'We are prepared to concede enough powers to regions to exercise some form of self-rule' but he stressed that the ANC could not accept a racist state.</p>

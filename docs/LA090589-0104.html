			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Steelers, who open their season at home against the Cleveland  Browns Sunday, haven't even been able to get around the Rolling Stones.  </P> <P> The Stones' first Pittsburgh concert in 17 years Wednesday night means the  Steelers won't be able to practice in Three Rivers Stadium until Friday.  </P> <P> "It's a distraction and a hardship from our normal practice routine," said Joe  Gordon, the team's business manager. "This is the first time since Three Rivers  opened (in 1970) that I can remember this happening the week of the home  opener."  </P> <P> Until then, the Steelers will practice on their nearby grass practice field,  which they normally use only when they play teams with natural turf fields.  </P></p>

A PRENSA LATINA dispatch explains  that in a climate of friendship, the two leaders came out in  favor of strengthening the movement of nonaligned countries and  increasing South-South cooperation.    Nujoma termed the U.S. blockade against Cuba unfair behavior  that lacks justification since the end of the Cold War. He  stressed that the peoples of Namibia and Cuba have much in  common.    Windhoek and Havana signed an important trade agreement  Friday. After having met with Roberto Robaina, whose African  tour also included Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, 15  Namibian businessmen will be traveling to Havana soon to explore  investment possibilities.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cemex buys second Spanish group CEMENTOS Mexicanos (Cemex), the world's fourth-largest cement producer, is to buy Spain's second-largest cement group, Sanson, for Dollars 600m. The deal comes just two weeks after Cemex agreed to the Dollars 1.25bn purchase of Valenciana de Cementos, the biggest cement producer in Spain. With combined sales of 8.1m tonnes, Sanson and Valenciana together would be one of the six largest producers in Europe. Spain is Europe's third most important cement market. The two deals give the Mexican buyer about 28 per cent of the Spanish market and dominance along the Levante, in Catalonia, Madrid and the Canary Islands. Sanson is the cement-making arm of the Banesto banking group's industrial offshoot. Banesto has been selling assets vigorously over the past year, and last month it signed an option to sell its 62 per cent interest in Sanson to Apax, an affiliate of a Geneva-based holding company, Unifund. At the same time, Banesto mounted a public takeover for the 30 per cent of Sanson that trades in the Spanish markets. Cemex yesterday acquired the Apax option and will buy from Banesto those minority shares that accept the Banesto bid. Cemex shares fell 4 per cent in Mexico after the announcement of the deal. Cemex is paying for Sanson through a Dollars 600m bridging loan provided by JP Morgan. This would be refinanced through a Dollars 200m payment from Cemex; a Dollars 90m private placement of shares in Sanson and/or Valenciana to Apax; the sale of around Dollars 100m in Sanson's non-cement assets, mainly in the property sector; and the issuance of long-term debt and equity in Spanish and international markets. Apax could eventually hold around 15 per cent of Sanson. The Sanson purchase is similar to the agreement to buy Valenciana in that the Mexican group also intends financing that purchase through the sale of around Dollars 200m of Valen-ciana's non-cement assets. Cemex believes that Valenciana and Sanson are ripe for radical restructuring to reduce costs, even though the Spanish market is currently weakening. Cemex is itself one of the lowest-cost producers among the world's leading cement makers. Nevertheless, the market for Spanish cement is being hurt by imports. Cement consumption in Spain is expected to fall about 2 per cent next year as the economy continues to cool.</p>

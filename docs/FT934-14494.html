			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Further 300 staff cut at VSEL A FURTHER 300 job cuts were announced yesterday at shipbuilders VSEL in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. In the past three years VSEL has cut its workforce steadily from 14,000. The company has said it might have to reduce its workforce to 5,000 in spite of its diversification programme. The losses are in both manual and management areas and will take place between now and December. Mr Ray Davies, the personnel director, said the move was due to a 'continuing reduction in our Ministry of Defence workload, coupled with the need to reduce costs to make us more competitive'. He added that the losses - which will bring the workforce down to 6,500 - were in line with those anticipated in the company's strategic plan.</p>

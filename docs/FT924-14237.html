			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Beaverbrook: the master of intrigue - The extraordinary life and times of the great press baron BEAVERBROOK: A LIFE by Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie Hutchinson, Pounds 20, 589 pages POSSIBLY ONE is unduly influenced by the UK's current economic gloom and the sense of national failure: I found this biography of Lord Beaverbrook almost unbearably depressing. Here was a man who arrived in England from Canada in 1910, became a Member of Parliament before the year was out - even before he was eligible to vote in a British general election - was knighted in 1911, played some part in the downfall of Asquith and the formation of the Lloyd George/Bonar Law coalition, and at the end of 1916 ceased to be Max Aitken and became Lord Beaverbrook instead. Some 40 years later he was still intriguing. He became minister of information in 1918 and was recalled to government in the second world war as minister of production. Beaverbrook knew practically everyone. He was a friend - until the Irish Treaty - of Rudyard Kipling, who admired Canada but disliked the United States. He was close to Arnold Bennett, the writer. At least three people wrote novels that included him. Evelyn Waugh had him as Lord Copper in Scoop. Rebecca West, his sometime mistress who described him as 'every other inch a gentleman' (Beaverbrook was only 5 ft 7 in) had a go. William Gerhardie, a young protege, thinly disguised him as Lord Ottercove in his book, Jazz and Jasper. We should not blame Beaverbrook. He was a brilliant journalist, as proprietor, writer and innovator. He had been a cub reporter and newspaper salesboy in his native Canada. He began to acquire the Daily Express in 1910, founded the Sunday Express in 1919 and picked up the Evening Standard in 1923: thereafter he did not seek to extend his empire. He was not quite as ruthless as is sometimes suggested. The Daily Express had only three editors in a period of 40 years. He had a talent for bringing in writers. The Evening Standard was, as this book points out, his only paper that was regularly read by his friends. Thus he allowed it be more to be more sophisticated and less profitable than its stablemates. The Beaverbrook technique of surprising the readers remains in the Standard even now: see, for example, an outstanding, unsigned article last Wednesday on Britain and Europe. Lord Deedes, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph and also once a Tory minister, has paid proper tribute. Beaverbrook, he wrote, brought about 'a social revolution . . . During the 1930s he introduced through his newspapers a transatlantic philosophy to our still highly class-conscious and stratified society . . . he did more through his newspapers to emancipate our society than any of the pre-war political leaders. A cat may look at a king, he constantly reminded his readers.' Without the old Express, there might be no Sun today, though Beaverbrook in the 1930s avoided undue prying into private lives. It is a remarkable achievement that old models are still being followed by new proprietors. Nor should we blame Beaverbrook for his string of mistresses who scatter the pages of this biography. By now they are irrelevant. They took what they could get, and so did he: he was in many ways a remarkably generous man with an eye for other people's weaknesses. The real puzzle is why English society as a whole should have sucked up to him for so long. The explanation seems to be money. Beaverbrook gave presents all over the place: he paid other people's debts and seemed to assume that almost everyone could be bought. The sad truth is that he was very nearly right: where he erred was in assuming that giving money would secure political influence. Of the latter, except perhaps in those early days of the Lloyd George coalition, he had very little. He must nevertheless have had some personal charm and some insights. The historian, A J P Taylor, once wrote of him: 'the Empire Crusade was a knockabout comedy, not worth a footnote in the textbooks. In the 1940 the minister of aircraft production may have inspired his colleagues; but only plans made years before could have matured into aircraft,' and much more in the same scathing tone. Yet within a year Taylor had become a Beaverbrook admirer and eventually wrote a favourable biography. The trouble with this laborious work by Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie is that they seldom stand back and examine why so much much of English society was so gullible to the Beaverbrook approach. There is also a serious lacuna: a chapter on how much money Beaverbrook had, and how he managed it, would have been helpful. For example, he was wise enough to sell a large number of shares before the great crash of 1929. He was not a Maxwell, but years later Maxwell had a similar kind of influence.</p>

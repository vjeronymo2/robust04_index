			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS SEEK AN OUT-OF-THIS WORLD 'GREETING CARD' TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALIENS  </P> <P> Scientists have been avidly debating how to communicate with aliens from outer  space in a city where a long-distance telephone call to fellow earthlings is  hard enough.  </P> <P> Last month's 41st International Astronautical Congress in Dresden, eastern  Germany, was dedicated to ensuring that if little green beings ever show up on  telescopes, or doorsteps, we will be prepared.  </P> <P> "We have to assume two things about them: They have radio technology and can  count," said Carl DeVito, a mathematics professor from Arizona University.  </P> <P> The latest IAC, which annually reviews progress in space exploration, evaluated  efforts to invent a new language for communicating with creatures from another  planet.  </P> <P> Ironically, the scientists chose a venue where the antiquated telephone system  of what was formerly East Germany made it difficult to contact families and  friends by long-distance phone calls, let alone make contact with aliens.  </P> <P> With their smart Western suits and shiny blue name tags, the scientists  themselves stood out like extraterrestrials among the shabbily dressed locals.  </P> <P> The weeklong congress, which was opened by German Science Minister Heinz  Riesenhuber, drew thousands of delegates.  </P> <P> Flying saucers may be the stuff of science fiction, but scientists have long  presumed that someone else is out there somewhere.  </P> <P> The U.S. Voyager space probe spun off into outer space in the 1970s carrying  pictures depicting life on Earth and a recorded message from then U.N.  Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.  </P> <P> There has been no response so far. But Jill Tarter, a scientist from the Search  for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) institute, said Earth should start  preparing for how to react when we discover we are not alone.  </P> <P> "There's nobody who writes international greeting cards, but we have to find  one for the world," she told a committee reviewing SETI's work, which is  financed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </P> <P> Tarter said the U.N. should adopt guidelines telling humans how to approach  their first alien.  </P> <P> Her paper admitted that some may think there would be little point to the  project.  </P> <P> "In the absence of compelling evidence of an extraterrestrial intelligence, it  may be difficult to sustain high-level interest in this issue," the paper said.  </P> <P> NASA launched an $80-million project in 1982 to transmit signals to aliens in  outer space, but scientists at the congress said more taxpayer money was needed  to pick up the long-awaited response.  </P> <P> German scientist Sebastien von Hoerner said Earth needs a huge radiotelescope  in its southern hemisphere, costing millions of dollars, to speed up the  search.  </P> <P> But the hardest part remains unsolved.  </P> <P> "We want to say something but we don't know how," DeVito said.  </P> <P> Previous research on communicating with aliens focused on trying to teach  extraterrestrials a language. That was the aim of Dutch mathematician Hans  Freudenthal, who wrote a book on a "language for cosmic intercourse."  </P> <P> Despite the promising subject of this pioneering work of the 1960s, DeVito  said, its approach was too slow.  </P> <P> It would be quicker to seek common ground with whatever arrived, he said.  </P> <P> "The basic problem is how to get out of our brains and into reality," he said.  </P> <P> Aliens should be presented with a picture of reality, with captions  representing the image in a scientific or mathematical language, he said.  </P> <P> His approach is based on the principle of the Rosetta stone, a plaque found in  the Egyptian desert in 1799 by Napoleonic troops.  </P> <P> The stone had Egyptian hieroglyphics translated into two other languages,  enabling scholars to decipher the ancient language of the Pharaohs for modern  man.  </P> <P> DeVito would first like to confront any little green beings with an image  showing an ocean, then an ice field followed by an iceberg. Each picture has a  caption.  </P></p>

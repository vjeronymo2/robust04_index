			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Aleksandr Belov, "one of the chiefs" </F> of the Ukrainian Security Service Analysis Center, by  unidentified UNIAN reporter; place and date not given: "CIA  Director Demanded That His Functionaries Foresee Events and Not  Write History"]    [Text] At the end of 1991, in compliance with the  Ukrainian laws "On Security Service" and "On Investigative  Operations," the analysis and information administration was  established at the Ukrainian Security Service [SBU], which  included a research unit called the analysis center. A UNIAN  correspondent met with one of its chiefs, Colonel Aleksandr  Belov. Here is what he said.    [Belov] Over the past two years, we have sent more than  3,500  documents on national security matters to the Ukrainian  president, Supreme Council chairman, and prime minister. This  enables the necessary measures to be taken on the legislative  level and allows people to keep one step ahead of events.  Instead of writing history, we try to foresee developments. By  the way, this is what former CIA Director Robert Gates demanded  from his people. We are now studying two major issues. The  first is Ukraine and the system of collective security, because  just like other East European states, our country seeks to enter  international institutions in order to obtain firm guarantees of  its security. We are trying to consider all the advantages and  disadvantages stemming, for example, from entry into NATO or the  EEC, integration into the Visegrad Group, or the creation of a  Baltic and Black Sea Union. The second issue is to determine  the likely centers for international terrorist organizations'  operations on Ukrainian territory.    [Reporter] How often were your prognoses borne out?    [Belov] When the armed conflict in the Dniester region was  in  its initial stage, the Ukrainian leadership instructed the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, Foreign Ministry, border troops,  and the SBU to prevent the spread of the conflict onto Ukraine's  territory. At that time, we were preparing on a daily basis  information for Leonid Kravchuk, Ivan Plyushch, and Anatoliy  Zlenko on the situation in the region and the likely directions  that events might take. Our prediction that the 14th Russian  Army was likely to turn into an independent political force was  borne out.    [Reporter] Do you have any evidence of any analytical  operations by foreign special services in the Crimea?    [Belov] At present, the Crimea remains a potential crisis  spot, not only in Ukraine but also in the context of a larger  geopolitical area. This is why developments in that region are  closely watched by Turkey, Romania, the United States, Germany,  and Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries [MAFF] has decided on an early compilation of a  package of reform plans for the food control system, which  stipulates the government's control over the entire rice market.  MAFF intends to work out the reform package in July, a year  earlier than its initial plan. The reform package includes the  following measures: 1) The compulsive allotment of rice  production cuts should be discontinued so that farmers can  choose between free business and farm subsidies; 2) "black  market rice" should be legalized by allowing direct deals from  farmers to wholesalers; and 3) an additional rice reserve quota  should be provided to prepare for serious rice shortages. In  view of public criticism of the food control policy, the  government is going to "relax' its control over the rice market  for the first time in the last half century.    A MAFF source said the reform package includes an  "alternative rice-paddy reduction policy." Under the policy,  MAFF intends to discontinue its rice production cut policy  imposed on all rice farmers at the wholesale level, and to allow  the farmers' own discretion on whether or not they cut their  production.    The government will keep offering subsidies and guarantee  the  minimum price of products to those who agree on rice production  cuts. However, those who pick free production will have to deal  with the free market at their own risk. The government hopes  most farmers follow its rice production cut policy.    When the new policy is implemented, free-production farmers  will have no duty to sell their products to the government.  This means free production comes with free distribution. Upon  the abolition of governmental control over the entire rice  market, the free rice market would not be called a black market  anymore.    Regarding the rice reserve policy, MAFF will provide a new  rice reserve quota called the special reserve, which amounts to  several hundred thousand tons, in addition to the ordinary rice  stock of over a million tons. The special rice reserve is  intended for emergencies, livestock feed, and food aid to  developing countries. Funds for the special rice reserve is  expected to be raised with profits from the distribution of  foreign-grown rice imported according to the minimum access  accord.    The government will continue to compile annual rice supply  plans even after the food control policy's revision, aiming at  stabilization of the Japanese rice market's demand-supply  balance. However, MAFF intends to characterize the rice supply  plans just as guidelines for farmers and distributors, and let  them submit detailed production and sales plans annually to  maintain indirect control over the market.    MAFF plans to announce such directions of the rice policy  reform in July. The reform measures will be finalized in view  of deliberations of the (prime minister's advisory) Agricultural  Policy Commission now in session, and, within the summer, MAFF  will start compiling a revision of the Food Control Law. Some  of the reform measures are expected to take effect in fiscal  1995.    In the initial plan, MAFF defined reform of the food control  policy as a long-term subject. However, its rigid rice policies  are being criticized from various quarters. MAFF decided to  work out the reform plan this coming summer since "we have to  swiftly prepare tangible reform measures and implement it as  soon as possible" (as noted by a senior MAFF official).</p>

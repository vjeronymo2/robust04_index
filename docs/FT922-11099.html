			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: ICI loses fight over US patent IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK industrial group, has lost a battle to protect the US patent on Nolvadex, its best-selling breast cancer drug. The patent for the drug has been successfully challenged by Barr Laboratories, an independent New York-based generic manufacturer, which said yesterday it expected to market a generic equivalent within a year. Normally, sales of previously patented products fall by 40 per cent in two years when faced by generic competition. Although ICI refuses to give details of product sales in specific geographical areas, analysts believe about half of Nolvadex's annual sales of Pounds 248m are in the US. 'ICI could lose about Pounds 20m from its bottom line from this decision,' warned Mr Charles Lambert, a chemicals analyst at Smith New Court. ICI said it planned to appeal against the ruling made at the southern district court of New York. It is alleged to have submitted incomplete data when it filed patents in the US.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Clinton files row move ACTING US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger yesterday took responsibility for the controversial bid to find old passport files of Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton, Reuter reports. Apparently stung by claims that low-level officials were being blamed, Mr Eagleburger said: 'The buck stops here.' He said he was prepared to testify publicly on the matter before Congress. The Senate foreign relations committee scheduled but then postponed a Monday public hearing on charges that the State Department used improper procedures to try to get files about Mr Clinton. The controversy involves the recent search for files in Washington, London and Oslo at a time when President Bush's supporters were increasing attacks on Mr Clinton's draft record, his role in the anti-war movement as a student and a trip he made to Moscow.</p>

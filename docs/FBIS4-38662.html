			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow has no intention of giving up weapons exports  to third world countries unilaterally without prior talks with  the West, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in Moscow  on Tuesday. At a meeting with U.S. congressmen led by Senator  Sam Nunn, he dwelt upon Russian arms exports to Iran which are  causing western concern.    "Let us work together over the rules of weapons exports (to  third countries)", Kozyrev said. "Asking Russia to undertake  commitment not to export weapons(to Iran) unilaterally as a  condition for talks on the issue is not only out of line with  the spirit of partnership with our western allies, but it also  brings to mind the worst in our common history", he said.    About Nagorno-Karabakh, the minister said that Russia was  alone prepared to send peacekeepers to that area of conflict  poisoning the situation on both sides of the Caucasus and posing  threat to its southern fringes.    "Meanwhile, we are being accused of neo-imperialism on the  grounds that a political solution must be found to the conflict  before sending peacekeepers to the region", he said.    Kozyrev said that instead of the assistance Moscow would  welcome, the West preferred to act as inspector driving in a  wedge in efforts by Russia and the CSCE to try to settle the  conflict. "This is not a partnership approach", he said.    For details, refer to Diplomatic Panorama of May 31.</p>

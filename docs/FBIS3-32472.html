			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] As of filing time, Cuban sources  monitored by Panama Bureau have not been observed to carry  statements by elite Cuban figures or commentary on the U.S.  decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam. The following is  a compilation of Cuban-source straight reporting on the lifting  of the embargo.    Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2249 GMT on 3 February  carries its first report on U.S. President Bill Clinton's  announcement lifting the trade embargo against the SRV. In the  175-word Washington-datelined report, the U.S. President is  quoted as saying: "I am absolutely convinced that this decision  offers the best way to resolve the fate of missing persons,"  adding that "nothing of what we do today is irreversible if the  SRV cooperation ends." The report concludes by noting that  President Clinton's decision authorizes the opening of "liaison  offices" in Hanoi and Washington, which will serve as the first  diplomatic representations between the two countries.    Havana Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 4  February, during its regularly scheduled "Evening Information  Review" program, carries a one-minute report citing U.S.  Government sources as saying that "President William Clinton  decided on Thursday to lift the trade embargo imposed 19 years  ago against the SRV." The report cites an AFP report as saying  that White House officials said the official announcement will  be made in the course of the next few days. This report is  rebroadcast by Havana Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish at 0100 GMT  on 4 February.    At 0216 GMT on 4 February, Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish  carries a 350-word report on reaction within the United States  to the lifting of the embargo against the SRV. The  Washington-datelined report states that the business community  cheered Clinton's announcement, while Vietnam war veterans  criticized it. The report says that in an effort to stem  criticism, "the Executive Branch warned that the elimination of  the reprisal does not entail a normalization of relations  between the two countries." The report concludes by citing  Clinton as saying that "this measure was adopted because the SRV  has cooperated favorably in the recovery of remains of U.S.  soldiers."    Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 1309 on 4 February  carries  a 550-word, Washington-datelined report on the economic benefits  derived from the lifting of the U.S. embargo on the SRV. The  report notes that "aside from politics, there is a potential  commercial exchange of some $9 billion, according to a group of  U.S.-Vietnamese businessmen based in Washington." The report  concludes that "the measure has a marked business character."    Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 1347 GMT on 4 February  carries a 335-word, Hanoi-datelined item on Vietnamese reaction  to the lifting of the trade sanctions. "Although Hanoi has not  yet issued an official statement," the report asserts, the SRV  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman was quoted as saying that "her  country applauds the end of the restrictions, which will benefit  both parties and the entire international community." The  report cites remarks by various U.S. businessmen, as well as the  PRC Foreign Ministry and Japanese Cabinet chief praising  President Clinton's decision.    At 1515 on 4 February, Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish  carries a 175-word report on Vietnamese Government reaction to  the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo. The Hanoi-datelined  report terms as "positive and significant" the decision by  President Clinton to lift the embargo and "begin a process  toward normalizing relations." The item cited the Vietnamese  deputy foreign minister as saying "his country accepts the  establishment of liaison offices in Washington and Hanoi, but  warned that the establishment of diplomatic ties could not be  subject to any precondition." The Vietnamese official  reiterated his country's desire to continue assisting the United  States in the search for missing persons, the report concluded.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Pakistan cherishes peace role: A UN route to winning friends PAKISTANI troops in the United Nations force in Somalia have this month been at the centre first of tragedy, when 23 of their number were massacred by Somali gunmen, and then heated controversy when 12 civilians died in crossfire when the soldiers shot at a demonstration in Mogadishu. Yesterday at least one more Pakistani was killed in fighting in the capital. Pakistani soldiers also are serving in the UN operation in Cambodia. Islamabad believes that acquiring a peacekeeper's role will help its diplomatic case on the disputed Indian state of Kashmir. The two countries disagree on ways to resolve the issue. While New Delhi claims that Kashmir is in an internal matter, Islamabad demands that the future of the state should be determined under UN resolutions calling for a plebiscite. 'Pakistan believes that UN peacekeeping is the only rational alternative to unilateral imposition of the decisions of major global or regional powers,' said a foreign ministry spokesman recently when asked about the motives for sending soldiers to join the Blue Helments. Both Pakistan and India have fought three wars and there have been exchanges of fire on a number of occasions between the thousands of troops deployed on each side of the disputed border in Kashmir, known as the line of control. Tensions have been mounting in the state during the past three years amid intense guerilla operations waged by separatists. India has accused Pakistan on a number of occasions of supporting those militants, a charge which Islamabad denies. In recent days, some senior officials have said that joining the UN deployments would also strengthen their case for continuing with the United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (Unmogip) operation either until the Kashmir issue is resolved or at least until relations improve and tensions are lowered. Unmogip has been in place since 1949. It consists of military observers drawn from UN member countries who monitor the line of control. In spite of recent events in Somalia, Pakistan is likely to try to join other operations. 'A large Moslem army of almost half a million certainly gives Pakistan an edge in operations in Moslem countries where there will be less resentment from the local population,' says one western diplomat.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Senate this morning approved the Washington  protocol which establishes sanctions against governments  installed through illegal means. The protocol has been adopted  by the foreign ministers of OAS country members on behalf of  their governments.    The document sent by the executive branch to the Senate on  13  May refers to a modification to the OAS charter. It adds rules  to protect democratically elected administrations and sanctions  against those that illegally oust their governors.    The senators unanimously approved the protocol. Senator  Carlos Alberto Gonzalez, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  later emphasized its importance.    One sanction contemplated in the document states that  illegal  administrations cannot participate in OAS meetings.    The Senate also agreed to the executive branch appointment  of  Ruben Bareiro Saguier as plenipotentiary ambassador to France.  [passage omitted]</p>

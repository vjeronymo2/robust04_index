			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Rise seen in company ethics codes THE PROPORTION of large companies with a written ethical code is rising sharply and stands at nearly 30 per cent, according to a survey published yesterday. Policies on relations with employees and customers and on sexual harassment dominate ethical codes, says the study by the Institute of Business Ethics, a think tank. There has also been a sharp growth in statements on environmental policy in the past two years, said Mr Simon Webley, author of the report. Twenty-nine per cent of the replies from 164 leading companies said that they had a statement of business ethics in 1991. That compared with 18 per cent when the survey was last conducted in 1987. A fifth of companies with codes were UK subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations, most of which were American. Those had more detailed and lengthy codes than British parent companies, and discussed staff involvement in the community more frequently. Most companies with written codes commented on their obligations to employees, including equal opportunities, remuneration and development, and listening to staff. By contrast, very few mentioned duties to shareholders. Some discussed obligations to customers, such as the provision of high-quality products. A smaller number mentioned their responsibilities to suppliers, such as prompt payment or policies on giving and receiving gifts. In 37 per cent of cases, the chief executive or chairman was the person who felt responsible for the company's ethics. Lord Laing, institute president and former chairman of United Biscuits, urged all companies to produce a code and said that shareholders should call for the introduction of codes at companies' annual meeting. Eleven per cent of companies gave reasons why they did not have written codes, including a belief that it was unnecessary because they always acted ethically, or that policies should be determined by individual subsidiaries.

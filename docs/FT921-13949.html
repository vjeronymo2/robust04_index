			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Inland Steel turns in record loss of Dollars 275.1m INLAND Steel reported its largest ever annual loss in 1991 totalling Dollars 275.1m, or Dollars 9.88 per share. The results, already hit by low steel prices and poor demand for consumer durables, were further depressed by a Dollars 215m restructuring charge relating to plant closures and about 3,500 jobs cuts. The workforce reduction will take place over several years. Before the restructuring provision, the company's net loss last year was Dollars 110m, or Dollars 4.55 per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 20.6m, or Dollars 1.41, in 1990. Sales fell by 12 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.87bn in 1990. For the fourth quarter, when the charge was taken, Inland reported a net loss of Dollars 191.3m, or Dollars 6.44. Before the charge, the loss had been Dollars 26.2m, or Dollars 1.11, against losses of Dollars 57.1m, or Dollars 2.05 per share, a year ago. Mr Frank Luerssen, Inland's chairman, said the company's restructuring and a modernisation programme should allow it to benefit from steel's next upturn. But, he said, 'we have no illusions that the months ahead are going to be anything but difficult. The outlook for steel orders, particularly from the automobile industry, remains weak.'</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter (2): Pensions: resolving surpluses problem through RPI link and collateral question through the law Sir, It would appear that the collateral used by Mr Maxwell in raising bank loans did not belong to him; it belonged to the trustees of the pension funds that have apparently been plundered. It is appalling that the pensioners of those funds should suffer whereas the banks appear to have title to that collateral. The law should be changed so that the onus is put upon the lender to satisfy himself that the collateral used on a loan does in fact belong to the borrower. Had such a law been in place much of the agony suffered by Maxwell pensioners would have been avoided. H R Wynne-Griffith, Barnett Waddington &amp; Co, 11 Tufton Street, London SW1</p>

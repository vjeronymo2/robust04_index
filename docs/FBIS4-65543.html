			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["G.P."-signed report: "Rexrodt Opposes Abandoning Nuclear </F> Energy"]    [Text] Stuttgart, 17 May -- At the opening of the 1994  Nuclear Technology Annual Conference in Stuttgart, Federal  Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt warned against the FRG  abandoning nuclear energy. It completely lacks logic to abandon  a technology in which German companies occupy a leading position  internationally. Those who call for the abandonment of nuclear  technology should realize that the resulting energy shortage  will have to be made up for and that jobs for highly qualified  people will be affected. In addition, it will be scarcely  possible for Germany to make an effective contribution to  improving the security of nuclear power plants in Central and  East Europe without the necessary technology.    Rexrodt said that the long-term option for the use of  nuclear  energy should not be given up now, even if a discussion is  currently taking place on issuing permits for new nuclear power  plants. He called on the laender governed by the SPD to stop  resisting the law on the use of coal and nuclear energy, which  the Federal Council is to decide about on Friday [20 May]. The  law will set new conditions that have to be fulfilled before a  permit for the operation of a nuclear power plant is issued.  The main aim is to significantly reduce the danger to the  population in the event of reactor accidents by way of  preventative measures, including the prevention of melt-downs.    The minister regretted that last year's talks on achieving a  consensus had collapsed, at least temporarily. There should be  a broad social consensus on the supply of energy in the future.  Schwaben Energy AG board of directors member Staebler said that  the consensus talks had, despite their collapse, increased  acceptance for nuclear energy, because the discussion had  acquired much more of a factual character. Thus, within a year,  the number of people who wanted to abandon nuclear energy  quickly fell from 32 to 24 percent. The number of people who  are of the opinion that a modern industrial state needs nuclear  power plants has risen from 29 percent at the beginning of the  1990's to 41 percent. Incidentally, with technological and  other improvements to reactors over the past two decades, a  notable degree of safety has been achieved. Serious accidents  involving the release of radiation, even if the amounts do not  exceed a natural level, have not occurred so far. Approved  limits were only exceeded in the case of the "incident" at the  Lingen nuclear power plant in 1969.</p>

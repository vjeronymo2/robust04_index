			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> COLLINS OUTSPENDS OTHER CONTENDERS  </P> <P> Businessman John J. Collins has spent almost $2,800 in his campaign for the  City Council, more than twice the amount of the total campaign budgets of two  other candidates, according to his campaign financial statement.  </P> <P> Collins' biggest payment -- $2,200 -- went to American Union Printing for  flyers. He has raised $4,900 for his campaign to fill one of three seats after  two failed attempts in 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> Candidates Marvin P. Adler and Guy Carozzo do not plan to spend more than  $1,000 on their entire campaigns, according to their financial reports.  </P> <P> A major part of Carozzo's election pledge is that he will pay for his campaign  out of his retirement fund and won't accept campaign contributions.

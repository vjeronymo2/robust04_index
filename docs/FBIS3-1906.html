Qiao expressed the hope that Belau, a trustee of the United  States, will win full independence at an early date in  accordance with its people's desire.    Describing the delegation's visit as a good beginning for  promoting Sino-Belau relations, Qiao hoped for more exchanges  between the two sides after Belau's independence.    Qiao also reaffirmed China's consistent position that  countries, big or small, strong or weak, should be equals and  all countries must respect each other and have the right to go  their own ways in the light of different conditions.    The visitors, led by Yutaka Gibbons, who is the chief  Aibedul, arrived here yesterday.    Gibbons thanked the hosts for their hospitality and  expressed  the hope that Belau and China will have more contacts.    Present at the meeting was NPC Vice-Chairman Li Peiyao.  After the meeting, Li hosted a dinner in honor of the visitors.</p>

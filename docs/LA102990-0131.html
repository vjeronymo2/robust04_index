			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 7 NEW INDUCTEES PICKED FOR ROCK HALL OF FAME;  </P> <P> MUSIC: IKE AND TINA TURNER, THE BYRDS, JOHN LEE TURNER, THE IMPRESSIONS, WILSON  PICKETT, LA VERN BAKER AND JIMMY REED TAPPED.  </P> <P> Soul stylists Ike and Tina Turner and country-rock stars the Byrds are among  the seven new inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced today at a  press conference in Cleveland.  </P> <P> Other performers to be honored at the Jan. 16 induction ceremony in New York's  Waldorf-Astoria include John Lee Hooker, the Impressions, Wilson Pickett, La  Vern Baker and Jimmy Reed.  </P> <P> Howlin' Wolf was chosen as this year's honoree in the early  influence/forefather category along with producers Dave Bartholomew and Ralph  Bass as non-performing professionals.  </P> <P> Despite legal disputes in the Byrds camp, all five members of the original  lineup are expected to be on hand at the January ceremony. Byrds' leader Roger  McGuinn said he was "thrilled" to hear the news.  </P> <P> "What's important is that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has chosen to honor  the music of the Byrds," McGuinn said. " Whether there is any personal  disagreement between the band members is inconsequential."  </P> <P> Ike Turner, who is serving a four-year sentence in the California Men's Colony  in San Luis Obispo for a misdemeanor drug conviction, could not be reached for  comment. Carol Pinkins, associate warden at the facility, said she doubted that  Turner would be allowed to attend the dinner.  </P> <P> Impressions leader Curtis Mayfield, who was paralyzed from the neck down Aug.  13 in a freak accident at an outdoor concert, told The Times that he expects to  join the Impressions at the event.  </P> <P> "We're taking it day be day," Mayfield said in his first interview since the  accident. "I'm very moved that the Impressions will be honored, and I hope to  attend."  </P> <P> More than 300 performers, producers, writers, record executives and  broadcasters voted in this year's election. This year's 15 nominees were chosen  on the basis of contributions to or influence on the course of rock 'n' roll,  and all released records in 1965 or before.  </P> <P> So far, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has inducted 68 performers,  non-performers and forefathers since the nonprofit organization was conceived  in 1985 by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun.  </P></p>

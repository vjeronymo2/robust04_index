			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICK A VIDEO: CABLE'S NEW JUKEBOX NETWORK;  </P> <P> MUSIC: WITH A $3 TELEPHONE CALL YOU CAN AVOID RAP OR HEAVY METAL OR SUGARY POP  BY PROGRAMMING YOUR OWN VIDEOS.  </P> <P> It's the same old story -- or, in this case, the same old music video.  </P> <P> You tune into MTV or VH-1 to catch your favorite video and find yourself  quickly tuning out after you OD on rap, heavy metal and New Kids on the Block  videos.  </P> <P> What if there was a cable network that allowed the viewers to program the  videos?  </P> <P> Meet the Jukebox Network, what its backers call the first interactive cable-TV  network. With a $3 phone call, you can pick the video you want to see.  </P> <P> First tested in 1985, the Jukebox Network -- which is owned and operated by  Miami-based Video Jukebox Network, Inc. -- is in 94 locations across the  country and hopes to be in 30 more by year's end. It is carried locally by  United Artists Cable, which serves Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys, Toluca Lake and  Pacoima, Sammons Communications in Glendale and Comcast in northern Orange  County.  </P> <P> When no video is playing, a scroll appears on the screen, listing a succession  of as many as 100 videos that can be ordered, from Phil Collins to Public  Enemy, from Billy Joel to Billy Idol. The viewer notes the code number that  appears to the left of the title, then calls the 900 or 976 phone number shown  at the top of the screen and punches in the appropriate code. If the Jukebox  Network isn't particularly busy, the video will start playing within two  minutes.  </P> <P> The phone company puts each call on the customer's bill and takes a small  percentage of the $3 fee for itself. The balance goes to Video Jukebox Network,  Inc., which in turn passes on some of the money to the cable company that  generated the call -- usually 5 to 7 cents per call.  </P> <P> That's part of the appeal to cable operators.  </P> <P> "We say, 'You won't get rich with us, but you'll make some money,' " explained  John Robson, director of corporate communications for Video Jukebox Network.  "They are also looking for value-added programming, and the channel is locally  originated and responds specifically to their viewers."  </P> <P> "It was a smart move to put it on," said Dan MacKenzie, manager of pay-per-view  entertainment services at United Artists, which has carried the Jukebox Network  since December. "It's definitely paying for itself. It's just an additional  piece of icing for the customers to enjoy."  </P> <P> Sampling Jukebox on Sammons, though, one tends to see the scroll more often  than videos. Sammons general manager Tom Robbins insisted, nonetheless, that  Sammons is very pleased with the response from its customers. "Sometimes there  is more activity than other times," he said.  </P> <P> The patented technology for the Jukebox Network was developed before anyone had  a good idea of how to use it.  </P> <P> "We tried things like classified ads, a movie guide and a real estate service,"  Robson said. Finally, someone hit on the idea of a video jukebox.  </P> <P> The first video jukebox was launched on the TCI system in Miami on Dec. 20,  1985. Two years later, another box was added in Jacksonville. After three more  years of testing in Florida, national roll-out began on March 6, 1989.  </P> <P> "It is one of the most researched and developed projects," said Andy Orgell,  president of Video Jukebox Network. "The product was fine-tuned while it was on  the air and developed over a period of time."  </P> <P> Cable companies and subscribers don't need any extra equipment for the Jukebox  channel. A box the size of a small refrigerator is placed in the cable company.  It contains laser discs of the music videos and is activated by the viewer's  phone call.  </P> <P> "We can play something like half-a-million separate songs every month," Robson  said. "There is no entity who can play as much music as we can."  </P> <P> If there are videos that the system isn't carrying, viewers are invited to  request them by calling a toll-free number. "We receive 50,000 calls a month,"  Robson said.  </P> <P> The line is also used to lodge complaints. Les Garland, vice president of  programming, maintains that only 4% of the calls find fault with the network  and none complain about the cost of the videos.  </P> <P> "There is not such a sensitivity about the phone bill," he said. "People seem  to get their telephone bills and just pay it."  </P> <P> "One of the things we have done from day one is pound the price home," Robson  said. "We put the price right in the middle of the (TV) spot and we also put  the price message on the phone message."  </P> <P> Ordering a video through Sammons, though, the price message was delivered after  the video was ordered.  </P> <P> Garland believes the network will be able to predict hits very quickly. "It's a  very active audience," he said. "It's a 12- to 25-year-old audience. They are  watching the network and telephoning in to make requests. They are also record  purchasers. They are the trend-setting, on-the-cutting-edge kind of young  people."  </P> <P> A small number of videos are not available to the network because of the  exclusivity MTV has with some record labels.  </P> <P> "But we have world-premiered a number of videos," Robson said. "We have a great  opportunity to show more videos than MTV because they don't play as many songs  as we do. We have shown local videos that wouldn't fly anywhere else."  </P> <P> Garland said that the network is not trying to "take on" MTV, where he formerly  worked as programming vice president.  </P> <P> "We really see the Jukebox as a place for people to come to discover the talent  of tomorrow. It's an alternative music channel," he said. "It's the first  alternative music channel that has come along since MTV in 1981. We can play  things you are not going to hear on the radio or any of those other channels. I  think the public has a desire to have a choice. It's the wide array of music  which will position us."  </P> <P> Despite the fact the Jukebox Network is now seen by nearly seven million  customers, Orgell admits the public company hasn't turned a profit. "We did  make an operating profit during the first quarter," he said. "But we are still  not bottom line profitable -- yet."  </P> <P> Video Jukebox Network sees itself primarily as an interactive company and not  just a music company.  </P> <P> "The Jukebox Network is our first product," Robson said. "We are committed this  year to have another product line on the air. It will be nothing to do with  music, but we are not 100% sure what it will be. We are looking at a lot of  things."  </P></p>

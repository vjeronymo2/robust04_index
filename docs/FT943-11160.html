			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Merchant banks The flurry of bids in UK food retailing is a reminder that life is not as bad for the merchant banks as their market performance might suggest. The sector has dropped by 16 per cent this year, roughly twice as far as the market as a whole. Kleinwort's results this week will give some indication of whether merchant banks deserve to be treated so badly, but there are grounds for doubt. Not only did equity and gilt market turnover hold up well during the first half in spite of falling prices. There was also an active UK market in new issues. Two other points suggest investors are wrong to link merchant bank performance too directly to the equity market. The first is that several now appear to be basing pay more closely on financial results. They are thus more easily able to rein in costs when income drops. The larger merchant banks are also increasingly active on the international stage. Full control of Wertheim will strengthen Schroders' position in the US. But even smaller Kleinwort has shown it can compete globally for privatisation business. This is not to say that 1994 will turn out as good as last year. Warburg's recent annual meeting caution is a reminder that the new business pipeline is not particularly full. But in the longer term a structural change may become apparent. The capital markets should continue to capture business from commercial banks while larger merchant banks continue to diversify abroad. They will thus enjoy greater growth prospects and less volatile earnings. Currently depressed share prices ignore this prospect altogether.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Antero Flores Araoz, congressman for the </F> Popular Christian Party, by Eduardo Lindo Collantes at the  Congress of the Republic in Lima; from the "Newspaper of the  Airwaves" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Collantes] Good afternoon. I am at the Congress  of the Republic covering reaction to the bill which Congress  approved early this morning on the conflicts over civilian  versus military jurisdiction in cases that do not involve drug  trafficking. The bill eliminates the possibility that one  person alone can decide if a case is to be tried by a civilian  or military court.    We have Antero Flores Araoz, congressman for the Popular  Christian Party [PPC] with us. Congressman, we would like your  comments on this issue. How do you view the fact that a  congressional majority passed this bill when the La Cantuta case  is still to be resolved?    [Flores] Listen, what we saw at the Congress last night is  something we never imagined could happen. Really, all moral  principles were trampled. They [the ruling majority] did not  care about anything and displayed an attitude of total arrogance  and gall. The issue was not on the agenda and had not been  discussed at the council board meeting. The issue was presented  between midnight and dawn. They took advantage of the fact that  the tribute to Don Luis Alberto Sanchez [recently deceased  American Popular Revolutionary Alliance leader] had ended, and,  without even distributing copies of the bill beforehand, they  started the debate. The bill had not even gone through the  commissions. This bill really dashes all the international  pacts on international law signed by Peru. Those agreements  clearly stipulate Peru's commitments with the due process of law  and the people's right to be tried by competent courts. This  law has a set purpose.    [Collantes] However, the argument presented to substantiate  the bill's approval is that the physical integrity of the  magistrates, who have to decide on the jurisdiction of the La  Cantuta case, has to be protected.    [Flores] Does this mean the Armed Forces and the Police are  not able to protect one, two, or three supreme court justices?  Does this mean our Armed Forces and Police are so inefficient  that they can't provide this protection and that we need to  trample all moral principles and violate five articles of the  Constitution simply because a leaflet fell in a justice's home?  Is this their excuse for trampling the Constitution and  international agreements? Please! This is only a plot between  the Executive and Legislative branches to cover up the people  involved in the famous La Cantuta case. They have become  accomplices in this case.    [Collantes] Congressman, a few minutes ago you presented a  bill to repeal the questionable habeas data [as heard] article  included in the 1993 Constitution. What prompted this action?    [Flores] It is really very simple. Many people are talking  about the need to regulate the constitutional article on habeas  data and stressing that some of its dangers should be expunged.  The PPC bloc believes, and said so when the Constitution was  being debated, that the habeas data has to disappear. Dead dogs  do not bite. Let us wipe out this article from the Constitution  and kill this deadly institution at the root.    [Collantes] This was PPC Congressman Flores. The opposition  congressmen are currently meeting at Democratic Movement  Congressman Henry Peace Garcia's office and will shortly issue a  communique on the case having jurisdiction problems and on the  bill approved early this morning. Back to the station.</p>

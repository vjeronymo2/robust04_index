			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Lloyd's faces threat of fresh legal action LLOYD'S OF LONDON faces fresh legal action in the next few days. The Gooda Walker Action Group plans a 'radical' new case, while the Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group, a new Names' pressure group formed last month aims to issue writs against managing and members' agents at the insurance market before May 15. The Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group is seeking support from several thousand Names who face multi-million-pound insurance losses as a result of their membership of syndicates that specialised in spiral reinsurance business - in which syndicates and London market companies reinsured each others' catastrophe exposures. Losses by spiral syndicates, managed by agencies such as Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker, may account for more than half of the total Lloyd's market loss of between Pounds 1.35bn and Pounds 2bn for 1989, which the market will report next month. In a letter to the group's Names, Withers, the solicitors, says that they appear to have a 'prima facie' case of negligence against both managing agencies and members' agents who failed to 'give proper warning' to Names of the 'immense dangers of underwriting LMX spiral business'. The recommendation is based on initial advice from Mr Gavin Lightman QC. The group is seeking further advice about the chances of obtaining an injunction that would prevent Lloyd's from drawing down on Names' deposits in order to meet cash calls. The Gooda Walker Action Group, which represents 2,100 Names, is lending financial support to the Distressed Names action but is also planning two initiatives of its own. According to its chairman, Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, Gooda Names hope to present a case next week based on 'radically new grounds'. That would be 'utterly different' to the case pursued earlier this year on behalf of 800 Names. Last month the Names failed to win injunctions - on the ground that the cash calls against them were legally improper - after a ruling by Mr Justice Saville in the Commercial Court. Twenty-four Conservative MPs - including ministers - are named in a Commons motion as having been members of the loss-making catastrophe syndicates. The motion tabled by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, calls on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to 'institute a full public inquiry into insider dealing, financial mismanagement and corruption in Lloyd's and to demand wholesale reform and independent regulation, bearing in mind that if even half these 24 colleagues of his are indeed declared bankrupt the government could lose its majority'.</p>

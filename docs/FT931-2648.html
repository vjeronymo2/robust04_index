			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Schroders expected to reveal inner reserves of Pounds 80m in next results SCHRODERS is likely to disclose next year that it has about Pounds 80m in hidden reserves. The merchant bank said yesterday that it would publish its inner or hidden reserves in its next set of full year results. Analysts with a close knowledge of the group said these would be in the range of between 15 and 20 per cent of its Pounds 462m in published capital and reserves - a far higher proportion than most of its rivals. Schroders also yesterday disclosed that it made after-tax profits of Pounds 64m, 23 per cent more than the previous year, excluding an extraordinary item. Pre-tax profits, after the transfer of an undisclosed sum to inner reserves, were Pounds 67m, 20 per cent higher. 'We are particularly pleased with the result, given that other merchant banks are finding conditions more difficult', said Mr Win Bischoff, chief executive. He said that more than half the group's revenues now derive from outside the UK, although a large proportion of these were treated in its accounts as UK profits. Last year's fall in the pound boosted by Pounds 5m the value of Schroders' overseas profits on translation into sterling. There was a similar benefit to the sterling value of funds managed by the group, which rose in the year from Pounds 27.7bn to Pounds 36.1bn. Mr Bischoff said that some Pounds 4bn of that growth was due to the translation effects of sterling's fall. Corporate finance operations, which are the traditional heart of the group, acted in 99 transactions worldwide, with a value of Pounds 8bn. Of these, Pounds 6.3bn were international. The final dividend is 16p, making 22p for the year, a rise of 22 per cent. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.</p>

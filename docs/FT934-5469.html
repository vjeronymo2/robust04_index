			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Jobless scheme is 'sabotaged' The academic who invented Workstart, the scheme for reducing the number of long-term unemployed introduced in the Budget last March, has accused the Department of Employment of sabotaging it. Professor Dennis Snower, of London University's Birkbeck College, says the scheme has been 'flagrantly mis-designed' with the intention that it should fail. Prof Snower's idea was that the long-term unemployed should be able to offer a large proportion of whatever benefits they received to a prospective employer as a subsidy. He was unhappy when, in four Workstart pilot schemes in south London, Devon and Cornwall, Tyneside and east Kent, with 1,000 places, the unemployed were only able to offer a subsidy of Pounds 60 per week for six months and Pounds 30 per week for the following six months. The employment department said that take-up had indeed been low - only about 108 people compared with the target of 1,000 - but said employers had been offering unsuitable vacancies. 'There have been some successes, such as an ex-offender who had been unemployed for seven years, and interest is now growing,' said the department. But one official confirmed that there was no great enthusiasm for the Workstart scheme in the department because the idea had been tried before with limited success, and had been forced on it by the Treasury. Officials say that in many cases unemployed people would have been hired even without the subsidy. 'We've had several schemes like this over the last 20 years and none of them have been very effective,' said one official. Prof Snower is convinced that the low take-up for the scheme is the result of inter-departmental politics. He said: 'They have not advertised the scheme properly. In some areas you have to be unemployed for four years. And they are not letting employers and workers make their own arrangements.'</p>

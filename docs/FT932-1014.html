			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / A rounded bloke at the Treasury: Kenneth Clarke outlines his views on taxes, the economy and the pound to Philip Stephens and Peter Norman Interviewing Mr Kenneth Clarke is a disarming experience. Chancellors tend to be cryptic and evasive. Their most characteristic skills are caution and a capacity to sidestep awkward questions. Pressed on interest rates, tax policy or the value of the pound, they frustrate their inquisitors with a frozen smile or an infuriating shrug. Mr Clarke is not like that. The 52-year-old scion of the industrial Midlands has built his political career on a bluntness born of abundant self-confidence. He prefers to say what he thinks rather than worry about how others might interpret it. He has a habit - rare in politics these days  -of saying the same in public as in private. His approach has brought grief during spells running most of Whitehall's big departments. At Westminster the Tory right wing still seethes over his decision in November 1990 to tell the wounded Mrs Margaret Thatcher he would resign unless she stood down. But the ups have far outweighed the downs. Mr Clarke now holds the second most powerful office in the land. He might yet realise his ambition to become prime minister. He does not intend to be cowed by the financial markets into Delphic obfuscation. In a hour-long discussion, he spelled out: why he might be forced to raise taxes in his November Budget. his intention to accelerate the reduction of the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. why he had not cut interest rates; and how his preference for a managed exchange rate would influence policy towards sterling. He said he wanted to change the culture of the Treasury and explained why he intended to 'sit on the fence' in the debate over independence for the Bank of England. But above all, Mr Clarke explained the politics which drives his economics: why he had changed the rhetoric of policy making. His starting point was simple. It became a recurring theme. He had no intention of being mesmerised by the Treasury's monetary's motorways or the preoccupations of City scribblers. They were important, but: 'The Chancellor of the Exchequer is essentially a political post.' From that perception flowed the central ambition of his chancellorship: 'I regard the whole object of economic policy as making it easier for the wider world, particularly the business community, to deliver greater wealth, more employment and so on.' Mr Clarke paused, perhaps in case the mandarins took fright. He was not abandoning the strategy of his luckless predecessor, Mr Norman Lamont. He was as committed as anyone to sustaining low inflation. He was pledged also to his 'obvious, screaming, day-to-day task' of tackling the deficit: 'Not just talking about it - but taking necessary action to get it down.' But the Treasury had other roles. It should be constructive, instead of simply 'spending its whole life saving money'. Above all, Mr Clarke wanted to 'relate all we do to the real economy, to commerce, business, creation of wealth, creation of jobs'. But how confident was he that Mr Lamont's green shoots are now firmly rooted? Was the present inflation rate of 1.3 per cent - the lowest for nearly 30 years - one of those infamous 'blips'? There was a note of caution. He had been restrained in his claims about the economic upturn. But then: 'I think the recovery is steady, I mean it's not so patchy as it was. The news has all been consistent for some time now. There was evidence of a fallback in one or two areas in April but nothing to disturb the underlying trend. We do appear to have a recovery. It's not very strong, but it looks like it's going to be sustained.' He would not offer a personal forecast. But there was a hint that growth might outpace the predictions set out in Mr Lamont's March Budget: 'In so far as people are revising their forecasts for the growth of the UK economy they tend to be revising them upwards . . . I take comfort from that.' Mr Clarke appeared sanguine about prices: 'As far as inflation is concerned there are no signs of any inflationary pressures of any kind coming through in any of the data that I have.' Not that he was complacent: past devaluations had too easily translated into higher prices. But 'we have a refreshingly low level of pay settlements, a reasonably low level of inflationary expectations so far. Therefore on that front I am reasonably relaxed.' But on one subject Mr Clarke had no cause for optimism. A Pounds 1bn-a-week borrowing requirement is unsustainable. He knows it. So he first protested that: 'From the word go I have been saying . . . recovery in itself is not going to solve the problem of the public finances.' Nor did he take much comfort from Mr Major's oft-repeated assertion, blaming 70 per cent of the deficit on the recession. It was a 'guesstimate'. What matters more 'is how much of the deficit will be reduced by recovery if we can sustain it'. Then came a significant policy announcement - the sort you would expect in an important set-piece speech to the City rather than in a interview. Mr Clarke declared that the medium-term profile for the borrowing requirement set out by Mr Lamont - reducing it to 4 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97 - was not good enough. 'Where we stand at the moment, the situation appears to be: that on this year's (March) Budget, on this year's public spending remit, on the current forecast of growth, the forecast I have indicates that the deficit is too high.' Mr Clarke intended to accelerate the pace of reduction. There are only three ways he can achieve his ambition. By cutting spending further, by raising taxes or by securing faster economic growth. The chancellor ruled out the first. He does not intend to reduce public spending below the ceilings agreed recently by the cabinet - they were tough but realistic. So either the economy has to grow faster than predicted or Mr Clarke has to add more tax increases to those already in place. He agreed that was what he meant. 'The stronger or more sustained growth becomes, the less likely I am to look at the tax side of the account. If growth shows signs of faltering or weakening the more likely I am to look for revenue. Its about as Delphic as I can put it.' There were caveats here. The chancellor interjected that his judgment was based on present forecasts for growth. His answers betrayed a hope that, come November, he will be able to be more optimistic. He would probably make his final judgment three or four weeks before the Budget: 'Then I'll be able to see where we are in anticipating growth, where we are on the public sector borrowing requirement, forecasts of it, and take a judgment about whether we need some revenue to help speed up tackling the deficit.' He was not enthusiastic about the idea of raising taxes. His own instincts were to cut them. But he had to face up to reality. But why had he not demanded deeper cuts in public spending? Three reasons. The existing ceilings were much tougher than generally realised. Spending was now set to grow by far less than GDP. He also wanted a settlement that was deliverable - not a short-term fix which would quickly unravel. Third, Mr Clarke made clear he believes in public spending. Its purpose is not simply to buy votes: 'The reason for going for public expenditure is because you are committed to certain public programmes which you are bound to deliver. And the objective of the government is to deliver what it said it was going to deliver in a cost-effective way within whatever you judge the country can afford.' Then came a sideswipe: 'If you just look at the financial pages, I sometimes think public spending remits are regarded as a test of the government's machismo. This is fine for some bloke who spends his entire life writing - with the greatest respect - for financial readers. It is no way to run a democratic state.' So what taxes would be raised if needs be? There were one or two clues to what he probably would not do. Mr Lamont had hinted he might raise corporate taxes. This seemed to be 'uncharacteristic kite-flying'. Mr Clarke went back to the strength of the recovery. 'If we don't have a very strong recovery . . . I don't begin by looking at raising extra taxation from the corporate sector.' He was more equivocal about whittling away mortgage interest relief. A quick dismantling looks unlikely. 'I've no doubt it's something I shall look at in due course, but the idea that it's an easy thing just get rid of it . . . just seems to be currently flavour of the month.' It was time to talk about the exchange rate. Mr Clarke accepts that Britain is unlikely to return to the European exchange rate mechanism this side of the next general election but made no secret still of his preference for a managed, stable pound. So does he intend, like Mr Nigel Lawson, to shadow the D-Mark? 'Straight answer - no. Nigel's experience of shadowing the D-Mark, whilst noble at the time, I think he would accept, did not succeed.' He does not think the exchange rate is 'one of those things that can just be left to find its own level'. But 'for every conceivable reason we are not going to be in the fixed rate exchange rate system for some years to come, and I think therefore it's a mistake to somehow shadow some currency in the ERM or try to allow the exchange rate to dominate policy compared with all other indicators once you're outside'. He added: 'I'm not sitting here at the moment thinking I want to see the pound stronger against the DM or I want to see the pound weaker against the DM, I'm not sitting here saying that.' The discussion moved on to the idea of an independent Bank of England. Two out of the last three chancellors have made public pleas for day-to-day control of monetary policy to be passed to the Bank. Mr Clarke said he would listen carefully to the debate - 'Yes, I'm sitting on the fence' - before making up his mind. But 'there's nothing that's going to happen in a hurry on the central bank front'. More important than the institutional arrangements was the need to ensure that the right decisions were made over interest rates: 'It doesn't matter who the hell takes the decision,' he said. So what about interest rates - why has he not given a further boost to economic activity by lowering borrowing costs. He sees no reason to do so: 'I haven't cut interest rates because I don't think the indicators we use would suggest that we should. I certainly would not just cut interest rates to go for a quick kick-start to the recovery, because I think that would have inflationary implications and I am determined to keep to low inflation.' The trade deficit - at present running at between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 20bn a year - troubles Mr Clarke. He did not think there would be any problem in financing it. 'What concerns me about it, obviously, is what it tells us about competitiveness. I think it shows we have to do a lot more on the supply side of the economy.' The interview has been running for an hour. Mr Clarke has not paused once to consult his papers or check his figures with the attendant Treasury official. There is time (but not space in this account) for him to reiterate his instinctive pro-Europeanism and for him to return to the theme that industry and industrialists count. But the abiding impression that Mr Clarke leaves is of his determination to broaden the Treasury's role - to return it to the real world. It needs to be more constructive and positive in setting the government's priorities. 'Candle-ends matter but guys here are too bright as to bother all the time about candle-ends.'</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Body Shop claims 'libel' cut profits A TELEVISION programme that questioned the commitment to animal welfare of The Body Shop, the natural toiletries and cosmetics group, cost the company Pounds 463,000, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr Gordon Roddick, The Body Shop chairman, and Mrs Anita Roddick, managing director, are suing Channel 4 and Fulcrum Productions for libel over the programme broadcast in the Dispatches series last year. Cross-examined by Mr Richard Rampton QC, for the defendants, Mr Roddick said pre-tax profits for the first six months of the 1992-93 financial year were Pounds 930,000 lower than the previous year. He said the company was claiming that Pounds 463,000 in lost profits - including Pounds 360,000 from that period - was attributable to the programme. The defendants deny libel. The hearing was adjourned until today.</p>

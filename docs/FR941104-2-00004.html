All loan advances made during fiscal year 1994 under bank loans approved during or after fiscal year 1992 shall bear interest at the rate of 6.40% (the financing account rate). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The calculation of the Bank's cost of money rates for fiscal year 1994 for the liquidating account and the financing account are provided in Tables 1a and 1b. Since the calculated rates are greater than the minimum rate (5.00%) allowed under 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(A), the cost of money rates for the liquidating account and financing account are set at 6.15% and 6.40%, respectively. The methodology required to calculate the cost of money rates is established in 7 CFR 1610.10(c). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Matthew P. Link, Director, Rural Telephone Bank Management Staff, Rural Electrification Administration, room 2832, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, telephone number (202) 720&hyph;0530. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (``Credit Reform'') (2 U.S.C. 661a,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ) implemented a system to reform the budgetary accounting and management of Federal credit programs. Bank loans approved on or after October 1, 1991, are accounted for in a different manner than Bank loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992. As a result, the Bank must calculate two costs of money rates: (1) The cost of money rate for advances made from the liquidating account (advances made during fiscal year 1994 on loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992) and (2) the cost of money rate for advances made during fiscal year 1994 on loans approved on or after October 1, 1991 (otherwise referred to as loans from the financing account). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cost of money rate methodology is the same for both accounts. It develops a weighted average rate for the Bank's cost of money considering total fiscal year loan advances; the excess of fiscal year loan advances over amounts received in the fiscal year from the issuances of Class A, B, and C stocks, debentures and other obligations; and the costs to the Bank of obtaining funds from these sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Sources and Costs of Funds_Liquidating Account <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During fiscal year 1994, the Bank was authorized to pay the following dividends: The dividend on Class A stock was 2.00% as established in amended section 406(c) of the Rural Electrification Act; no dividends were payable on Class B stock as specified in 7 CFR 1610.10(c); and the dividend on Class C stock was established by the Bank at 7.5%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with Section 406(a) of the RE Act, the Bank did not issue Class A stock in fiscal year 1994. Total advances for the purchase of Class B stock and cash purchases for Class B stock were $2,110,537. Rescissions of loan funds advanced for Class B stock amounted to $1,679,067. Thus, the amount received by the Bank from the issuance of Class B stock, per 7 CFR 1610.10(c), was $431,470 ($2,110,537&hyph;1,679,067). The total amount received by the Bank in fiscal year 1994 from the issuance of Class C stock was $16,590. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank did not issue debentures or any other obligations related to the liquidating account in fiscal year 1994. Consequently, no cost was incurred related to the issuance of debentures subject to 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> COASTAL STRIP MAY BE FOCUS OF LEGAL BATTLE  </P> <P> More than 26 acres of pristine coastal parkland across Coast Highway from the  Ritz-Carlton hotel may be the site of the next round of legal battles between  the feuding cities of Dana Point and Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> The Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District, which manages parkland for the  city of Dana Point, announced last week that its board had voted to sue the  Laguna Niguel Community Services District to gain control of the property,  called Sea Terrace Park.  </P> <P> The pending legal action is the latest round in the dispute between the two new  cities over a 1.5-mile coastal strip of about 850 acres. That property, which  includes the parkland, originally was under the sphere of influence of Laguna  Niguel but was transferred to Dana Point in 1988 by the Local Agency Formation  Commission.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel challenged LAFCO's reorganization of the city boundaries in court  and lost. The Superior Court ruling upholding LAFCO is now before the 4th  District Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> While LAFCO has determined that the parkland belongs in Dana Point, the legal  title to the property remains in the hands of the Laguna Niguel Community  Services District. The failure to relinquish that title is what prompted the  planned lawsuit, said William Wilcoxen, attorney for the Capistrano Bay Park  and Recreation District.  </P> <P> "We think that, as lawsuits go, this is a pretty clear issue," Wilcoxen said.  "LAFCO issued an order and they didn't follow it."  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel City Atty. Terry Dixon said the city is awaiting outcome of the  appeal before making any further moves. "I don't really understand why anyone  is filing a lawsuit now," Dixon said. "Our attitude is that they know there is  litigation pending regarding the reorganization. Given the outcome of that  litigation, we'll be glad to cooperate with them."  </P> <P> Sea Terrace Park was dedicated for public park use by the county in 1981 as  part of the approval process for development surrounding the park. The  agreement included a stipulation that the park be developed at no cost to the  public.  </P> <P> At that time, however, the county did not take title to the land. The Laguna  Niguel Community Services District did take title in July, 1988, a month after  Dana Point residents voted to incorporate, but before the city formally came  into existence in January, 1989.

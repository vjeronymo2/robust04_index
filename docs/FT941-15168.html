			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Management: Poacher turned TV star - Do headhunters deserve their BBC image Simon Hall puts down his glass of champagne and frowns. Uneasy at the length of time his visitor has spent in the Gents, he sets off to find him. Hall opens the lavatory door and recoils in horror. The visitor, the senior partner at Dunwoody Standish, is lying on the floor in a pool of blood with both wrists cut. Last night's episode of Headhunters, a new BBC drama, does not present the trade in its most flattering light. Hall works for one of London's foremost headhunting firms, where he spends his time on the mobile phone in constant search of bodies to 'poach'. A client wants to hire an entertainment lawyer: Hall does better by persuading him to poach a whole team. When the head of the old law firm finds out that his valuable assets are about to leave he is so upset he kills himself. Headhunters have never been the most respected profession, but the message from the BBC seems to be that their ruthless tactics are pushing them to new depths of unpopularity. Tim Clark, an expert on headhunters at the Open University, argues that the business does not deserve a bad name. He says that from the beginning people have viewed headhunting as a secretive, underhand business, disliking the process by which individuals are approached discreetly and persuaded to move jobs. 'It's an easy industry to pick on. So much of the business is confidential. People don't know the full facts.' So what are the facts? Is there a moral problem with poaching? Might it be the responsibility of the headhunter to think about the mess that a person leaves behind when they change jobs? 'The work is very sensitive,' says Ian Butcher of Whitehead Mann. 'You can create problems if you take out key people. But most senior businessmen recognise that that is part of the game. In any case, our loyalty is to the client.' Far from feeling on the defensive, headhunters view what they are doing with an almost missionary zeal. Paul Buchanan-Barrow of Korn/Ferry says he is 'helping clients to make the best use of really excellent people, and helping people use their full potential'. Miles Broadbent of Norman Broadbent agrees that 'a successful headhunter provides an opportunity for someone capable of being a chief executive to become one'. He lists successful British managers including Sir Colin Marshall at British Airways and Michael Harris at Mercury as among those headhunted into their jobs with great effect. The business was not always thus. Headhunting was unheard of in Britain until 1961 when Peter Brooke, a young aristocrat who is now a government minister, set up a British office for the US firm Spencer Stuart. Three decades later the UK executive recruitment market - which includes both search (headhunting) and selection (advertising) - is worth about Pounds 500m a year. These days most companies use headhunters to fill any post that carries a salary of more than Pounds 70,000. Eton College, the England football team, the government and the Royal Family use headhunters. Even headhunters use headhunters. Although the business has taken a knock during the recession, growth is forecast. Korn/Ferry boasts that its business is already running at 30 to 40 per cent above the levels of a year ago. The business has grown partly because senior employees no longer feel unshakeable loyalty to their employers. Yet most do not reply to advertisements, partly because they have no time to comb through them, and partly because they are nervous about being found out. But even if headhunters add vital oil to the system, it might be argued that they are overpaid for what they do. Top headhunters earn Pounds 250,000 or more a year, while a middling one might be on a basic salary of Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 70,000 with a bonus worth the same again. Their charges to clients are correspondingly high: a fee on success might be between 25 and 40 per cent of the first year's salary. According to Clark, the largest fee earned on a single appointment in the UK is Pounds 700,000. Hardly surprisingly, headhunters themselves - most of whom are mid-career, and sometimes have impressive CVs of their own - think they deserve their heavy pay packets. Broadbent compares using a headhunter with using a solicitor to do conveyancing. 'You want to make sure it is properly done,' he says. A good headhunter must be able to understand exactly what the client wants, and reason with them if the brief is unrealistic. Broadbent has a database of 8,000 to 10,000 possible candidates, and says: 'It is our job to know who is potentially movable.' For any given appointment he might start with a list of 50 to 100 names, which he would pare down between four and six to present to the client. 'We get paid the fee for saving them time chasing around,' he says. Kim Owen-Browne, who runs his own headhunting company, explains that getting the right people involves careful work. He says it is essential to get to know the candidate, which means talking to people who have been their bosses, their peers and who have worked for them. This endless sifting through CVs and interviews makes headhunting a strange job, not as glamorous as is sometimes thought. According to Buchanan-Barrow, the endless wining and dining of possible candidates is a fiction: he is more likely to be having early morning assignations with people at faceless hotels on the M25 than lunching at the Ritz. Even though headhunters collectively might not command the greatest respect, individual headhunters tend to find themselves popular wherever they go. 'Nobody puts the phone down on them. Not even the prime minister or chairmen of big companies. That was what I found so fascinating,' says Bill Bryden, executive producer of the BBC series. The synopsis for the rest of his television series tells of a mid-life crisis and an escape by Hall to the country in search for his spiritual self. Headhunters may view the next instalments with detachment. They think they have found their spiritual selves already.</p>

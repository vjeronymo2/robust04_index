			<p>BFN     [Text] A politician in the Second Republic, (Malam Mohamed  Tukur Abdulai), has advised those calling for a jihad in the  country to desist from such calls. (Malam Mohammed), who is a  member of the Conflict Resolution and Peace-Building Forum in  Kaduna State, said in a statement that only the Sultan of Sokoto  could make such a call in consultation with the Council ulemas.  He said jihad could only be prosecuted within the framework  provided by Islam, and records have shown that even Prophet  Mohammed fought the Holy War due to severe persecution he and  his followers suffered at the beginning. (Malam Mohammed) noted  that Muslims in the country have been enjoying freedom of  worship and were not in any way persecuted. (Malam Mohammed)  called on the government to punish any persons caught supporting  the jihad campaign.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "In the Corridors of </F> Power": "It Is a Dark Night in the Russian Federation Procuracy"]    [Text] After the unexpected resignation of A.  Kazannik, Aleksey Ilyushenko was appointed acting general  procurator of the Russian Federation. His name is linked in the  mind of many people with the so-called "Rutskoy case." Let us  recall that the case went into high gear along with the  intensification of the political crisis and involved charges of  corruption against the former vice president. It was alleged  that he had something to do with foreign currency accounts in  Switzerland, as well as ownership of the Trade Links company.  But is it legitimate to assume that A. Ilyushenko's appointment  is associated only with the "Rutskoy case"?    This is what we have been able to find out in the  general procuracy from various sources, since A. Ilyushenko  himself refrains from comment.    On the eve of the elections and referendum on 12 December,  the Moscow procuracy closed the corruption case against A.  Rutskoy. Note that public comments on this event came from  investigator M. Slinko instead of Moscow Procurator G.  Ponomarev, who chose to remain silent. Then the "case" went for  review by the General Procuracy-- the sphere of supervision of  A. Kazannik (whose principled stance we all seemed to have seen  proof of). After that, three top specialists independently come  to the conclusion that "...the decision to close the criminal  case regarding A. Rutskoy should be revoked... The General  Procuracy should be tasked with further investigation of the  criminal case by reason of the scale of the criminal case and a  large number of questions requiring establishment of contacts on  a federal level. I. Bobrovskiy, the general procurator's  assistant for special tasks." 31 January 1994.    This document, as well as a number of others, prompted A.  Kazannik to speak up at the General Procuracy collegium at the  end of February. "Three of our best specialists, for the purpose  of ensuring legitimacy, studied the materials independently of  one another. All of them came to the conclusion that the Moscow  City Procuracy did not answer a single question. In addition,  the investigation had been conducted with gross violations of  the norms of criminal law, in particular, Article 67 of the  Russian Federation Criminal Process Code... Moscow investigators  are threatening to charge persons who have handed over documents  with slander. I am not sure, however, who should be charged  under Article 130 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code."    The aforementioned Moscow procuracy investigators were not  present at the collegium. Moscow Procurator G. Ponomarev,  however, was present and sat in the presidium. He, however,  remains silent to this day. The man who is still talking is the  same M. Slinko, with respect to whom the principled A. Kazannik  had his doubts.    All in all, after a number of meetings with procuracy staff  one gets the impression that the procuracy, torn apart by  politicians, is now completely demoralized. Despite the experts'  conclusion and A. Kazannik's statement, six volumes of the  "Rutskoy case" ended up in the General Procuracy, and another 10  volumes--in the Moscow City Procuracy... There is every reason  to believe, however, that the conclusions of A. Kazannik's  commission will indeed prevail and "the case of A. Rutskoy's  trust" will be brought to a logical conclusion. In any case,  Canadian notary public Chapnik, who continues to maintain that  he had notarized genuine documents with a genuine signature, is  at this point well and alive. Besides, it is possible that after  the conversation with Russian investigators, Chapnik himself  will come under charges of perjury. Then he will face criminal  prosecution in Canada.</p>

Century Life, a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Iowa, entered into a permanent affiliation with CUNA Mutual Life Insurance Society (``CUNA Mutual'') on July 1, 1990. Applicants state that the terms of the ``Agreement of Permanent Affiliation'' provide for the following: Financial sharing between Century Life and CUNA Mutual of future individual life insurance business through reinsurance arrangements; joint development of business plans and systems for the distribution of individual insurance and other financial service products within the credit union movement; and, sharing of certain resources and facilities. All of the directors of Century Life are also directors of CUNA Mutual and many of the senior executive officers of Century Life hold similar positions with CUNA Mutual. Applicants state that the affiliation is not a merger or a consolidation and that both Century Life and CUNA Mutual remain separately owned by their respective contract owners who retain voting rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Account, established by Century Life on December 14, 1993 as a separate investment account under Iowa law, serves as a funding medium for certain flexible premium individual deferred variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts''). Applicants state that the Account meets the definition of a ``separate account'' under the federal securities laws. The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The application incorporates by reference the registration statement, currently on file with the Commission (File No. 33&hyph;73738), for the Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Account currently has five subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in the shares of a designated investment portfolio of the Ultra Series Fund (the ``Fund''). The Fund, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. The Fund currently has six investment portfolios, five of which offer their shares to the Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Contracts may be purchased on a nontax qualified basis (the ``Nonqualified Contracts'') or they may be purchased in connection with retirement plans, including retirement programs described in sections 401(a) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), or as individual retirement annuities that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment under section 409 of the Code (together, the ``Qualified Contracts''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. CUNA Brokerage Services, Inc. (``CUNA Brokerage'') acts as the principal underwriter, as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Contracts pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement between Century Life and CUNA Brokerage. The principal business address of CUNA Brokerage is the same as that of CUNA Mutual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

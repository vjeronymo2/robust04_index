			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: PRODUCERS FLEE HOLLYWOOD FOR THE BEACH  </P> <P> Whenever New York ad agency hotshots would come to visit director Fred  Petermann at his TV commercial production company in Hollywood, they always  wanted to go outside for walks in the California sunshine.  </P> <P> Once outside, however, the East Coast clients often found themselves surrounded  by dirty air, ugly buildings and people asking them for spare change. It was as  if they'd never left New York.  </P> <P> "When you walked out the front door of our office, there was nowhere to go,"  said Petermann, who has directed commercials for American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph Co. and Budweiser and is regarded as one of the best in the business.  Last year, Petermann left Hollywood after 16 years and rented space in Venice.  He is awaiting completion of a plush, new Santa Monica office building that he  will move into in December. "I just didn't want to be in Hollywood anymore."  </P> <P> He has plenty of company. The major movie studios abandoned Hollywood years  ago, and only Paramount remains. Now, many production companies that specialize  in making TV commercials are doing the same thing. They are cruising to the  beach towns of Santa Monica and Venice. Luring them are new luxury hotels, fine  restaurants and hip art galleries. Also, many top directors have moved to the  area -- and a gaggle of hip ad agencies has also set shop there. Then, there's  that keen desire to at least appear to be where the action is.  </P> <P> "It's a theme park for clients," explained Gary Buonanno, executive producer at  Michael/Daniel Associates, which moved from Hollywood to Studio City three  years ago and is now looking to relocate in Santa Monica. The company has  filmed commercials for Bud Light.  </P> <P> "When clients come to California, they don't want to be trapped in town. They  want to feel like they're really in California," said Gary Feil, executive  producer at BFCS, which has filmed ads for the California Lottery, and which  opened in Santa Monica two months ago.  </P> <P> One production company that recently moved to the beach even placed bicycles  and roller skates in its office for clients to use. So popular have the beach  towns become that over the past year at least six commercial production  companies have moved from -- or announced plans to move from -- Hollywood.  Besides Petermann Films, Michael/Daniel Associates and BFCS, plenty of others  have their cameras focused on the Westside.  </P> <P> Riverrun Films, which filmed those "Getting to Know You" ads for Geo  automobiles, may soon move from Hollywood to Venice. Image Point Productions,  which has filmed some of those roving red dot commercials for 7-Up, plans to  move from Hollywood within the next six months -- probably to the Westside. And  six months ago, Chelsea Pictures, which has filmed "Heartbeat of America" ads  for Chevrolet, left Hollywood for Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Others have been there for some time, including De Sort Films, which moved  there 11 years ago, Cucoloris Productions and Berkofsky/Barrett Productions.  Perhaps the most sought-after director in the business, Joe Pytka, moved his  commercial production company there in 1985. "I was enchanted by Venice because  of its art community," said Pytka, who has directed many of Nike's Bo Jackson  ads, as well some of the Pepsi ads that feature Michael Jackson and Madonna.  "The creative atmosphere was like New York's Soho district 15 years ago."  </P> <P> But today, creativity is hardly mentioned by most.  </P> <P> "It's totally an image thing," said Steven Monkarsh, executive producer at  Riverrun Films. "The commercial production companies have finally caught up  with the art community."  </P> <P> Some say the lure is the trend-setting Los Angeles ad agencies -- such as  Chiat/Day/Mojo, Suissa &amp; Associates and the Shalek Agency -- that have  moved to the area. "If ad agencies moved to the Mojave Desert, it wouldn't be  long until we moved there," said Michael Romersa, chief operating officer of  Partners USA, a production company moving to Santa Monica. Partners, which has  filmed ads for Giorgio perfume, also owns Michael/Daniel.  </P> <P> "It's the cool place to be," said Jonathan Miller, president of Image Point  Productions. "Certainly, the advertising business is all about image and  perception. If you're perceived to be doing trendy things, it doesn't hurt."  </P> <P> Adds John Marias, executive producer at Chelsea Pictures, "This area is fun.  Hollywood is an ordeal."  </P> <P> All of this is frustrating officials from Hollywood. "That's the challenge of  being in Hollywood," said Larry Morris, president of the Hollywood Chamber of  Commerce. "Hollywood is a victim of its own success."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, executives at some commercial production companies that plan to stay  in Hollywood are bemused by the movement out of town.  </P> <P> "If the emperor is wearing all of his new clothes at the beach, that's fine  with me," said Larry Morris, chief financial officer at HKM Production, which  recently purchased and renovated a big building in Hollywood. "We're really  happy here. And we bought the building we're in for a song."  </P> <P> To the contrary, the real estate in Santa Monica and Venice is very pricey.  Executives interviewed said their rents or mortgage payments increased anywhere  from 25% to 100% once they made the move from Hollywood to the beach. Others  complain that parking near the beach is always scarce. And most still truck to  Hollywood to use sound stages or special vendors.  </P> <P> But that isn't stopping many from making the move. Even the West Coast  president of the Assn. of Independent Commercial Producers moved his commercial  production company, Smillie Films, from Hollywood to Santa Monica a year and a  half ago. "The reality is, most directors live in these areas," said Bill  Perna. "And they don't want to keep commuting to Hollywood."  </P> <P> Many trace the beginning of this trend back to 1979, when Jack De Sort was  among the very first to move his production company, De Sort Films, from  Hollywood to Santa Monica.  </P> <P> People told him he was crazy. After all, the business had always been in  Hollywood. "I wanted to get away from Hollywood," said De Sort, who  occasionally picnics on the roof of his office building that is one block from  the ocean. "I wanted to be where the air was clean."  </P> <P> </P> <P> J. W. Thompson Chief of L.A. Office Resigns  </P> <P> The fast pace of change at J. Walter Thompson's Los Angeles office continues.  </P> <P> In the past week, the agency picked up some badly needed new business but lost  the man who has run the Los Angeles office for the past eight years.  </P> <P> On Monday, the agency announced that James K. Agnew, who has been with the  agency for 20 years, was resigning "to pursue other career interests." Bill  Lane, executive vice president of JWT West, will assume Agnew's duties as  general manager of J. Walter Thompson/Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Lane returned to California in May after two years in New York as co-executive  creative director at a time when the Los Angeles office was losing ad business,  including the 20th Century Fox account. Agnew said he already had begun  exploring the possibility of a position in one of Thompson's international  offices when Lane returned "as part of an orderly succession."  </P> <P> When that failed to pan out, Agnew said he chose to resign. "I'm excited about  some of the opportunities that are available with my background," he said, "and  felt it was important to be open to discuss those opportunities."  </P> <P> Like other New York agencies that have opened Los Angeles offices, J. Walter  Thompson has been disappointed in the results.  </P> <P> Slowly, however, the Los Angeles office has been getting back on its feet. As a  result of several recent business wins, the agency has rehired four employees  that were laid off earlier in the year, Agnew said.  </P> <P> Last week, the agency picked up the new Los Angeles-based cruise company  Concorde Cruises. Agnew declined to reveal the size of the billings, but  industry sources estimate it at about $5 million annually.  </P> <P> Concorde's new, 352-passenger ship will start operations in December, 1991,  with seven-day cruises from Puerto Vallarta to Acapulco and Guatemala. Mexicana  Airlines, also a client of Thompson, will be the primary air carrier to Puerto  Vallarta. Print advertising for the new cruise line will probably begin this  winter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tracy-Locke Finds Life Beyond Taco Bell  </P> <P> Some are calling it the agency that refuses to die.  </P> <P> Back in April, the Los Angeles office of the Dallas ad agency Tracy-Locke lost  the $80-million national ad business for its biggest client, Taco Bell, to  Foote, Cone &amp; Belding's San Francisco office.  </P> <P> Massive layoffs followed. There were even rumors that the Los Angeles office  would close. But management staunchly denied that, citing the fact that it hung  onto the Mexican fast-food chain's $10-million regional business. Well, earlier  this month it lost that business, too.  </P> <P> Is the office doomed now? No way, insists Dan Michel, who joined the office as  president about a year and a half ago. "We take a long view of things," said  Michel. "And we think our chances for success here are terrific."  </P> <P> He may be right. Over the past six months the agency has picked up six new  clients, including Aqua Chem pool chemicals and Walt Disney Records. Michel  declined to reveal the combined billings of the new clients, but they are  believed to exceed $15 million annually.  </P> <P> "Taco Bell was a blessing and a burden at the same time," said Michel. "You  can't build an agency on a single client."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cycle Campaign Isn't a Case of Typecasting  </P> <P> No one's going to mistake Alan Pando for Evel Knievel.  </P> <P> But last week, the Moto du Monde (Motorcycles of the World) Grand Prix-style  racing series awarded its estimated $2-million advertising business to his  agency, the Los Angeles office of DDB Needham Worldwide. The agency will also  handle public relations for the new competition and seek out corporate  sponsors.  </P> <P> Pando, president of the agency's Western operations, recalls he has only ridden  a motorcycle once. "But I think they stopped making it after World War I," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> The Secret Life of Archie's Wife (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars  Jill Eikenberry as an unhappily married woman who falls in love with the inept  bank robber (Michael Tucker) who has kidnaped her.  </P> <P> Lethal Weapon (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a big, shallow, flashy buddy-buddy cop  thriller salvaged by the unpredictability of its star Mel Gibson and Danny  Glover as Gibson's apoplectic partner.  </P> <P> Stakeout (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is another high concept item -- detective falls  in love with a woman he has under surveillance -- but it too is brightened by  its stars, especially by Richard Dreyfuss as the detective and Madeleine Stowe  as the woman.  </P> <P> To Kill a Mockingbird (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) is the 1962 milestone film  in which Gregory Peck, in an Oscar-winning performance, stars as a small-town  Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of rape.  </P> <P> Jasmine Guy and Anna Maria Horsford star in A Killer Among Us (NBC Monday at 9  p.m.), about a young mother who starts her own manhunt after serving as a juror  on a murder trial and hearing the verdict.  </P> <P> Beetlejuice (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), an uproarious 1988 comedy, is a dazzling  display of director Tim Burton's unique pop culture sensibility. It's an  irresistible treat in which attractive, homespun ghosts Alec Baldwin and Geena  Davis wreak havoc on the relentlessly upscale new owners of their New England  home. With Michael Keaton as the decidedly weird "bio-exorcist" of the film's  title.  </P> <P> Biloxi Blues (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again Saturday at 6 p.m.) is Neil  Simon's recollection of his life as a 1945 Army recruit in the Deep South,  nostalgia with pinpricks of pain and a mood of hard-edged reverie that the  actors, especially Matthew Broderick as Simon's alter ego, seize upon.  </P> <P> The 1984 Missing in Action (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) has been shrewdly  tailored to Chuck Norris' stoic persona and physical skills, and it's one of  his best, an action-adventure that finds him on a secret mission to Vietnam to  rescue American soldiers still held captive there.  </P> <P> The slight possibility that three convicts who vanished from Alcatraz in 1962  didn't drown in San Francisco Bay provides the basis for the taut and dynamic  1979 Escape From Alcatraz (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.). Clint Eastwood stars  as the escapees' ringleader and once again is the archetypal strong man of few  words.  </P> <P> Braddock: Missing in Action III (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) finds Chuck  Norris' Braddock discovering his wife did not die in the fall of Saigon.  </P> <P> The 1982 Creepshow (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is a homage to the gory old  days of horror comics and has the look down pat. It's written by Stephen King  and directed by George Romero, but only one of the film's five episodes,  starring E. G. Marshall as a rich old misanthrope, really works.  </P> <P> William Friedkin's underrated To Live and Die in L.A. (Channel 5 Saturday at 8  p.m.) is a grim, bleak, harrowing true-life police drama close to the spirit  and impact of his "French Connection." With William L. Petersen and Willem  Dafoe.  </P> <P> Welcome to L.A. (Channel 28 Saturday at 11 p.m.), Alan Rudolph's multicharacter  1977 debut film, captures mesmerically the quality and style of life in the  City of Angels. Keith Carradine, Sally Kellerman, Geraldine Chaplin and Harvey  Keitel head the large cast.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the run-off in the Salvadoran  presidential elections scheduled for 24 April 1994.    Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique Borgo Bustamente,  presidential and vice presidential candidates, respectively, for  the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, campaigned over the  past weekend in Sonsonate, Santa Ana, San Vicente, and  Sensuntepeque. In Sonsonate Calderon Sol said that he wants to  win the run-off elections convincingly. He stated that "the  people must categorically show their disagreement with leftist  ideas." The candidate pointed out that he will continue to  develop the national reconstruction strategy and work for the  establishment of a state of law to generate trust in and respect  for the country's legal system. Calderon Sol praised the  "political maturity" of parties that will not be in the run-off  elections, but will support ARENA. Meanwhile, Borgo Bustamente  said that ARENA did not win the elections in the first round due  to "a legal technicality," and not because of lack of voter  support. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 11 Apr 94 p  5)    Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence Coalition, met  over the past weekend with groups that pledged support to his  coalition in the run-off elections. He held meetings in the  Municipalities of Ciudad Delgado, Mejicanos, Apopa, Ilopango,  and Soyapango, in San Salvador Department. Zamora added that he  has met with leaders of the Christian Democratic Party and Unity  Movement, but those parties decided to let their members vote  for whomever they wish. The candidate denied that fellow party  members voiced support for ARENA publicly, quite the contrary,  the coalition has identified "a natural increase in the number  of followers coming from parties that oppose ARENA." Zamora and  his vice presidential candidate Francisco Lima will make public  appearances next weekend in Santa Ana, San Salvador, Santa  Tecla, and San Miguel to close their campaign.

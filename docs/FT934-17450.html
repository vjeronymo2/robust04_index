			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UN chief seeks Libyan handover MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, was last night seeking an undertaking from Libya to set a time and place for the handover of two men suspected in the Lockerbie bombing. UN diplomats yesterday said Mr Boutros Ghali wanted a commitment to hand the pair over within two weeks. However, the diplomats confirmed that Britain, France and the US would this morning present a draft UN resolution calling for tougher sanctions against Libya, given Tripoli's failure to hand over the suspects before today's deadline, set by the three on August 13. The resolution will be circulated around the 15-member Security Council immediately, but is unlikely to go to a vote for up to two weeks. It calls for the freezing of liquid Libyan assets held overseas, estimated to be worth Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.2bn), and a ban on all exports of oil transit and refining equipment. Mr Boutros Ghali was due last night to hold his third meeting in a week with Mr Omar al-Muntasser, Libyan foreign minister, and hoped to receive the undertaking in a letter from the Libyans. The meeting follows a Libyan statement on Wednesday that the government 'had no objection' to handing over the two men for trial in a Scottish court, but that the decision to stand trial lay with the two men, Mr Abdel Baset Ali al-Meghrahi and Mr Amin Khalifa Fhimah. In Tripoli, lawyers for the two suspects said they would meet the men on Monday or Tuesday to offer advice as to whether, in their view, the pair would receive a fair trial in Scotland. 'It will then be up to them to decide,' Mr Ibrahim Legwell, one of a team of defence lawyers, told Reuters. British diplomats said last night they would become convinced of Tripoli's willingness to submit the two men to trial only when they were physically handed over. 'We're interested in actual activity, not just letters,' said one. But the sincerity of Libyan intentions was clouded slightly further yesterday by an attack in a Tripoli newspaper on the Foreign Ministry's stated willingness to allow the two men to be extradited.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: How 'Nimbies' will curb recovery A 'Nimby', for the benefit of non-British readers, is someone who says 'not in my backyard'. The word came into fashion in the 1980s to describe people who were all in favour of economic growth and housing development in general, but were fiercely opposed to it in their own vicinity. It has often been justified by high-sounding references to preserving rural England, maintaining local amenities and protecting areas of natural beauty. But in practice the most important force behind it has been people's urge to maintain and boost the value of their own property by suppressing new building which could bring down values. An occasional subsidiary motive has been a snobbish dislike of urban newcomers who might change the character of semi-rural or outer suburban areas. For the moment, Nimbyism is not a very live issue. Construction has lagged well behind the rest of the economy in its recovery from recession. So have house prices. After an initial small spurt at the beginning of 1994, house prices are now no higher than a year ago. This lack of a property boom so far is a good sign. Soaring domestic property values have been an unhealthy development in each of the last few booms. By giving rise to large paper gains in personal wealth, they stimulated consumer borrowing and then left behind a legacy of debt which prolonged the recession period. The property cycle is a magnified version of the general boom and bust cycle, and accounts for much of the latter's virulence. But the effects are not only cyclical. In the period 1968-88 the prices of new houses rose twice as fast as prices in general; and the price of housing land rose on average twice as fast as house prices themselves. The cumulative increase in the housing land price over the two decades was 350 per cent above inflation. The resulting real increase in housing costs has discouraged workers from moving to where the jobs are; it has increased the poverty of the less skilled and discouraged them from taking low-paid work. Housing market distortions are second only to labour market rigidities in causing structural unemployment. A sign of healthy and sustainable economic growth would be a long period in which houses were bought as homes and not as a speculation, in which houses became more affordable rather than less, and renting returned as a normal form of house tenure, especially suitable for younger and more mobile households. In the short term, the housing stock is fairly stable and house prices depend on demand. But the price of land has a big influence in the longer term. For it determines the prices at which builders can profitably increase the supply of dwellings to respond to rising demands. To the extent that land is pure space, its price depends on the amount released for new development. A study*, commissioned by the Department of the Environment itself, gives some estimates of the cost of Nimbyism. It rejects the extreme view that the planning system puts a straitjacket on the amount of land available for development. There are three elements of elasticity in the supply of land for house building. First, adjustments can be made to development plans at both the structure and the local level. For instance, the Berkshire plan for residential development was increased by the government in both 1983 and 1988 to allow for more housing. There has been some modest streamlining of the planning system. As a result of quicker decisions and improved organisation by house builders, the time taken for the supply of land to respond to an increase in demand has fallen from three years in the early 1970s to two years in 1990. Unfortunately, however, successive secretaries of state for the environment have become ever more restrictive in their willingness to release land for development. 'One nation Toryism' has been identified more and more with the interests of property holders in the shire counties and on the rural fringes of the conurbations. Scrubland, which few people want to look at or use for recreation, has been retained in green belts, along with areas such as the South Downs and the Cotswolds. A second element of elasticity is that additional housing land, known as 'windfall sites', can become available, even though they have not been marked as such on the development plans. In Surrey, in the five years up to 1988, nearly four-fifths of the land used for new housing came from this source. Third, there are 'brownfield sites', which consist of land already used for commercial or other urban purposes, but which becomes profitable to transfer to residential use as housing land prices rise. Nevertheless, the planning system has restricted the supply of building land. The conclusion of the DoE study is that land supply controls of all types have increased house prices in the south-east by 35 to 40 per cent, and by lower but still substantial amounts in areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside. The table shows the way this has worked. In Reigate and Wokingham - two semi-urban areas just outside London - plot values in 1990 were around half those of corresponding house prices. Without planning restrictions, the land would still have some value, which would be determined by what it would be worth for uses outside housing. (The study identifies this with the economists' idea of 'opportunity cost' - the value that the land has in its next best use.) It would be tempting to regard the next best use as being farming land, where the value is often one-thirtieth or one-fortieth of what it is when housebuilding is allowed. But the authors avoid this route because of the cost of preparing land for housing purposes. Instead, they estimate what a similar amount of land would cost in Barnsley, where the scarcity premium is regarded as low. This establishes a reservation price for what the land might fetch if there were no prospect of planning permission for development or redevelopment. This reservation price is subtracted from the actual price. The difference may be regarded as an estimate of the effect of the scarcity of housing land on house prices. It is put at 36 per cent for Reigate, 42 per cent for Wokingham - both just outside London in the south-east - and 16 per cent even for Beverley in eastern Yorkshire. The planning system affects the form as well as the amount of new developments. Because of the rising price of land, there has 'been a shift away from the production of bungalows and semi-detached houses towards flats and terraced houses'. Detached houses have also been designed to achieve high densities. So far as the system discourages development such as the cliff-top bungalows that disfigure the landscape east of Brighton, that is to the good. But the overall effects on house and land prices are less desirable. The DoE study does not make policy recommendations. But it is clear that any attempt at curbing future increases in land values would have to be at a national level. Within even a large area, such as the south-east, there is a great deal of substitution between different districts. For instance, an increased release of land in Wokingham would do little to curb land prices there, as new land would be snapped up by developers denied access elsewhere. The extra land would have to be available throughout the south-east. Ministers have, in their reaction, over-emphasised the fact that land for housing is physically available, which it always is for those willing to pay the market price. The question is whether that price is unnecessarily inflated by ill-conceived restrictions. *The Relationship Between House Prices and Land Supply, Gerald Eve, Cambridge Land Economy Dept, HMSO 1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The effect to land restrictions on house prices (1990)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      (1)        (2)        (3)        (4)       (5) Town                House       Plot    Value in   Difference   % of                     price      value   alternative             house                                           uses      (2)-(3)   (4)*(1)                   (pounds)    (pounds)  (pounds)    (pounds)    (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Reigate           140,000      69,000    19,000      50,500      36 Wokingham         115,000      60,500    12,000      48,500      42 Beverley          100,000      29,000    13,000      16,000      16  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Environment  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

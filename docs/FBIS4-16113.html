			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS -- "I believe Russia will  withdraw its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31," Enn Tupp, head of  the Estonian Defense Ministry defense policy department, told  BNS at a press conference today.    Tupp claimed the troop pullout cannot be stopped. Jyri Kork,  head of the defense forces general staff information department,  added that every week from 30 to 40 Russian military personnel  leave Estonia.    The Russian military staying in Estonia are a political toy,  just like the Skrunda radar facility in Latvia, Tupp noted.    The Russian delegation to the Estonian-Russian troop  withdrawal talks announced April 6 that Russia is not going to  pull out its troops from Estonia by the Aug. 31, 1994, deadline.  Russia also officially revoked the clause in the draft agreement  that established Aug. 31 as the withdrawal deadline.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Tuesday [4  January] announced the lifting of a ceiling on fresh credits  that commercial banks could extend to exporters.    In a statement carried by the Jordan News Agency, PETRA, CBJ  Governor Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi said the management of the  commercial banks could determine the volume of fresh credits  they could grant to exporters.    The move, Dr. al-Nabulsi explained, means that the credits  that banks may extend to exporters are not bound by the general  ceiling on fresh credits during the year as agreed by the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the economic restructuring  programme under way in Jordan.    He said the move came as part of the government's efforts to  encourage exports and was adopted in light of "the positive  changes witnessed in the monetary sector to conform to the CBJ's  tendency to have indirect controls over credits facilities  through the use of new monetary means such as certificates of  deposits in Jordanian dinars."    Another recent move by the government to encourage exporters  was the exemption of up to 70 per cent of exporters' profits  from income tax.    Banking officials said they had received a CBJ circular  informing of the relaxed credit regulations, which took effect  as of Jan. 1, 1994.    Dr. al-Nabulsi said the new regulations also replace earlier  standing rules which restricted banks from extending loans to  not more than 10 times their capital and reserves.    In the context of credits for exporters known as packing  credit in banking terms, the total amount extended should not  exceed 90 per cent of the bank's reserves.    The general ceiling on fresh commercial credits set by the  IMF for the year was JD 400 million--JD 335 million for the  private sector and the rest for the public sector.    But the ceiling was broken as a result of high demand--the  total of fresh commercial credit extended hit JD 360 million in  the first seven months of the year--prompting the CBJ to  introduce a series of restrictive measures.    The measures included the limits related to capital and  reserves of commercial banks and the banks' involvement in  trading in the Amman Financial Market.    Subsequently, the CBJ sought a higher ceiling and got IMF  approval for another JD 60 million that could be extended during  the last quarter of 1993 at a rate of JD 20 million per month.  Banks which had already broken the ceiling were excluded from  the addition.    However, bankers said the additional credit came too late  for  the market to utilise it since the financial year was drawing to  a close.    The ceiling is set as a percentatge of the gross domestic  product for the previous year.    The government has been trying to exclude credits extended  for industrial investment from the ceiling, arguing that such  investment had contributed to economic growth and would be  reflected in terms of increase in the gross domestic product.    But the IMF argued that it was too early for such an  exemption since Jordan was in the early stages of implementing  the economic restructuring programme.    It was likely that the IMF would respond positively to the  Jordanian request at a later stage in the second phase (1993-98)  of the restructuring programme.</p>

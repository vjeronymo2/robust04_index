			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: An artist but not a rebel / Obituary of Derek Jarman Derek Jarman, who died on Saturday, was that rarity in cinema: an independent film-maker who never sacrificed or hazarded his independence. His record attests to a stubborn refusal to 'sell out': no other director in our time has spent 20 years making acclaimed feature films without once reaching a budget of Pounds 1m. Yet in a movie age when the cry has been 'Is the money up on the screen?', with Jarman the answer was always yes. In early films like Jubilee and The Tempest, in late films like The Garden, Edward II and Wittgenstein, he rejected star-casting and multiple locations to film with largely unknown actors in tiny studios, abandoned warehouses or derelict country homes, borrowed or rented and dressed up in the colours of his imagination. The 'location' for Jarman's films was his own mind. He came to directing from painting and designing (opera, ballet, Ken Russell's The Devils) and he took the self-expressive spirit of the 1960s, the time of his studentship at the Slade School of Art, into virtually all his later films. These began as experimental shorts, shot on Super-8 and/or video to achieve Jarman's unique early style: a dream-like, blurry staccato like paintings shimmering into life. Later, some of the improvisatory style and demotic working methods of these shorts - diary-like records of friends and places Jarman loved - were transmuted into his feature films. His first, Sebastiane, was made with friends on a glorified working holiday in Sardinia: a gay confessio amantis thinly disguised as the story of a Roman saint and playfully scripted in dog Latin. This prototypical Jarman movie provoked the prototypical dual response from viewers: delight from fans and outrage from those offended by the male nudity, apparent plotlessness and historical/religious irreverence. Later Jarman films brought a similar blend of gay anarchy and licensed iconoclasm to Shakespeare (The Tempest), the Italian Renaissance (Caravaggio), 20th-century philosophy (Wittgenstein), the Bible (The Garden) and the English monarchy (Jubilee, Edward II). Jarman insisted that he was no rebel: just an artist claiming the right to survival and self-expression in a homophobic age; and the right to defend the England he loved - that of Shakespeare, English literature and painting, and the English countryside - by satirising the England he loathed. This, for him, was the wasteland of new Toryism as perceived and depicted in his anti-Thatcher broadside, The Last Of England. A residual division of style, though, stayed in Jarman's work throughout his career. While the free-form visual experimentation of his early shorts was carried over into the daring effects of films like Imagining October, The Angelic Conversation and The Last Of England, his films based on famous texts or famous lives were more linear and accessible. Even here, however, movie orthodoxy hardly threatened. Though the films had scripts and professional actors and were shot in 35mm, they still startled us with their seditious touches. Anachronism (motorbikes and pocket calculators in Caravaggio); music-hall burlesque (Elizabeth Welch singing 'Stormy Weather' at the close of The Tempest); gay agitprop (demos and banners in Edward II); rampant surrealism (a green Martian in Wittgenstein). Jarman's humour and his delight in tactical aesthetic outrage gives even his most 'serious' films the power of laughter and surprise. In his last years he was the least self-pitying of all artists struck by Aids. His will and stamina allowed him to carry on working long after doctors had despaired of his health. Even in Blue, his last, powerfully moving film, there is wit and wry defiance as Jarman's spoken thoughts and memories play over that single, unchanging colour on screen. Blue was for him the colour of infinity, the colour of favourite flowers, the colour of the landscape elements he loved (sea, sky). 'Blue', to those who knew him or his work, never seemed the colour of his mood or emotions, nor those of his films. He was the most affirmative iconoclast British cinema ever had.</p>

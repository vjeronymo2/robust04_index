			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Chorus of discontent grows in Romania: Government has survived, but only just Romania's minority government scraped through a no-confidence motion just before Christmas with a margin of 13 votes. But the closeness of the voting and the growing chorus of discontent means that pressure will continue to mount for the government to find solutions to the country's serious economic problems. Pro-reform opposition parties lodged the motion on grounds that the weak, left-wing, minority government had blocked economic reform, failed to control inflation or find an adequate exchange rate policy. They also accused the government of allowing state monopolies and corruption to strangle the economy during its one year in office. The vote took place against a backdrop of warning strikes and the biggest street demonstrations in three years. Trade union leaders backed the opposition motion and are threatening to call a general strike in mid-January if their demands for faster privatisation, higher pay and reforms of the social security system are not met. The opposition went ahead with the motion in spite of the government's recent breakthrough with the International Monetary Fund after months of negotiation. Many reformers doubt that the government led by the Party of Social Democracy in Romania, which relies on nationalists and former Communist parties to stay in power, has the will or ability to implement the package of reforms agreed with the IMF and World Bank. 'The government has two faces, like Janus. It says one thing to the IMF and World Bank and another at home which has led to contradictory policies. It has shown clearly over the past year that it is against reform. Its aim is to keep the status quo and to protect state property,' says Mr Varujan Vosganian, an opposition MP. Others hope an agreement with the IMF, which would unlock Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) of badly-needed loans from the Fund over the next 18 months, will give a new impetus to reformers within the government. The reform camp is now led by Mr Mircea Cosea, the economic reform minister. He is leading the battle against conservatives headed by the prime minister, Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, a Communist-era official who spent the last years of the Ceausescu regime working at the central economic planning committee. With the economy in a worst state than that of any other in central Europe (outside former Yugoslavia) there appear to be few tolerable alternatives to rapid implementation of the reform programme. The priority is to prevent the country from slipping into hyperinflation. Consumer price inflation rose from 200 per cent in 1992 to 314 per cent in the year to October. The delay in imposing financial discipline on highly-indebted state concerns is one reason for high inflation. But many economists say the chief cause in recent months has been the population's expectation of continuous price rises which has also further reduced confidence in the leu, the national currency, creating a dangerous spiral. Another key aim of the programme is to allow the leu to float early next year. The government's refusal to liberalise the exchange rate pushed the black market rate to 1,700 to the dollar from 600 at the beginning of the year, and kept more than 80 per cent of hard currency transactions in the parallel economy, according to central bank officials. The government has also assured the IMF and World Bank that it will accelerate privatisation after a year in which the authorities sold off only 220 small companies, compared with a target of 800-1,000. They also failed to liquidate a single bankrupt medium-sized or large state enterprise. Such measures are essential if Romania is to gain the confidence of foreign investors and attract the capital and know-how needed to turn round its economy. This year's delay in undertaking reform has led to a drop in direct foreign investment. Only Dollars 205m has been committed compared with Dollars 270m in 1992, according to Romanian Development Agency figures. The government must also move quickly to boost public morale. The tens of thousands of weary Romanians who have recently protested on the streets are in sharp contrast to the jubilant crowds which four years ago overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu. Real wages have fallen by 45 per cent since 1989, according to official statistics, and as living standards continue to drop, many show nostalgia for what seems like the security of the past.</p>

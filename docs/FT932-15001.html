			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: South Africa JOHANNESBURG marked gold shares down in relatively thin trade, anticipating US selling after yesterday's mass stayaway. The gold index lost 51, or 4.2 per cent, to 1,167 in spite of a stronger gold price and a weaker financial rand. The overall index was 31 points lower at 3,498 with industrials, finding support from rand-hedge shares, losing only 13 to 4,340.</p>

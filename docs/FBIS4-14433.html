			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Republic of Ingushetia"]    [Text] According to a report from the press service of the  permanent mission of the Republic of Ingushetia under the  Russian Federation president, the meeting of working groups of  the conciliation commission for Ingushetia and North Ossetia  scheduled in the town of Terek (Kabardino-Balkaria) for 29 March  did not take place owing to the Vladikavkaz delegation's failure  to appear. The Ingush delegation returned to Nazran. Earlier,  Republic of Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev forwarded to  Akhsarbek Galazov, head of the Republic of North Ossetia, a  package of proposals on a settlement of relations between the  two republics. Since terms for the return of Ingush refugees to  North Ossetia and preparations for a meeting between the  Republic's leaders early in April were supposed to form the main  topic of the talks in Terek, in the Ingush side's assessment the  failure of the North Ossetia delegation to come to the talks can  be assessed as "boycotting the process of normalizing the  situation in the region."</p>

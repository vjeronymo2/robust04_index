China's 900 million farmers will face a "severe overall  shortage" of fertilizers and other means of production this  spring, said State Councillor Chen Junsheng at a national  conference on the supply of means of agricultural production.    The main suppliers of the country's means of production, the  domestic trade departments, have bought much less than for last  year and have less in stock, Chen said.    The number of the country's fertilizer plants has shrunk,  and  high-quality fertilizer is more urgently needed, he said, noting  that imported fertilizers have not come as expected.    Chen said that domestic trade bodies must resort to all  possible means to provide enough for the farmers for the spring  ploughing.    He said that good market order should be maintained. Any  profiteer who infringes upon the interests of farmers will be  prosecuted to the full extent of the law.    Fake and shoddy goods must be barred from the market, so  that  high quality means of production can be ensured for farmers, he  said.    He also encouraged the domestic trade departments to reduce  circulation costs and offer reasonable prices that farmers can  afford.</p>

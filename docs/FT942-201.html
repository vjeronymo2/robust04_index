			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Labour in eve-of-poll row over Monklands spending The Labour campaign for the Monklands East by-election was thrown into chaos on the eve of the poll yesterday as a leading Scottish Labour MP first attacked the party's candidate over the crucial issue of Monklands District Council, then made a hasty retraction. The row broke just as Labour for the first time said it was poised to hold the seat in the face of a strong challenge from the Scottish National party. It is defending a majority of nearly 16,000. Yesterday the Glasgow Evening Times published an article by Mr Jimmy Wray, MP for Glasgow Provan, in which he challenged Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate, over her statement last week that Airdrie, the centre of Monklands East, was discriminated against in allocations of capital spending by Monklands council compared with neighbouring Coatbridge. However two-and-half hours after the article appeared Mr Wray issued a statement saying he had now examined the figures for council spending in Airdrie and Coatbridge used by Mrs Liddell and said she was right. Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, said the entire Labour line on the Monklands council issue was a fraud.</p>

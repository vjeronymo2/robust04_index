			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Facing up to life's problems - Why disclosure can be a virtue for insurers Life insurance companies face a huge challenge next year when the UK's new regulatory regime for the industry comes into effect. But according to the organisers of a seminar in London today* the mandatory disclosure of commissions and other policy details should be seen as a marketing opportunity, not a threat. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, has made compulsory from January 1 both the design and the use of a 'key features' document giving details of costs, charges and the risks in taking out a policy. Companies' responses to this new demand - how they redesign their products, for example to spread charges and commissions, and how they incorporate the new document into their agents' sales pitch - will be a sign of how flexible they really are. Many life companies have previously regarded new regulatory requirements as part of their problem rather than part of any solution. So it is perhaps quixotic of marketing consultants Bamber Forsyth, which together with Courtyard City Services is staging the free lunchtime seminar, to seek to persuade them that they can use the change to improve their contact with customers. The presentation will include some marketing jargon. There will be talk, for example, of customers going on 'information journeys': either a 'horizontal' one - often the company's vision of what happens, in which they see a range of branded leaflets - or a 'vertical' one - in which information comes from more varied sources. There will also be some statements of the seemingly obvious, but on the whole the seminar should raise some valid issues at a time when much of the life industry would be unwise to reject any offers of help. Peter Kelly, a financial communications consultant taking part, says companies need to be positive and that the sales force should not see compliance as just a mass of detailed requirements to be met. 'The life insurance industry is nowhere near as good at communication, especially internally, as it thinks it is,' he says. Compliance can be presented to the customer as a sign of a powerful and client-friendly organisation. Anne McCrossan of Bamber Forsyth argues that one of the effects of disclosure will be that products will become less easy to differentiate: companies should therefore take the opportunity to develop more strongly their corporate values in communicating with the client. 'It's a question of how good customers feel about the company as well as the product.' The need to develop corporate branding applies not just before the sale but also afterwards. Keith Bamber cites a company whose after-sale material was so forbidding that sending out the annual statement acted as a trigger for policies to be cashed in. He argues that branding should be more powerfully reflected in the papers sent to an investor after buying a product. 'Retention of customers has to be paramount,' he says. Companies will need new sales strategies to address this, including greater integration of the promotion and administrative functions. The clear language of the compulsory SIB document will put the onus on companies to spell out equally clearly the benefits of taking out a policy. 'The company has to do something just as strong, simple and understandable about what it is offering, and the kind of company it is,' says Kelly. While the overall message is that the new regime can work positively for life companies, other conclusions are more chilling: Bamber Forsyth says there is high cost to getting it wrong and warns that 'disclosure can dominate even if you bury it'. *The seminar takes place at the Institute of Directors, Pall Mall, London from 12.30pm.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Tough US trading hits JIB TOUGH trading conditions in the United States insurance market and international reinsurance markets depressed pre-tax profits at JIB Group, the insurance broker, to Pounds 18.2m in 1992, against Pounds 20.1m. Lower interest rates also affected the result to leave earnings per share down 26 per cent, from 13.6p to 10.1p. A final dividend of 5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 7.5p. Last year there was a single final of 5p. 'In difficult markets and difficult times we have not done too badly,' said Mr Nick Cosh, finance director of the company, which is a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson Holdings. Turnover increased to Pounds 175.9m (Pounds 168.9m). There was a lower contribution from the US of Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 80.6m), offset by increases in the UK and Ireland to Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 66.8m) and Asia Pacific to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 21.5m). Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 176.3m (Pounds 165.2m), partly because of a number of one-off costs.</p>

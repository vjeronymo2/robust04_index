			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in Footsie futures yesterday moved on a rollercoaster yesterday, with several influences pulling on the December contract, writes Christine Buckley. US selling once again stalked the contract in the morning and it slipped to a day's low of 3,166 early in the session. There was not much of a fight to rescue December, with sellers outweighing buyers. Later on some optimism fed across from a bouncy German market and the contract moved up to trade in more positive territory. For a while it hovered mainly in a small range between 3,185 and 3,187. But the US sellers would not be deterred and returned to push the contract down. It struggled to muster a rally before the official close when it registered 3,174 - on a par with its fair value premium to the cash market which stands at about 8 points. Volume was improved on recent sessions at 10,602 contracts. In after-hours trading the market was enlivened by the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin which contained upbeat signals for inflation. The contract advanced to 3,174 and looked poised to bounce in today's trading. Traded options were steady at 29,904 lots. The bulk of the interest was in index options with the FT-SE 100 option trading 9,416 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100 option showing good interest at 6,747.</p>

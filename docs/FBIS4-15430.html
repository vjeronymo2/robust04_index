			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The decision of President  Boris Yeltsin to set up military bases in Latvia would change  the political situation, said Indulis Berzins, of the Latvia's  Way faction.    The motion would also and endanger the implementation of  U.N.  General Assembly's resolution on the complete and immediate  withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, he said.    Certain ruling political forces in Russia dislike the  anticipated agreement with Latvia because they hope to make an  advantage of the present situation when there is no formal  agreement to keep Russian troops in Latvia, Berzins said.    Latvia, however, should not sign the initialed agreements on  troop withdrawal before additional talks between authorized  state delegations, Berzins added.    Berzins claims that the information about "the technical  mistake" in the text of Yeltsin's resolution "does not and will  not enhance confidence" unless the Russian president himself  issues an official statement.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, proposed &sect;618.8005(d) would provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services may be offered to recipients that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise meet the eligibility requirements, as long as such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service is offered in connection with loan applications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan servicing, and other transactions between these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients and persons or entities eligible to borrow under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria in proposed &sect;618.8005(a), (b), or (c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The service in question would have to be a part of or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain to the transaction. For example, if a System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution offered a soil testing service, a natural food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> store wishing to purchase produce from a farmer could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilize the System institution's service to test the soil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for pesticides. Although the eligible farmer directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits from the service and could arrange for the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the institution, the food store may wish to contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the service directly in order to ensure independence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing. The System institution could not, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer tax planning services to the natural food store  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because tax planning does not pertain to the store's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction with the farmer and does not directly benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the eligible farmer. In addition, the authority to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services in &sect;618.8005(d) would not depend on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party arranges for or pays for the related services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, for BCs and ACBs, proposed &sect;618.8005(d) would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change the requirements of &sect;613.3120 of this chapter that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voting stockholder must substantially benefit from services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in connection with foreign export or import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the Regulatory Burden comments stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System institutions should have the authority to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services to non-eligible entities as long as such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services did not comprise the majority of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The FCA does not believe that statutory or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory eligibility requirements depend on the percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an institution's services that are provided to the person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or entity whose eligibility is in question, and did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include this suggestion in the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the FCA does not agree with the view advanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Farm Credit Council (FCC) and FRS petitioners that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appraisals and other services could be provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-eligible entities pursuant to the institutions'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidental authorities under sections 1.5(21), 2.2(20),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.12(20), and 3.2(16) of the Act. System institutions were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created for the express purpose of providing lending and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services. It is a general principle of corporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law that incidental powers are those powers that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powers expressly granted and cannot be used to waive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific limitation on an express power. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of incidental authorities for activities derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either lending or related services express powers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still be subject to the limitations on those express powers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Fletcher Cyc. Corp. &sect;2485 (rev. perm. ed. 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 618.8010_Related Services Authorization Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its commitment to reducing the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden, the FCA proposes to eliminate the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirement that each System bank or association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the FCA's prior approval before providing a related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service program. In addition, System institutions requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a change in the approval process to lessen the burden and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed up the process. A number of suggestions were made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the process; many of these have been incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation sharply reduces the FCA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up-front role in two ways. First, the FCA would only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate proposals for new related services up front, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is, only services that have not previously been approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA. Second, only the service itself, not an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's program, would initially be evaluated. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means that the FCA's evaluation of new services could occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the proposing institution prepares a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility analysis or its funding bank completes its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. In fact, while the FCA would expect well-documented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service proposals, an institution would not need to devote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valuable resources to developing its operational program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before submitting a new related service for the FCA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation. Following the FCA's authorization of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, any authorized institution could develop and offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a program based on regulatory criteria in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;618.8020 and 618.8025 without obtaining prior approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the FCA. The institution's program would then be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to review in the course of the examination process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

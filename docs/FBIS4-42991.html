			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colin Brown report: "Gummer Spikes PM's Attempt To Unite </F> Party"]    [Text] John Major's attempt to unite the Conservative  Party began to come apart yesterday when John Gummer distanced  himself from the Prime Minister's vision of a multi-speed Europe.    The Secretary of State for Environment, a committed  pro-European, said it did not put Britain in the slow lane. He  said: "What he (John Major) is absolutely clear (about) is that  Britain is not going to be at a slower speed than the rest of  Europe. That would be quite unacceptable. We are at the heart  of Europe. We have no intention of being at a slower speed than  the rest." But the Europhobes, including Lord Tebbit, who  hailed the Prime Minister's words as a turning point, believe he  has signalled that Britain will not be carried along by other  member states on a track towards single currency and deeper  union. The confusion in the Tory camp is unlikely to influence  the result.    Labour strategists used the results of a telephone poll of  1,000 voters to play down expectations. It gave Labour 43 per  cent, the Tories 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 21 per  cent. While admitting the survey should be treated with  caution, Labour estimates that could translate into 50 to 55  seats for Labour, 20 for the Tories and a handful for the  Liberal Democrats.    The Tory leadership has been planning on the assumption of a  low turn-out in Thursday's [9 June] poll and has directed its  "Euro-sceptic" message at its bedrock. It believes it has  touched a chord with its campaign over the alleged threat to the  national veto and jobs posed by the Social Chapter. In the  run-up to polling day the Tory party yesterday continued to  hammer away at that theme. Mr Major will reinforce that message  today in his final rally in London.    Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of the party, denied running  a negative Euro-sceptic campaign. He said: "Right up to polling  day we are going to keep on pushing home our positive message on  the key European issues. We are going to keep on pointing out  the contrast between our determination to stand up for British  interests and Labour and Liberal willingness to see Britain  out-voted and walked over." That is the kind of "positive"  message that has dismayed Europhile Tory MPs.    Mr Major has made it clear he will not stand down, however  bad the results are when they are declared next Monday. But  back- benchers say Mr Major will be under increased pressure to  go by the autumn, if a Labour Party under Tony Blair builds on  its success in the European polls and by-elections on Thursday.  The Tory high command is prepared to write-off defeats this  week as a protest vote. But Europhile Tories said it would be a  disaster if the Tories were left with 15 seats -- a third of the  seats held before the 1989 election.    "It is not the Europhiles who will cause trouble. If Labour  gets 44 per cent of the vote and we get less than we did last  time (34 per cent) it will be all those people who suddenly  realise their seats have gone who will start to get twitchy,"  said one leading pro-Europe MP.    Tory Europhiles say Mr Major's leadership can no longer be  trusted on Europe, as a result of the negative campaign that he  has led. They are in a minority, but if mainstream Tories fear  defeat under Mr Major, panic could lead to a clamour for a  change of leader in the autumn.    Michael Heseltine's support is hardening in response to the  threat of Labour under Mr Blair. One ardent pro-European MP  said: "I would have voted for Kenneth Clarke, but colleagues are  saying Heseltine is the one person who can eat Blair alive."    They believe the Tory campaign, centred on the threat to the  national veto, has been used for short-term advantage, without  taking account of the long-term damage it might cause.    "The Prime Minister has pushed some of the right buttons. He  has pleased the Euro-hostile Tories but they are not the ones  who are going to go out and fight for a result on Thursday. He  has very severely demoralised the people who have to go out  among our traditional supporters."    Senior Tory MPs who criticise the campaign as too negative  point out that the formula of a multi-speed Europe, on which Mr  Major has fought the election, never appeared in the Tory  European manifesto. They said it was produced to appease  Europhobes with private assurances to some leading pro-European  Tories that a more positive approach would be taken after the  election.</p>

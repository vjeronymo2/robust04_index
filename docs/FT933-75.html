			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (4): Stores hit by downturn THE entry of Burger King, the US hamburger chain, into an already over-crowded Japanese market this month, surprised many industry analysts because the prolonged economic slump is beginning to hit fast-food outlets. Japan's service sectors, which were virtually unaffected during the initial stages of the economic downturn, are now starting to feel the effects. Although the Japanese fast-food market saw firm sales and profits during the initial stages of the economic downturn, it is now suffering as a result of the further tightening of consumer spending. Burger King has signed an agreement with Seibu Railways, run by Mr Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, one of the richest men in the world. Mr Masao Okada, general manager of project, expects to open 200 to 300 stores in the next few years along Seibu's railway network. While Burger King hopes to lure customers with its healthier and bigger Whopper burger, its move comes at a time when the fast-food market is experiencing declines in purchases per customer. Ms Kaori Hasegawa, analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says many companies are starting to limit the number of new stores to cut down costs. Convenience stores, meanwhile, saw sales fall in June and July due to the long rainy season and cool summer weather. The sector, unlike the luxury department stores and larger super stores, has until now seen firm sales, unaffected by the downfall in consumer spending. However, sales of seasonal goods, such as soft drinks, ice-cream, and cold noodles, on which convenience stores are largely dependent, have slumped. In July, FamilyMart, a leading convenience store chain, experienced the first year-on-year fall in existing store sales for the first time since its listing in December 1987. Growth in the trucking industry, which remained firm during the initial economic downturn, is also starting to decline. During the April-June quarter, volumes on scheduled trucking services rose by only 1 per cent. Compared to manufacturing companies, which are experiencing double-digit percentage falls in revenues, trucking companies are only now being forced to discount rates to win business. Ms Julia Baldini, analyst at Schroder Securities in Tokyo, estimates that annual revenue for the industry this year, will fall around 3 to 5 per cent, compared to the 2 per cent decline last fiscal year. The labour shortage which severely affected the industry during the late 1980s, has led companies to retain workers, causing a heavy overhead burden. While the bigger trucking companies have succeeded in controlling costs, the smaller companies are struggling. Ms Baldini believes that over the next five years the number of licensed companies will decline sharply. Gradual deregulation of the industry is also expected to accelerate consolidation. The ministry of transport eased territorial restrictions in 1990, abolishing protection for the small local companies and allowing larger companies to expand national networks. The recent proposal included in the new government's list of deregulations, allowing companies to use bigger trucks, is also expected to help the larger companies. The transport industry is the most regulated of all industries, and deregulation is expected to prompt consolidation railways, trucking, shipping and warehousing. Larger transportation companies will be the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation, while smaller companies will be forced to form alliances. The government's push for deregulation to adjust the price differences between Japan and overseas is expected to help the warehousing sector increase imports in the medium term. The government has stipulated a review of import procedures, including construction materials, quarantine procedures and food health checks. While such changes are not expected to boost imports immediately, a further easing of procedures on a wider range of products in the future will support an increase in import levels. Pressure from consumers for cheaper food and agricultural products is also expected to increase demand for imported foods. While import levels remain subdued, warehouses will enjoy the benefits of easing of import regulations once consumption increases.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (29): Wonder stocks lose a little glamour - Paul Abrahams ponders whether the charmed status enjoyed until now by pharmaceuticals groups may be coming to an end / Chemicals and pharmaceuticals EUROPEAN drugs companies, wonder stocks of 1991, had rather more mixed experiences last year. While some groups - such as Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK and Astra of Sweden - enjoyed a successful year, others - such as Fisons and Wellcome of the UK - had a more turbulent 12 months. Meanwhile, most European chemicals groups had a difficult time, slipping down the rankings as the industry suffered from overcapacity and sliding profits. A few were protected by their speciality chemicals or drugs operations. Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group, moved from third to second in the FT500, as its profits rose 11 per cent to Dollars 2.358bn on turnover up 20 per cent at Dollars 6.76bn. Two years ago it was 10th. Astra, which competes directly against Glaxo's best-selling drug, the ulcer treatment Zantac, rose from 37 to 32. Its ulcer medicine and respiratory drugs helped the Swedish group drive its profits up 36 per cent to Dollars 608m, on turnover up 32 per cent at Dollars 2.2bn. Other pharmaceuticals groups that did well included Novo Nordisk of Denmark which moved from 209 to 165; Synthelabo of France which entered the FT500 at 228 thanks to its acquisitions of two laboratories, Delalande and Delagrange; and Institut Merieux, which moved from 469 to 253, thanks to strong growth in its vaccine business. The drugs companies that performed poorly did so thanks to special circumstances. Fisons, fell from 80 to 215, as its profits fell 17 per cent from Dollars 380m to Dollars 314m on turnover up 5 per cent at Dollars 2bn. The company has lost substantial revenues from the withdrawal of two products in the US because of quality control problems. Efforts to reinstate one has led to significant costs. A substantial management shakeout has taken place. The other company that suffered was Wellcome, although the reason was nothing to do with the quality of the company. Wellcome Trust, a medical charity which owned about 74 per cent of Wellcome, decided in March to sell off a significant part of its stake. However, the company's shares suffered a long-drawn-out bear raid by institutions which drove the price down from Pounds 11.26p to under 800p by the time of the issue in July. By the end of the year, the shares had recovered to well over 950p. Most chemicals groups suffered from the malaise in European industry caused by overcapacity and cheap imports from the US which were assisted by the cheap dollar. Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, slipped from 16 to 28. It was also hit by a slowdown in pharmaceuticals earnings as its best-selling drug, a hypertension treatment called Tenormin, lost more than half its sales in the US, the world's largest market, following the expiry of its patents. Two of the three German giants slipped down the list, Bayer falling from 28 to 34 and BASF from 46 to 56. The third of the trio, Hoechst remained static at 45. The Germans' ratings were helped by the weakness of the dollar and strength of the D-Mark. The realisation of the full extent of the slowdown of the German economy has hit the stocks, as have fears about dividends. Both Hoechst and BASF cut their pay-outs last year, and all three are expected to cut further when full-year results are announced in March. Some chemicals companies outperformed the sector and the market. BOC of the UK and L'Air Liquide, both industrial gases groups, improved their ratings, the former from 93 to 80 and the latter from 70 to 52. Industrial gas companies are strong defensive stocks during recession. Their contracts are long-term and less vulnerable to the economic swings that hit commodity chemical products. Other chemical companies did well because of their pharmaceuticals or speciality operations. Roche, the Swiss group with strong drugs interests, had a spectacular year, climbing from 18 to 6 in the FT500, while its profits soared 113 per cent from Dollars 724m to Dollars 1.54bn on turnover up 18 per cent at Dollars 8.68bn. Roche's dramatic rise up the table was partly due to acquisitions - such as Sara Lee's European over-the-counter business - but was mostly driven by organic growth of the pharmaceuticals operations. Mr Peter Smith, European pharmaceuticals analyst at broker James Capel, says Roche has no single successful product, but enjoys a broad range of medicines that are growing strongly. The company also benefited from a change in accounting standards that added to profits. Sandoz, Roche's competitor and neighbour in Basle, also did well, rising from 29 to 20 as all of the Swiss pharmaceuticals stocks were re-rated. The shares have also been driven up in anticipation of the group publishing its 1992 figures according to international accounting standards rather than the conservative Swiss ones. This could add up to 20 per cent to profits. The third of the Swiss giants, Ciba-Geigy, had a rather less successful year, advancing only two positions to 24. The stock suffered from concerns about the impact of reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy on the agrochemicals industry in which Ciba-Geigy is the world leader. The dramatic success of the group's nicotine patch in the US during the first half of the year was not sustained. And the upturn in the US, which might have helped its cyclical dyes and polymers businesses, proved slower than expected. Akzo, the Dutch group, moved from 179 to 124. Although its profits and turnover were down, the group is partly protected from the slowdown in the European economies because of its portfolio of speciality businesses. It has some pharmaceuticals operations and is less exposed to petrochemicals than its German counterparts, according to Ms Jackie Ashurst, European chemicals analyst at James Capel. Chemicals groups that left the UK FT500 included MTM, the speciality chemicals company, ranked at 290 last year. MTM suffered a catastrophic collapse in its share price from 189p to under 15p after a profits shortfall and the subsequent resignation of its founder and chairman. If the US recovery accelerates and the slowdown on the European continent looks like it is bottoming out, then the unfashionable chemicals stocks could come back into fashion. At the same time, the charmed status of pharmaceuticals groups looks like coming to an end, as investors begin to switch into cyclical stocks and drugs profits growth slows due to world-wide efforts by governments to control healthcare spending.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST, DOWN 12 AT HALF, RALLIES PAST PATRICK HENRY  </P> <P> Trailing by 12 points at halftime, the Southwest High School boys' basketball  team appeared headed to the off-season, where its next game wouldn't be until  summer league.  </P> <P> That may not be exactly what Southwest Coach Steve Selland thought. But summer  league triggered his mind as he headed for the locker room with his team  trailing Patrick Henry by 12 points in a second-round section Division I  playoff game at Southwest.  </P> <P> "I said, in the second half, let's play just like summer league basketball,"  Selland said. "With motion, pass and cut, pressure, running and gunning."  </P> <P> Will Tate made three of three free throws in the final 23 seconds and had a key  steal and layup as Southwest kept the season alive, rallying for a 57-55  victory.  </P> <P> Saturday, Southwest (21-7) will play at San Diego, a 62-51 winner over San  Dieguito.  </P> <P> With Tate (20 points) applying pressure on the full-court man press, Southwest  outscored Patrick Henry, 21-11, in the final quarter, forcing seven turnovers.  </P> <P> "We got guys who get the ball with three guys guarding them and can't pass the  ball to an open man," Patrick Henry Coach Fritz Ziegenfuss said. "Our  ballhandling was terrible."  </P> <P> Patrick Henry (13-12) led, 44-36, after three quarters and 51-45 with 3:48 to  play. Southwest then went on a 7-0 run to take its first lead, 52-51, with 46  seconds left. Sean Swenson had five of those points, including a three-pointer  that put the Raiders ahead.  </P> <P> Patrick Henry's Bart Brandenburg then made two free throws with 39 seconds left  for a 53-52 lead.  </P> <P> Tate came right back, driving the baseline and drawing a foul from Terence  Hamilton while attempting a reverse with 23 seconds. It was the fifth foul for  Hamilton (13 points, 10 rebounds).  </P> <P> Tate made both shots to put Southwest ahead, 54-53. The 6-foot senior then made  the play of the game, slipping around Brandenburg in the back court, stealing  the ball, driving for a layup and drawing a foul. There were only 11 seconds  left when he made the free throw that clinched the game for Southwest.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO IS ROXANI GILLESPIE?;  </P> <P> AND WHY IS SHE SAYING ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT RALPH NADER, THE  INSURANCE REVOLT AND PROP. 103?  </P> <P> IN HER AIRY OFFICE, high above San Francisco, California Insurance Commissioner  Roxani Gillespie, petite and perky in her round, bouncy, black Dutch-boy bob  with bangs, is hopping about the floor, flapping her arms and swishing her  skirts as she demonstrates, amid gales of merry laughter, the virtues of her  dress. The commissioner is tired of all the flak she's been getting -- from her  daughter, her press secretary, even perfect strangers -- about the dresses that  have become her trademark: prim, pristine little-girl numbers, Laura Ashleys by  label, with gathered skirts, puffy sleeves, teensy patterns. This one is blue.  With what looks like rosebuds.  </P> <P> Little Miss Muffet comes to mind. An English nanny. The parson's wife. Roxani  Gillespie, 48, looks more like any of these than the queen of California's  $55-billion insurance industry and the state's most politically controversial  woman since former Chief Justice Rose Bird.  </P> <P> "I like these dresses!" Gillespie protests, giggling, exasperated, as her press  secretary, a pretty, stylish blonde in a smart black suit, named Carey  Fletcher, covers her eyes and groans at the indignity of the unfolding sight.  </P> <P> "Suits are not comfortable. These dresses are comfortable," Gillespie cries,  slapping at her unfettered waist, her hidden hips. "Look!" Jerk goes the skirt.  Walking space. "See!" Yank, a handful of bodice. Roomy. Gillespie likes these  dresses so much, in fact, she next announces, that she buys them by the  half-dozen, each style in all available colors. "Let's see." She pauses,  frowning, ticking them off briskly on her fingers. "I have this one in red,  blue, green, black and, uh . . . yes! Dark blue! Why not? I don't like to shop.  Besides, men wear the same clothes all the time."  </P> <P> Fletcher moans. "God, you oughta see her black one," she mutters. "It's got  little pink flowers on it."  </P> <P> Gillespie thinks that's hilarious, too. She flounces into her chair, triumphant  -- having demonstrated, all within a space of five minutes, a good many of the  qualities that have reduced her critics to howls of impotent fury for months  now: Unpretentious, down to earth, spontaneous, funny, she's a born charmer.  Also stubborn, opinionated, a streak explosive and possessed of enough apparent  self-confidence for 15 people. You don't like the way she runs her kingdom?  Ralph Nader calls her a lackey of the insurance industry? No refund check from  your insurance company yet? You think she wants to trash Proposition 103? You  might as well criticize her dress.  </P> <P> EVER SINCE November, when California voters, in their most dramatic uprising  since the property-tax rebellion of 1978, passed Proposition 103, consumer  activists and assorted politicians have been protesting that Roxani Gillespie  -- Greek immigrant, attorney, wife and mother, one-time claims adjuster and  former insurance company executive -- is unfit to preside over such a  pioneering piece of populist history.  </P> <P> What Proposition 103 represents is something out of any good conservative's  worst nightmare: a public lunge into the affairs of one of capitalism's most  enduring monoliths. Among other reforms mandated by 103, insurance companies --  unless they can persuade Gillespie otherwise -- must roll back their rates to  their Nov. 8, 1987, levels, then reduce them by an additional 20%. Banks have  been granted permission to enter the insurance market. The office of the  insurance commissioner, traditionally one of the governor's appointive plums,  has been turned over to the electoral process, starting in 1990, and  transformed from an essentially passive administrative post into an aggressive  consumer watchdog position, with full authority to set all future rates for  California's 788 insurance companies.  </P> <P> All of which, critics say, is utterly beyond Gillespie's demonstrated  capacities or inclinations.  </P> <P> So far, Gillespie, appointed commissioner by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1986,  has been accused of grandstanding, evading, deceiving and dragging her feet on  103; of making decisions stacked in favor of insurance companies or, more  often, of making no decisions at all. She has been called everything from  criminally negligent to a docile puppet of Deukmejian. She has been likened to  various small animals -- "an attack pit bull" (Harry Snyder, West Coast  director of Consumers Union); a "bulldog" (Will Glennon, legal analyst for the  California Trial Lawyers Assn.), and "a timid mouse" (Robert Fellmeth, director  of the Center for Public Interest Law).  </P> <P> "That woman isn't fit to be dogcatcher," screams Proposition 103 author Harvey  Rosenfield. His mentor, Ralph Nader, national icon of consumer rights, also has  pitched in, demanding Gillespie's resignation. "She has no interest in  consumers; she's just biding her time, waiting for some big fat offer from the  insurance industry," Nader warns from his Washington headquarters.  </P> <P> And, if pressure on Gillespie was heavy before, the California Supreme Court  only turned up the heat in its May 4 ruling upholding most of Proposition 103.  The court's decision vested Gillespie with even more authority than she had  before, essentially the power (subject to court appeal) to decide, right here  alone in this stark little office with the picture of Athena on the wall, which  insurance companies must grant the 20% rollbacks and which get off the hook.  The court further dramatically relaxed the standard that companies must meet to  qualify for exemptions: Under Proposition 103's original language, only  companies that could show a "substantial threat of insolvency" would have been  spared from the rollback; now Gillespie need only find that they are being  denied "a fair and reasonable" profit, as she determines it. Gillespie says the  fair rate of return will vary from company to company and that past profits  will not be a factor in deciding whether a rollback is merited.  </P> <P> And we're not just talking auto insurance here -- an $11-billion industry all  by itself -- but every form of property and liability insurance in California,  too.  </P> <P> Even now, they are pounding on her door in droves, insurance companies begging  exemptions based on need. Nearly all of California's insurance companies are  expected to file. And, now it isn't going to be just the Rosenfields and Naders  on her case: Every policyholder in California who doesn't get a refund check in  the mail is going to be mad at Roxani (pronounced Rox-annie) Gillespie, too.  And that's probably going to be a whole lot of people.  </P> <P> BUT DON'T BLAME Gillespie -- she always told you Proposition 103 was a lousy  law. From the start of the insurance initiative wars last year, Gillespie has  been quite explicit in her view of 103 as "unfair and one-sided" in its all-out  assault on insurance companies, while doing nothing about what she sees as the  central villains in escalating auto-insurance rates: ambulance-chasing lawyers  and their sue-happy clients. To Gillespie, 103 was never more than a  "pie-in-the-sky" fraud perpetrated upon consumers by Nader and Rosenfield.  </P> <P> Now the chickens have come home to roost, and there's no overstating  Gillespie's frustration as she sits at her desk, eyes flashing, intent, trying  to explain once again, in her clipped European accent, the reasons 103 will  never work -- and why "a lot of people are going to be frosted" when they don't  receive a rebate or a rollback.  </P> <P> "Because you have a very significant California auto industry that simply  doesn't have the money that Rosenfield says they have," she exclaims for the  umpteenth time since Proposition 103 exploded in her lap, "it's going to depend  on whether your company is a rich one or not. If you're with one of the big  guys that comes from the East that has a significant surplus, like our friend  State Farm, you're going to get your rebate. But a great number of  policyholders with California companies simply are not."  </P> <P> Gillespie has always complained about the inherent unfairness of this  situation. Why should some customers get rollbacks and not others? Thus, she  sees the Supreme Court decision, which basically enables her to grant  exemptions to more insurance companies, as "fairer across the board to  consumers." Meaning, if you don't get a refund, you are now less likely to be  jealous of your neighbor, because he's probably not going to get one either.  Gillespie searches for a way to make the situation clear:  </P> <P> "What Harvey has gotten passed is something that says, 'This VW just as it is,  you got it for $5,000 last year, well, you're going to be getting it for $4,000  this year.' Now, the VW is exactly the same -- so how is that going to happen?  Harvey didn't say, 'OK, how are we going to get the VW to cost less? Let's take  out the radio, let's take out the tape deck, let's take out the air  conditioner.' No. It was the exact same VW, but costing less."  </P> <P> Good for Harvey.  </P> <P> "Yes, you see," she cries, exasperated, unamused, "and that's exactly what  everybody likes! But how the heck is the VW manufacturer going to be able to  provide you with this VW? It's very seductive. But where I'm coming from is the  bottom line. We must find a way to bring down costs for everybody."  </P> <P> To Gillespie, whose opinion is shared by many insurance experts, the only  solution to the auto-insurance crisis is some type of no-fault plan, which  would eliminate costly court battles between insurance companies over which  driver was at fault. Instead, each driver would be obliged to collect damages  from his own company, most lawsuits over auto accidents would be eliminated and  recovery for hard-to-prove losses such as pain and suffering would be  drastically limited.  </P> <P> Eliminating lawsuits and attorneys' fees is all-important to Gillespie, which  is the central reason she so dislikes the consumerists nipping at her heels. In  her view, they are not only half-baked ideologues and flunkies of the trial  lawyers but a social menace, too, thanks to their obvious populist appeal.  </P> <P> Most days, she simply swats them away like gnats -- all of them, from the  large, established Consumers Union (which Gillespie once dismissed as "a  handful of people who test vacuum cleaners") to Rosenfield's Voter Revolt, the  organization behind 103.  </P> <P> "Pussycats, all pussycats," she sighs, laughing, dismissing the whole lot of  them with an airy hand, her tone one of near fondness, the tolerant teacher  beset by naughty and somewhat slow-witted pupils. "And they're always so  unprepared, they don't do their homework, they don't show much understanding at  all of the financial situation," she clucks. "Frankly, I think they are mostly  interested in the (TV) cameras."  </P> <P> Other days, Gillespie tries to accord them some minimal respect. It isn't easy.  "I don't like them because these people don't represent the consumers, they  represent themselves. What the Rosenfields of the world" -- she pronounces it  Rosenfeld, apparently in innocence -- "really want is to be the consumers'  daddy. They're paternalistic; they want to make the consumers' decisions for  them. And their agenda -- at least the Rosenfield agenda, and the Ralph Nader  agenda -- is to stop tort reform. They represent only the victims.  </P> <P> "And I do think that they truly believe in it. They feel .in their hearts there  is no need to do anything about legal excesses, that these awards are never too  big, that we simply cannot have enough of a good thing," she says. "And, of  course the rights of victims are important -- or there would be no need to have  insurance. But there is the other side, too. What about the poor stiffs that  pay the bills? We must bring this to a common-sense compromise. There are  excesses on both sides, but Harvey has persuaded people otherwise."  </P> <P> By the time she finishes, she is practically wagging her finger. That's the  most consumerists will ever get from Gillespie by way of serious consideration.  Otherwise, her plan is clear: She intends to kill them with condescension, if  she doesn't mock them to death first.  </P> <P> Ralph Nader, the man who has gone so far as to demand her job, takes the  mightiest chop. "Why does he do these things? He has never even met me,"  Gillespie wonders. "Normally, you wait for a person to at least act, but this  man sits out on the East Coast and uses the same libretto for everyone, be it  General Motors or me. Actions are irrelevant to him."  </P> <P> She warms. "The last time he was in California, for example, was the very day  when we had just gotten State Farm to refund what we alleged to be improper  premiums to its policyholders. It was on Page One of The Times!" she remembers,  simmering. "But, there was Nader anyway, in the state Legislature, saying I was  lackadaisical, dragging my feet, that I wasn't doing anything." Gillespie  throws up her hands, then, mockingly, this to Nader himself: "Now, come on.  Everybody can read, Ralph. Maybe you can't, but everyone else can.  </P> <P> "I would just hope the man would eventually go back to wherever he comes from,"  she finishes, neat as a cat wiping its paws.  </P> <P> SO JUST WHO is this lively, razor-tongued, uncowed woman, so seemingly fit for  high-pressure public combat, who suddenly emerges from the obscurity of what  was once one of California's most boring, ignored agencies to Page One  prominence, Woman of the Hour?  </P> <P> Roxani Manou Gillespie is, for starters, the daughter of a prosperous and  influential family of Greek politicians, intellectuals and attorneys. She  speaks six languages, including Russian, fluently. She immigrated to the United  States when she was 22, having married a Canadian based in Boston who is now a  consulting engineer in suburban San Carlos. She is the mother of two  college-aged children: Costa, 20, an engineering student at the University of  the Pacific, and Margaret, 22, a UCLA law student.  </P> <P> Gillespie is also an attorney. She attended Boston College Law School and,  after graduation, worked for a couple of years as an attorney for the Boston  Legal Aid Society. It was there, she says, that she decided she would rather be  a corporate attorney than work with poor people. They were too frustrating, she  recalls -- and, in some cases, frightening. She still grimly remembers one  client she represented in a divorce case:  </P> <P> "This woman had three children who all drowned -- at three different times, one  in a bathtub, another in a pool. The police marked them all up to accidents,  but, you just knew. . . ." Gillespie, subdued, shakes the image away. "But  these were the kinds of people who were our clients. We had to represent them."  </P> <P> Even those who weren't probable murderers exasperated her, she says. "I could  not get them out of my mind, because what you saw in a lot of (clients) is that  they were in a vicious circle, some of it of their own making, and it was very  hard for them to pull out," she says. "You could say, 'Now, Mrs. Smith, I  really never want to defend you against such a charge ever again.' But you knew  darn well, lo and behold, she would be coming right back the next week."  </P> <P> And so, "I decided then that I was not good at being a public defender, that it  was far easier to deal with issues than with poverty," she finishes. "It is  much easier dealing with the big guys than with the Mrs. Smiths whose children  keep drowning."  </P> <P> Gillespie began small with the big guys, however. Her first job, after her  husband transferred to San Francisco in 1970, was as a claims adjuster for  Industrial Indemnity, the large San Francisco-based insurance firm where she  would spend the next 13 years. "It was the only job I could find. There wasn't  much demand for female attorneys in those days." Her rise within the company  was rapid, however. In fact, she says, her first promotion, to corporate  attorney in 1971, came too fast. "I was their token woman, totally unprepared."  </P> <P> Five years later, Gillespie became a vice president, making her the  highest-ranking woman in California insurance circles at that time. Heady years  -- by 1980, even Gov. Jerry Brown briefly considered her for insurance  commissioner, she says.  </P> <P> Meantime, Gillespie's halcyon days at Industrial Indemnity were fast coming to  an end, she says, still visibly soured about it. "I realized I had hit that  invisible glass ceiling, you know? When you know you're never going to advance  any further." She was just about to quit and go into private practice or hunt  for a judgeship, she says, when along came Deukmejian in 1983 to appoint her  deputy insurance commissioner.  </P> <P> Gillespie is also a self-described feminist, particularly when it comes to  abortion rights, which she supports with almost white-lipped intensity. In  fact, she says, although she is a registered Republican and a "fiscal  conservative," she is a liberal on most civil-rights issues. She even supported  her fellow Greek-American, Michael S. Dukakis, for President. But, she quickly  amends, "only until he won the nomination. Then I stopped working for him."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "Because I felt it would have been inappropriate," she says, confused at the  question. "It would have embarrassed the governor if I were out working for  Dukakis. He really wanted Bush -- and I'm his appointee, after all. You have to  be a team player." She won't say whether, in the privacy of the polling booth,  she voted for her Greek or for George Deukmejian's Texan.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean she's a puppet of Deukmejian, who dislikes Proposition  103 every bit as much as she does. "I've never personally discussed 103 with  the governor," she says vaguely. "And he doesn't tell me what to do on a  day-to-day basis. But he does set the standard, definitely. By his own actions,  he sets the tone. He took a position against 103. He opposed all the  propositions. That sends a definite message."  </P> <P> But Gillespie never stays vague for long. What about all these charges that  she's an insurance company lackey?  </P> <P> "I'm not in the pockets of anybody," she explodes. "I don't know why they keep  saying it. There's absolutely no evidence. What these people (consumerists)  want is a commissioner who's in their pockets. In their own way, they are no  different from the insurance companies -- both sides want absolutely unfettered  authority. But I'm no part of any of it. I am trying to be a very independent  commissioner, to do what I think is right for my customers, California  policyholders. I also think that if I were a gray-haired gentleman, there would  not be this much attention."  </P> <P> And now she is marching through the lobby of a fancy San Francisco hotel, en  route to a speaking engagement, such a conspicuous figure in her blue corduroy  dress, her sturdy, no-nonsense black shoes with their big, odd Pilgrim buckles,  a little old lady's black plastic purse over her arm, chin jutted forward,  girlish bangs hanging almost to her eyes, the body language -- stand back.  </P> <P> Suddenly, passing a group of men, she snatches at her visitor's arm. "Did you  hear that?" she whispers, excited, eyes sparkling. "One of those men back there  said, 'There goes Gillespie and her entourage.' " Gillespie notices these small  episodes in her new life -- and, have no doubt, she's thriving in the  limelight. It's a kick, being recognized; all the media attention fascinates  her. She's gradually mastering the art of the 30-second TV sound bite, she  confides. "Insurance issues are so complicated, it's difficult, but we're  trying to learn." ("She's learning too well," Rosenfield gripes.)  </P> <P> Nor is Gillespie coy about the thrill of it all.  </P> <P> "There I was, in the sleepy old days -- I had my green eyeshade, I did my work,  I did my numbers -- we were basically a nickel-and-dime collection agency. And  then wham, all this," she says, in delighted mockery of her own former, musty  state-agency status. Now, thanks to Proposition 103, Gillespie's budget has  nearly doubled, to about $60 million, and her staff also has almost doubled;  she will soon have 788 employees at her command. "We're having the time of our  lives." Gillespie also relishes seeing her once-unglamorous $85,000-per-year  job suddenly become the focus of so many covetous eyes. At last count, there  were at least half a dozen prospective candidates.  </P> <P> She may, of course, run herself. So far she's not saying. Only that "I haven't  made up my mind. I'm too busy right now just getting the show on the road."  </P> <P> And then she is swallowed up in a sea of beaming, pink-cheeked, flannel-suited  insurance executives, members of the Workers Compensation Institute. By way of  introduction, the host calls Gillespie "a capable and diligent administrator"  who has "shown tremendous grace under fire" despite many "potshots and cheap  shots."  </P> <P> Gillespie's speech -- quick, clear, relaxed and off-the-cuff -- contained this  basic message: The insurance companies had better get moving now, on their own,  to remedy the inequities in the workers comp system, to do more for "the folks  who pay the bills . . . not just the workers" before "what happened to your  brethren in the automobile industry happens to you too. California, as you  know, has the initiative process." Everybody laughed.  </P> <P> GILLESPIE became insurance commissioner three years ago, after her predecessor,  Bruce Bunner, was unceremoniously bumped by Deukmejian in a dispute over  Bunner's attempt to take a harder line in regulating insurance companies.  Critics called Bunner's departure a blatant display of the Administration's  cozy relationship with the insurance industry -- and Gillespie was promptly  portrayed as a commissioner the governor could control.  </P> <P> Gillespie has always said that she only wants what's best for California  policyholders -- all of them. Cheaper rates for everybody, not just some. But,  she complains, it's not her role to make insurance law, only to implement what  she's given. Then she explodes in a fit of real temper at the state  Legislature. It burns Gillespie up that she's in the middle of this controversy  all because, she fumes, the "do-nothing" Legislature failed to head off the  insurance revolt by properly performing its duty to provide decent insurance  laws -- an opinion that is widely shared.  </P> <P> In Gillespie's opinion, the Legislature has passed only one significant  insurance bill during her tenure -- the so-called Joint Underwriting Assn.  bill, directing companies to provide affordable coverage to day-care centers  and others. And, she declares, "I proposed that bill myself, or rather the  governor did. It was one of the first things I did when I took office, and they  dragged their feet on even that for a year."  </P> <P> State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), chairman of the Senate insurance claims  committee, only shakes his head at Gillespie's assault on the Legislature. "Her  department has opposed 75% of all reform legislation we've proposed in past  years," he says. And what the insurance industry hasn't resisted, he adds, the  trial lawyers have.  </P> <P> But, as far as Gillespie is concerned, she's the only one getting any work done  on behalf of the consumer. She cites everything from rate review to information  hot lines. But, her real pride and joy -- "my little tortilla," as she  sometimes calls it -- is a proposed bill she has been working on, in concert  with such minority groups as the Urban League and the Latino Issues Forum. The  bill, aimed at people who go without insurance because they can't afford it,  would provide a stripped-down, no-fault insurance package for only $160 a year,  the trade-off being that the policyholder forfeits all rights to sue for  damages unless they exceed $15,000 per person.  </P> <P> This type of "no-frills" plan is the "real long-term solution" to escalating  insurance prices, "the way to provide everyone with affordable prices,"  Gillespie says. To her delight, both Consumers Union and Assemblyman Patrick  Johnston (D-Stockton) have incorporated her "no-frills" plan into a broader  no-fault package they are sponsoring. Its backers say this package would  provide a far-reaching no-fault system modeled on New York's -- widely  considered the best in the nation -- that would both stabilize rates and make  insurance accessible to the poor.  </P> <P> Gillespie's $160-a-year plan is guaranteed to bring about a counterattack from  trial lawyers and others who op pose no-fault's limitation on damages. "It's  the most outrageous thing she's pulled yet. It's racist," Rosenfield declares.  </P> <P> "Ah!" Gillespie sighs. "Why don't they let the poor make their own choices? The  bottom line is, how the heck can we tell people they must buy insurance if it's  not affordable? If it comes down to a choice between buying groceries or paying  $2,000 for insurance, what do you think the choice is going to be?"  </P> <P> Gillespie also has always insisted that, even if she doesn't like Proposition  103, she has been doing her best to enforce it, given the limitations imposed  by the six-month legal delay. (When the insurance companies brought suit  immediately after the November election, challenging the constitutionality of  103, the Supreme Court imposed a freeze on both the rollback and rate-increase  provisions pending its decision.)  </P> <P> She cites her much-publicized intervention when Travelers attempted to pull its  auto-insurance business out of California last fall to escape 103, and her  settlement of a State Farm rate discrimination case earlier this year. "We  really cracked down, and it was strictly implementation of Proposition 103."  </P> <P> Despite Gillespie's tough talk, however, State Farm officials had no specific  gripes about her treatment of them -- or her public statements chastising the  company. "Some of her (State Farm) statements were clearly geared to the  political climate, and we understood that," says State Farm vice  president-counsel Laura Sullivan, who has known Gillespie for years and likes  her. "She's getting tarred with political statements, so she's responding with  some too.  </P> <P> "Roxani's independent, smart, gutsy," Sullivan adds, "and she's not going to be  pushed around by anybody, whether it's the insurance industry or the consumer  groups."  </P> <P> To be sure, Gillespie seems well-liked within the insurance industry. Such is  her lonely lot these days, however, that, while her critics are having a field  day at her expense, few insurance company officials will launch an all-out  defense. Reaction is universally warm but muted. Some go out of their way, in  fact, to find nit-picking points of criticism.  </P> <P> "She's in a tough position, and I think she's doing a good job," says Tom  Conneely, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies. "And,  unlike these consumer activists, she understands some basic business principles  -- one being that what a business charges for its product must reflect the cost  of it." Gillespie also recognizes that all parties have a right to due process  -- "one of the things that escapes the Harvey Rosenfields of this world -- and  who are they anyhow?" Conneely declares.  </P> <P> What's more, Gillespie doesn't always act to please the insurance industry. For  example, Conneely says, insurance companies "wondered for months what the  process for rate filings is going to be, how long it will take, how they get it  approved. If she were in the pocket of insurance companies, she'd have been  issuing all kinds of cozy letters saying here's what you have to do to get your  rates approved."  </P> <P> For her part, Gillespie will frowningly concede that, yes, "insurance companies  have alienated everybody." But her most enthusiastic complaint about them is  confined to the "mumbo jumbo of insurance jargon, which really must go. Nobody  understands what they are paying for."  </P> <P> When it comes to profits, gouging, greed -- that which occurs to the average  consumer when he thinks about insurance companies -- Gillespie reiterates, as  she always does, that "of course, there are excesses on both sides." And, in  the next breath, she intently recites her version of what actually happens to  your insurance dollar. Most of it goes to legal claims, she asserts, "and so  what you have is only 5 cents (of every dollar) going to administrative  expenses." (The California Trial Lawyers Assn., by comparison, says it's 20  cents on the dollar.)  </P> <P> THERE ARE SO many competing agendas in the chorus of controversy surrounding  Gillespie, so many politicians with eyes on higher offices and consumerists  with a sweet tooth for national publicity, that, at times during the past  months, Gillespie has been all but lost amid the in-house sniping over who is  the Truest Populist of Them All.  </P> <P> Democratic politicians tend to describe Gillespie's various sins more as a  generic Republican disease. "Roxani is smart, personable, but she's no  politician, obviously. If she were, she could become a California folk hero.  She's just a very cautious individual, and I just think she wants to do a good  job for Deukmejian. She once said that, you know, that 'I belong to  Deukmejian,' " says Alan Robbins, who is considering running for insurance  commissioner in 1990. Likewise, another leading Gillespie critic, Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp, wants to be governor.  </P> <P> "Political hay, all of it!" Gillespie snaps.  </P> <P> For once, she and Rosenfield agree on something. "There's so much posturing in  all this, we're the only purists," says Rosenfield, who does not take lightly  to those attempting to horn in on the issue that is making him, at 36, famous  -- and he's got copies of Esquire and Newsweek, among others, on his desk to  prove it. Big, full-sized pictures. ("Aw, I hate that picture," Rosenfield  says, grinning bashfully at himself, in shades, looking super cool, in  Esquire.)  </P> <P> It has usually been Gillespie's inaction that has most antagonized  herconsumerist watchdogs. They are particularly bitter that she did nothing to  stop dozens of insurance companies from using the loophole provided by the long  court delay to raise their rates. They also complain that, through her failure  to impose penalties on companies, even when she did act, Gillespie has set a  permissive tone for future industry misdeeds, given a green light for anything  from arbitrary cancellation of policies to purposeful undercharging of  customers in fly-by-night schemes to make a fast buck.  </P> <P> Nor do they see much to cheer about in the much-touted Travelers or State Farm  cases -- neither company was inconvenienced nearly so much as their customers,  and "she was excruciatingly slow to act in both cases," says Steven Miller,  head of the small Insurance Consumer Action Network.  </P> <P> Not least, Gillespie's critics saw her utter contempt for Proposition 103 writ  large in her refusal to begin early hiring, writing regulations and taking  other steps to swing into action if the court upheld the measure. Gillespie,  who did predict that "the court can never uphold that thing in its entirety --  it's unconstitutional," insists that she had been preparing all along and will  be ready to begin rate hearings by July.  </P> <P> BUT IN ALL these long months, nothing has better captured the full flavor of  the case of Gillespie vs. the Consumerists than the public hearing she held in  March to investigate a 9.6% rate increase by State Farm, California's largest  auto insurer. The State Farm rate hike, announced in January, only three months  after passage of Proposition 103, ignited consumerists as little else could. To  them, it was the insurance industry at its most arrogant, and an added economic  burden to thousands of policyholders who were shelling out an extra $14 million  a month in premiums.  </P> <P> Gillespie said her hearing would demonstrate her full intent to implement the  people's will "in the spirit of 103 -- to spread sunshine." Assorted consumer  organizations, as well as observers from Van de Kamp's office and the  California Trial Lawyers Assn., saw it differently.  </P> <P> To them, Gillespie's handling of the State Farm hearing reflected her at her  cunning, deceitful worst, posturing as a heroic watchdog of consumer interest,  while, in fact, doing everything in the book to sabotage the intent of  Proposition 103, starting with her delays in holding the hearings. The rate  hike had been in effect for almost two months before Gillespie convened her  public court. Then, when Gillespie did schedule the hearing, her department's  attorneys first held a private meeting with State Farm attorneys. Consumer  attorneys were not invited. "And if that's not collusion, what is?" howled  Harry Snyder of Consumers Union. Gillespie dismisses the meeting as  "unimportant."  </P> <P> The day of the hearing, several consumer-group representatives showed up in  full force, and the sideshow began.  </P> <P> In a technical dispute over which provisions of 103 were in effect and which  were under Supreme Court stay, consumerists, backed by Van de Kamp's office,  argued that the hearing should resemble a courtroom proceeding, with themselves  entitled to sufficient information and privileges to determine whether the rate  increase was legitimate. That is not what they got. Roxani Gillespie evidently  knows how to maintain order in the courtroom, her way.  </P> <P> "It was incredible! A kangaroo court! Like being in Moscow!" sputtered Snyder  afterward.  </P> <P> "Harry behaved very badly," Gillespie sighs. "He was really out of order. He  just kept popping up, and he hadn't done his homework, as usual."  </P> <P> "Gillespie denied us every single right of participation, of discovery mandated  by 103," Snyder screamed. "She totally ignored legal process."  </P> <P> "Ah, process. Always the process," exclaims Gillespie, touching her forehead in  mock despair. "They are so hung up with process. But the process is not for  them. It is for the policyholders. They don't like that I used Section X as  opposed to Section Y? What is the difference? My goal is the bottom line -- not  Section X versus Section Y!"  </P> <P> Meantime, Gillespie was viewing State Farm's rate increase with the same amused  tolerance she applies to her critics: "State Farm is pleading misery, but, it  is in a way sort of like Donald Trump raising his rents. He doesn't really need  it, but he will tell you that all of his buildings have to pay for themselves  because he's in business. And that's what State Farm is saying. 'Yeah, I don't  need it. I can put food on the table. But I'm not a charity. I'm in business.'  "  </P> <P> But it's all moot now. Gillespie still hadn't made up her mind about the State  Farm increase when the Supreme Court ruled on 103. Now, she says, the company  will go through the same rate relief hearings, starting in July, as everyone  else. But the public hearing wasn't wasted, Gillespie says cheerfully. "It was  a good dress rehearsal for the types of hearings we're going to have. It was  good training for all of us."  </P> <P> IT'S THE END of the day, some of the fire has died down, Nader and Rosenfield  are mostly forgotten. Now Gillespie, softer, quieter, wearing baggy blue jeans,  is showing a visitor around her home, a picture-post-card, three-story  townhouse on a San Francisco hillside overlooking the Presidio. Inside is a  page from House Beautiful -- Persian carpets, burnished wood, antiques, bay  windows, hand-carved ceiling friezes. In fact, Gillespie says, looking shyly  pleased, "the blind pianist, what was his name? George Shearing used to live  here." Gillespie and her husband, Chris, 56, bought the house when they first  came to San Francisco. Today it must be worth a small fortune.  </P> <P> But it's the oil paintings of Gillespie's ancestors that are her real treasure.  They are all over the house, elegant portraits of dark-eyed people, period  pieces many years old, each lovingly lighted. Now Gillespie is darting about  like a butterfly, radiant, alighting briefly before each one to tell that  relative's special story.  </P> <P> Nothing seems to take the insurance commissioner's mind off her Proposition 103  wars faster than the chance to discuss her rich family history. Liberators of  Crete, field nurses, poets, both grandfathers members of the Greek Parliament,  one of them -- chairman of the National Bank of Greece -- jailed for defying  the Nazis during World War II. Gillespie's memories of both World War II and  the civil war that crippled Greece into the '50s include "corpses lying in the  streets . . . starving children." In the next breath, she's sunny again,  describing the glories of the 15th-Century family home that she still maintains  on the island of Corfu.  </P> <P> "We weren't rich, at least not by American standards," she says with quiet  pride, lingering before a portrait of her father, a businessman, "but my family  had certainly been comfortable for many generations. But they were also the  kind of people who did things."  </P> <P> Gillespie is also the classic doting mother. She is particularly proud of  daughter Margaret's impending career takeoff, so much more glamorous than her  own. "She just interviewed with eight major (international law) firms -- and  had her pick," Gillespie happily brags, leading the way down a corridor.  </P> <P> Discussing her husband's attitudes toward her career, she is typically direct:  He's supportive, he's proud -- otherwise, he doesn't like it. "He complains  that it's been a lot of pressure on him. And it's true. He doesn't have a woman  whose only concern is his welfare and what he is going to eat and those kinds  of things. It's just not the kind of environment his father had. But," she  finishes with a laugh, "I think he's getting used to cooking his own dinner."  </P> <P> And now we are in Gillespie's bedroom, admiring what is apparently her most  prized family portrait, a pretty, dark-eyed woman who looks a little like  Gillespie herself. This is her grandmother, she says, and, for a second, Roxani  Gillespie is silent, reverent, a woman visiting some private shrine.  </P> <P> But in the next second, she has flung open her closet door, yelping with  frisky, defiant glee. You don't believe that she actually buys her Laura  Ashleys by the half-dozen? Well, see for yourself. It is stupefying, this act  -- who else but Roxani Gillespie would invite a perfect stranger to gawk into  her closet? And what do we find? Crumpled clothes, dirty underwear, coat  hangers on the floor?  </P> <P> No. What we have here, lined up in a neat row, is a sea of dark-colored Laura  Ashleys, maybe 50 of them, all looking just alike -- not a single deviant dress  in the lineup. On the floor are four pairs of shoes, exactly alike -- squat  pumps with little bows, in different colors.  </P> <P> Gillespie stands there laughing. "I was more conscious of my image when I  worked at Industrial Indemnity, of course. Back then, it was very important to  look, um, prohibitive. So I wore suits. But now," she chortles, "my idea of  looking prohibitive is to wear black."  </P> <P> Then Gillespie is excitedly discussing a trip she would make to London the  following week to attend a big international insurers conference. She would be  a guest speaker and also meet with the head of Lloyd's of London, she says,  eyes dancing, plainly impressed. "The international market is becoming quite  important in California, you know," she remarks with all the dignity befitting  the California insurance commissioner. "And it's going to be exciting, too.  These trips are fun."  </P> <P> Give the Laura Ashleys a year. Roxani Gillespie is outgrowing them fast.  </P> <P> Porsche convertible courtesy of Bob Vernali.  </P></p>

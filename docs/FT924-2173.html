			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Total warns of steep fall in earnings for year TOTAL yesterday became the second French oil company to forecast a steep profits decline for the year, when it warned net earnings in 1992 would drop by more than the 47 per cent decrease recorded in the first six months. Mr Serge Tchuruk, Total's chairman, told a shareholders' meeting the first-half decline would be 'confirmed or slightly exceeded in the full year', prompting a fall in the share prices of Total and Elf Aquitaine, its larger French rival. The squeeze on refining margins over the past year and the dollar's decline, has hit Total harder than Elf Aquitaine, because more of Total's activities are downstream. Elf recently predicted a 35 per cent fall in 1992 profits, citing several reasons including over-capacity in the petrochemicals industry. Total's forecast includes the impact of a FFr600m (Dollars 113.2m) charge for restructuring and writing down the value of some non-strategic assets, as well as the FFr50m it will have to contribute towards repairing a fire-damaged refinery, the rest of which is covered by insurance. Mr Tchuruk warned the gloomy international economic situation may last through the first half of the year, despite encouraging signs from the US. However, Total planned to maintain its dividend this year unless the oil industry outlook worsened.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> b. Shared Use Services and Other Authorizations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The specific categories of shared-use services listed below are not on the statutory schedule but were listed in the House Report. As discussed above, we propose that emergency and public safety services would be exempted from regulatory fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Aviation (Aircraft and Ground Stations) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . The aircraft radio service provides communications between aircraft or from aircraft to ground stations and includes frequencies used to communicate with air traffic control facilities. See generally 47 CFR Part 87. Aviation aircraft transceiver stations are subject to a regulatory fee of $7 per year per station (the total fee of $70 per station for ten year license term is to be paid at the time a renewal or new application is filed). Aviation ground stations provide communications to aircraft for weather or landing information, or for logistical support to aircraft operations. These stations are subject to a regulatory fee of $7 per year per license (the total fee of $35 per license for five year license term is to be paid at the time a renewal or new application is filed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Marine (Coast and Ship Stations) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . Marine coast stations are land-based stations in the maritime services, authorized under Part 80 of our rules, which provide communications services to ships and other watercraft in coastal and inland waterways. Coast stations are subject to a $35 regulatory fee for each license, covering the five year license term ($7 per year). Marine ship stations, also authorized under Part 80, provide telecommunications between watercraft or between watercraft and shore-based stations. Shipboard radio installations are required by domestic and international law for large passenger or cargo vessels. Radio equipment may be voluntarily installed on smaller vessels, such as recreational boats. Ship stations are assessed a $70 regulatory fee per station, covering the ten year license term ($7 per year) and is to be paid at the same time a license renewal application or new application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . GMRS, authorized under Part 95 of the Rules, is a land mobile radio service that provides personal and limited business communications between vehicles or to fixed stations for short-range, two-way communications. Each GMRS license is subject to a $35 regulatory fee, which covers the five year license term ($7 per year) and is to be paid at the same time a license renewal application or new application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Other Land Mobile <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . Licensees in the land mobile services not covered in the exclusive use category provide one or two way communications between vehicles, persons or to fixed stations on a shared basis. These services, authorized under Part 90 of the Rules, include radiolocation services, private carrier paging, industrial radio services and land transportation radio services. Regulatory fees will be assessed on a per license basis with the $35 fee covering the five year license term ($7 per year) and is to be paid at the same time a license renewal application or new application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> c. Amateur Vanity Call-Signs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 12. If Part 97 of the Rules is amended by the Commission to authorize the use of vanity call-signs, amateur radio operators would be able to request a specific call-sign.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See Notice of Proposed Rule Making <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in PR Docket No. 93&hyph;305, 9 FCC Rcd 105 (1993). Each amateur licensee with a vanity call-sign will be assessed a regulatory fee of $7 per year. The total fee of $70 will cover the ten year license term during which the call sign will be in use. The first 10-year fee must be paid at the time a request for a vanity call-sign(s) is made. If a requested vanity call-sign is not available or otherwise cannot be issued to the requestor, the regulatory fee will be refunded since amateurs are expressly exempt under the statute from regulatory fees, unless they have received their vanity call-sign. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Mass Media Bureau <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 13. The regulatory fees for Mass Media services generally apply to broadcast licensees and permittees and to other regulatees. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  We have exempted noncommercial educational broadcasters from regulatory fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that some Mass Media services, such as the direct broadcast satellite service (``DBS''), the Instructional Television Fixed Service (``ITFS''), and FM translators and boosters were not specifically listed in the statutory schedule. We believe that ITFS was excluded because of its general educational noncommercial status. We also believe that the omission of DBS and FM translators and boosters was inadvertent and that Congress did not intend to exempt all DBS permittees and licensees and licensees of FM translators and boosters from regulatory fees as these services result in the Commission incurring costs for necessary regulatory functions. Since these services are not on the statutory schedule, we have not assessed fees for these services during the 1994 fiscal year. However, pursuant to our authority in section 9(b)(3) to modify the schedule, we intend to add regulatory fee categories for DBS licenses and for FM translators and boosters to be assessed and collected during the 1995 fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> a. AM Radio Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 14.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Class A <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . Class A AM radio stations are unlimited time stations operating on a clear channel and designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended service area and at relatively long distances from their transmitters. Class A stations' primary service areas are protected from objectionable interference from other stations on the same and adjacent channels, with secondary service areas protected from interference from other stations on the same channel. The operating power shall not be less than 10 kW nor more than 50 kW. For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class A AM station will be assessed a $900 annual regulatory fee. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatees are to pay the fee to which their facility is subject on the date the fee is due. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

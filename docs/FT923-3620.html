			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Minister warns of danger of No vote: Sapin foresees threat to French economy MR Michel Sapin, the French finance and economics minister, yesterday threw the weight of his powerful government department behind the campaign for a Yes vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty to be held on September 20 and predicted widespread adverse consequences in the event of a negative outcome. 'A vote in favour of the treaty by the French people, and not only by its parliament, would reinforce France's position not only within Europe but in the world,' the minister said at his weekly press conference, reinforcing his point with detailed statistical information showing how France had benefited from membership of the European Community. On the other hand, a No vote would weaken France's international position and have very bad economic consequences. One of the results, according to Mr Robert Lion, managing director of France's principal state savings and investment institution, the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, would be a general rise of 1 point in French interest rates and a fall of economic growth to below 2 per cent in 1992, compared with 2.6 per cent in the case of a Yes vote. These warnings from two of the leading members of the country's financial establishment coincided with the publication of new opinion polls showing a continuing decline in support for the Maastricht Treaty, though those intending to vote Yes in the referendum remain in the majority. Although they predict a narrow victory for the Yes camp, the polls do not agree on the size of the majority. The IPSOS institute announced yesterday that 53 per cent of the voters polled intended to endorse the Maastricht Treaty, against 47 per cent who would vote against it. But the ISL poll found that only 51 per cent of the electorate at present intended to vote Yes, compared with 49 per cent opposing the treaty. The large number of polls conducted over the past three weeks, publication of which will be banned from midnight on Saturday until the referendum is held a week later, show that a large number of voters remain volatile and could change their minds at the last minute.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER HIGH-ROLLER WITH FEET OF CLAY;  </P> <P> COVENANT HOUSE: THE RECTOR OF THE RUNAWAYS KNEW HOW TO TUG THE HEARTSTRINGS.  HIS TROUBLES CAME WITH PURSE STRINGS.  </P> <P> Giovanni Francesco Bernadone, the 13th-Century Italian soldier who gave up  war-making to serve the poor and became St. Francis of Assisi, advised his  followers to avoid money, power and fame. After that, do it twice as hard.  </P> <P> For a time, America's favorite Franciscan was Father Bruce Ritter. Like the  founder of his order, the priest reached out to the scorned and wretched. In  1969, he took in homeless kids, most of them runaways barely surviving on New  York's streets: They came to his East Greenwich Village tenement apartment.  When the flow increased, he founded Covenant House near Times Square. It would  quickly become both a legend and a beacon.  </P> <P> Now, after months of publicity over allegations of sexual liaisons, shady money  deals and favoritism, Ritter has resigned as director of his organization. Last  week, new charges about a secret trust fund of nearly $1 million and payments  of $350,000 in contract fees to relatives placed Ritter still further away from  the Franciscan spirit that was part of his early appeal.  </P> <P> The priest is the latest in a wide pew of high-rolling reverends who, with  computerized donor lists for electronic panhandling, access to politicians and  CEOs, and a media given over to press agentry, turn out to have feet of clay --  and legs, upper trunk and arms, too.  </P> <P> Americans, with a national penchant for hero worship, had in Ritter a model for  something higher: saint worship. A 1981 front-page story in the Wall Street  Journal took everything that Ritter said as gospel. By then, he was well into  major fund-raising, taking both foundation and government money, along with the  widow's mite. The $12-million budget in 1981 would rise to $85 million by the  end of the decade.  </P> <P> Every tax-deductible, nonprofit organization with an income over $25,000 is  required by the IRS to provide a financial statement to anyone asking for it.  Maybe all was well during the buildup years, maybe not. Who was checking --  staffers earning $90,000? Ritter's operation in 1988 was nearly twice the size  of the federal government's funding for runaway-youth programs, except no  General Accounting Office was on hand to monitor what happened to money sent in  by some 650,000 donors. While Ritter passed the hat, an unquestioning media  passed the buck.  </P> <P> Much of the secular press has trouble holding the popular clergy to standards  routinely applied to other public figures. Religion, like entertainment, can be  a business of appearances. It shouldn't be a sacrilege to look at one of the  haloed and wonder, "If we give him a free ride will we end being taken for a  ride?"  </P> <P> Ritter was a favorite of Ronald Reagan. In 1984, the President stationed the  priest in the gallery for the State of the Union address and had him take a bow  as an "unsung hero." The next year Ritter signed on as a member of Edwin  Meese's commission on pornography. George Bush toured Covenant House last  November, shortly after Georgetown University conferred an honorary degree on  Ritter.  </P> <P> If the political right was thanking the Lord for a man known as the Rector of  the Runaways, so was the religious right. Such Catholic money men as J. Peter  Grace, the billionaire chemical CEO, and William Simon, Treasury secretary  under Richard Nixon, became Covenant House angels.  </P> <P> Although not frequent, it is common enough in Catholic religious orders that  members become untethered to the community after hearing the applause of  secular society. Instead of staying on their knees, they stay on their toes --  for the big donation, the fatter grant and the splashier promo. In the  mid-1960s, the award-winning novel "Morte D'Urban," by J. F. Powers, told the  tale of a religious-order priest who was snared not by wine, women or song but  by the thrills of fund-raising.  </P> <P> Ritter, who denies all charges of wrongdoing, became too big for the humble  Franciscans. He was also beyond the control of another group -- social workers  who ran programs for runaways. They criticized his establishing large-size --  not small -- shelters, and then locating them in prostitution zones. That, said  a runaway-youth official in a 1983 federal survey, is like using a tavern for a  meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.  </P> <P> Ritter, whose mass-mail fund-raising letters were models of unction speaking of  God's mercy toward "His kids whom He loves so much," brought in gobs of money.  He knew how to tug the heartstrings. His troubles came with purse strings.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Fisons starts disposals with Dollars 140m sale in N America FISONS, the troubled UK healthcare group, yesterday sold its US and Canadian consumer health businesses for Dollars 140m (Pounds 93m) to Ciba-Geigy Corporation, the US subsidiary of the Swiss chemicals group. The deal marks the start of Fisons' disposals programme that will involve the sale of its horticultural and consumer healthcare operations. It will concentrate on ethical pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments. Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, said: 'We are very pleased with this sale because we thought it would be the most difficult to get away.' The consideration will be used to reduce group debts. The North American operations had a turnover last year of Dollars 65m and made an operating profit of Dollars 5.5m. They represented about 40 per cent of the division's profits. Mr Thomas said negotiations were continuing for the sale of remaining consumer healthcare businesses. The largest, in the UK, generated sales last year of Pounds 27m, those in Australia Pounds 16m and those in South Africa Pounds 11m. The most important product line is Sanatogen vitamins. Bids are being considered for each of the remaining national consumer healthcare operations. One company looking at the vitamin business is thought to be E. Merck of Germany. Mr Thomas said negotiations for the sale of the horticultural business, which had sales last year of just over Pounds 100m, were advanced. There was at least one interested buyer offering an acceptable price. An announcement would be made in the near future.</p>

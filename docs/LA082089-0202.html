			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO INVITATIONAL SOCCER TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> HAWKS BEAT JUST-UNITED ORANGE UNITED  </P> <P> Tom Manulkin got the call Thursday night. It was his youth soccer coach with  news that the season was starting early -- as in early the next morning.  </P> <P> Manulkin, 14, had just returned from a Lake Arrowhead vacation with his  parents, and he hadn't played soccer since February. But Friday morning he was  one of 11 Orange United players competing in the Mission Viejo Invitational  Soccer Tournament. Eleven players -- the bare minimum for soccer -- were all  Orange United coaches could round up after they were asked Thursday morning to  replace a team that had canceled.  </P> <P> Robbie Fisher got the call Friday night after returning from a week of  cross-country training in Mammoth. With Fisher, who will be a sophomore at  Villa Park High School in the fall, and with a couple of other players added,  Orange United had the luxury of a few substitutes.  </P> <P> However, it still wasn't the same team that was the under-16 runner-up in the  California youth soccer championships this year.  </P> <P> That's why Gary Manulkin, Tom's father and an "assistant-assistant coach,"  seemed a bit surprised Saturday afternoon that the team even had a chance to  advance to the tournament's final. Orange United went into Saturday's game  against the Diamond Bar Hawks knowing that the winner would advance to the  final.  </P> <P> On the sideline, watching the second half of the game against the Hawks, the  elder Manulkin explained that practice was scheduled to start Monday for his  son at Mater Dei. Martin Stringer, the Monarchs' soccer coach, was planning to  put the team through a week's conditioning.  </P> <P> "That was going to be our hell week," Manulkin said. "Instead this is our hell  . . . " His sentence was cut short by his own yelp and cheers for the first  goal of the game, by Orange's Alex Martinez.  </P> <P> After Freddy Romo scored to put Orange ahead, 2-0, there was a excitement on  the Orange sideline. Orange United beat Diamond Bar in the semifinals of the  state tournament this year, but a victory in this tournament would have been  considered an upset.  </P> <P> But the upstarts were stopped quickly by Diamond Bar. Three Hawk goals in about  six minutes ended Orange's chances. Manulkin, the player, watched the three  goals from the sideline, fearing that he had pulled his left hamstring.  </P> <P> Going for its second consecutive Mission Viejo Invitational Championship,  Diamond Bar will play the North Huntington Beach Football Club at 2 p.m. today  at the Mission Viejo Lake Youth Athletic Park in the under-16 division. Orange  United will play the Junior United Soccer Assn. Banditos at 9:15 a.m. for third  place.  </P> <P> In the boys' under-19 semifinal round today, the North Huntington Beach  Football Club will play Cal Express at 8 a.m. and the Corinthians will play  Mission Viejo Pateadores Gold at 9:15 a.m. In the girls' under-19 semifinal  round, the Shooting Stars will play Mission Viejo United at 8 a.m. and the  Villa Bratz will play the Football Club Heat at 9:15.  </P> <P> Finals will be at 4 p.m. today.  </P></p>

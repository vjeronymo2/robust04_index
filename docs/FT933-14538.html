			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Caledonian seeks privatised mines stake CALEDONIAN MINING, a Nottinghamshire mining equipment manufacturer, is seeking to become a significant shareholder in a privatised British coal industry, providing the business is sold off as a single entity. The privately owned company, which has an annual turnover of about Pounds 30m, has told the government that it wants to own a significant part of the 51 per cent of British Coal that it hopes the government will sell in the first tranche of privatisation. Although Caledonian is a relatively small company, its bid is significant because it is among the first to express faith in a privately owned British coal industry. The government plans to privatise the industry within two years and hopes to bring a bill before parliament in the autumn. Mr Colin MacLeod, Caledonian chairman, said the company had the backing of its bankers for a bid if the government agreed to its pro-posals. Caledonian's bid is likely to be strongly opposed by unions and some managers who want to bid for British Coal themselves. Caledonian says in a submission to ministers that it would welcome employee participation through share ownership. But it would expect to negotiate no-strike agreements and modern working practices. The company agrees with management and unions that British Coal should not be broken up. 'It is doubtful if a coal industry could survive if it was split into a number of comparatively small units all competing in a market place dominated by two principal customers,' it says. It adds that coal producers would be played off against each other in the need to generate sales, and urges an 'orderly' rundown of electricity generators' coal stocks. Mr MacLeod said yesterday that his company would not be bidding for individual mines sold by British Coal in the approach to full privatisation. In the longer term, however, it would be interested in mines such as Easington in Durham and Wearmouth in Tyne and Wear, which are being closed by British Coal.</p>

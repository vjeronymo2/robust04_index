			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe by </F> correspondents Dorian Berry and Paul Eylers on the "Good Morning  South Africa" program; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Berry] I picked up this from  the news -- I know we were all drinking coffee then, but I  snatched this item from the news reader in which she read that  Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha says South Africa's  transition to democracy is a big lesson for Nigeria to restore  civilian rule, and he said he was committed and anxious to  return Nigeria to democratic rule. Would you agree with that?  I think as foreign minister you might have to, but possibly you  could....    [Kingibe] No, no, I'm not agreeing, just being the foreign  minister. There is a national consensus about the imperative  for democracy in Nigeria. There has always been. We have been  consolidating independence, consolidating democratization over  time, but there are events which make us return to military rule  periodically, and we are under military government at this point  in time, but under a military government committed to  democratization. Indeed, it has already unfolded a plan of a  speedy return to democracy in Nigeria. As you quite rightly  quoted, our head of state said this commitment is not only a  commitment of the government, but it is a commitment of the  people. Our transition program has been unfolded, and come 2  January 1995 there will be full political activity with the  formation of political parties, to be followed soon by the  restoration of full democratic government.

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: TRUMPS' RECONCILIATION AGAIN A WAR OF WORDS  </P> <P> EASTER WEEKEND, Donald and Ivana Trump were hand-holding, having lunch with  their kids, taking in a movie in Connecticut. People were talking  "reconciliation."  </P> <P> As Earth Day weekend ended, the battling Trumps were in a no-reconciliation  mode. After Donald's appearance on "The Larry King Show" on CNN and Marla  Maples' exclusive on ABC's "PrimeTime Live," Ivana's attorney, Michael Kennedy,  made two rare public statements.  </P> <P> Kennedy said: "Donald Trump is 'the Master Manipulator.' But he has become  bankrupt in all ways except financially."  </P> <P> Kennedy was also derisive over Donald's charges that Ivana had tried to get  many lawyers to take her case and been refused. Kennedy said: "There is not a  lawyer in this country who wouldn't drop his briefs for this case!" (Ivana  Trump remarked the day after she returned from the Aspen incident meeting Marla  with Donald on the slopes that she went immediately to Kennedy. The reason? "He  can't be bought by Donald. He can be trusted. And he has known the family for  13 years and he always represents the powerless against the powerful.")  </P> <P> I asked Kennedy many questions, but he declined to say more or to comment on  the merits of the case. (Donald Trump responds: "Kennedy's words on moral  bankruptcy are actionable.")  </P> <P> IVANA'S PALS had much to say about what happened on TV last week. They've  observed Ivana waver from angry resolution to a heart-melting susceptibility.  Now intimates hope that "The Week of TV" will firm up her resolve. One  commented: "The problem is that Donald appeared to be the soul of reason with  Larry King, who put him on for a full hour with no annoying call-ins. King  treated Trump like a pussycat. Then, although Marla may have reaped a TV  ratings whirlwind, especially in New York, aside from revelations that she's in  love with Donald and has never taken money from him, the interview rated a zero  for content."  </P> <P> From Ivana's side comes an amalgam of "reliable sources," remarking on both TV  shows. These speakers insist they can't be identified for fear of "reprisals"  from Donald.  </P> <P> 1. Donald says he is a family man. Reality: He carries on an adulterous affair  for years. (Donald denies this.)  </P> <P> 2. Donald says the family is the most important thing to him. Reality: His true  sensitivity to his family is shown in that he walked out on them. He then hired  a self-acclaimed "killer who rips the flesh from witnesses" (lawyer Jay  Goldberg) to defend himself against his wife and children. And Trump is  reported having angrily fired his brother, Robert, from the Taj Mahal, although  Robert is still in the Trump organization. (Donald says he did not fire  Robert.)  </P> <P> 3. Donald says Ivana is getting $25 million and the house in Connecticut from  the nuptial agreement. Reality: If the Trumps divorce, Ivana gets $10 million  only, and the house.  </P> <P> 4. Ivana is said to have been disturbed by remarks her husband made on the King  show to the effect that their children are "great," newspapers are kept from  them, they are "insulated." Reality: Ivana's intimates say the children are  "devastated," back in school in N.Y.C. and not "insulated" from comments by  their chums. (Donald says: "It is disgraceful that Ivana and her  representatives are playing the children for sympathy. I have assured the  children no matter what happens to the marriage, I will continue to be their  father and to provide moral support, love and affection and our relationship  will in no way change. "  </P> <P> 5. On the King show, Donald restated his idea that "people grow apart." This  was also repeated by Marla to Diane Sawyer. One intimate of both Trumps says,  "Growing apart is one thing. Lying and cheating are another." This source  insists that Marla wasn't truthful in the matter of money from Donald. "He has  been supporting her for years." (Donald denies this.)  </P></p>

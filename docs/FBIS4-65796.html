			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andreas Khatzikiriakos] </F>   [Text] The negative prospects for a quick solution to the  Cyprus issue have resulted in discussions at the European Union  [EU] headquarters on radical scenarios for the accession of  Cyprus, or part of it, to the EU.    The EU bureaucracy in Brussels appears positive regarding  Cyprus' accession to the Union, as long as this does not bring  it into confrontation with Turkey, does not get it involved in  the Cyprus issue, and provided structural changes within the EU  have proceeded to a conclusion.    Despite all the above reservations, there are thoughts about  the accession of Cyprus to the EU through Greece, or the  clarification and amendment of the German formula for the Cyprus  case. It appears that what the EU will not accept is the  existence of two clearly Greek states with the same prerogatives  (presidency-veto).    A source in Brussels who favors Nicosia's positions has told  O FILELEVTHEROS that what the Cyprus Government should make  clear is that Cyprus itself would agree to have the free areas  alone join the EU if there is no solution to the Cyprus issue.    Regarding the Cyprus Government's demand for talks with the  EU to begin as quickly as possible, the Brussels bureaucracy  appears to have divided views.    There are some who support the beginning of some kind of  talks in 1995, but not necessarily accession talks. On the  other hand, others feel that the EU should limit itself to a  statement regarding expansion that will satisfy Cyprus and Malta  but will have no practical effect at this stage.    In general, it is thought that Germany's presidency  [beginning in July 1994] will prove decisive for the EU's  relations with Cyprus and Turkey because the EU-Turkey Accession  Council will convene in the second half of this year, when  deliberations that are expected to lead to full customs  association between Turkey and the EU in 1995 will be  intensified.</p>

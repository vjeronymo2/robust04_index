			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): MSF poll winner faces threat of instant removal THE WINNER of an election to head MSF, Britain's fifth-largest union, may be removed from office two days after the declaration of the result next week, Michael Smith writes. The poll outcome is scheduled to be announced on Thursday of next week, but a motion to be considered by the conference of the general technical union on May 18 calls for the election to be declared null and void. It has been proposed by the union's branch in St Pancras, London. Mr Roger Lyons, assistant general secretary and one of the two candidates, is one of its members. Supporters of Mr Lyons argued strongly for the election this year of a general secretary-designate to succeed Mr Ken Gill, who retires in August 1992. Mr Gill, a standardbearer of the left in the trade union movement, opposed the move, saying it was intended to undermine his position. The union executive's decision to call the election in between annual conferences last year and this year angered some members who believe the timing should have been a conference decision. In addition, the Commissioner for Trade Union Rights has indicated that the election could be challenged legally on the ground that a general secretary and his or her successor should not hold office together for more than six months. Mr Lyons' opponent in the election is Miss Barbara Switzer, another assistant general secretary. The St Pancras motion seeks to censure the executive for proceeding with the election. It says: 'The conference is the proper place to take decisions of this magnitude.' Another motion, from Queen's University, Belfast, urges the conference to ask Mr Gill to stand down immediately to allow a successor to take up the reins. 'This would also avoid the possibility of any further legal action in this area.' The MSF said yesterday it had settled a pay dispute with more than 100 officers that led to a ban on overtime. The settlement provides for 9.3 per cent rises, backdated to January 1. MSF had originally offered 4.5 per cent. Negotiations are to take place on a formula for determining future pay awards.</p>

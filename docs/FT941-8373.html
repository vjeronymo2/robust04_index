			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Pick up a bottle of 1822 - Jancis Robinson tastes madeira, the world's longest living wine How very boring we all are. For 99 out of 100 drinkers, wine is either red or white, occasionally pink, and, if stronger than average, then either sherry or port. But what about madeira? Here is yet another wine of world renown invented by British merchants, and one that is truly thrilling to taste, yet it is all but ignored by the world's wine-drinkers. In Britain, for example, the UK's imports of madeira are barely one fortieth of its imports of port. I was reminded of the thrill of top quality madeira the other day as I wallowed in a wine made when Emily Bronte was four years old - a Cossart Gordon Verdelho 1822. It was a light tawny, beautifully creamy, mellow and probably nearing its prime but still lively enough to show off, being full and rich without too much sugar or alcohol but with madeira's characteristic tang. A prancing 171 year old] They say, and I've said too, that fino sherry's the thing to get the gastric juices flowing, but madeira does the same thing while offering the richness of a tawny port. The great thing about madeira of any age or quality, unlike any other wine, is that you can open a bottle and sip at the contents for months before it starts to deteriorate. The bottles from which I recently tasted 18 vintage madeiras from 1971 back to 1822 had been opened nearly two months previously and showed not a jot of decay. Madeira has one more unique attribute in my experience. Compared with port, brandy or liqueurs - its rivals as what are ludicrously known as 'digestifs'  -madeira is much less likely to cause a hangover. This is a bold claim, as madeira is almost half as strong as gin and has to be treated with caution. But fine madeira does have a certain way of cleaning out the cerebral rafters before the morning after. Vintage madeira is the most expensive, and is not even released before it is 20 years old, although it will still be in its infancy then. A bottle of vintage madeira is unlikely to cost much less than Pounds 60, but it can be sipped over many an evening and makes a great birthday present if the year can be matched to recipient. Madeira has also produced historic wines made by fractional blending, so called solera madeiras dated with the year in which the blending system or solera was begun, typically in the 19th century. These can be very fine, mature wines at much the same price as vintage madeiras. Madeira was one of the first 'varietal' wines, traditionally made from a single grape variety in the following styles: Sercial - lightest, most delicately tangy and slowest-maturing of all; Verdelho - rather nuttier and fuller but still quite dry; Bual - rich raisin and molasses flavours; and Malmsey - the Malvasia grape makes the sweetest, darkest madeira. The island's supply of these noble varieties has been so decimated by pests and diseases that today's basic three year old madeiras (labelled 'Finest', with blatant disregard for the English language) are made mainly from the lesser Tinta Negra Mole vine and are labelled stylistically rather than varietally, as in 'Dry'. Five year old 'Reserve' blends are generally about Pounds 10, and should contain at least 85 per cent of the noble variety specified, but better value are Special and Extra Reserves, older blends at Pounds 13 to Pounds 20 with more cask ageing and subtlety. Although vintage and solera madeiras are usually even better value than these 10 and 15 year old blends, some of the best madeira buys are the Reserva blends from Henriques &amp; Henriques which have an average age of 88 years. Because they are not dated, they are available from La Vigneronne of London SW7, Britain's greatest cache of fine madeira, at Pounds 26.95 a bottle. Since Portugal joined the EU, and Symington, the port family, took control of most of the best known madeira names, the madeira wine industry is being licked into Euro-acceptable shape, but the wines live so long that it could be at least a century before every bottle of madeira fits in to the neat, new taxonomy. Drink these wines before and after meals, or with cheese, and revel in their durability. The 1964 and 1954 vintages are nowhere near ready.

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> STANKOWSKI LEADS SOCAL TEAM IN PACIFIC COAST PLAY  </P> <P> When Paul Stankowski of Oxnard won the 90th annual Southern California Amateur  golf championship last Sunday at Glendora Country Club, he became the first  teen-age winner of the prestigious event in 10 years.  </P> <P> Stankowski, 19, a junior at Texas El Paso, shot 279, nine under par, over the  narrow, tree-lined course, defeating Randy Drake, the home club favorite, by  three strokes. It was the second summer victory for Stankowski, who a few weeks  ago won the Oxnard city championship.  </P> <P> His next outing will be the 23rd annual Pacific Coast Amateur tournament, which  starts Tuesday at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Stankowski heads an  eight-man team that will represent the Southern California Golf Assn. in the  72-hole event.  </P> <P> Other team members are David Stockton of Mentone, last year's runner-up; Jerry  Michals of Vista; Craig Steinberg of Tarzana; Buz Greene of Thousand Oaks;  George Lombino of Lynwood; Jack Spradlin Jr. of San Diego, and Pat Duncan of  Rancho Santa Fe.  </P> <P> Representing the Southern California Public Links Assn. will be Kelly Manos of  Cypress, Dan Pouliot of Burbank, Tony Chieffo of Granada Hills and Dave  Fernandes of Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> After the Pacific Coast Amateur, Stankowski will try to qualify for the United  States Amateur, Aug. 7, at Palos Verdes, where 114 players will be going for  seven berths in the tournament at Merion, Pa., Aug. 22-27.  </P> <P> The last teen-ager to win the SoCal was Jeff Hart of Solana Beach, who was 19  and a student at USC when he won in 1979. The only younger winners in the  nation's oldest continuously contested amateur tournament were Al Geiberger of  Santa Barbara in 1956 and Doug Clarke of La Jolla in 1977, who were 18.  </P> <P> Stankowski, who plays out of the SeaBee Golf Club of Port Hueneme, received a  scholarship from UTEP on the basis of winning the Channel League championship  as a senior at Oxnard High. He also finished fifth and third as a 16- and  17-year-old in Junior World tournaments.  </P> <P> Paul, whose brother Tom won the Los Angeles City junior title in 1982 before  playing four years at Arizona State, has been playing golf since his father  started him in the game at 8. Tom, who is now playing on the Golden State Tour  as a professional, caddied for Paul in his Glendora triumph.  </P> <P> Southern California golf enthusiasts were taken by surprise when popular Tom  McHugh was released as professional and course manager at Los Angeles Royal  Vista, formerly Pomona National, in Walnut.  </P> <P> McHugh, 60, started at the 27-hole facility in 1967 as director of the National  Golf Courses properties that included the Ontario and Corona courses as well as  Pomona. He left briefly in the 1970s to become director of golf at Cathedral  Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs, but returned in 1977.  </P> <P> "The course (Pomona National) lost more than $100,000 in 1977 and we turned it  around in three years," McHugh said. "I ran the course like it was my own. I  wouldn't have done a thing different if I'd owned it myself."  </P> <P> One of McHugh's most successful innovations was a St. Patrick's Day tournament  for which players signed up months in advance to make sure they could get  starting times. He also thought up the Comedian's Golf Classic and the  California 500 Celebrity tournament, which featured such players as James  Garner, Bob Newhart, Don Rickles, Joey Bishop and Claude Akins.  </P> <P> "We didn't have a meeting of the minds on the way the course should be  operated," A. C. (Sandy) Waterhouse Jr., owner of L.A. Royal Vista, said of  McHugh's dismissal.  </P> <P> Dan Horning, formerly of the San Ramon National course in Northern California,  has replaced McHugh.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> The purse for the 18th annual Queen Mary Open, Aug. 17-20, has been increased  $10,000 to $110,000, according to tournament director Doug Ives. First two  rounds will be played at the Skylinks and Lakewood courses in Long Beach, with  Lakewood the site of the final two rounds. John McComish, last year's champion,  will not defend, since he is now playing on the PGA Tour. The Len Kennett  Putting championship will be held at Lakewood in conjunction with the  tournament, offering a purse of $7,500.  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia's win in the British Open moved him up to fifth in the Sony  worldwide rankings, behind Seve Ballesteros, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo and Curtis  Strange. . . . Pro Bob Spencer of Sierra La Verne knows the way around his home  course. Spencer, who is playing in the Senior British Open this week, has made  three holes in one this year at Sierra La Verne, the most remarkable with a  driver on the downhill 405-yard 11th hole. Two days earlier, he had missed an  ace on the same hole by a foot, according to George DeLellis, who witnessed all  three aces.  </P> <P> Al Geiberger, Jack Nicklaus, Kathy Whitworth and Hubie Green have been inducted  into the Collegiate Hall of Fame. . . . Robert Gamez of Arizona, the Pacific 10  champion, has been awarded the Nicklaus Trophy, given annually to the top  collegiate player in the country. . . . When Brad Greer won the Greater  Sacramento Open, it was the first time a player had ever repeated as champion  in a Golden State Tour event. Greer is a two-time SoCal Amateur champion from  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Mark the dates on your 1990 calendar: Jan. 4-7, MONY Tournament of Champions,  La Costa; Jan. 17-21, Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, La Quinta; Feb. 15-18,  Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, Torrey Pines, San Diego, and Feb. 22-25, Nissan  Los Angeles Open, Riviera.  </P> <P> Julie Lynd of Lake Arrowhead CC won the 18th annual Southern California Women's  Masters championship by two strokes over defending champion Sue Ewart of Old  Ranch. Lynd shot 230 in the tournament for club champions, which was held at  Industry Hills, California and Sierra La Verne. Low net was a tie between Kiiko  Kimihara of Industry Hills and Sue Hanki of Palm Meadows at 226. Teri Melanson  of Rancho Park had long drive of 254 yards.  </P> <P> Rancho Park's nine-hole course is open again after having been closed for  several weeks during construction of a new irrigation system. . . . Billy  Casper, Johnny Miller and Gene Littler are the three best male golfers and  Mickey Wright the best female golfer born in California, according to Golf  Digest.  </P></p>

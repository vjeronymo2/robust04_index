			<p>BFN     [Text] During his recent inspection of some mountainous  areas in southern Gansu, provincial party committee Secretary  Yan Haiwang conducted on-site investigations and study. He  stated emphatically: We should make every possible endeavor to  steadily develop agriculture, successfully build  vegetable-basket projects, and show more concern for people's  livelihood.    From 20 April to 25 April, Secretary Yan Haiwang and his  entourage went deep into seven counties in southern Gansu to  inspect town and township enterprises and vegetable production  bases. They also visited some peasant households; inquired  about the situation in the implementation of central policies,  the building of vegetable-basket projects, and arrangements for  people's livelihood; and helped local areas tackle economic  problems.    After being briefed on the situation in building  vegetable-basket projects in these counties, Secretary Yan  Haiwang noted that the supply and prices of vegetables now have  become a pressing issue for urban residents. This is why  vegetable-basket projects have a crucial bearing on the overall  situation.    During his investigations and study, Secretary Yan Haiwang  fully affirmed the achievements scored in economic development  by the seven counties, saying: Now that the seven counties have  made excellent development plans, they should strive to  implement their respective plans to the letter in the months  ahead, make redoubled efforts to emancipate their minds, push  ahead with opening up and exploitation, become bold in trying  out new methods, firmly implement new methods proven successful  in practice, vigorously further reforms, develop a series of new  trains of thought to guide local economic development, carry  forward a self-reliance spirit, and work in a down-to-earth  manner.    Secretary Yan Haiwang also called for making sound  arrangements for people's livelihood and for solving the problem  of sufficient food for poor peasant households in the province's  mountainous and disaster areas, in batches and stages. He urged  leaders at all levels across the province, and especially  principal leaders, to attach great importance to and assume  personal responsibility for work in this regard.    Those accompanying Secretary Yan Haiwang during his recent  investigations and study were Song Zhaosu, secretary general and  member of the provincial party committee standing committee; Mu  Wenli, member of the provincial party committee standing  committee and secretary of the Zhangye City CPC Committee; Han  Zhengfu, vice chairman of the provincial committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; as well as  some other provincial leaders.</p>

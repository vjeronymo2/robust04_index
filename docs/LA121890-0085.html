			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: A REQUIEM FOR CHAKA -- AND DANIEL  </P> <P> Think back to September, 1989. A sleepy time, not much happening in the city.  Out in the projects of downtown L.A., a teen-age kid is hanging around the  family apartment.  </P> <P> This would be Daniel Bernardo Ramos. A sweet boy, by most accounts. He's small  for his 17 years, with calf eyes and a great affection for his skateboard.  Daniel is the kind of kid who would ride a skateboard to the bathroom.  </P> <P> Anyway, on this evening Daniel's brother strolls by. He, the brother, has some  spray cans and plans to decorate a few blank walls in the neighborhood. Daniel  can come if he wants.  </P> <P> So out they go, and Daniel puts a paint can in his hand for the first time. He  wonders what he will write. Then it comes to him. He will use the nickname that  his friends gave him several years before. "Chaka" is born.  </P> <P> That was the beginning of one of the most remarkable careers in graffiti  history. A career that apparently ended only last week. As you may know, Chaka  is currently cooling his jets in County Jail, having been busted while writing  his name on one more light pole.  </P> <P> Before the end, it is estimated that some 10,000 Chakas had been scrawled on  everything from freeway signs to store windows. This number is all the more  impressive when you realize that Daniel's career lasted only 15 months. That  comes to 25 Chakas per day, month in and month out, with no time off for  vacations. During this period, Daniel surely did little else beside travel  through our neighborhoods and write advertisements for himself.  </P> <P> I know about Daniel's beginnings as a graffiti artist because he told me. Not  in person. On videotape. Some months before he was busted by the Los Angeles  Police Department, Daniel was approached by the RTD police and asked if he  would tell Chaka's story. Since buses were not targets of Daniel's spray cans,  the interview would be friendly. Daniel said OK; he would spill.  </P> <P> What's revealed on that tape is surprising. The boy who has befouled thousands  of urban landscapes shyly nibbles M&amp;Ms and presents himself as courteous,  quiet and determined. This is no common goon but a young man absorbed by a  quest.  </P> <P> His work day starts at 11 p.m. and ends at 5 a.m. He sets out from home  camouflaged as a kid headed for algebra class, never forgetting his glasses.  You can fool the cops that way, Daniel says. In his knapsack he carries not  books but seven spray cans -- five black and two silver. This is enough  firepower for 85 Chakas.  </P> <P> Also in the knapsack is accessory equipment as complete as any doctor's bag.  There are paint nozzles and glass scratchers for the right effect. There are  color-coded freeway maps and a directory of all Chief Auto Parts stores.  </P> <P> The last item is maybe the most comic. The Chief is Daniel's store of choice  for stealing paint. Since he steals so much, he knows he can't depend on any  one branch. So he chooses a different store each week from the directory.  </P> <P> This is a kid fascinated with detail. He knows you don't put up 10,000 Chakas  without having your act together. So he uses devices such as a list of Southern  California neighborhoods. It's an organizing tool. The neighborhoods are  divided into "to do" and "done" categories.  </P> <P> If you live in Marina del Rey, Studio City or Irvine you have been "done."  </P> <P> If you live in Venice, El Monte or El Segundo, not to worry. Chaka has plans  for you.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of competition out there," Daniel says on the tape. "It's all  about who gets around the most."  </P> <P> As for why a kid would spend most every night from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. dodging  cops and urban predators, Daniel has his answer. By creating Chaka, he has  created himself. Chaka/Daniel is now everywhere. When he overhears someone  mention the notorious Chaka, Daniel says, he gets "real excited." It makes him  want to write even more.  </P> <P> And the nights spent on the streets of a dark, sleeping city have brought other  rewards. He meets people, has adventures and plays his game with the cops.  </P> <P> "It brings memories," he says, and nibbles another M&amp;M.  </P> <P> You wonder if Daniel is thinking about those memories in the slam. The  prosecutors want to nail him for 48 separate counts and say they plan to put  Daniel away for a while.  </P> <P> Was Chaka worth it? This is a question that would seem laughable to most of us.  </P> <P> But we are not Daniel. And somehow I get the feeling that for this kid, even  now, the answer may not be obvious at all.  </P></p>

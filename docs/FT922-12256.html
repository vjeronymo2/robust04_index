			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (11): Washdays made more environmentally friendly - Warwick International FEW homes these days would be complete without a carton of concentrated or environmentally-friendly washing powder. The growth in the popularity of such products has been one of the clearest signs of the increased public commitment towards conserving the environment, and they are now the fastest-growing area in the European detergent industry. Additives produced by a Welsh company, Warwick International, are used in almost all of them. Ariel Ultra, in the UK, and Dixan, in Europe, are the best-known brands containing the company's products. Warwick, awarded a Queen's Award for export for the second time in five years, is one of only four companies worldwide (and the only one from the UK) that produces the additives essential to make such powders effective. Among these four, Warwick says it has the largest market share, although it will not reveal the precise figure for competitive reasons. For more than 12 years it has been developing a range of bio-degradable additives based on the chemical Terta Acetyl Ethylene Diamine (TAED). These have two main applications. The first is to improve the efficiency of lower-temperature powders. Chlorine-based bleaches have been replaced by 'greener' oxygen-based bleaches in most powders, but the latter do not function well at lower temperatures. Enter Warwick's bleach activators, which enable oxygen-based bleaches to work even at lower temperatures. Lower-temperature powders consume less energy during the wash, while their concentrated forms save even more energy by requiring less packaging and being more economical to transport. The second main application for Warwick's additives is to boost the effectiveness of phosphate-free powders. Many manufacturers have attempted to eliminate phosphates as they contribute to the growth of algae in rivers and in the sea. 'The growth of environmental awareness has been an important factor in our success,' says Mr David Richards, the managing director. 'There has been a real resurgence in the past few years in the use of concentrated detergents, due to both economic and environmental factors.' Warwick International, based in Mostyn, Clwyd, also produces flame retardants for fabrics, and softeners for textiles, but detergent additives are the bulk of its business. The company's workforce has grown from 20 to more than 300 in less than 12 years. More than Pounds 40m has been reinvested in that period in new equipment and buildings. The company's export policy, however, has also been crucial to growth. Exports accounted last year for 82 per cent of sales, and Warwick has more than doubled its already substantial export trade since it won its first Queen's Award in 1988. One reason for this is the company's policy of sending its scientists and technical experts on frequent trips abroad to work with local companies to produce the environmentally-friendly products best suited to a particular market. The company now has a multi-lingual sales team in the UK and places great emphasis on the need for foreign language-speakers - backed up by a network of 22 sales agents worldwide. Of the 40 overseas countries Warwick exports to, western European markets, particularly Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Benelux are by far the largest. But Warwick is also making inroads into eastern Europe, where the need for green detergents is evident. It is also developing business in middle Eastern countries including Algeria, Morocco, the Gulf states and Egypt, as well as in south-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Its next target for expansion is Latin America. Warwick has also contributed to the regeneration of the local economy, which was devastated when the nearby Shotton steelworks closed in 1979, with the loss of 8,000 jobs - the biggest ever plant closure in Britain. In 1984, Warwick received loans worth nearly Pounds 6m from the European Coal and Steel Community to aid the expansion of its chemical works and switch from oil- to coal-fired equipment. The expansion helped to create more than 200 jobs, many of which went to former steel workers from Shotton.</p>

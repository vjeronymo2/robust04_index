			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Togolese Government  announced in Lome today that legislative elections have been  postponed for two weeks. They are now slated for 6 and 20  February.    A government communique stated that this decision was made  as  a result of the "delays observed in carrying out some material  tasks, mainly the personalization and distribution of voters'  cards." The government also stated that "it took into account  French and German electoral experts' views."    The text of the communique stressed that this postponement  illustrates the "concern" of the head of state, General  Gnassingbe Eyadema, and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh "to  help these elections take place under better conditions."    This revision of the electoral timetable is in response,  observers note, to the wishes of the moderate opposition, who  were of the view that the initially fixed dates of 23 January  and 6 February would be "technically" impossible to meet, as  they would jeopardize the validity of the poll.</p>

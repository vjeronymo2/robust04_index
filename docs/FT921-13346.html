			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: London and Man writes off Pounds 17m bad debts LONDON AND Manchester Group, the life assurance company, is writing off Pounds 17m before tax relief in bad debts on commercial property loans. As a result the final dividend is frozen at last year's 9.144p for a 2 per cent rise in the total. The shares fell 22p to 263p on the news. Mr Tom Pyne, group chief executive, said that the group had withdrawn from the commercial property lending market last year. 'It's very much a one-off, and the losses have been struck off after a very rigorous examination of the portfolio. We've made sure that we now make adequate provision to make absolutely certain that our liabilities are now fully covered.' Mr Roger Harvey, analyst with Kleinwort Benson, welcomed the news, saying: 'I'm quite pleased to see them take this action, rather than let it depress dividend cover. Analysts agreed that 1991 sales figures in the mainstream life and pensions business were more encouraging. New annual premiums were up 3 per cent to Pounds 50.4m, while new single premiums rose66 per cent to Pounds 115m. This reflects an industry-wide trend, which has shown consumers being wary of taking out regular commitments in a recessionary environment, but much more willing to shelter any spare cash they have in single premium products.</p>

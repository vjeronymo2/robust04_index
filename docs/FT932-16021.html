			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Germany awaits ruling on Nato role GERMANY'S constitutional court yesterday failed to diffuse mounting tensions in the coalition government after it adjourned proceedings without a ruling on the legality of German military participation in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Constitutional judges in Karlsruhe will meet again today to debate the appeal made by liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior party in the coalition, against an earlier cabinet decision for Germans to fly Nato missions in Awacs surveillance aircraft once the United Nations no-fly zone is enforced. Germans make up as much as a third of some of the multinational crews. Their removal would lessen the effectiveness of the Awacs fleet, which will be at the heart of Nato's monitoring operation over Bosnian airspace. The judges are expected to rule today only on the validity of an interim injunction requested by the FDP. If they issue the injunction, it would prevent German participation until the court rules on whether involvement in such enforcement missions violates a vague constitutional ban on German military participation in combat operations outside of the Nato area. Chancellor Kohl and the ruling Christian Democrats, eager for Germany to play a greater international role, argue that article 24 of the constitution allows for military participation alongside the UN. If the court agrees to hear the appeal, it could take months before they rule on it, Mr Gotthard Wehrmann, the court spokesman said. The court's failure to come to a prompt decision yesterday led to bitter recriminations from FDP politicians. Mr Hermann-Otto Solms, parliamentary leader for the FDP, said that the coalition could be jeopardised if the court refused to hear the full constitutional case brought by the FDP. The FDP has said it supported in principle a greater German military role in the former Yugoslavia, but demanded constitutional clarification on the involvement of German forces. The move, which allows the FDP to both support the government's overall policy but sue against a specific cabinet decision, has been widely criticised.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in Bonn </F> by Ulrich Wickert in Cologne on 4 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Wickert] After the United Nations banned the Serbs  from the Sarajevo region, they sent their troops to Gorazde and  caused great suffering there. When UN pressure became too  strong in Gorazde, the Serbs shifted their troops again -- this  time to the north of the country. Whereas the Serbs and Muslims  are now concentrating their troops around Brcko, the United  Nations is preparing the deployment of 12 unarmed military  observers. Thus, nobody should be surprised if the Serbs play  cat and mouse with the United Nations. We interviewed Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe on this issue in our studio in Bonn  shortly before this program. Good evening, Mr. Ruehe.    [Ruehe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert.    [Wickert] Mr. Ruehe, is the credibility of NATO suffering if  the Serbs withdraw their troops from one area -- from Gorazde,  for example -- upon NATO pressure, but use them again in another  place -- in Brcko, for example.    [Ruehe] You are quite right. First of all, the credibility  of the United Nations, under whose auspices the whole operation  is being carried out, is being damaged. Yet NATO is also  affected. We have seen that after the ultimatum for Sarajevo,  things calmed down there. The Serbs then shifted their military  actions to Gorazde. A resolution has now been adopted that  covers all six safety zones. However, there are signs that the  Serbs might again circumvent the decision. Precautionary  measures have to be adopted to deter them because the  international community, the United Nations, and NATO cannot  allow the Serbs to lead them up the garden path.    [Wickert] You discussed this issue in a five-hour meeting  with the U.S. defense secretary on what could be done to improve  deterrence. What was the result?    [Ruehe] Well, we discussed other topics, too. I also  visited the State Department. There have also been statements  in Paris. I believe that a solution must be found to prevent  what happened in Gorazde from being repeated.    [Wickert] What solution do you consider conceivable?    [Ruehe] International measures might be adopted with the  United Nations. The safety zones might be enlarged on the basis  of the existing formula to ensure that additional military  action does not develop in other areas. We finally need a  cease-fire and a situation in which violence is reduced so that  the peace process can be advanced. In spite of all the  ultimatums, one must never forget that a lasting solution is  only possible if a peace agreement is concluded. However, it  must be just so that it is not doomed to lead to another war.    [Wickert] Why is the West not yet ready to accept Yeltsin's  proposal for an international peace conference?    [Ruehe] This is one possibility. But it will only be  successful if violence can be stopped in Bosnia. Nothing would  be worse than a peace conference that would be reduced to  absurdity by military actions on the part of the Serbs. Thus,  both things belong together: The implementation of a cease-fire  everywhere in Bosnia and preparations for diplomatic efforts.  The Russian proposal is quite interesting in this respect. A  peace conference would then lead to a political solution. Yet,  I would like to stress once more that the approval of the  Serbian side is required. If one forces a completely unjust  solution on the Muslims, this would be the beginning of the next  war. Monitoring the implementation of such a peace agreement  would be terrible for the United Nations and for NATO.    [Wickert] The United States believes that lifting the arms  embargo on Bosnia would be useful. You also support this  measure. When will it be possible?    [Ruehe] Well, we have endorsed such a move for a long time.  However, one must also bear in mind that the number of soldiers  on the ground who have saved the lives of tens of thousands of  people -- particularly British, French, Danish, and Dutch  soldiers -- has increased. They might be endangered. We are  facing a dilemma and a conflict here. What I told the Americans  is that we supported them on this issue in the past, but that it  is now important to avoid a unilateral U.S. decision -- by  Congress or by the President. Future decisions should be  adopted jointly by Europe and the United States so that the  situation does not become even more complicated.    [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.    [Ruehe] You are welcome.</p>

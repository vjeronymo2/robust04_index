They appealed to the Rwandan parties to show a spirit of  compromise and to overcome outstanding obstacles. They stressed  the urgent need for a solution in view of the political and  economic timetable. After studying the agreements on power  sharing, all political parties which were legal on the date of  the signing of the protocol and the Rwandan Patriotic Front must  be represented in the Transitional National Assembly, once  formed, on condition that they respect the peace agreement.    It will be up to the commission on unity and national  reconciliation to that each political force respects the code of  political ethics. Violations are punishable by exclusion from  the institutions, as decided by the supreme court.    They recommended that the commission be set up without delay  after the establishment of the institutions and that it be  charged with evaluating the behavior of parties represented  within the institutions. They stressed that if this principle  is respected by all parties, there should be no further cause  for delay in the establishment of the institutions. Each  political force should restrain itself from trying to create new  problems among or within political parties. A constructive  attitude is indispensable for the satisfactory conclusion of the  ceremonies to establish the two broad-based institutions and for  their efficient operation.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Summit plan leaves Copenhagen flat - Danish shares are still the worst performers in Europe this year There had been hopes that the solution to Denmark's Maastricht treaty problem, at the Edinburgh summit a little over a fortnight ago, would lift the Copenhagen bond and equities markets out of the doldrums in which they have wallowed since last the treaty went down to defeat in the Danish referendum last June. But the Edinburgh deal has failed to impress the financial markets, which are operating under the influence of several important negative influences. The continued currency unrest and very high short-term interest rates are a drag on the markets. The medium-term outlook is adversely affected by currency depreciation in several of Denmark's most important export markets, especially Sweden and the UK, and by the prospect of stagnation in the German market which accounts for 20 per cent of Denmark's merchandise exports. Several of the large industrial companies have adjusted their profit forecasts for 1992 downwards, including FLS Industries, Danisco and Lauritzen, while Carlsberg warned that earnings growth may not be as strong in 1992-93 as last year. Novo Nordisk's share price, meanwhile, has fallen in recent days following a statement by the group that it will not be able to introduce nasal sprays for insulin before the turn of the century. The all-share index has fallen by nearly 25 per cent since the beginning of 1992, making Copenhagen the worst performer in Europe. The shares to suffer most were the banks, down by 30 per cent, insurance, down 39 per cent, and investment companies, down 38 per cent. In each case the performance reflects the dismal state of the property and the equity markets. Although no major Danish bank has run into terminal trouble (in marked contrast to the banks in Denmark's Nordic neighbours), the banks continue to report very large loss provisions. Hafnia Holding, controlling the Hafnia insurance business, suspended payments in the autumn following unwise investments in Sweden's Skandia and Denmark's Baltica, while Baltica expects to see its equity capital halved as a result of 1992 losses. Until both long- and short-term interest rates come down, and bond and share prices recover, companies in the financial sector will continue to face extremely difficult conditions. While market conditions have been unsatisfactory in 1992, the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE), the Guarantee Fund for Future and Options and the Securities Registrations Centre, the institutional trio which operate the Copenhagen market, are feeling pleased by a number of innovations which they say have helped to make the Copenhagen market more attractive. The Guarantee Fund reduced its fees to market-makers three times in 1992, finally abolishing fees, which were made per contract, for registered market-makers with effect from the first trading day of 1993. The Copenhagen futures and options market has noted an increase in contracts concluded of about 50 per cent in 1992, says Mr Tyge Vorstrup Rasmussen, the fund's chief executive, and he expects that there will be a similar increase again in 1993. Options on three new shares will be introduced from January 1: Carlsberg B, Sophus Berendsen B and ISS B. Options trading exists already for Danske Bank, Unidanmark, Novo Nordisk, Danisco and East Asiatic. Another important innovation was the establishment in the autumn of Copenhagen Stock Exchange International (COSI) for trading in international securities which are not listed on the CSE. The COSI list includes leading German and Scandinavian shares and Swedish government bonds. 'Turnover in some of the Nordic shares, such as Norsk Hydro, Volvo and Ericsson, in the COSI system is 20 to 70 per cent of the turnover in the shares' domestic markets,' says Mr Vorstrup Rasmussen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A state of extreme caution prevails in various  areas in the south and western al-Biqa'. The occupation forces  last night machine-gunned the Habbush valley and al-Wadi  al-Akhdar from their position in al-Suwayda'. They directed  sniper fire at the Habbush road.    Israeli helicopters flew over al-Tayyibah and al-Qantarah at  2315 yesterday. Helicopters also flew over the villages of the  western sector and the plain south of Tyre after midnight last  night, dropping flares over these areas.    Enemy aircraft were seen over Tyre at 1200 today.    Security sources in southern Lebanon have reported that the  occupation forces brought into the occupied border strip tanks,  armored personnel carriers, and long-range artillery and  deployed them on the hills overlooking the areas adjacent to the  occupied part of the south.</p>

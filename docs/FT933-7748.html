			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Central America feels the benefits of liberalisation - The region's equity markets A new climate of economic liberalisation and growing political stability has given a boost recently to Central America's fledgling stock markets. But business caution, and sometimes arduous legal procedures, mean that they still have a long way to go. Many of the leading companies in Central America - a geographical area bounded by Guatemala and Panama - are family owned and, faced with the prospect of being accountable to shareholders, have been reluctant to issue shares. Share issues and commercial paper also require financial disclosure which, in a region notorious for its failure to pay taxes, has put off a number of potential participants. But Mr Roberto Solorzano of Guatemala's Bolsa de Valores Nacional, the largest and oldest of the country's three exchanges, believes that this will have to change. In the past, the protection afforded to Central American businesses by high external tariff barriers meant that they enjoyed largely captive markets in which foreign competition was limited. But following rapid economic liberalisation, this is no longer the case. 'If Guatemalan companies are to survive they will have to increase capital in order to compete,' says Mr Solorzano. A capital market has yet to appear in Guatemala, but four large local companies are preparing to issue shares by the end of the year, and a dollar futures market is developing, according to Mr Solorzano. Investors had hoped that the market, which is currently trading about 1.2bn quetzales a month (Dollars 210m), would reap the benefits of a prospective share issue representing the government's remaining 25 per cent stake in Aviateca, the former national airline. But since the election of Mr Ramiro de Leon as Guatemalan president in June, the previous government's extensive privatisation programme has been put on hold for fear of antagonising the labour unions. The oldest and largest market in Central America is in Costa Rica, where the Bolsa Nacional de Valores began operating in 1976. Over 90 per cent of transactions on both primary and secondary markets are government bond issues. Of the 115 companies listed, only 12 have issued shares, the rest covering mostly short-term commercial paper. The bolsa is now having to compete with a second exchange after the opening of the Bolsa Electronica, which uses software of the Chilean exchange which, it hopes, will provide it with a technological advantage. Meanwhile, in northern Central America, plans are also under way to strengthen the links between the markets of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, as economic integration between the 'northern triangle' has gathered pace. At a meeting earlier this year, these three countries' presidents agreed to facilitate a closer integration of the markets as part of moves towards greater financial harmonisation, to include free movement of capital, and permission for national banks to operate in neighbouring countries. A committee of members of the three exchanges is looking at the practicality of trading on each other's markets without having to make major changes to current legislation. There is already an agreement to allow brokers to work in all three countries and to allow securities registered in one country to be traded in the others. 'It is a question of time; there are no major obstacles,' says Mr Guillermo Hidalgo-Quehl, president of the El Salvadorean exchange. 'What we need to do is to put these agreements into practice.' But Mr Roberto Orellana, the president of the El Salvadorean Central Bank, admits that it will not be so easy. 'One of the problems is currency convertibility,' he says. In Guatemala, all foreign exchange must be sold daily to the Central Bank, which complicates payments. In addition, a future electronic link-up is at the mercy of particularly poor telecommunications in El Salvador and Guatemala. Mr Orellana is confident, however, that the system will be operating fluidly this year. 'The laws are becoming more uniform,' he says. 'The markets should integrate, and become more competitive.'</p>

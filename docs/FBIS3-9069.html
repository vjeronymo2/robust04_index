			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [T. Cela article: "Can Radio and Television That Speak </F> Albanian Be Considered Albanian?"]    [Text] The situation that the independent and opposition  Albanian press is experiencing is among the most difficult, or,  not to mince words, most alarming that it has ever experienced.  Journalists were not as much under threat as they are today even  in the days when the system was changing, in the first days of  pluralism, nor in the days of severe political tensions with  strikes and upheavals. When we say that we have won freedom  today, have gained democracy, and no longer live under a  dictatorship, we nevertheless have many more journalists before  the courts, in the prosecutors' offices, and in prison. We have  today more journalists than ever before hit on the head with  iron bars, and a journalist is frightened to walk on the street  lest he be charged and imprisoned for stepping over the white  lines. A journalist today is frightened of drinking coffee with  an acquaintance, because he can be charged and imprisoned as an  accomplice, and you cannot say that someone in power is  incompetent because you will be charged and imprisoned for  slander. Thus, journalists are under greater threat today than  ever. These threats come from two directions, from the state  and the street -- from the state with handcuffs for the wrists,  and from the street with an iron bar for the head.    To make known and protest these threats, the Professional  Journalists Association held a news conference last Saturday [12  March] for Albanian and foreign journalists and representatives  of the diplomatic corps accredited to Tirana, a news conference  widely reported by some Albanian newspapers. However, what made  a greater impression was the way in which the state media  handled it. Albanian Television, which had its journalists  present in the hall, did not report a single word about this  news conference that was so important for the threatened  journalists, not a word about extreme and unjust prison  sentences, and not a word about physical menaces. Meanwhile,  the BBC's Albanian language service from London devoted a  prominent eight-minute feature to the news conference, with  interviews with participants. The ET3 television station also  came to Tirana from Greece with a camera and a microphone,  interviewing the association's chairman, Prec Zogaj, and  presidium member Aleksander Frangaj, who had spent one month in  prison.    Albanian Radio-Television's [RTSh] ridiculousness is thus  obvious: It does not report problems that worry the independent  and opposition press or death threats against these journalists.  Europe, London, and Athens turn out to be closer than Tirana (by  Tirana, I mean RTSh). Who is it who is making Albanian  journalists beholden to foreign associations, newspapers, and  radio and television stations and making them say, "Shame on  Tirana?" Who are these people who are sullying the name of  RTSh, obliging Albanians to turn away from the only Albanian  channel and watch and listen to foreign stations to find out  what is happening in Albania? Seen from this point of view,  the question inevitably arises of whether the only radio and  television station that speaks Albanian can be considered  Albanian.    It is a real scandal that today, when it is claimed that  something has been won in the direction of freedom, Albanians  should huddle around foreign radio stations in order to find out  what is happening in Albania. It reminds one precisely of the  early days of changes in Albania, when we were working to bring  down the dictatorship, and when Albanians gathered at home at  1830 in order to listen to Voice of America as the only station  that then reported developments and activities of those who were  in opposition to the state and were working against the  dictatorship. At that time, RTSh defended that state and the  dictatorship. Today too, RTSh defends the state. The  opposition, independent thinking, and events or activities that  comment on or conflict with the political regime of today can  only be learned about on foreign stations. This shows that this  regime is scared of the truth.</p>

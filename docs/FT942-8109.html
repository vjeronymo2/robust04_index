			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Science and spirituality - Daniel Green ventures in to the Darwinian jungle of neuroscience THE ASTONISHING HYPOTHESIS: THE SCIENTIFIC SEARCH FOR THE SOUL by Francis Crick Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 317 pages What is it that says and thinks 'I'? Many people feel that it is the soul, but scientists, on the whole, do not. For them, and others of a more rational bent, believing in souls is no easier than believing in unicorns. There is no direct evidence for either, they say, and to accept their existence would call into question a host of scientific premisses and deductions. Unfortunately, scientists have yet to agree on exactly what does go on between our ears. Those who do venture an explanation usually fall into one of three camps. Some say that the physics of the brain is yet to be discovered: quantum mechanics, for example, is the most successful tool of modern science when applied to atoms and their components, but its implications for everyday experience remain unclear. Perhaps, one day, quantum mechanics will explain the mind. Then there are those who say that biology and physics belong to different worlds and to think that human activities, such as love and politics, could be described by physics is just silly. US Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman, for example, describes the brain as a Darwinian jungle where cells link to others in order to cope better with the world. Finally, there are those like Francis Crick, also a Nobel Laureate for his co-discovery of the structure of DNA, who argue that conventional science will provide the answer if it approaches the subject seriously. Crick's 'astonishing hypothesis' is: 'You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules'. His evidence is the vast and impressive store of discoveries in neuroscience. Taking just the question of how the brain turns electric signals from our eyes into moving colour pictures, Crick shows that the breadth and detail of today's knowledge of the physical brain are matched only by an awareness that there is still much to learn. He links this physical knowledge of cells to recent work in experimental psychology. Take 'blindsight', in which a patient can see but denies it. Brain damage leads to a patient saying that part of his field of vision is blank. Asked to point to a light placed in that field, 'the patient normally demurs, saying that since he is blind there, there is no point in doing the test. With a little persuasion he may be coaxed to give it a try and 'guess' where it was. The surprised patient, in spite of denying that he can see anything, points to the light usually to within five or 10 degrees.' The patient appears to be unconscious of something of which he is, in another way, aware. Crick concludes that it is not only the visual part of the brain that can be pinpointed, but a part related to consciousness, in this case damaged. Crick says that not only consciousness but free will have identifiable locations in the brain. His survey of the latest finds in neuroscience is clear and entertaining. But it does not lead, as the reader might expect, to a theory of how the mind emerges from the brain's jumble of wires and junctions. Instead the physicist-turned-molecular-biologist Crick appeals to fellow scientists to claim the subject of the mind from philosophers and psychologists and to bridge the gap between neuroscience and thinking. 'Now is the time to take the problem of consciousness seriously,' he writes. 'We cannot be satisfied forever by the guesses of yesterday.' One question that Crick does not answer is why mainstream 'hard' science has not yet taken up the challenge. He is 78 next month. Others will have to pick up the gauntlet.</p>

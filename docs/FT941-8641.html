			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Israel Fund lifts target to Dollars 200m The UK's first specialist Israeli investment trust has increased its size after heavy demand during the placing stage. The dollar-denominated Israel Fund, to be managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, was originally aiming to raise the equivalent of Pounds 100m in total. That has been upped to a maximum of Dollars 200m (Pounds 136.9m), Dollars 140.6m of which has already been raised from the placing, which closed earlier this week. The public offer opened yesterday and closes on March 3. First dealings are expected on March 17. Shares are being offered at Dollars 1, with one warrant attached to five ordinary shares. The fund will invest in Israeli companies listed in Tel Aviv or elsewhere, principally on Nasdaq. Up to 10 per cent can be invested in unquoted companies. The managers believe that a number of factors give Israel strong capital growth potential. These include continuing immigration, particularly of highly-qualified Russians, the easing of the Arab boycott, shrinking defence expenditure, a large privatisation programme, and a growing tourist industry. The main Tel Aviv index rose by 27 per cent last year, after a rise of 75 per cent in 1992. The fund's promoters are stressing that Israel is a mature rather than emerging market, but its economy is growing at rates comparable to emerging markets, greater than those of European countries. However, recent events in the Israeli stock market may have unsettled some potential investors. The arrest last week of a number of portfolio managers on suspicion of share price manipulation hit the market after a series of falls prompted by other factors, such as the US interest rate cut and a general correction of a developing 'bubble'. Mr Roger Hornett, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities, sponsors of the Fund, said that the arrests demonstrated that the regulatory authorities took a firm view of irregularities, detecting them even in high-volume trading, and as such gave an encouraging sign to international investors.

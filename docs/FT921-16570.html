			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / French pate de foie gras loses some class PARISIAN shoppers have thronged the narrow streets of the Eglise St Eustache in the Les Halles area of Paris in the seasonal rush to buy pate de foie gras. Sales of the delicacy - a creamy pate made from the livers of specially plumpened ducks and geese - are strong despite the economic slowdown. Yet producers in the Landes region of south-west France are in trouble. Prices in France have fallen sharply in the past two years. Imports are rising, while the recession in other countries, notably the US, is making exports more difficult. To add insult to injury, there are allegations of dubious practices in the Landes foie gras trade. Foie gras, often accompanied by muscat wine or champagne, has been part of the French diet for decades. It is the customary hors d'oeuvre over the Christmas and New Year holiday, when two thirds of the 8,820 tonnes of foie gras sold in France every year are consumed. The French appetite for foie gras is still strong. But the market is more competitive today than it was a few years ago. Prices have fallen 15 per cent to around FFr420 (Pounds 42.76) a kilo for standard goose foie gras in the past two years. This is partly because of a shift in distribution towards keenly priced supermarkets. It also reflects the continuing increase in imports of eastern European foie gras, which sells for a fifth less. Exports too are slowing, notably in the US and Japan, which showed particularly strong growth in the 1980s. A fifth of the 4,450 tonnes of foie gras made in France last year was sold to other countries. Mr Emmanuel Jung, secretary general of Rougie, a family company based at Farlat in the Dordogne, points to 'serious difficulties' in the industry. 'Profitability is low. Stocks are too high. Some producers are in a precarious state.' Finally, the government has announced an official inquiry into the industry following allegations that some producers are importing foie gras from Hungary and Bulgaria, repackaging it with Made in France labels, and selling it at French prices.</p>

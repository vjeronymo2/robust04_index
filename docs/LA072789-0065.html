			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Oscar is coming back downtown to the Music Center for next year's Academy  Awards, after two years down the freeway at the Shrine Auditorium. Richard  Kahn, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, says that  "the Shrine Auditorium allowed the academy to do some new and special things  with the 60th and 61st Academy Awards telecasts. At the same time, we've always  had a good relationship with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and we've done 19  very handsome shows from that venue. The board's feeling at the moment is that  we now have two very nice homes for the show, each with its own special  virtues." Oscar night will be March 26.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

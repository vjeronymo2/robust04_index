			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Books: The art of success - The 35th anniversary of T&amp;H's 'World of Art' series RARELY does an independent British publisher get to celebrate longevity these days; so many have been swallowed by larger competitors. It is even more unusual for a publisher to undertake a promotion not simply designed to sell more of its books but which also hopes to prod the general public into an appreciation of the visual arts, design and architecture. But Thames and Hudson's World of Art series is 35 years old this year, and its promotion on May 1 is quite exceptional. The distinctive black paperback collection of more than 130 titles, which eclectically stretches from Abstract Expressionism to Women, Art and Society is proof that commerce can still be both intelligent and successful. To commemorate its 35th anniversary, T&amp;H, as everyone knows it, is running a UK-wide World of Art day on Saturday May 1 when visitors to galleries and museums in Belfast, Cambridge, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Oxford and elsewhere can get two entrance tickets for the price of one. The only requirement is to carry a copy of a T&amp;H World of Art book, new or old. Visitors to galleries and museums which do not charge entrance fees will be able to get discounts on selected items in the gallery shops concerned. T&amp;H will be donating a percentage from sales of its World of Art books to three charities (two art charities and Greenpeace, the latter because of T&amp;H's dolphin logo) between April 19 and May 3. T&amp;H will spending in the region of Pounds 50,000 on the promotion. UK and overseas turnover this year will reach about Pounds 16m in wholesale prices for the company as a whole. T&amp;H started life in 1949, established by Walter Neurath, an Austrian who fled Nazi-controlled Vienna and arrived in London in 1938, and his second wife Eva, who remains chairman. Neurath's Fabian-socialist leanings inclined him towards producing high-quality art books at prices within the reach of the general public. He published English Cathedrals, T&amp;H's first English-originated book, in 1950. Far in advance of current 'New Age' vogues, T&amp;H's list has since its inception been shown interest in exploring not just classical fine arts but also more esoteric visual arts, mythology and what Thomas Neurath - Walter's son and currently managing director of T&amp;H - calls 'archetypal psychology'. Among its earliest series was Myth and Man, about the Homeric gods and Celtic mythology. The new publications for 1993's World of Art series include Aboriginal Art, Buddhist Art and Architecture and Latin American Art of the 20th Century. More than 23m World of Art books, in 16 languages, have been sold since the series began. T&amp;H has prospered since first established. Thomas Neurath says that T&amp;H's relatively small scale is a 'very viable model for publishers to stick with.' The company is guarded from death duty erosions of its independence by its family trust status. Moreover, T&amp;H regularly makes the top-ten list of booksellers' favourite publishers, because the company has an enviable reputation for sticking to its promises, delivery times and payments, all basic business practices, towards which larger publishers sometimes take a rather more cavalier approach. That reputation secures a welcome in other markets. T&amp;H has set up a joint venture with a Spanish publisher; it co-publishes with companies in Italy, and Germany; it runs its own companies in Australia, France and the US, and has links with Japanese publishers. The World of Art series is priced very competitively, at Pounds 6.95 a paperback, for books crammed with black-and-white and colour illustrations. Given that an ordinary unillustrated paperback can cost rather more than that, isn't T&amp;H failing to maximise potential profits? Not necessarily, and Thomas Neurath demurs at the suggestion that T&amp;H is philanthropically inclined. The economics of the World of Art series require that a typical first print-run will be about 30,000, quite substantial given that in the UK today a hardback print-run for a first novel might be as little as 500. T&amp;H has been hit recently by increased reproduction fees expected by museums and galleries for publishing paintings and exhibits; the estate of Salvador Dali gets a higher royalty for the World of Art book on Dali than does its author. Neurath argues that 'even if you end up paying Pounds 250 for a picture, once you spread it across a first print-run of 30,000 and then the book goes on selling, it doesn't really cramp us hugely. The whole economics is geared to volume.' But with telescoping attention-spans the order of the day, is not Neurath worried that the World of Art series, which requires a growing audience of thoughtful readers, might be running against the tide of contemporary culture? 'There are perhaps two streams operating. Not everyone is playing Nintendo games. Perhaps it is a sort of compensation. Short attention span activities are fulfilling up to a point. Eventually people realise that a wider view and a more sustained level of interest may be more important.' The World of Art series has become synonymous with well-written, informative and admirably illustrated guides to the finest of art and artists. 'The aim we have is to get people who know their subject and can write clearly and in a manner which is free from jargon . . . it's a very affordable and straightforward way of absorbing knowledge. Inexpensive books, which are accessible, open windows for people,' says Neurath. How many publishers today speak of opening windows for people - and even put their words into practice? That in itself is cause for celebration.</p>

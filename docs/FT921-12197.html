			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Ottawa to curb deficit with freeze on spending CANADA has frozen all discretionary government spending and public-service hiring to contain a spiralling budget deficit and calm increasingly jittery foreign investors. Mr Don Mazankowski, finance minister, said yesterday the freeze would hold the federal government's deficit to CDollars 31.5bn (Pounds 15bn) in the year to March 31, still above the original deficit projection of CDollars 30.5bn. The spending freeze will save a relatively modest CDollars 200m in the remaining two months of the fiscal year, but Ottawa is anxious to send out a message of restraint and financial prudence. The minister acknowledged the government was unlikely to meet its target of a CDollars 25bn deficit in 1992-93. Canadian bond prices and the Canadian dollar tumbled yesterday ahead of Mr Mazankowski's announcement. The dollar fell as low as 85 US cents, down from a peak of 89.30 US cents last November. The currency has lost more than a cent in the past week. Investors have also been unsettled by the deepening fiscal troubles of Ontario province, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the country's output. Ontario acknowledged last week that without further belt tightening its deficit would balloon to CDollars 14.3bn next year, from an original projection of CDollars 8.9bn. Ottawa is also reviewing all new capital projects. Mr Mazankowski said it would proceed only with those required for 'health, safety or essential services'.</p>

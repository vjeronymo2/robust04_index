			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] A total of six candidates were included in the  ballot papers -- Chairman of the Union of Agrarians and Council  of Collective Farms Alexander Dubko; Premier Vyacheslav Kebich;  head of the former parliamentary commission on struggle with  corruption Alexander Lukashenko; Secretary of the Communist  Party Central Committee Vasili Novikov; leader of the People's  Front Zenon Poznyak and ex-speaker Stanislav Shushkevich.    Dubko, Kebich, Novikov and Lukashenko represent the left  centrist bloc. Their programs focused on further integration  with Russia, gradual non-shock implementation of the reforms,  the continuing state management of the basic economic  industries, simultaneous existence of different forms of  property and the basic social guarantees for the population.  These four candidates are backed by the bloc of parties and  public movements making a part of the Belarussian People's  Movement. The Belarusian People's Movement includes the  Communist Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Republican  Organization of Veterans, the Union of Officers, the Slav  Council Party and others which have a wide net of local  structures.    Shushkevich and Poznyak represent the bloc of the right  forces. Their programs concentrated on "unconditional  neutrality," active economic reforms and introduction of  Belarus' own national currency units.    All candidates except Poznyak see Russia as the main  economic  partner of Belarus. Representatives of the left bloc regard  establishment of an economic union with Russia as the beginning  of a closer, not only economic but, later, also political  integration.    Both the left and the right candidates tried to put forward  single candidates from their blocs. However, no agreement has  been reached.    IF Note: In accordance with the Belarusian legislation, the  president is elected if more than a half of those voting during  the elections vote for him. In Belarus 7.349713 million people  enjoy the suffrage. About 2,000 Belarusian citizens will be  voting abroad.    Observers in Minsk said they believed that there would be  two  rounds of the elections since there was quite a number of  respected candidates each of who could win a significant part of  votes. Moreover, according to the rating of the six candidates  established during sociological polls, none of them had the  guaranteed support of the majority of voters. This made the  council of monitors under the Central Election Commission  recommend that media publish no results of different  sociological polls.    According to the Institute of Sociology under the Belarusian  academy of Sciences, Kebich (with 31 pct of respondents  supporting him) and Lukashenko (25 pct) have the best chances.  They are followed by Shushkevich, Poznyak, Novikov and Dubko.    The Belarusian Interior Ministry told Interfax that the  investigating bodies had practically completed the investigation  into the false assassination attempt on Lukashenko and would  soon announce the name of a person close to Lukashenko, who had  shot the Mercedes of the candidates in the Belarussian  presidency.    IF Note: In the evening on June 16 Interfax learned from the  initiative group of Lukashenko's supporters that his car had  been shot by unidentified persons during his campaigning trip  across the Vitebsk Region. The press services of the Interior  Ministry and the KGB officially announced that the assassination  attempt had been planned and carried out by Lukashenko's group  itself.    In an interview with Interfax leader of the initiative group  Dmitriy Bulakhov disagreed with the conclusion made by the law  enforcement bodies. He said that except this version the  investigating bodies had not cared to work on any other  versions. Bulakhov added that the investigation had been carried  out without respecting the secret of preliminary investigation  which made think that there were attempts to use the incident  with Lukashenko against him pursuing some political goals.    Bulakhov did not rule out that at the last moment the  candidacy of Lukashenko could be withdrawn from the presidential  race since feeling that Lukashenko's rating was growing, the  team of Kebich was ready to do anything in order to save its  posts.</p>

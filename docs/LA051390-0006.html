			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA'S LOST GENERATION  </P> <P> "China's Lost Generation" is another lesson for us in what our freedoms mean to  others and how important our way of life has become to the rest of the world.  </P> <P> "Tyranny Begins at Home" (by Harry Shearer), is a well-worded warning that we  must continually work to keep our freedoms.  </P> <P> Thanks for both, and let me say the magazine has become a must-read for me; it  is always well-done and thought-provoking.  </P> <P> HELEN SONGER, Van Nuys  </P></p>

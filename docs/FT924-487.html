			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Gardening: Euro-sceptics to the core - The Sloane Wallys have suffered a culture shock AMAZINGLY, six years have slipped by since Julian and Veronica Sloane Wally first made their move from Onslow Gardens in London to their not-so-old rectory in Sussex. There have been happy Christmasses meanwhile, but a cloud is hanging over this one. Like most of this year's problems it traces back to Europe. The truth is that, by different routes, the Sloane Wallys are confirmed Euro-sceptics. In Julian's case, scepticism is too weak a word for it. He still believes in the Special Relationship across the Atlantic and this year, he proved the value of his convictions by buying the dollar heavily in July. It is not just that he mistrusts Europe's combination of Opus Dei, the Mafia and New Germany: he hates the annual batch of petty Brussels legislation and the eternal hypocrisy about class. Everybody blames Britain for its class system, but the worst snobs are to be found in Europe, even though most of their titles were only dished out by Napoleon: this year Brussels has also excelled itself by impinging on Julian's favourite pastime. Shooting has always run in his family, but he is now being asked to take seriously a semi-federal Europe which has recently legislated to protect magpies and is about to require a qualified vet to be present within an hour of the killing of any bird or animal which is later to be sold to the game or poultry market. The prospect of sodden vets standing by Sussex gamecarts in order to conduct post mortems on each pheasant killed by Julian's friends on Boxing Day seems only slightly less absurd than declaring one of the worst predators in nature to be an endangered European asset. Until this summer, Veronica has been less dogmatic. Admittedly, the social wage would make nonsense of her deal with her Sussex daily woman but, in today's world, might it not be better to hang together, save Germany from the Germans and export post-Sloane style to the French who have always been mad about pearls and proper jerseys? Or so she thought, until Julian took her in late June to the equivalent of France's Game Fair beside the great chateau of Chambourd, on the way back from the gardens at Villandry, where the mass bedding out of ornamental cabbage had solved one of the Sloane Wallys' problems for next year's new paddock border. At first, the French idea of a game fair seemed rather fun. It was amusing to see what ritual the French made of killing things and to walk past stands with titles such as La Passion des couteaux. It was even funnier to discover an association which was exhibiting dead foxes, stuffed and fitted for slinging over the shoulder, for anyone who might have joined in the chase but felt cheated at having to go home without any trophy to show to the family. Veronica thought of ordering half a dozen for Sussex friends who hunt with the Crawley and Horsham, on the grounds that it is years since they last killed a fox in the open, but a nearby stand brought her up with a bump. At first sight, it looked very touching. Beneath a thatched roof, on a bed of straw, the French attendants had set out a family of badgers, stuffed, scrubbed to a chic black and white and shown in relaxed family mood. In one corner, a mother was snuffling, in the other, father was reviewing a litter of seven bright-eyed cubs, several of whom were engaged in acts of community care. It looked so like a nativity crib that Veronica thought at first of ordering one for the front hall at Christmas, when a Frenchman thrust a leaflet into her hand and asked if she wished to sign up as a chasseuse de blaireau 'at the adjacent tent'. Beside the straw crib demonstrators were showing a range of truly fearful instruments: tongs to catch a blaireau by the snout, spikes with which to extract it from the sett, long-handled spades with which to dig for a victim and a reverse attachment for coshing the head of Monsieur le Blaireau if he was found chez soi. Even worse, photographs of this foul sport were plastered all over the tent and the equivalent of a French field sports member was keenly enlisting names and distributing catalogues. The equipment made the antis' version of the Quorn hunt on video look like an episode from the Flopsie Bunnies. Julian was not in the least surprised, as Europeans had always struck him as totally unsporting and unsafe in the field, ever since he found two Spaniards out shooting with his syndicate. They had brought large sheets of metal and fixed them into the ground on either side of their stand, to protect themselves when they shot too low down the line during drives. Veronica's sympathies were rudely shaken: if this is Europe's idea of sport, how could someone who was Green from her head to her wellingtons have anything to do with it? This week, these old fears from the summer have resurfaced. After his coup with the dollar, Julian has been shopping across the Atlantic for his special presents this Christmas. A Sloane Wally can never say no to a gadget: in New York, he was given a copy of the All American Garden Supply Company whose goods looked irresistible. He was tempted by the Cadillac of Composters, electronically powered for a basic Dollars 99; there are Handy Totes with a Hundred Uses, Aerator Sandals which spike the lawn as you walk on it and two utterly irresistible tools of choice. One is a steel-plated Sod Corer with which, apparently, you can 'core the sods' which otherwise resist you: Julian decided it would be just the job for Veronica who is now sitting on the planning committee of the East Sussex Council. He has also ordered two machine-powered Bulb Planters with an auger which will kit into a handyman's drill and bore holes a foot deep for daffodils while a rounded shaft prevents kickback. Bulb planting is the great chore of the Sloane Wally's autumn, but next year, they will core sods and test-drill for narcissi even if the ground is as hard as bricks. Yesterday, the Americans delivered promptly, but, unfortunately, Veronica took receipt of the parcels. Wrapped in orange polythene, their contours seemed uncomfortably familiar. There was no post mark, but the sod-corer and the bulb-borer look worryingly similar to the very tools which the blaireau boys were trying to sell to Julian at Chambourd this summer. has he really had the nerve to buy them? If he has gone and made her a member of the French Society for Badger Digging, he will have to find someone else to cook his Christmas farm-fresh bronze turkey. The gadgets, meanwhile, are brooding in the stair-cupboard, items in a culture-clash, America or Europe, which has affected even a Sloane Wally's outlook in 1992.</p>

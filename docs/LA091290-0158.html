			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> INJURY BRINGS BUNGEE JUMP BAN  </P> <P> The thrill-seeking sport of bungee jumping was banned today pending review of  an accident that injured a former Miss Australia and an experienced jumper.  </P> <P> Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss Australia ended Monday, suffered a broken  collarbone when a cord came free as she and a staff member of the Bungee Bats  group plunged 130 feet.  </P> <P> McCurry and Andy Gulby took a tandem leap from a cage suspended by a crane off  Sydney's Birkenhead Point.  </P> <P> They had their arms wrapped around each other, and elastic cords attached to  their ankles were supposed to stop their fall a couple of yards above the  water.  </P> <P> But one of the cords broke free from the cage, leaving only the other to  support the couple's combined weight.  </P> <P> They hit the water and went under before the remaining cord stretched back.  Then they dangled upside down for several minutes with their heads just above  the surface.  </P></p>

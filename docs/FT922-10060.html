			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Injunction granted in publishing dispute THE increasingly bitter row over the future of Duckworth, the publisher, moved to the High Court yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes. The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, a 26 per cent shareholder in Duckworth, obtained injunctions against Mr Colin Haycraft, Duckworth chairman, and Mr Stephen Hill of Lica Development Capital, an industrial development capital group. It is believed the injunctions prevent Mr Haycraft and Mr Hill talking to potential investors or talking about the issues involved to the press. In March, Mr Haycraft was sacked as chairman and chief executive of Duckworth and locked out of the company's premises. He returned last month after raising enough money to exercise an option that took his shareholding in the company to 70 per cent. In recent weeks Mr Haycraft has been trying to find new investors to secure the future of the company.</p>

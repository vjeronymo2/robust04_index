			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Mortgage indemnity losses keep Sun Alliance in red FURTHER LOSSES from domestic mortgage indemnity insurance left Sun Alliance, one of the UK's largest insurers, in the red for the third consecutive year. However, milder weather, premium rate increases and more selective underwriting helped to reduce the pre-tax loss for 1992 to Pounds 129.6m. The result was a marked improvement on the Pounds 466.2m deficit in 1991, and prospects of a return to profit this year led the group to maintain its final dividend at 9p for a same-again 14.25p total. Even so the loss, coupled with the cost of the dividend and a Pounds 150m write-down of property investments, further weakened the balance sheet. Net assets fell to Pounds 1.55bn (Pounds 1.68bn) and solvency (net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) was reduced by 15 points to 54 per cent. Solvency amounted to 129 per cent at the end of 1989. Premium income from general business increased to Pounds 3.13bn (Pounds 2.68bn). Life premiums rose to Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.02bn) while underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 547.6m (Pounds 833.5m), mainly because of a reduction in domestic mortgage indemnity (DMI) business losses to Pounds 186.4m (Pounds 319.6m). The loss was partially offset by life assurance profits of Pounds 62m (Pounds 54.3m) and investment income of Pounds 356m (Pounds 313m). Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, said he expected a 'further substantial loss' from DMI in 1993, although repossessions and average claims costs were falling - to Pounds 12,500 compared with Pounds 15,000. DMI claims reserves had risen to Pounds 428m (Pounds 357m). Some Pounds 281m (Pounds 262m) was earmarked for outstanding claims, with a further Pounds 147m (Pounds 95m) in unearned premium reserves. Last year Pounds 170m was paid in claims, twice 1991's level. Underwriting losses from commercial insurance increased to Pounds 248m (Pounds 222m). The IRA bomb in the City last year left the group with net losses of Pounds 39m. Liability business also incurred significant losses, with reserves strengthened on employers' liability and professional indemnity lines. Losses from marine business amounted to Pounds 74m (Pounds 50m). Sun's Danish operation, which was expanded last week by the acquisition of Hafnia, was profitable. The purchase will increase the business generated from the Continent to 23 per cent, but it knocked another 4 points off solvency.</p>

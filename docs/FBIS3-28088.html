			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The government will ease  restrictions on corporate fund-raising overseas by increasing  the ceiling on foreign exchange-denominated securities issues  abroad from last year's 2 billion U.S. dollars to 2.5 billion  dollars and relaxing the qualifications required of corporations  to issue such foreign debts.    Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong, attending a meeting of  business leaders sponsored by the Korea Employers' Federation on  Wednesday, said the government would also selectively allow the  introduction of foreign commercial loans to finance imports of  capital goods for infrastructure expansion projects.    To help corporate investment in foreign countries,  restrictions on overseas real estate investment will be eased,  while the red tape surrounding government approval of corporate  foreign investment plans will be removed. In addition, overseas  securities investment by institutional investors, such as  securities houses and insurance companies, will be liberalized,  Hong said.    To improve the country's foreign investment environment, he  added, the five-year industry-by-industry plan on market opening  for foreign investors, set to start in 1996, will be revised to  advance the opening date and broaden the opening scope.    The increased investment in foreign industries and  securities  markets will check inflation due to an anticipated increase in  foreign fund inflows in the coming year, he observed.    Foreign investors are expected to increase their  participation in the stock market here this year, combining with  a current-account surplus expected for the year to expand  foreign fund flows to the country.    Corporations giving employees part of their profits in the  form of a special bonus in shares, not in cash, will be accorded  tax benefits in a bid to promote labor peace in such  corporations, Hong said.</p>

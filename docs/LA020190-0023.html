			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP: SILENT ALARM FOR HEARING-IMPAIRED  </P> <P> John Smart of La Jolla wonders where he can find a wristwatch alarm for deaf  people, one that vibrates instead of beeping. None of the groups that serve the  hearing-impaired were able to steer him in the right direction. Can you give  Smart a fair shake with a source, or will this be an unheard-of idea that  nobody pays lip service to?  </P> <P> And speaking of useful gadgets, Rick Grossman of Hollywood is looking for an  electronic timer that will turn off his television automatically but leave it  to be turned on manually; he wants the TV to go off an hour or so after he goes  to bed, but he doesn't want it to come on by itself. Can you help put  Grossman's mind -- and body -- to rest, or will he never find out what button  he has to push to get a good night's sleep?  </P> <P> For a gentleman of leisure, Elizabeth Stephan of Pacific Palisades would like  to find a leisure suit similar to a jumpsuit for ladies -- a one-piece outfit  with a zipper up the front. Can you give Stephan the name of a place she can  zip right over to, or must some other suitable garment be found for his leisure  time?  </P> <P> Louis Fragoso of Canoga Park cannot locate Lucarellis's men's colognes; the  men's clothing store he formerly bought them from no longer carries the line.  Can you put Fragoso back into aromatic gear, or will nothing anybody does scent  him on his sartorial way?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Elizabeth at (213) 927-0574 needs two patterns from  the 1984 Butterick catalogue: a Misses 6070 suit and a 6188 pantsuit, both in  Size 12. Wouldn't it be nice if somebody could suit Elizabeth to a tea, or  perhaps even a dinner? . . . Maxine at (213) 378-1103 is looking for a Cookie  Chef aluminum cookie gun that uses disks for the various shapes of cookies and  has a trigger similar to that on a grease gun; it was made by Vital Products  about 30 years ago. Please make sure Maxine never has to find out which way the  cookie crumbles in her kitchen. . . . Don at (714) 772-0411 would like to find  an Ascor Light Quick Charger (Cat. No. 011-502) A.C. adapter and an Ascor Auto  1600 II light; Berkey Ascor is out of business. Please, quick as a flash,  brighten Don's day.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> We finally have a source for sealing wax, which several readers have asked  about. Esther Tyrrell of El Monte says that Vroman's Bookstore, 695 E. Colorado  Blvd., Pasadena, (818) 449-5320, carries a fabulous selection of sealing waxes  in every color imaginable, even in gold, from as far away as Scotland; one  stick costs about $2.  </P> <P> Allan Voigt of Palm Desert, who wanted someone to re-tin a brass chafing dish,  can stop chafing. A reader writes that Willcocks Tinning Corp., 220 E. 57th  St., Los Angeles, (213) 234-0704, can dish out all the help he needs.  </P> <P> Bette Lynch of Glendora, who needed some Brunswick yarn to finish a sweater,  might soon be a sweater girl again. Chloe Schwartz of Bellflower writes that  Hand Weavers Supply, 17826 Bellflower Blvd., Bellflower, (213) 866-8208, stocks  Brunswick yarns and might listen to Lynch's.  </P> <P> For Betts Waite of Ventura, who needed a quadruple-magnification round mirror  with a stand, we have some magnificent news. Joy Forrester of Apple Valley  writes that she ordered such a mirror with stand from a (free) catalogue put  out by Comfortably Yours, 61 W. Hunter Ave., Maywood, N.J. 07607. Dorothy Libra  of Torrance writes that the mirror can be obtained for about $20 from Magic  Focus, 610 State St., P.O. Box 39, Augusta, Kan. 67010, telephone (316)  775-2251. And Eleanor Gibbel of Beverly Hills came through with an interesting  suggestion (assuming Waite wears bifocals): Reverse the glasses, so that the  bifocal part is on top. This will magnify the vision and will still allow room  to maneuver the tweezers.  </P></p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (9): A better deal for delegates - Hotel Industry HOTELS ARE the linchpin of the international conference and exhibition industry. Not only do they provide delegates with accommodation but they are also the biggest supplier of space for small meetings and other convention facilities. Thus, it is surprising that hotels have been so poor in the past in meeting the needs of this important market. Anecdotal horror stories abound about poor standards in hotels, both for rooms and conference space, and even some newly refurbished or designed hotels still manage to get it wrong. A survey by consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte found, for example, that hotels accounted for some 36 per cent of revenue and 31 per cent of profits for all conference venues. Half of all delegate days, moreover, were spent in large hotel chains. But times are changing. Several leading hotel chains, conscious of criticisms in the past, have revamped their approach to conferences. Forte Hotels, Britain's biggest hotel chain, recently decided to give its conferences a new look with the launch of its Venue Guarantee scheme. 'Our research showed us that companies wanted to end the uncertainty they felt when booking hotel conferences and to have confidence that they would get what they asked for,' says Mr Geoff Thomas, Forte Hotels' marketing communications controller. Under the scheme, which applies to Forte hotels worldwide, each conference has a specified Venue Guarantee manager whose job it is to see that the event goes smoothly. Forte also promises to send a Day Planner, ensuring that nothing is missed out, to conference organisers within 48 hours of a booking being made. The Day Planner indicates all the charges and the agreed basis of billing. The new scheme includes a Customer Satisfaction report placed within the meeting room, so that if services are not delivered then they can immediately be deleted from the account under Forte's 'no quibble' bill policy. Forte is not alone in developing a scheme to give conference organisers more confidence when booking a hotel meeting. Hilton International, part of the Ladbroke Group, is launching its Meeting 2000 conference system - previously confined to the UK - at 27 of its other hotels worldwide. Hilton's research of conference users found that the top requirement for successful meetings was the provision of professional, specially trained staff who were readily available. Like Forte, Hilton provides a dedicated Meeting Service manager for each meeting. Among the other elements of Hilton's conference facilities are a business and meeting service centre, located close to the main function area, providing communications services, such as typing, fax, photocopying and couriers. 'Our initiative is aimed at meetings of up to 50 people which, according to our research, account for some 70 per cent of the global conference market and represent its fastest-growing sector,' says Mr Geoffrey Breeze, Hilton's vice president for corporate marketing. Former Hilton chief executive Mr John Jarvis, who two years ago set up his own hotel chain, Jarvis Hotels, with the Pounds 186m acquisition of Embassy Hotels from Allied-Lyons, has launched a similar scheme. Called Summit Conferences, it guarantees a totally successful conference or a refund of the cost of the meeting. 'If equipment does not work during the conference or messages are not delivered, then the organiser is refunded,' says Mr Jarvis. 'In addition, a complete four-course lunch can be served within 55 minutes if required.' Inter-Continental's response to the increased competition from other chains has been its European Meetings Portfolio, which also includes a specified meetings manager. Its published conference rates will be kept for the rest of this year. 'It is one-stop shopping for a conference which takes all the hassle away from meetings organisers,' says Mr Bob Davis, Inter-Continental's European vice-president for marketing. To make things even easier for organisers, the ITT Sheraton hotel chain has put its Guide for Meeting Planning in diskette form on IBM compatible format. It includes information on checklists and guidelines and automatically processes the user's data. 'This is a 'user-friendly' working tool which de-mystifies the planning process of successful meetings,' says Mr Mike Prager, ITT Sheraton's advertising director. 'Not only does it save time and energy on the part of the conference organiser, but it also ensures that nothing is overlooked.' Hotels are increasingly waking up to the technological needs of conference delegates. The new all-suite Conrad Hotel at Chelsea Harbour in London has the state-of-the-art high-tech equipment which modern conference users demand. Its meeting rooms can be linked up by video if necessary. The major hotel chains, however, have not had it all their own way in wooing the conference organiser. Many small country house hotels have carved a niche for themselves in offering small meetings in more pleasant surroundings than city centres. The Lygon Arms in Broadway, Worcestershire, part of the Savoy Group, last year opened a new Pounds 1.4m swimming pool and fitness centre, to meet the needs of conference groups which increasingly demand such facilities. Mr Kirk Ritchie, the Lygon's managing director, says that such investment is essential. 'It has helped us retain and attract small meetings and conferences over the past difficult year,' he says. Lucknam Park in Wiltshire, which has extensive leisure facilities, also believes that 'memorable food' helps attract top-level meetings: its chef has just won a Michelin star. Other small country house hotels also make clear their willingness - perhaps not always so obvious in the past - to meet the needs of organisers. Bishopstrow House in Wiltshire, for example, is closing its tennis courts for three weeks while they are being used as a mock garage for a motor dealers' conference.</p>

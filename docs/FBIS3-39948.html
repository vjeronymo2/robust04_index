For the first time, [Northern  League Secretary] Umberto Bossi has abandoned his crusading tone  and opened up to Fini's right wing.    He did it at the same time the leader of the AN was shaking  the hand held out to him by [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi. "The right is ready to govern," Fini replied to the  call put out by Berlusconi, who wants to transform the electoral  agreement between Forza Italia, the Alliance, the League, and  the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] into the political  alignment destined to govern the country after 27 March.    In the space of a single day, the moderate alignment took  more than one step forward. Interviewed on Rete 4 [Fininvest TV  station], it was Bossi who broke the ice. To speak of Fini's  movement he took the long way around. He reiterated that the  Fascist Party had become the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and  that the MSI "then became something else again," implicitly  admitting that a change was underway. "In parliament, Fini's  group will be statist, whereas now it is antistatist," he noted  with irony.    Thus, it is possible to move from opposition to cooperation.  That does not, however, include cooperation in the executive,  the League secretary warned, "since they have to clean up their  act." Bossi predicted support "from the outside," to cite him  verbatim.    In short, they are no longer "fascists" but "snails": even  Bossi's words appear at least kindly this time. Is this just a  momentary conversion? According to Roberto Maroni, the League's  parliamentary floor leader, the AN will not form part of the  government. The League and Forza Italia "have the consensus  they need" and will form a minority executive to which "anyone  can give their external support." Thus, Fini's deputies would  not be unwelcome.    A dialogue is underway -- albeit at a distance, and with all  the necessary provisos (no to government posts, but yes to  forming part of the majority) -- between the League and the AN.  Moreover, an agreement has been concluded between Fini and  Berlusconi.    Opening the electoral campaign in the capital, the MSI  secretary also dropped the "anti-everything" tone he used to  adopt back in [former President] Cossiga's days, in the same way  as the Forza Italia leader has toned down his anticommunist  stance of recent days. The explanation is clear: Fini and  Berlusconi are today opting for proposal rather than protest,  since the polls show them on the up -- i.e., no longer in  howling opposition, but in the lineup being put forward for the  government.    Fini stressed: "Moving from the first to the second republic  must include overcoming the divisions of the past and bring  about the union of Italians who are trying to roll up their  sleeves and get down to work." Fini asked his followers to  refuse the "left's policy of casting its opponents in the role  of the Devil." He asked the moderates to "oppose the statism  which links [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary]  Achille Occhetto, [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, and  [Italian Republican Party Chairman] Visentini today, and which  will try to embrace [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Mino  Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni tomorrow."    Bossi said of Segni: "I will let him come forward for a  while and then I will strike him and beat him back, because I  know that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] plus Segni will  disappear from Italian politics in the new electoral system.  Then it will be we and the former DC centrists, whom we are  holding onto so they do not have to fall back into the oblivion  left by the disappearance of their former party."</p>

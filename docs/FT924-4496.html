			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: City Challenge shelving confirmed THE Department of the Environment confirmed the suspension of the third round of the City Challenge urban regeneration scheme. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, emphasised the amounts available for a range of inner-city programmes, but officials made clear that he had not asked for new cash for City Challenge in 1994-95. The department also hinted that information from the 1991 census might lead to some re-assessment of which urban areas were eligible for particular schemes.</p>

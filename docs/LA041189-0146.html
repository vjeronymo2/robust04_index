			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ARAFAT BRANDS SHAMIR 'MR. NO'  </P> <P> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat labeled Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  as "Mr. No" today and turned down his proposal for elections in the occupied  territories.  </P> <P> He told a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Poland that Shamir  had rejected all peace proposals, and Palestinians had no interest in holding  elections under the guns of Israeli troops.  </P> <P> "Since 'Mr. No' doesn't accept any peace proposals, I ask what would you say  about elections under occupation? I say 'yes' to elections but only after the  end of the occupation," he said.  </P> <P> Arafat said he was cutting short his Polish visit by several hours to fly to  Morocco for an unscheduled meeting with King Hassan. He gave no further  details.  </P></p>

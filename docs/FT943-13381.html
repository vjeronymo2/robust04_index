			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Row over cash for questions probe A row broke out at Westminster yesterday after four MPs with extensive outside interests were proposed to sit on the committee charged with investigating the so-called 'cash for questions' affair. The 17 MPs selected to serve on the Committee of Privileges had between them 18 paid directorships, eight consultancies and six sponsorship arrangements with trade unions or other bodies. Just two of the proposed committee members, both Conservatives, had nothing to declare in the most recent register of members' interests. One Labour MP - Mr Dale Campbell-Savours - immediately claimed that the public would not have 'very much confidence' in a probe conducted by such a committee. But this view was rebutted by Sir James Spicer, who was among the nine Tories nominated. 'Do you want people on a committee like this to be virtually eunuchs who do nothing at all except haunt the House of Commons?' he asked. The inquiry will focus on the case of two Conservative MPs who were suspended from their posts as junior ministerial aides after reports that they were prepared to accept Pounds 1,000 for tabling parliamentary questions. But some Tories are worried the probe could lead to a fundamental reassessment of MPs' outside interests. Labour MPs last night blocked attempts to nod through the appointment of those named, forcing a debate on the subject today and making it less likely the committee will be able to meet for the first time before the recess. The bulk of the directorships and consultancies held by those proposed for the committee were shared between four senior Tory MPs: Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee; Sir Peter Hordern, Sir Cranley Onslow, a past 1922 committee chairman; and Sir Giles Shaw. Six of the seven Labour MPs are sponsored by trade unions or other bodies, the exception being Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield. The two proposed members who had nothing to declare in the most recent register were Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, and Mr John Ward. The full list of those proposed was as follows: Sir Nicholas Lyell (attorney-general); Mr David Alton (Lib Dem Liverpool Mossley Hill); Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield); Sir Marcus Fox (C Shipley); Sir Peter Hordern (C Horsham); Mr Doug Hoyle (Lab Warrington North); Mr Bill Michie (Lab Sheffield Heeley); Sir David Mitchell (C Hampshire North West); Mr Alf Morris (Lab Manchester Wythenshawe); Mr John Morris (shadow attorney-general); Mr Tony Newton (Leader of the Commons); Sir Cranley Onslow (C Woking); Sir Giles Shaw (C Pudsey); Mr Peter Shore (Lab Bethnal Green and Stepney); Sir James Spicer (C Dorset West); Mr John Ward (C Poole), and Mr Alan Williams (Lab Swansea West).</p>

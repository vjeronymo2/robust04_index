			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / BR sell-off plans face further delay CABINET ministers are preparing the ground for a further delay in publication of plans for the privatisation of British Rail. The government had previously hoped to release details before the general election. Clashes between ministers over how the rail network should be restructured seem unlikely to be resolved in time for a white paper before April 9 - the most likely election date. A senior minister said yesterday that the imminence of the election was likely to mean that only broad proposals would appear in the Conservative manifesto. The white paper would follow if the Tories were re-elected. That would be at least the third delay for the white paper. When Mr John Major, the prime minister, unveiled his Citizen's Charter last summer the white paper was promised by the end of last year. This was subsequently delayed until January and then to before the election. The dispute has been caused by Mr Major's preference for reviving the pre-war regional railway companies. This conflicts with the determination of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to keep intact the InterCity service. Mr Rifkind had hoped for agreement on a compromise that would have kept InterCity in one piece and sold to a private operator, but with new regional companies being able to run services on BR tracks.</p>

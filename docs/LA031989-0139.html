			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOURNAMENT PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> BECK AND KITE TAKE COMMAND AFTER LIETZKE, MCCUMBER FALTER  </P> <P> For someone who had just missed a tap-in putt of one inch and had four-putted a  hole, Mark McCumber was relatively calm and upbeat.  </P> <P> His double-bogey five on the par-three 17th hole in the Tournament Players  Championship at Sawgrass Saturday cost him a chance for the outright lead.  </P> <P> Instead, it was left to Chip Beck to take the lead from Bruce Lietzke on  another warm and somewhat windy afternoon in Florida.  </P> <P> Lietzke was breezing along after nine holes with a four-stroke lead, but he  shot a 41 on the backside to finish with a 74.  </P> <P> His lapse opened the door for Beck and Tom Kite, who took over the top two  positions on the leader board, setting up a scramble for the championship  today.  </P> <P> Beck shot a 68 for a three-day total of 207 and the lead at nine under par for  54 holes, while the steady Kite shot a 68 and was one stroke back at 208.  </P> <P> Five players -- Lietzke, McCumber, Gary Koch, Ben Crenshaw and Fred Couples --  were bunched at 209. Greg Norman and Gil Morgan are next at 210.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus and Craig Stadler have an outside chance of winning today. Both  are four strokes behind the leader.  </P> <P> McCumber, the defending champion and the home favorite since he lives in nearby  Jacksonville, should have been devastated, but he wasn't.  </P> <P> On the 17th, a green completely surrounded by water, McCumber's tee shot  stopped 25-feet from the pin.  </P> <P> "I hit the hole on my first putt and I thought I had made a two, but it spun  out five feet past the cup," McCumber said. "It looked as if I was going to be  10 under par."  </P> <P> Then, the nightmare began.  </P> <P> McCumber said he just burned the hole on his second putt, the ball sliding an  inch past.  </P> <P> McCumber reached out with his putter and tapped the ball, but it moved only a  quarter of an inch.  </P> <P> "I was ready to reach down and take the ball out of the cup," McCumber said. "I  couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> McCumber said he wasn't frustrated after just barely missing his five-foot  putt, although it seemed that he made a half-hearted stab at the ball.  </P> <P> "I know I hit it," he said, "but I didn't do it out of anger."  </P> <P> "It wasn't a tragedy. It was just an unfortunate situation. Overall, I'm  extremely satisfied with the way I played and I'm looking forward to defending  my championship tomorrow."  </P> <P> Since he is only two strokes behind Beck, he has good reason to believe that he  can put the four-putt green behind him. But will others let him forget it?  </P> <P> "I'm taking my phone off the hook tonight," McCumber said.  </P> <P> McCumber still managed to shoot a two-under-par 70 on a day when the course  didn't yield many low scores.  </P> <P> Lietzke, the easy-going pro from Dallas who had a two-stroke lead at the outset  of Saturday's third round, took his faltering back nine in stride.  </P> <P> "I lost my concentration after I three-putted the 10th hole," he said, "Then, I  tried to coach myself."  </P> <P> That turned out to be a mistake as he got off to a shaky start on the par-five,  529-yard 11th hole by topping his 3-wood and sending the ball into the water.  </P> <P> Lietzke wound up with a double bogey on the hole. He bogeyed two more holes on  the backside after getting three birdies on the front nine.  </P> <P> "I hadn't missed a putt inside of 10 feet for 2 1/2 rounds, so I felt  vulnerable again," hesaid.  </P> <P> However, he was philosophical about losing a substantial lead.  </P> <P> "If you have to have a train wreck, Saturday is a good day to do it," he said.  "There's a lot more golf to play, and I can't let nine holes get in my way."  </P> <P> Beck said he was surprised to be leading, adding, though, that his confidence  has steadily improved each day.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a great shootout tomorrow, a great championship," said Beck,  who hasn't made much of an impact on the Tour this year after earning $926,817  to finish second on the money winning list in 1988.  </P> <P> Beck made a bogey at the second hole, but then played steadily the rest of the  way, collecting five birdies.  </P> <P> Kite, who won last week at Orlando, Fla., in a sudden-death playoff with Davis  Love III, is in the hunt to become a back-to-back winner, emulating Steve  Jones, who won the first Tour events of the season, the Tournament of Champions  and the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.  </P> <P> As for Nicklaus, he said he is going into today's round with the positive  attitude of shooting a low score.  </P> <P> "After I got a bogey on the 10th hole, I said I'm going to cost this course  four birdies," Nicklaus said.  </P> <P> He proceeded to get them with a fine round of 68.  </P></p>

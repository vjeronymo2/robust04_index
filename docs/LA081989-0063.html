			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REWARD OFFER FAILS TO SPARK GOLD RUSH OF ENGINE-PART SEARCHERS ON IOWA FARMS  </P> <P> Despite rewards totaling $279,000, farmers in northwestern Iowa are not rushing  to look for missing bits and pieces of the DC-10 jet engine that blew apart on  United's Flight 232 last month.  </P> <P> The parts, considered critical to an investigation of the incident, are  believed scattered over a 16-square-mile area dense with ripening corn and  soybeans north of this little agricultural community.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the engine  failure that led to the plane's July 19 crash in Sioux City, about 60 miles  west of here, said that without the parts "it will be difficult" to determine  why the engine came apart.  </P> <P> General Electric, maker of the engine, last week offered farmers living in the  search area up to $50,000 for turning in one missing part and lesser amounts  for other parts, hoping to speed their recovery.  </P> <P> "The investigation is going on now, and we'd like to have the parts as soon as  possible," said Dave Lane, a spokesman for General Electric Aircraft Engines in  Evandale, Ohio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Every Possible Piece'  </P> <P> "We want to get every possible piece of that plane that we can," NTSB spokesman  Alan Pollack said.  </P> <P> "Search?" Buena Vista County Sheriff Chuck Eddy asked. "There isn't much of a  search." Eddy, who is collecting parts as they are recovered, said that, in the  first 10 days since the rewards were offered, he had received only "a couple of  pieces."  </P> <P> "We've been searching here and there," said Steve Lullman, a worker at the  Mellow Dent Seed farm in the search area. "But we don't do it on company time.  I think it's a waste of time."  </P> <P> "They're looking in an area that's bigger than downtown Los Angeles, and its  covered with corn and beans," said Mitch Quirin, research director for Mellow  Dent. "That's one heck of an area to be looking for nuts and bolts and pieces  of metal the size of your forearm."  </P> <P> Farmers and trappers familiar with the terrain believe recovery of parts is  unlikely before the September harvest. Chances will also improve when hunting  begins in the autumn and when trappers begin moving through groves, along  creeks and in areas not under cultivation.  </P> <P> "I feel (that) when they start taking the crops out, calls will be a little  more frequent," Eddy said. "There are creeks and ponds and timber and abandoned  farm places. They could have fallen in somebody's grove with all their old  machinery around."  </P> <P> "How you gonna find anything in here?" asked Clarence Peterson, 84, leading a  visitor into a field of corn.  </P> <P> The plants are up to 10 feet tall, and the foliage, dusty and abrasive, is so  thick that little light filters into the narrow rows between plants.  </P> <P> "You could be walking down one row and there could be something in the next row  and you wouldn't see it," said Peterson, whose family operates several farms in  the search area.  </P> <P> Soybeans are also particularly dense in these final weeks of the growing  season. They grow much lower to the ground than corn, and it is impossible to  see the earth through the leaves.  </P> <P> General Electric offered rewards only to farmers on whose land the parts are  found to prevent trespassing and to keep the area from being inundated by  treasure hunters in search of a bounty.  </P> <P> Rewards range from $50,000 for a 300-pound, truck-tire-size titanium disc to  $1,000 each for 20 nuts and 20 bolts to $500 for each of 57 missing fan blades.  </P> <P> Currently the rewards are available only to Aug. 31, but sources close to the  investigation said they could be extended.  </P> <P> When asked if General Electric was disappointed by the relatively low level of  response to the reward offer, company spokesman Lane said: "We understand many  of those people are professional farmers and they have a lot of things on their  minds this time of year. We certainly (would have) liked to have seen some  results. That's why we offered the reward."  </P></p>

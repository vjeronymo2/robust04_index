			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD/Hungary Hungarians Sign Up To </F> Chemicals Safety Programme"; as released by Brussels EUROPEAN  REPORT]    [Text] Hungary has just signed up to the part of the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's  Chemicals Programme involving Good Laboratory Practice and the  Mutual Acceptance of Data on chemicals safety testing.  Hungary's agreement to participate in this important chemicals  safety cooperative effort puts it on an equal footing with OECD  member countries and brings advantages to both Hungary and OECD  member countries. For instance, members of the 24-nation  Western club will be able to establish and maintain the  appropriate formal contacts and information exchange procedures  with the Hungarian laboratory practice monitoring authorities.  This, says the OECD Secretariat, will "underpin confidence in  the Hungarian compliance monitoring programme necessary to  assure OECD member countries of the quality of data generated in  Hungarian laboratories." As a consequence, much-needed further  testing capacity will be opened for use by OECD member countries  and their industries, which can be confident that data generated  in Hungary will be accepted in OECD member countries. Since June  1991, Hungary has been participating in the OECD's Partners in  Transition Programmes, one section of which involves taking part  as an observer in numerous committees and other subsidiary  bodies.</p>

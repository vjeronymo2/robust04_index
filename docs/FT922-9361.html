			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK-led consortium wins HK bridge contract  -Accusations of unfairness after lower tender by Korean group is rejected AN Anglo-Japanese consortium led by Trafalgar House has won the contract to build one of the world's longest suspension bridges, linking Hong Kong's new airport with the mainland, even though Hyundai of South Korea made a lower tender. The Hong Kong government said yesterday the Trafalgar consortium's HKDollars 7.14bn (Pounds 517m) bid was the 'lowest acceptable offer'. Hyundai had bid HKDollars 2.43bn less than Trafalgar House, but the Korean company fell USDollars 393m short of the government's standard capital requirements, designed to ensure the company has enough capital to complete the contract. The decision provoked controversy in the colony. The lion's share of airport-linked contracts awarded so far have gone to British companies. However, immediate reactions to the awarding of the contract to a more expensive British-led tender were more subdued than expected. The airport core project is already over-budget and there is local suspicion that the project is Britain's final move to cash in on its colony before the hand-over to China on July 1, 1997. It is scheduled for completion within five years. Mr Albert Chan, of the United Democrats, the party which won the majority of the directly-elected seats in the Legislative Council last year, said he was concerned there may have been undue favouritism towards British companies over airport consultancy contracts. The majority have been picked up by UK-related companies. But with regard to the bridge contract, he said the government's argument for choosing the Anglo-Japanese consortium appeared convincing. However, he deferred judgment until he had time to examine the decision more closely. He said he would discuss it with Hyundai. The Chinese authorities have been kept informed of the decision, although no formal consultation is necessary since the project does not straddle 1997 and does not require financial guarantees from the post-1997 government. China has made no official comment. The Tsing Ma bridge is the largest single contract so far for Hong Kong's Port and Airport Development Scheme, which will cost HKDollars 114bn at March 1991 prices. With a centre span of 1.38 kilometres, the bridge is the longest section of the Lantau Fixed Crossing, which provides a road and rail link between the Chek Lap Kok airport and central Hong Kong. The government has been accused of unfairly requiring Hyundai to provide special financial guarantees, thereby creating an uneven playing field for competitors on the bridge contract. Mr KY Leung, secretary for the Treasury and chairman of the Central Tender Board, denied showing favouritism to any British consortium. He said Hyundai had been the only bidder to fail to meet the standard financial requirements. 'Hyundai have not been able to offer us satisfactory assurances that their position would be corrected,' said Mr Yeung. The final decision was made on the basis of four criteria: price, technical and management expertise, evaluation of the construction programme and compliance with contract specifications, including the fulfilment of completion deadlines. Mr Leung said the Anglo-Japanese consortium came first in all the categories, with the exception of price. The next highest bidding consortium was the French-led Hong Kong International Consortium, which made a HKDollars 7.36bn tender, while an all-Japanese consortium made a HKDollars 10.96bn tender. The Anglo-Japanese consortium comprises Dorman Long Overseas (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trafalgar House), Costain Civil Engineering and Mitsui, with each company holding a one third share. The major sub-contractor will be Gammon (the Hong Kong construction company owned by Trafalgar House and Jardine Matheson). Trafalgar House has significant expertise in bridge building. Its subsidiary Cleveland Structural Engineering has been a principal contractor for five of the world's 15 longest span bridges.</p>

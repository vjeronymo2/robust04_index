			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: MOORPARK HIGH TO PLAY CANADIAN SCHOOL IN FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Moorpark High has scheduled a football game for Sept. 14 against a team from  Canada, giving the area two such matchups that weekend.  </P> <P> Moorpark will play host to Okotoks High from Alberta, one night before Village  Christian meets St. Mary's of Calgary at Kennedy High.  </P> <P> Moorpark originally was scheduled to play Village Christian that weekend, but  Coach Mike Plaisance arranged the St. Mary's game and asked Moorpark to release  his school from its contract.  </P> <P> Moorpark Coach Rob Dearborn agreed on the condition that Moorpark find a  replacement. When Dearborn failed in that endeavor, Plaisance arranged for the  second Canadian team to head south.  </P> <P> Senior right-handers Robert Ramirez and Jakob Jensen of Highland Hall have been  selected to the All-Southern Section Small Schools Division first team by a  panel of sportswriters.  </P> <P> Ramirez (12-3, 1.83 earned-run average, .579 batting average) was selected for  the second consecutive season. Jensen batted .518 and was 9-1 with an ERA of  2.85.  </P></p>

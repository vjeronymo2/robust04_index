			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Bankruptcy vice was tightening MR ASIL NADIR was running out of time to comply with various English court orders brought to force him to co-operate with his trustee in bankruptcy, it has emerged. Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with accountants Robson Rhodes and the court-appointed trustee, said yesterday that he had requested court orders to force Mr Nadir to provide him with greater information. The action followed a failure by Mr Nadir to co-operate fully in Mr Cooper's attempts to identify the ownership of numerous assets and to trace a series of transactions. If Mr Nadir had not complied with the orders shortly, he would have faced action for contempt of court, including possible imprisonment. Mr Cooper said that he was unable to put a value on assets to which Mr Nadir might lay claim, because of questions over both ownership and valuation. He warned: 'There are quite likely to be assets in parts of the world that Mr Nadir can effectively control and we cannot.' He said potential assets to which there are claims by members of Mr Nadir's family included several casinos, newspapers, banking investments, an island and a floating house in Turkey. Mr Cooper said he was taking legal advice about possible court action in Turkey in an attempt to take control of assets. He added that the ownership of three houses in northern Cyprus reportedly owned by Mr Nadir remained in dispute. There are also numerous antiques, artefacts and oil paintings which have not yet been tracked down by the trustee in bankruptcy. Meanwhile, administrators to Polly Peck at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand said that before Mr Nadir's escape they had been 'getting near' to sales of numerous assets in northern Cyprus. These included several hotels and other companies.</p>

Denmark sponsored the Riga city waste processing scheme that  also provides for sorting of non-industrial waste. Latvia used  Danish funding to assess the quantity of toxic waste in the  country, Bruvers said.    Sweden allotted 108 million kronor to build sewage  processors  in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. From this, 5 million kronor  were extended to the Riga municipal water supply and sewerage  enterprise.    Another part of the Swedish Government assignation, around  40  million kronor, is needed to reconstruct the Liepaja city  sewerage. Currently, Liepaja is one of the main polluters of  Latvian waters in the Baltic Sea.    Another 9-million-U.S.-dollar project targets introduction  of  efficient and environmentally friendly heating systems in  Latvia's small towns. The plan is based on transforming regional  heating systems on local raw materials, like wood or peat.    From the project's expenses, 1 million dollars are donated  by  the Danish Government, the rest is the Danish Government's loan  to Latvia. The term of the credit is 10 years, Denmark wants no  interest from the sum. The Latvian Government, however, still  has to extend its guarantees to insure the credit.    In addition, the Latvian Valmiera district and the Danish  Velje district environmentalists started to jointly monitor the  river basins in the Valmiera vicinity, said Bruvers. The Velje  authorities also presented Latvia with a sea monitoring ship.</p>

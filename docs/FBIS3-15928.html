			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The value of a deal between Aeroflot-Russian  International Airlines and Boeing on leasing four Boeing  767-300ER jumbo jets may be halved, while the term of lease may  be cut by at least one year, the head of the company's  international commercial department, Vladimir Tikhonov, told a  conference of Aeroflot representatives abroad in Moscow  Thursday. According to his calculations, the lease of four  Boeing 767 airliners is "too costly" as the expenses may amount  to $300 Mn. Tikhonov believes two jumbo jets will be quite  enough, while the term of the lease may well be reduced to three  to four instead of the proposed five years.    Tikhonov said he was sceptical about the experience of  exploitation of five A310-300 in Russia. According to Airbus  Industry which supplied the airliners in 1992, their leasing  inflicted losses worth $15 Mn on Aeroflot in 1993 alone, while  Aeroflot states the losses reached $22 Mn. [passage omitted]    Tikhonov said the high cost of the airbuses' use was caused  by the exceptionally high amount of the lease ($46 Mn a year)  which covers the entire profits from their exploitation.  Commenting on the lease of foreign-made jets, Tikhonov said it  was a "forced measure called to cover the deficit of modern  long-range jets until new Russian airliners such as Il 96-300  and Il 96M are supplied in sufficient quantities."</p>

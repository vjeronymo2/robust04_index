			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Leading Article: No joy for UK interest rates Will Mr Kenneth Clarke cut the UK base rate of interest in the near future? He is unlikely to do so. More important, there no longer appears to be a case for his doing so. Only a marked weakening of the economy, following the tax increases that have come into effect this month, or a substantial strengthening of the currency, consequent upon declining interest rates on the Continent, would justify such a cut. The International Monetary Fund warns strongly against any such move. 'In the period ahead,' suggests the latest World Economic Outlook, 'inflation is expected to remain within the authorities' target range of 1 to 4 per cent, although recent wage settlements raise the risk that inflation may have bottomed out and financial market developments suggest some increase in uncertainty about inflation prospects. Further monetary easing should await firm evidence that inflation is well on course toward the medium-term objective of 1 to 2 1/2 per cent.' On balance, the varied economic data that have appeared this week give further support to the IMF's case. Only a chancellor prepared to cast aside a far from credible medium-term target for inflation could justify expansionary moves. Mr Clarke must hear little voices telling him to be precisely such a chancellor. Perhaps one of those voices even comes from within himself. But he is severely constrained by the government's earlier commitments, by the increasingly outspoken views of the Bank of England, by the vigilance of gilt market investors and, let it also be said, by his own good sense. The data on retail sales were perhaps the most striking of those released in the course of the week. With a 0.8 per cent increase between February and March and a 1.1 per cent rise between the last quarter of 1993 and the first of 1994, British consumers seem to be doing their usual stuff. Gloomy survey This buoyancy comes in the teeth of a poll from Gallup for the European Commission, showing consumer financial confidence close to an all time low, and a rather gloomy survey of retail sales from the Confederation of British Industry. These may mean that retail sales will stop growing once the tax increases come into effect. But when the year-on-year increase in the officially estimated volume of retail sales has been as much as 3.8 per cent, it would be foolish to assume this in advance of the facts. Further support for the view that the recovery is proceeding came with the data on unemployment, the seasonally adjusted level of which fell 30,000 in the month to March 10 and 211,000 over the year, to 2,723,000. Admittedly, this decline does not appear to reflect comparable increases in employment. Revised estimates show that total employment rose only 104,000 between its trough in March 1993 and the end of that year. Moreover, there was a decline of 40,000 in full-time employment, offset by a rise of 144,000 in part-time employment. The total number of hours worked in the economy has probably continued to fall. Disturbing jump The tricky question for monetary policy is whether the labour market is tightening. What looks like the crucial piece of evidence comes from figures for earnings, which rose on an underlying basis by 3 1/2 per cent in the latest 12 months, up from a low of 3 per cent last year. In the hitherto subdued services sector the underlying annual increase was 3 1/4 per cent, up from a low last year of 2 1/4 per cent. Still more disturbing was the jump of 2.4 per cent in February alone. This, it is argued, reflects one-off payments. But it is not a development that the government can readily ignore. For all that, the inflation data are not so bad. Producer output prices, for example, rose only 0.1 per cent in March and 2.7 per cent over the previous year. But even this is not securely within the inflation target that the government hopes to achieve by the end of the parliament. Moreover, the figures for broad money (sterling M4) over the past six months show a modest acceleration, to an annual rate of 7 per cent. Where does all this leave the chancellor? Mr Clarke has no good reason to change monetary policy, in either direction. This is particularly true when, as the IMF suggests in its characteristically oblique way, rates of interest on medium-term gilts have jumped from a low of 6.1 per cent in early June to more than 7.8 per cent this week. This relatively large jump indicates that the UK will suffer for years, maybe for decades, from its deserved reputation for monetary irresponsibility. Interest rates would presumably rise if inflation started to turn sharply upwards or growth were to accelerate strongly. They would presumably fall only if short-term rates of interest were to decline substantially on the Continent or evidence were to accumulate that the tax increases were biting deeply into consumer demand. None of these seems imminent. In the meantime, monetary policy is likely to be put on hold, as it certainly should be.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (8): Girl's best friend survives a crisis - Antwerp is still the diamond capital of Europe When Pete Sampras swept to victory in the European Union tennis championships in Antwerp this month, he picked up a rare first prize. Instead of the standard cheque, Sampras, the world's number one tennis player, won a diamond-encrusted racquet. It was a testimony to the champion's heavyweight serve, but also to Antwerp's skill in promoting itself as the diamond capital of Europe After a sluggish 1992, Antwerp is bouncing back. Revelling in its designated role this year as Europe's cultural capital, the city has devised a succession of glittering events to showcase the diamond trade, an industry whose roots in Flanders go back to the 17th century. Perhaps the most eye-catching was the exhibition called 'From the Treasury' which featured more than 10,000 carats of diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and rubies. The jewels came from the Romanov family of Russia, Thurn and Taxis of Germany, from the late Duchess of Windsor's collection and from other distinguished families. The three-week-long event attracted more than 175,000 visitors, a record for Antwerp and a considerable boost to the local tourist industry. It took place shortly after the 26th World Diamond Congress, whose principal message was one of cautious optimism about the prospects for a revival for the diamond trade in 1993/4. In his keynote speech, Mr Julian Ogilvy-Thompson, chairman of De Beers Centenary and De Beers Consolidated Mines, said that the diamond industry had weathered a crisis which some outside commentators had predicted would be terminal. Prudent intervention by the Central Selling Organisation in London (CSO: the body which regulates the distribution of rough diamonds) had helped to bring supply and demand in the cutting centres more into balance. Confidence was now returning to the trade, Mr Ogilvy-Thompson told delegates. This view is reflected in the performance of the Belgian diamond market which saw a strong expansion in the 1980s, followed by a period of stabilisation between 1991-2. In the past six months, the market showed signs of a revival. The chief reasons for the improvement were a recovery in the US; a decline in the supply of illegally mined diamonds from Angola (which continues to be disrupted by the civil war); and preventive action by the CSO to deal with dumping by Russian producers on key world markets. The downside for the producers were tighter margins, cuts in production and multiple lay-offs. In South Africa and Namibia, De Beers laid off 4000 people - about 25 per cent of its workforce. The raw statistics tell a part of the story. Imports of diamonds rose from 65.6 per cent in weight to 87m carats. Measured by value, imports rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn. Exports showed the same degree of expansion, with volume increasing by 66 per cent to 66m carats. Exports by value rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn, with an increase in polished diamond exports to the UK, Germany, Italy, and France, despite the persistent weakness of the European economy. As a result, the rise in turnover to 153.6m carats was markedly better than the 92.6m achieved in the first of 1992; meanwhile, value increased substantially from Dollars 7.6bn (1992) to Dollars 8.7bn. Of about 45m carats of directly imported rough diamonds of gem quality, 25m - 56 per cent  -come from the CSO in London. Antwerp remains the world's most important distribution point for rough diamonds, after the CSO. It also boasts four of the world's 20 diamond bourses which together form the Federation of Belgian Diamond Bourses: Diamantclub van Antwerpen (which celebrated its centenary this year); Beurs voor Diamanathandel; Antwerpsche Diamantkring; and the Vrije Diamanthandel. Together, the total membership of the four bourses is nearly 6000, with more than 1200 offices. They have come a long way since the old polishing factories of the 1860s, many of which were steam-driven. Today, electronic data processing has transformed the operation of the diamond trade and industry, breaking down distances and speeding up communications. If there is a darker side to the new age, it is that Belgian's diamond industry faces ever tougher competition, particularly from rival centres in the Far East which can exploit lower wages and costs. Smaller Belgian manufacturers are therefore pressing for regular supplies of rough diamonds which are traded through Antwerp, while others are urging younger members of the industry to come up with new technological breakthroughs to improve competitiveness. On the other hand, the Far East clearly offers enormous potential as a consumer market, particularly in China. Last February the Diamond High Council organised a visit to Asia which included stops in the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong. Local traders in Manila lobbied hard for deregulation of the industry in order to exploit its potential as an important foreign exchange earner. Mr Ogilvy-Thompson is cautiously optimistic about the future. But he warns: 'There will be no dramatic increase in business, until there is a resurgence of world economic activity, and that, unfortunately, may still be up to a year away.'</p>

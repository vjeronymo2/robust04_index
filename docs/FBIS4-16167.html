			<p>BFN     [Text] The air strikes on Serbian positions demonstrated  how little American diplomacy respects Russia. The statement  was made at a Wednesday news conference in Moscow by the leader  of the opposition Russian National Assembly Aleksandr Sterligov.    "The USA has actually begun building a new world order  through the use of force and we regard this as a dangerous step  that might pave the way to a war against the Slavic world",  Sterligov said.    According to him, in this situation the Serbs will not be  left alone, because steps would be made to organize the sending  of volunteers to Serbia. He added that if the war in Serbia was  not stopped, it would spread to Russia.    Sterligov spoke against the coming joint Russian-American  military exercises in the Urals this summer. He said the  purpose of the exercises is to encourage separatists to split  Russia as well as to spy on the capability of the remnants of  the Russian army to guarantee the security of the country.    "Americans want to consolidate their hold on our territory,  set up bases and begin the creeping occupation of Russia",  Sterligov said.    He stressed that the Russian National Assembly is ready to  form public committees of resistance to the appearance of  Western troops in Russia. "In this respect we have found full  understanding with Cossack organizations and groups of Afghan  war veterans", Sterligov announced.    He said his organization together with Cossacks and Afghan  veteranss would launch a campaign of resistance to the  exercises, if the Federal Assembly does not cancel them.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / A get-tough minister tackles Mission Impossible: 'I will fight to the best of my abilities' - Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's new finance minister, gave Christina Lamb a flying interview WHEN Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso discovered that he had been named Brazil's finance minister, during a trip to New York as foreign minister, he jokingly asked for political asylum at Kennedy Airport. Managing the world's ninth-largest economy is no easy task at the best of times but - with annual inflation of 1,500 per cent, an obstreperous Congress, and a mercurial president who has disposed of three finance ministers since December - it seems more like Mission Impossible. 'I think this is the worst job in Brazil, worse even than being president, as he can blame me,' said the sociology professor and senator, in an interview with the Financial Times on his 62nd birthday. 'But I will fight to the best of my abilities.' Although Mr Cardoso has kept smiling since taking office last month, he is acutely conscious of the weight of expectations upon him. The irony is that the man who, during the military regime of 1964-85 was persecuted by secret police, barred from lecturing and exiled to Chile, is now regarded even by the generals as the last chance for stabilising Latin America's largest economy. If he succeeds, he would be a strong contender for president in the election of December next year. The difficulty of Mr Cardoso's task has been brought home since he announced his 'Real Plan' last week. This, the seventh economic plan in as many years, is an orthodox programme aimed to balance the budget through a cut equivalent to Dollars 6bn in federal government spending, a crackdown on tax evasion, continued privatisation, a new tax on cheques and an attempt to force the profligate states and municipalities to pay back some of the Dollars 40bn they owe the federal government. In Braslia, the plan is already being written off and likened to the Ten Commandments - 'long inscribed and never obeyed'. By way of listing just some of the troubles and woes - last week, the Congress failed to approve the cheque tax; alleging corruption, a congressional commission called for suspension of the privatisation programme; the health minister is refusing to accept cuts; state governors are claiming that the federal government owes them money and the Braslia water and energy utilities turned off lights and water for government departments which have not paid their bills; one day before the final deadline, only 3.2m of Brazil's 52m working population have filed tax returns. But Mr Cardoso is not one to desist. From first thing in the morning till last thing at night, he is engaged in a round of negotiations with politicians, ministers, governors and directors of state companies, using every ounce of his considerable charm in a valiant attempt to win them over and balance Brazil's budget. 'Finally the government is admitting responsibility and trying to put its house in order,' he says. 'We must end this crazy situation where everyone owes everyone and nobody pays'. Speaking on board his aircraft to Sao Paulo, and clearly under strain, Mr Cardoso says he was shocked by the public sector accounts. 'People must realise that we no longer have any choice but to cut, things are so bad'. He points out that the federal wage bill has increased 30 per cent over last year to Dollars 18bn, while interest payments now consume more than 60 per cent of the Dollars 234bn budget, due to last year's high interest rates on the government's domestic debt and the resumption of foreign debt payments. He shrugs off doubts over his toughness, exacerbated by federal hand-outs last week to the local governments of Braslia and Rio de Janeiro. 'Just because I'm polite does not mean that I will cede,' he laughs. 'If Congress won't vote the cheque tax, then I shall go on television and tell people that this will mean closure of hospitals and schools.' To demonstrate his resolve, he sent a list of 1,000 alleged tax evaders to the courts yesterday. 'It's important that the courts act - we need people to go to prison, examples to be made. The way things are at the moment, we don't need the Bahamas - Brazil is a tax haven.' Mr Cardoso is also appealing to the justice system to liberate money held in escrow: 'It is too easy for businesses to get an injunction so as not to pay taxes. Billions of dollars are being held while our hospitals are in crisis.' The hardest battle, Mr Cardoso says, is with state companies, particularly state banks which have exceeded credit limits by 21 times to fund local government. Some banks 'pay graduates Dollars 6,000 per month. That's ridiculous - I'm a senator and finance minister, and earn Dollars 2,000]' Privatisation is seen as crucial to relieve pressure on the Treasury. The state steel mill Cosipa alone is costing Dollars 1m a day in interest and the steel sector has consumed Dollars 12bn in the last decade, he claims. Investors are disappointed that no major sell-offs have been announced, but Mr Cardoso explains: 'There are already so many things on the list, such as the electricity sector and railways, that it is better to get on with those and do that well than raise new controversy. But we will sell the big companies.' Brazilian inflation has now been stuck at more than 20 per cent a month for almost two years. Economists point out that, even if Mr Cardoso succeeeds in implementing his plan, it will not be sufficient to bring down inflation from current levels of 32 per cent a month, particularly as spending pressures mount before the presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections next year. Joking that, 'if I had tried heterodox measures they would have said I need orthodox,' Mr Cardoso admits that he may have to take further measures. 'I never committed myself to reduce inflation with this programe - I just promised to put the house in order'. But he insists that Brazil's situation is better than it looks: 'We've become very defeatist but, in fact, if you ignore public accounts, then our economy is going well. The harvest is good, exports are Dollars 40bn, reserves are over Dollars 20bn, companies are well-capitalised and the economy should grow 3.5 per cent this year'. He is confident of securing a new accord with the International Monetary Fund, saying, 'aren't we finally doing exactly what they ask?' Mr Cardoso denies he has presidential ambitions, saying he would prefer to return to Cambridge University, where he was once a professor. Pointing out that he never even wanted to be finance minister, he asks: 'If I really managed to clear up this mess, would I need to do anything else in my life?'</p>

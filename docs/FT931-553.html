			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Chirac gambles on leading from behind - RPR leader's latest move in a strategy for winning the presidency in 1995 THE smile says it all. Try as he might to adopt the insouciant air of a potential president, Mr Jacques Chirac yesterday failed dismally to disguise his glee at the conservatives' success in Sunday's elections. Mr Chirac, 60, has every reason to be gleeful. Not only has the conservative coalition won the biggest majority of any French government since the early 19th century, but his own RPR party emerged as the largest parliamentary faction with 247 seats, against 213 for the UDF, its coalition partner. This means that the RPR should not only have a strong claim over key cabinet posts, but should also be able to exert considerable influence on the policies of France's new cohabitation government. The RPR has been here before. It was also the largest party in the last cohabitation government from 1986 to 1988 making Mr Chirac, as its leader, the natural choice for prime minister. Mr Chirac then spent two gruelling years being upstaged by President Francois Mitterrand and, convinced that this cost him the 1988 presidential election, he has refused to stand as cohabitation prime minister again. Mr Chirac is gambling that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential poll will be better if he spends the next two years as mayor of Paris, rather than fencing with Mr Mitterrand. He may be wrong. His humiliations at the hands of Mr Mitterrand undoubtedly did contribute to his 1988 defeat, but Mr Chirac was also dogged by the electorate's lingering doubts. He is seen as too ambitious for his own good, a problem which may be aggravated by his tactics. In the meantime, RPR leader faces the challenge of striking a balance between adopting a low profile, thereby avoiding the blame for any mistakes made by the new government, and having such a low profile that he jeopardises his present success in the presidential opinion polls.</p>

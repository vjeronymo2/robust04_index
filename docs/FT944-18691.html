			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Comeback kid shows no fight: Jurek Martin examines a battered President Bill Clinton Franklin Roosevelt created it, Ronald Reagan perfected it and it is now on every US president's Saturday morning schedule. It is a short radio report to the nation, from the White House or wherever the president is, lasting no more than about five minutes. An hour later, a representative of the opposition party of the day gets equal time to respond. There was more reason than usual to tune in to President Bill Clinton's talk last Saturday. Last week, the Republican party's 'scorched earth' policy eviscerated in Congress what had remained of his domestic legislative agenda. On Friday afternoon, campaign finance reform had gone the way of healthcare reform. Approval of the Gatt trade treaty was put on hold - by a Democrat at that, Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Bills covering cleansing of contamination by toxic waste, western land preservation, housing, and telecommunications were all dead or dying. Even popular proposals, such as reform of lobbying and education, needed respirators. As the week ended, Democrats, like Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader in the Senate, were openly apoplectic about Republican obstructionism. The opposition, the senator charged, was determined to bring Congress further into disrepute 'so they can inherit the rubble'. Yet, on Saturday morning, the Democratic president did not even allow the word 'Republican' to pass his lips. He did try to parade his achievements, and bemoaned what had been lost, but the culprits were always unnamed 'lobbyists' or Senate 'filibusters', which, as every Congress-watcher knows full well, have virtually all been orchestrated by the Republican party. Almost as an indication of Republican contempt for the president, the party's response, by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, hardly referred to Mr Clinton's remarks. Instead, it assaulted his policies on Haiti, which the president had not even mentioned. Mr Clinton's reluctance to come out fighting may reflect immediate political concerns, not least the fate this week of the bills to reform lobbying and education. However, by that token, he might even be persuaded to hold back until the Senate has reconvened at the end of November to consider the Gatt agreement - and that will not be until after the mid-term congressional elections on November 8. Survey after survey of US opinion shows the elections as likely to be potentially disastrous for Mr Clinton and the Democrats, who now represent the political establishment in the widely loathed capital. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post yesterday carried extensive analyses, pointing to the likelihood of Republican control of the Senate, possibly of the House of Representatives and even of most state governorships. Some Democrats in rock-solid seats are now fighting for their lives, including Senator Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts. Many have chosen to respond by shifting themselves to the maximum distance from their president. A mid-western fundraising trip by Mr Clinton a week ago was poorly attended and its financial gain was disappointing. In fairness, the electoral season will not really begin until Congress adjourns, probably at the end of this week. Incumbents have been kept in Washington by the heavy congressional schedule, though some, like Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House, were forced back home at the weekend by polls indicating the depth of their difficulties. But, even if the public perception is that Mr Clinton is a drag on Democratic candidates, a deferential silence from him in the five weeks before November 8 might be yet more devastating. It would risk leaving the impression that he is prepared to face two more years of Washington 'gridlock', which is the certain result of large Republican gains. As R W Apple noted in the New York Times yesterday, this impasse with Capitol Hill could be turned to the president's advantage in 1996, as it was did in 1948 when President Harry Truman ran for re-election in the last months of the 'do nothing' Republican Congress returned two years before. But a more common view among Democrats, especially those up for re-election now, is that it would be folly to let the Republicans 'get away with it' now. Mr Clinton, self-styled 'comeback kid' of the 1992 race, can still be a formidable campaigner when his heart is in it. But, on Saturday, in front of a clear target and a ready-made forum, there was no hint of fighting spirit. His wife, Hillary, who also has much to lament with the loss of healthcare reform, was at least back in political harness campaigning for her brother, Hugh Rodham, a Senate candidate in Florida. But the nation still waits on its president.</p>

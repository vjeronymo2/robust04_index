			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirella Kalostipi] </F>   [Excerpts] Many senior officials arrived in Corfu today.  All European Union [EU] leaders are expected to arrive on the  island by late tonight. French President Francois Mitterrand  and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl are expected late tonight.    Tonight, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will host an  official dinner for the twelve EU leaders, the four new  partners, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    The Russian president arrived in Corfu at noon today  accompanied by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin  and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Cypriot President  Glavkos Kliridhis arrived earlier. Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Marquez Gonzalez's plane landed in Ioannis Kapodhistrias  airport around 1400 today. [passage omitted]    Kliridhis said the differences with the Turkish Cypriot side  have essentially increased and said he hopes that negotiations  on Cyprus' accession to the EU will begin soon.    In a statement, Churkin referred particularly to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: We will give all sides a last  chance to reach a peace agreement. If they do not accept these  proposals, which are extremely detailed and serious, I am afraid  they will get into serious trouble. The Russian deputy foreign  minister feels that the parties involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina  have no political will to reach a peace settlement. In any  case, an effort will be made in Corfu and a last chance will be  given to everyone for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian issue.    Churkin described the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina as  very  dangerous. He said: What the ministers and the international  community will attempt to formulate in Corfu and in early July  is a serious proposal that contains strong elements to motivate  and to dissuade the three parties.</p>

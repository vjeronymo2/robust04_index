			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from the "Foreign Policy Desk"] </F>   [Text] Following the announcement of the expulsion of the  second diplomat from the British Embassy in Tehran by the  Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry, the British  Government declared that the reason for expelling the Iranian  diplomat was the dissemination of false documents regarding  Britain's activities and position on Bosnia-Herzegovina.    When the British Foreign Office summoned the charge  d'affaires of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London last week  and informed him of its decision, it did not divulge the name of  the expelled diplomat and the reason for this action.  Yesterday, it announced the name of the Iranian first secretary  Bilurchi and claimed that he had circulated false documents  regarding the anti-Muslim policy followed by the British forces  deployed in that region.    The following points may be noted in this regard:    1. The British policy with regard to the Bosnian Muslims  requires no affirmation by means of forged documents as the  anti- Muslim policy of the British authorities regarding the  oppressed Bosnian Muslims is known to all.    The actions and allegations of the British political and  military officials are so numerous that their publication would  require reams and reams of paper. RESALAT has repeatedly  written that if justice were to prevail in the world, British  and military representatives such as David Owen should be  impeached on charges of complicity in the massacre of the  Bosnian Muslims.    The British Government has played the primary role in  preventing the Muslims from gaining access to arms for their  defense to save themselves from the Serbs' aggression and by the  induction of Russia in the political talks on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, it paved the way for further pressure on the  Muslims.    2. The actual point that the British Government wishes to  conceal by these miscellaneous charges against Iran is the same  issue of its espionage. The British security officials planted  a plethora of listening devices in the building of the Iranian  Embassy in London so that the building cannot be used for normal  purposes and has to be entirely reconstructed. Such an act has  completely destroyed the already tarnished position of London.    3. Britain's weak point lies not in a diplomatic war but in  economic pressure. Why should we have such firm economic  relations with a government that is completely unreliable from  the political point of view? What is the reason for the centers  for extensive purchases for Iran's industrial ministries in  London, especially the office for its oil sales? In addition to  minimizing economic relations, some thought should be given to  the transfer of these purchase centers to other countries.</p>

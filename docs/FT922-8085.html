			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ahead despite strong retail sales US Treasury prices wavered yesterday morning following the release of two sets of economic data for April, but by mid-session the market had moved slightly higher. In late trading, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up  3/16 at 101 3/4 , yielding 7.84 per cent. The two-year note was  1/8 higher with a yield of 5.09 per cent. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange overnight system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 3/16 per cent. The operation, which adds liquidity to the banking system, was more aggressive than expected and left some players perplexed about the Fed's intentions for monetary policy. Shorter-dated maturities firmed as Fed funds fell as low as 3 1/2 per cent in the afternoon before picking up to 4 per cent in late trading. The Fed's perceived target for the rate is 3 3/4 per cent. Expectations of a near-term easing of monetary policy were dampened by the release of an unexpectedly strong retail sales report for April. Retail sales climbed 0.9 per cent, well above the 0.4 per cent increase widely expected. However, the March figure was revised to show a 1 per cent decline from a previously-reported fall of 0.4 per cent. There was no real surprise from April's consumer price index, which rose 0.2 per cent. LONGER-dated UK government bonds gained about  1/4 of a point yesterday in thin trading as investors focused their attention on the publication this Friday of the latest retail price index figures. Market estimates put the April year-on-year headline inflation rate at anything from 4.2 per cent to 5 per cent, compared with the 4 per cent rise recorded in March. The difficulty of assessing the phasing out of the community charge (or poll tax) and the effects of VAT changes accounts for the wide discrepancy in views. Whatever the outcome, the latest RPI number may be a poor guide to the future - and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday again stressed his view that inflation will continue to fall in the UK. Yesterday's rally, helped by the firmness of sterling, saw the yield on 10-year gilts fall to within 133 basis points of their German equivalents, down from about 140 basis points a week ago and about their lows for the year so far. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 yielded 9.09 per cent by the end of the day, down from 9.16 per cent the day before. Of longer-dated issues, the yield on the 9 per cent bonds due 2008 fell from 9.03 per cent to 8.89 per cent on the day. On Liffe, the long gilt futures contract rose from 98 to 99 1/32 in moderate trade. Friday is expected to bring the latest announcement of further supply to the gilt market, with the market expecting anything up to Pounds 1bn in the form of a tap stock. WHILE other European bond markets moved around it, the cash market for German government bonds remained little changed. Most investors continued to await the outcome of wage negotiations involving IG Metall, the 4m-strong engineering union. Union leaders threatened a strike ballot next week - thought all the more likely given the outcome of German public sector workers' strike. On Liffe bund futures gained nearly 20 basis points, rising to 87.34 in late trading. A SHARP appreciation in the yen drove a sharp rally in Japanese government bonds yesterday. As the yen strengthened to 129.93 against the dollar, a gain of some Y1.5, bond yields tightened. The yield on the bond No 129 closed at just under 5.5 per cent, down from 5.6 per cent. The market returned to its levels of about a month ago, before tumbling share prices and concern about the weakness of the banks drove yields up to over 5.7 per cent. FRENCH government bonds advanced strongly against German bonds yesterday morning on the back of a strong currency. However, profit taking took OATs back to their opening levels by the end of the day. Having closed yesterday on a yield some 61 basis points above German bunds, 10-year French government OATs closed to about 57 points before retreating to yesterday's level. The 8.5 per cent OAT maturing in 2002 closed unchanged on a yield of 8.57 per cent. Traders were said to have switched to shorter-dated paper in the hope of a further interest rate cut on the back of the powerful performance of the franc. However, most analysts continue to believe that a rate cut to below German levels remains unlikely.</p>

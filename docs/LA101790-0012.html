			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURER DONATIONS TO WILLIE BROWN ATTACKED  </P> <P> Insurers gave at least $45,600 to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's campaign  against two legislative term-limit initiatives within weeks of the passage of  legislation exempting surety insurance from regulations imposed by Proposition  103, Voter Revolt Chairman Harvey Rosenfield said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rosenfield called for a federal corruption probe of the matter and charged that  "the campaign against term limits is being waged by the politicians bought and  paid for by insurance companies and other special interests."  </P> <P> Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103, the voter-approved insurance  initiative, also asserted that the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian acted  illegally in approving the exemption of the surety companies.  </P> <P> Brown's press secretary, Michael Reese, responded, "This attack is a reach even  for the likes of Harvey Rosenfield. Clearly, Mr. Rosenfield is playing  connect-the-dots politics. In this case, the dots do not and should not  connect."  </P> <P> Rosenfield noted that one clause of Proposition 103 prohibits the Legislature  from changing the measure unless doing so furthers the purposes of the  initiative. Exempting the highly profitable, $225-million-a-year surety  insurance business from the rollback and rate regulation provisions of  Proposition 103 does not further its purposes, he contended.  </P> <P> Rosenfield Tuesday asked Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to ignore the  exemption pending a court test of its validity.  </P> <P> Surety insurers provide a financial guarantee that a party, such as a  construction company, will perform the work they have promised to do on a  project.  </P> <P> This is the second time this year that insurance industry sources have been  accused of furthering their political agenda by giving to initiative campaigns  not strictly related to insurance.  </P> <P> In the primary campaign, insurers gave more than $300,000 to efforts to pass  Proposition 115, the anti-crime initiative. At that time, critics charged that  the insurers' real aim was to ingratiate themselves with the gubernatorial  campaign of Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, while not embarrassing Wilson by  giving directly to him. Wilson was the prime sponsor of the measure. Rosenfield  noted that the measure to exempt the surety insurers from Proposition 103  quietly passed through the Legislature on unanimous votes in August and was  signed by the governor Aug. 24. Many of the insurer donations to Brown's  campaign against the term limits -- Propositions 131 and 140 -- came between  Sept. 10 and 12.  </P></p>

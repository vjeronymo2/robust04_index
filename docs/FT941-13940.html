			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Dow climbs on its cyclicals and reaches peak - Wall Street If investors in US stocks were looking to the latest corporate reporting season for some justification for the high levels to which share prices have been pushed, they had plenty of good news to cheer them last week. The first batch of results for the final quarter of 1993 painted a picture of a corporate sector enjoying a faster-than expected pick up in demand at home and considerable benefits from the prolonged round of cost-cutting and restructuring of the early 1990s. Barring one or two nasty shocks in pharmaceuticals and the computer industry, results generally came in at or above the more optimistic analysts' expectations. Whether the earnings momentum is enough to support share prices at their current levels or push them higher is another matter. Dividend increases have been more modest than the rise in earnings, as many companies continue to rebuild their capital or conserve resources in anticipation of an expansion in working capital in the months ahead. And with the dividend yield on the Dow Jones Industrial Average already down at a lowly 2.6 per cent or so, each new upward twist in share prices puts extra strain on this valuation basis of the market. But last week was not a time to linger too long over such thoughts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its climb to new highs, breaking through the 3,900 barrier yesterday morning after ending the previous week at 3,867. The Dow continued to outperform the broadly-based S &amp; P 500: by mid-day yesterday, the narrow 30-stock average was up 3.7 per cent from the end of last year, twice as much as the broader index. It only takes a brief look at the composition of the Dow to work out why. With its heavy weighting towards cyclical stocks, the Dow continued to benefit last week from the craze for companies which would benefit from an acceleration of economic growth. While it only contains two financial stocks (JP Morgan and American Express), the 30-stock average has a wide range of cyclical industries: chemicals (DuPont and Union Carbide), metals and mining (Bethlehem Steel, Alcoa and 3M) and autos (General Motors), along with Caterpillar, Goodyear and International Paper. These have been among the stars of the stock market in recent days and weeks. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment, jumped by 8 per cent in a week capped by a stronger-than expected earnings announcement yesterday. The week had begun in similar mood, with Chrysler taking the market by surprise with the robustness of its growth and in the process giving a lift to GM and Ford. Not surprisingly, the chemicals and steel companies - which stand to benefit from greater demand as auto makers and other customers expand - are also among the biggest success stories of the year so far. Taking just those in the Dow average, DuPont's shares are now 11 per cent higher than at the start of the year, Union Carbide is up 12.5 per cent (it gave an upbeat preview of its latest results) and Bethlehem Steel is 13 per cent ahead. Neither steel nor chemical companies have much room to lift their prices, given the worldwide overcapacity in both industries, but at least they can expect to take up some of the slack from recent years while reaping the benefits of cost-cutting. This mania for cyclical industries served to overshadow a series of powerful earnings reports from US banks. Against the background of sharply rising profits all round, Citicorp stood out: not only has it bounced back from the brink of disaster in only two years, but its latest figures suggested that it could be one of the few commercial banks to see a sustained rise in revenues in the coming quarters (unlike others, Citicorp clung fast to its worldwide reach during the bad times, and is now benefitting from growth in developing countries). All of this had little to do with the stock market's obsessions last week, though. The latest figures seemed a good opportunity to sell off bank stocks, taking profits and moving into cyclical industries. Also suffering was the pharmaceuticals sector, dragged down by weak sales at Pfizer, which had seemed to offer better prospects for growth than most other drug companies. Digital Equipment, which gave a downbeat view of prospects for the first half of this year, dragged down technology stocks for a while - good news from Microsoft and Apple later in the week helped reverse the rot. On balance, though, there was little to disturb the general sense of well-being. Bar a round of profit-taking, Wall Street seemed to have prepared itself for two more weeks of good profits.  --------------------------------------- Monday      3870.29    +     3.09 Tuesday     3870.29             - Wednesday   3884.37    +    14.08 Thursday    3891.96    +     7.59 Friday      3914.48    +    22.52  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Battle over rice imports will test coalition: Hosokawa faces a tough time selling Japan's concession on farm trade JAPANESE rice farmers took to the streets of Tokyo last week in protest at the government's offer in the Gatt negotiations on world trade liberalisation to phase out the country's ban on rice imports. Japan, seeking to avoid being blamed for delaying the Uruguay Round talks, said informally it would open its rice market after a six-year moratorium. The move angered many farmers, but most are aware that an eventual opening of the Japanese rice market is inevitable. Since taking office, the prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, and his cabinet have made the ritual protests against rice liberalisation. However, before becoming prime minister, Mr Hosokawa was in favour of an open rice market. Furthermore, he is supported by the backroom power broker, Mr Ichiro Ozawa of the Japan Renewal party. The key posts of agriculture minister, foreign minister, and minister of international trade, are held by JRP members. Japan's controversial offer, leaked to the press last week, includes a six-year grace period of tarification on rice, during which it will accept imports equal to 3 to 5 per cent of domestic rice consumption. US officials point out that while it remains to be seen if other countries will accept the plan, Japan's move was a 'big step forward'. Even if other Gatt members accept Japan's plan, Mr Hosokawa will need to convince coalition members who staunchly oppose rice imports. The socialists, who rely on the rural vote, have generally opposed lifting the import ban. Some are threatening to leave the coalition if the ban is lifted. The Liberal Democratic party, strong in rural constituencies, also opposes liberalisation. The LDP, however, risks being split over the rice issue, since some LDP members, including young urban MPs, support liberalisation. In order to avoid a rift within the coalition disrupting the debate over political reform currently under way in parliament, the government is considering a parliamentary vote over rice imports. In 1988, parliament unanimously voted against opening the rice market. But having lost much of its support base in the recent election, the Socialist party does not seem to have much choice other than eventually to side with Mr Hosokawa. Many of the younger members feel the party will not have much to gain by leaving the coalition government, and are calling for the party to accept liberalisation. Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at brokers Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says: 'The only chance for the socialists' survival is to cling to the coalition.' There is a high possibility they will opt for concessions likely to be offered by Mr Hosokawa, such as income support for farmers, instead of abandoning the coalition. Mr Hosokawa is also trying to weaken the strong rice lobby by electoral reform, which will ease the disparity between the rural and urban vote. By redefining the constituencies, he wants to weaken the clout of the rural vote, which can be worth up to three urban votes. It is likely that Japan will officially make its offer after the EC and US settle their disagreement over agricultural trade, thus placing Japan at the centre of the negotiations and allowing the government to say it has defended farmers' interests in the face of international pressure.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: Why records continue to be broken - London RECORD stock market highs have become such regular events that they hardly merit being called news any more. The Footsie reached an all-time peak on Wednesday, held it on Thursday and rose again yesterday, making it through 3,100 and just staying above that. So, what has driven the market to these levels? The combination of largely favourable economic statistics and corporate news has, no doubt, helped but two other factors are worth examining. First, there is the question of the Bundesbank and the rate cut that never came. On Wednesday, the day before the regular fortnightly Bundesbank council meeting when decisions on interest rates are made, speculation grew that a reduction was coming. On Wednesday, too, the Footsie rose 29.9 points. It was all too easy to link the two. As it turned out, the Bundesbank did not cut rates on Thursday. The Footsie trembled but closed unchanged, suggesting that it was not the prospect of an immediate German rate cut that caused Wednesday's rise. Indeed, the German stock market also rose sharply on Wednesday although it fell on Thursday. Rather than focus on Europe - after all, German interest rates will fall sooner or later so it is hardly worth getting too worked up about timing - consider the US bond market. This has been strong lately, with the yield on the long bond dropping to near 6 per cent. Michael Hughes, an economist at BZW, thinks real yields on bonds are coming down world-wide. A look at the chart shows that, in the UK, real long gilt yields - those adjusted for inflation - have risen over the past couple of years. Inflation has gone down faster than yields. Although falling somewhat recently, real yields are still high. This suggests one of two things. Either bond yields are set to fall further - in which case, equities can continue their rise - or inflation is going up again. The present view is that an era of low inflation combined with economic growth - the dream of every finance minister - is dawning. And it might even be true, for a couple of years at least. If so, a Footsie at 3,100.6 is by no means over-valued. It is also worth looking at the performance of individual Footsie stocks this year. Although the index is up from 2846.5 so far, a rise of 8.9 per cent, the share prices of around a fifth of the top 100 stocks actually are lower than they were at the start of the year. These are mainly drug stocks such as Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham which have been hit by fears of cuts in health spending; food retailers, including Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Argyll, affected by theories that competition in the sector is becoming too intense; and consumer stocks like Bass, Allied-Lyons, Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, affected by fears that the revival in consumer spending is sluggish. If the market were in an over-optimistic phase, then such stocks would not have been left so far behind. Turning to economic news, there have been few statistics this week. But what has come from the Treasury and the CBI has been encouraging. The Treasury said on Thursday that the economic recovery this year was looking stronger than had been forecast in the March Budget. At the same time, the CBI raised its forecasts of economic growth this year and next, with a prediction of a 3 per cent rise in GDP in 1994. Meanwhile, the official statisticians admitted the recession really was not as bad as they had thought - little comfort to those who have suffered in it. An encouraging trend in corporate stories is the number of deals being done as companies buy or sell subsidiaries. Buyers - notably MB-Caradon, with its Pounds 800m purchase this week of the bulk of RTZ's industrial activities but also Wolseley, with a Pounds 51.5m US purchase - are looking to expand into the economic upturn. Sellers, like RTZ and TSB, which sold its EuroDollar car hire subsidiary to its management for Pounds 118m yesterday, are at last able to get rid of businesses they no longer want, and at reasonable prices. With all these deals going on, and rights issues and flotations continuing apace, it is no wonder the merchant bank sector has been one of the strongest performers so far this year. Another excitement this week - which can be taken as a bull point for the market, too - was Reuters move in offering to buy back Pounds 350m worth of shares from investors to use up some of its low-yielding cash. Such was the demand to sell that Reuters had offers of 164.3m shares, 6.5 times the 25m it wanted to buy even though it was paying Pounds 14 apiece and the market price was more than Pounds 1 higher. The reason was that those institutional investors which run tax-exempt funds, such as pension funds, could reclaim a tax credit from the Inland Revenue on top of the Pounds 14 from Reuters. In theory, then, institutions have Pounds 350m plus the tax rebate to put back into the stock market - more than offsetting MB-Caradon's Pounds 334m rights issue. Trading results remain patchy although expectations are that forecasts for full-year earnings growth from the market as a whole will be revised upwards once the interim reporting season gets going properly next month. This week saw BZW upgrading its profit forecast for Imperial Chemical Industries, not such a big business since it demerged Zeneca but still an important market leader. ICI told BZW that July had been a good month. Another pointer came from Graseby, the electronics group, which said this week it would cut its 1993 dividend from 10.7p to 6.6p, after reporting interim profits up 18 per cent, because it wanted to retain cash for investment.</p>

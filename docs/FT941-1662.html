			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Arts: All tap and no go in 'Hot Shoe Shuffle' - Theatre About 95 per cent of the dancing in Hot Shoe Shuffle ('The New Tap Musical') is slick, athletic, high-voltage, strenuous, and utterly devoid of the spontaneity that true tap is all about. As for the singing, the absence of spontaneity is nearer 100 per cent. All-singing, all-dancing, Hot Shoe Shuffle comes to us from Australia, where it was a wow. Judging by the reaction of the first-night audience here (Australians thick on the ground), it may wow London. It is not, however, good. The beauties of tap lie in the plenitude of rhythm, in the surprise of syncopation, in the elegant phrasing with which dense clusters of steps are threaded into a larger fluency, in the contrast between those busy feet and the slower changes of shape shown by the calmly informal upper body, and in the casual jazz brilliance whereby everything seems to be improvised. The tap of Hot Shoe Shuffle is tense, forceful, metrically bland. Only one dance ('Little Brown Jug' danced by a male foursome) has any real choreographic interest. Elsewhere there are one or two good steps (notably a kind of thundering stag sissonne in Slap's solo), a too-brief solo for Slide (Adam Garcia, the only relaxed dancer onstage), a clever use of six men crossing the stage like a chain (dropping or collecting a soloist as they pass) - and acres of bashing, hard-and-fast, highly amplified formula. Though Hot Shoe Shuffle may seem to be about tap dance, it isn't. Written by Larry Buttrose and Kathryn Riding, set in New York, it's about showbiz, standard American showbiz, where backstage problems abound but are ironed out as The Show Goes On in a golden haze of dreams coming true. I can be as susceptible as the next man to this hackneyed story, as long as it reveals some real human freshness. But Hot Shoe Shuffle milks every cliche with a complete lack of irony. Can the Seven Brothers Tap and their newfound full-grown sister April get this show on the road? 'We've only got four weeks]' 'Talent's cheap - anyone can have talent. Slick is Sweat.' The brothers are mean to April, who is taller than them, and can't tap like them. She leaves. Then they realise that without her they can't win the millions of dollars bequeathed to them by their father in his will. So they bring her back - she was just hanging around on the nearest park bench - and they train her. Then they find there is no money to inherit, and that the creep who has been rehearsing them so unpleasantly is actually their father. Never mind; as April says, 'We've got something much more valuable than money. We're a family.' And the Show Goes On. All of which could be funny and even touching if it were performed as if all this were happening for the first time; or as if they found it amusing that they were stuck in a story that has happened so often before. But no. Very energetically, these Australians conform to the most insincere and least witty norm of showbiz style. Which is also the way they sing and dance. As April, Rhonda Burchmore (5ft 11ins without her heels) has the main singing role. She puts over 'Long Ago and Far Away', 'How Lucky Can You Get', 'Birth of the Blues' with brassy panache, no musical individuality, and a boxy, worn voice that makes her sound 20 years older than the 30-something I presume she is. The evening's most grotesque feature is the way her high-cut leotard reveals a waxed bikini line and the folds of what are either her underwear or her tights. As for her facial mannerisms . . . The forced nature of the whole farrago seems to emanate from David Atkins, who not only plays Spring (the chief brother) but also has directed and (with Dein Perry) co-choreographed the whole show. His brow is alarmingly tense; sweat gleams profusely on his face; and he employs a wretched smirk amid comic dialogue to indicate he is trying not to 'corpse'. As their father, Jack Webster gives the most bogus performance of all, determinedly stale. Need I go on with this? I love tap, I love almost every song used in this show, and I loathed the way this show used them. At the Queen's Theatre.</p>

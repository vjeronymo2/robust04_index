			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / TV adventure that shows business: Financial programmes are back in fashion, but will enough people watch? The trouble with business television in the past has been that it has not amounted to much of a business. Businessmen may be happy to appear on television and, of course, they are desirable targets for advertisers. But catching them in front of the screen has been a much more difficult task. That may be about to change as leading broadcasters and international business information providers use the latest technology to try to entice businessmen to switch on more often. On Thursday Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and Flextech, the media group controlled by US cable group Tele-Communications of Denver, said they planned to launch a round-the-clock business channel in February. European Business News will be broadcast by satellite and carried on cable network. There will also be a specialist service aimed at the screens of market professionals. Dow Jones is already a partner in the satellite channel, Asia Business News, launched last year in Singapore. Also on Thursday, NBC Super Channel, the pan-European satellite broadcaster whose US parent company operates the CNBC business channel, announced an expansion of its coverage. From January 3, NBC Super Channel will broadcast European Money Wheel - five hours of live business programming which will focus on the main financial and business markets. The morning European Money Wheel segment will be followed in the afternoon by CNBC live from the US, before giving way to non-business programming in the evening. NBC Super Channel has not ruled out becoming a 24-hour business channel by adding an Asian Money Wheel to its existing Asian business service. Likely to provide the European input is FTTV, the television arm of the Financial Times, which already provides two live 30-minute business programmes each weekday for NBC Super Channel. It is on the verge of signing a deal to provide the new European Money Wheel section, though neither organisation would confirm this officially last night. That means that by early next year the two rival business publications, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, will be involved in head-to-head confrontation for the business television market in Europe  - though not 24 hours a day. The activity is in marked contrast to a few years ago, when an early attempt to create a European business channel failed. The Zurich-based European Business channel went into bankruptcy in June 1990 after a possible rescue from Time Warner, the US media group, fell through. A similar revival of interest in business programming is taking place in terrestrial television. In 1991, after four years on air, Channel 4 closed down its Business Daily having decided that its stretched resources should be used for business documentaries, rather than reaching about 350,000, often retired, viewers on weekday lunchtimes. Yet on September 19 the BBC will launch Working Lunch, a new half-hour programme five days a week, intended to explain the business and financial world. To some in the media industry, the flurry of interest is surprising. Mr Mark Wood, editor-in-chief of Reuters news and information group, which this year launched a specialist financial television service for market professionals, is sceptical about the prospects for more general business channels, such as that planned by Dow Jones and Flextech. 'It's a bold move. We keep looking at it (a general business channel), but we have not been able to see how it can be done profitably,' says Mr Wood. Apart from its specialist channel, Reuters Financial Television, which usually only broadcasts when there is a market-moving interview or announcement, the group prefers to make programme segments for other broadcasters. In spite of such scepticism, Mr Michael Connor, the managing director of European Business News who is beginning talks with cable operators about carrying the new channel, is optimistic there is a market for a quality channel offering 'news for business people'. Dow Jones appears to be intent on creating a worldwide network of both general business, and specialist, channels for market professionals. In Asia, for instance, it is experimenting with a specialist service to complement the existing Asia Business News. In the US, the company is thinking about adding a general channel (to challenge CNBC) to its existing specialist outlet, Dow Jones Investor Network. Its plans for Europe appear to be built on a conviction - rather then evidence - that there is a market for such services. There are no firm estimates of likely audiences. Even in Asia, after nearly 10 months on air, Mr Chris Graves, managing editor of Asia Business News, can only say that the channel, which can be picked up from Taiwan and southern China to Thailand and eastern India, is now available in between 12m and 16m homes. He has, however, had letters from the Solomon Islands and reports that his audience includes businessmen such as Mr Richard Li, founder of Star Television, the Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster. Similarly, NBC Super Channel argues that it has a big reach on which to build an audience. It says it can be received in a total of 60m homes in Europe, former Soviet states, the Middle East and north Africa - 33m on cable networks and a further 27m through terrestrial retransmission. Nevertheless, as the multi-million-pound business television battle begins to intensify, there is more than a degree of caution in the advertising world. 'Newspapers are a much better way to reach businessmen. There's much less waste,' says Mr Adam Smith of Zenith, the media buying arm of advertising group Saatchi and Saatchi. If business television is to become a proper business in Europe, it will increasingly have to depend on subscription revenue from cable operators, as well as advertising. It will also have to prove businessmen want to watch.</p>

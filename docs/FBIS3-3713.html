At the crucial  moment when tasks for reform, development, and maintaining  stability are very heavy today, it is all the more necessary to  pay great attention to doing a good job of doing propaganda and  ideological work.    Comrade Chen Bangzhu said the current provincial conference  on propaganda and ideological work is a very important one that  has a bearing on the overall situation. At the national work  conference on propaganda and ideological work, Comrade Jiang  Zemin made profound discussion on the importance of propaganda  and ideological work. Comrade Wang Maolin made exhaustive  explanations in his theme report delivered on 4 March. This  being the case, under the new situation we must pay greater  attention to propaganda and ideological work and cannot afford  any neglect or carelessness. Work in this domain must be greatly  strengthened, and not the least weakened; it must be improved,  and not come to a standstill.    Comrade Chen Bangzhu stressed that party committees,  governments, and various departments at all levels should attach  great importance to and support propaganda and ideological work.  Primarily, it is imperative to implement the principle of doing  two types of work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to  both. Second, governments at all level should proceed to  provide greater support and help for propaganda and ideological  work in hardware and software. Hardware support means to  ungrudgingly spending money to equip the propaganda and  ideological front with necessary modern means step by step, to  further improve conditions for developing propaganda and  cultural undertakings, and resolve some practical difficulties  of propaganda and ideological departments in a down-to-earth  way. Software support means to constantly brief propaganda and  ideological departments on the current situation and policies,  and help them promptly see conditions and grasp the overall  situation. At the same time, leadership at various levels  should befriend more propaganda and ideological workers,  constantly lend an ear to their opinions and suggestions, and  learn to make use of this channel to improve their own work.    The task is heavy and the road ahead is a long one for  propaganda and ideological work. We believe that a brand new  situation will surface in Hunan's propaganda and ideological  work in the wake of the current conference, and will play a  still greater role in socialist modernization and make still  greater contributions.    Wang Keying, provincial party committee standing committee  member, concurrently governor in charge of routine affairs,  presided over the conference yesterday. Attending the  conference also were Wen Xuande and Liu Dingying.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Binder partners in Scotland oppose Andersen merger The Scottish partnership in BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest accountancy firm, is set to vote against a proposed merger with Arthur Andersen, the fourth-largest. Mr Ian Valentine, managing partner for the firm in Scotland, said: 'As things are, we will not go ahead. We are unable to see any strategic basis. We have a different client base, culture and fee level. It just doesn't add up.' He said that he spoke on behalf of the region's 18 partners, and added: 'I am reasonably confident that we will not be the only region in the BDO network taking this view.' There are 11 regional partnerships that make up Binder, of which four appear to have come out firmly in favour of merger. The partners are expected to vote on formal proposals in the next few days. Andersen has said that it would be willing to proceed with the merger even if it was just with the single partnership covering London and Leeds, which represents more than half of fee income. The Scottish firm has one quoted client, Prestwick Holdings, and provides services to the subsidiaries of English-based clients. It is believed to have received a number of approaches from other medium-size accountancy firms, and may decide to switch allegiance if the merger with Andersen goes ahead.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Multiple choice for TV news launched Videotron, the London cable television operator, has joined forces with Carlton Television and London Weekend Television to produce what is claimed to be the UK's first daily interactive news service. The experiment which began yesterday allows Videotron subscribers to choose between four versions of the main London regional news and magazine programmes. In addition to the two main programmes broadcast by the London franchise-holders, customers will have three other options. They are: a local weather and traffic service; a compilation programme of all the week's social-action items; a repeat of After 5 - the early evening current affairs programme. Advertisements will be carried simultaneously on all four options.</p>

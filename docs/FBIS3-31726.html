The Macedonia foreign minister Crvenkovski considered as  successful and a good example the meetings he had with the  Albanian high officials. "We are for a close cooperation with  Albania and all the other neighbours realising the democratic  principle of the non-intervention into the domestic affairs,"  Mr. Crvenkovski said adding that his government is also for  respecting of the human rights and for the relations building  based on the European and international standards.    The Macedonian foreign minister said we discussed with the  Albanian side some economic projects of the common interest  about the international situation and for the eventual  consequences our two countries may have by the grave situation  in region. "We had a fruitful meeting and we desire these  meetings be as often as possible," Mr. Crvenkovski said.    Asked about the U.S. State Department report on the human  rights in Macedonia, Mr. Crvenkovski said he didn't know  anything about that report. We observe, said Mr. Crvenkovski,  the principle which says that all citizens in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are equal having all the rights  and it is of the state interest that all of them be pleased to  their state and accept it as their own. I think, Mr.  Crvenkovski said, all the problems can not be solved within a  year but the great steps the Macedonian state has done can not  be rejected.    Answering to a question in regard with the closing of the  Salonica port, Mr. Crvenkovski said "from the Albanian side we  have a full support and we appreciate this very much." But,  however this blockade makes the transport difficult. This is a  means of pressure that will not be accepted from the  international community.    Minister Serreqi, answering a question about the possibility  of the aggravation of the relations with Greece because of  giving FYROM port facilities, said that "the fact that the  Albanian Government offer not only port facilities, but  facilities for all the goods circulation in the interest of  Macedonia as an answer to the one- sided approach attended and  declared from the Greek Government, one day after the visit of  the Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias to Belgrade, is an evidence  of the will for relations of good neighbourhood with Macedonia  and an evidence of the independence of the foreign policy of  Albania. "I was surprised from the decision of the Greek  Government because during the visit and the meeting in Athens,  in the talking with Mr. Papoulias, he told me that the time has  come to reconsider the approach of Greece toward Macedonia in a  quite different sense from the decision taken by them. I  believe that even my colleague and the Macedonian Government  should appreciate this support given from Albania.    Answering the question of a journalist concerned on an  article published in the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT about  the ill- treatment of the Albanians who ask passports of  identity, necessary for the future census of the population, the  Macedonian minister said that this problem has no relations with  the census of the population and that the Macedonian state is  for its performance according to the world standards.    Answering the question "cause any trouble to the Macedonian  Government some cases of the killing of Albanians in FYROM" Mr.  Crvenkovski said that he doesn't know cases of the abuse of the  human rights till the killings, at least during the period he  has been minister.    Considering the representation of the Albanians in the  Macedonian institutions, Mr. Crvenkovski said that during a year  and a half, the representation of the Albanians in the political  life of Macedonia is going over the possibilities of the organs  of power there.    Considering the Albanian approach toward the acceptation of  Macedonia in CSCE, Mr. Serreqi said that it will depend from the  treatment of the Albanians living there. Calling the Albanian  factor as very important for the relations between the two  countries, Minister Serreqi said that something has been done  for the rights of the Albanians in FYROM, but there are  possibilities to do more.    The question "Which is the Macedonian approach to the Kosova  question," Mr. Crvenkovski said that "our approach toward Kosova  question is that it should be resolved through dialogue, it is  impossible to find a solution for it through other ways."</p>

Such notification and warranty shall be maintained for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 30 days after the loading of the tobacco has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed, and shall be available for inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other fumigated cargoes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before commencing to load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fumigated cargo other than the cargo specifically addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the employer shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ascertain that such cargo does not contain a concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fumigants in excess of allowable limits found in subpart Z of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 1910 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grain dust.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When employees are exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of grain dusts in excess of allowable limits found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in subpart Z of part 1910 of this chapter, they shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected by suitable respiratory protective equipment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the requirements of &sect;1918.102.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Catch of Menhaden and similar species of fish.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels having and utilizing refrigerated holds for the carriage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all cargo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) After a vessel has arrived at berth for discharge of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> menhaden, but before personnel enter the hold, and as frequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereafter as tests indicate to be necessary, tests shall be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the atmosphere in the vessel's hold to ensure a safe work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> space.

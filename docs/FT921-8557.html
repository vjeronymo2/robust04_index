			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (11): Marcos crony bounces back - Profile of Eduardo 'Danding' Cojuangco THEY call him Ferdinand Marcos's 'super-crony' an 'unrepentant protectionist' and the 'Pac-man' after the omnivorous computer game monster that eats everything in its path. He became extremely rich by controlling the coconut industry, the kind of monopoly that undermined the Philippines economy for years under President Marcos. Yet six years after fleeing into exile, Eduardo 'Danding' Cojuangco, the most accomplished of the Marcos business cronies, is back and a serious contender for the presidency. The fact that Mr Cojuangco - and Mrs Imelda Marcos, the former president's widow - should be given the time of day says something about the unpredictable twists of Philippines politics. Incredible though it might seem, Mr Cojuangco is an opposition front-runner. Through his effective control of the coconut industry, Mr Cojuangco had influence in virtually every village in the country and is believed to be able to call in political debts. It is not immediately apparent why. After Mr Marcos declared martial law in 1972, coconut farmers had to sell their produce to an authority Mr Cojuangco effectively controlled; he imposed a levy on them with which he built the United Coconut Planters Bank that took control of almost all the country's coconut oil mills. And his control of the supply of seedlings rounded out a monopoly that stretched throughout the coconut industry, the country's largest export earner. Nevertheless, he was considered by many in the countryside to be a good patron. 'Ferdinand Marcos controlled everything in Manila,' says one of Mr Cojuangco's army of campaign helpers. 'But in the countryside, poor people earned money. They know Cojuangco as a true friend.' Should he be elected, Mr Cojuangco would most likely regain control of the United Coconut Planters Bank and a sizeable shareholding in San Miguel, the country's largest private employer. These assets and some 400 other companies - Mr Cojuangco says he is unclear how many - are still frozen by a government body looking into the billions of dollars allegedly stolen by Marcos and his business associates. Mr Cojuangco denies the charge that he is a crony - the description of those who are believed to have benefitted financially during the Marcos era - because, he says, he did not receive government loans and he never invested abroad. More worrying to local and foreign businessmen are Mr Cojuangco's economic policy ideas. Many question whether he really had the super-business brain of the Marcos era. Who would not make money if granted a monopoly protected by the president, they ask? Moreover, while Mr Cojuangco is careful to adopt the rhetoric of economic liberalisation, businessmen suspect he is still an avid believer in what he knows best - monopoly capitalism. He says he would 'design programmes which would double the income of rural households' and government would develop local industries for the larger domestic market that would emerge. They fear it suggests an end to the withdrawal of government from business and the more export-oriented policies that the rest of south-east Asia has successfully followed. It would 'make the business sector lie low', according to one Filipino banker. Given Mr Cojuangco's record there is something chilling in his definition of a president's duties: 'chief executive for all the sectors of the economy.'</p>

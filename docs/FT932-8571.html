			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China appears ready to remove barriers against foreign miners AFTER YEARS of procrastination, China at last appears willing to begin dismantling nationalistic barriers against foreign involvement in its mining sector, including gold prospects. Participants in a conference held in Beijing last week, among them representatives of some of the world's biggest mining houses, came away convinced that change was in the wind; although it was unclear how quickly China would replace existing legislation. Mining company representatives, used to sterile discussion on the need for liberalisation, were surprised when, on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials, responding to international pressure, halved the rate of gold royalties in draft legislation. While the proposed 10 per cent royalty rate is still outrageously high by international standards, especially compared with those in developing countries where rates of between 2 and 3 per cent apply, apparent Chinese flexibility was regarded as a good sign. Chinese regulations at present ban foreign companies from involvement in the exploitation of gold reserves, but China is anxious to secure capital and perhaps more important the advanced minerals treatment technology required to exploit this lucrative area. Mr Graham Reid, a senior manager of CRA of Australia, said that although the Chinese had a 'fair way to go' in their efforts to attract foreign miners, he had found attitudes displayed by officials of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 'very encouraging'. He noted that Chinese officials responded with alacrity to suggestions by the foreign participants, who included representative of Newmont Mining of the US, Cominco of Canada, De Beers of South Africa, and BHP of Australia; although he also observed that substantial change to legislation would require the approval of the Chinese parliament. Among the more positive developments was a Chinese undertaking to study a proposal that the country should adopt a model 'contract of work' allowing prospective mining ventures to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, thus facilitating much greater flexibility. Mr Reid, CRA's general manager for exploration, noted that this approach was operating successfully in parts of Africa and in Indonesia  - a contract of work's main appeal is that it overrides existing laws - where it had proved an effective means of 'kick starting' mining exploration and development. Chinese mining officials have made it clear that they are under pressure to boost activity in the mining sector, which is lagging far behind the rest of the economy. China's economic boom has heightened demand for a whole range of minerals, both ferrous and non-ferrous. Mr Reid said that foreign miners would, however, proceed cautiously and would want to be sure that any new mining regulations were consistent with domestic laws. 'Western mining companies like laws that are drafted with particularity and clarity,' he observed. Western miners were also likely to insist that disputes be settled by international arbitration and not within the Chinese system. This was a concept that was fairly alien to the Chinese. Foreign mining representatives also pressed the Chinese last week on the need to make available larger areas for exploration, but at the same time urged regulations that would oblige exploration companies to surrender prospective areas that were not being exploited, thus ensuring 'turnover'. Other issues that preoccupied the conference, jointly organised by the United Nations, included access to foreign exchange, and guaranteed unlimited rights to export product. The Chinese were also pressed to clarify a tax regime that might apply to new mining ventures</p>

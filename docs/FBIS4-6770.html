			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Is It an Appeal or a Threat?"] </F>   [Text] According to AFP, Thailand has recently proposed a  meeting of ASEAN representatives in Thailand next week to  discuss a conflict with Cambodia which is apparently becoming  ceaselessly more and more serious and which seems to be slipping  toward the edge of a ravine. Thai Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri said Thailand will (?listen to) the ASEAN  representatives' opinions on the (?dispute) at a meeting, which  will prepare for an ASEAN ministerial meeting in (?June), to be  held in Bangkok next week.    Moreover, a report from Bangkok said Prasong on 18 April  appealed to diverse countries or outsiders to stop supplying  armaments and ammunition to Cambodia, saying the military aid  would further inflame the conflict between the Phnom Penh  government and Khmer Rouge rebels. The Thai foreign minister  also told reporters in Bangkok that the aid was not (?an  approach) to solving the problem. He added that various  countries and outsiders appear to be bringing more violence to  Cambodia on top of the existing conflict.    It is wondered whether Pasong Sunsiri's [words indistinct]  statement contradicts the accusation by the Royal Government of  Cambodia [RGC] about Thailand's recent support for the Khmer  Rouge -- support that is contrary to Thailand's pledge made  during Chuan Likphai's visit to Cambodia -- and that Thailand  supports the Cambodian government, not the Khmer Rouge.    According to the 19 April issue of Thailand's THE NATION,  Thai Army Chief General Wimon Wongwanit has issued an indignant  threat to Cambodian leaders, warning them that Thailand can no  longer maintain a good relationship [words indistinct],  referring to Phnom Penh's accusing Thailand of helping Khmer  Rouge leaders.    Wimon added that between human beings, true friendship is  very important, and so it is with international relations.  Without sincerity, there can be no friendship. He further said  that [word indistinct] without Thailand as a true friend,  Cambodia would certainly be in trouble.    Observers wonder why, since the Cambodian Government  occupied  the Khmer Rouge's important bases along the border, Thailand has  never expressed support for the occupation or denounced the  Khmer Rouge. It has only done things, such as the recent  repatriation of 25,000 Cambodian refugees in violation of human  rights, that appear to be opposed to victories by the RGC and  opposed to international organizations. Analysts are anxious  about the conflict, which is becoming more and more serious.    As for the Kingdom of Cambodia, it has always wanted peace  and friendship. It is also grateful to its friends for their  understanding. We wholeheartedly welcome (?Thai) friends, but  not those having a vested interest. The Cambodian people have  never practiced the policy of catching a fish with two hands.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TOLLIVER LIKELY TO START FOR S.D.  </P> <P> Rookie Billy Joe Tolliver will probably be the San Diego Chargers' starting  quarterback instead of Jim McMahon in Sunday's game against the New York Jets,  Coach Dan Henning said.  </P> <P> McMahon's ineffectiveness in recent weeks was not a factor in the decision to  change quarterbacks, Henning said Wednesday, nor was a wrenched knee that  McMahon suffered during the Chargers' 10-6 loss at Indianapolis last weekend.  </P> <P> The move was prompted instead by Henning's desire to give Tolliver another  chance to show what he can do in a game before the season ends.  </P> <P> "At this point, I'd say it's going to be Billy Joe," Henning said of his  quarterback situation. "I told him . . . that if he looks prepared (in  practice), then he would start.  </P> <P> "(McMahon) probably still gives us our best chance to win, but by the same  token I think Billy has come along in the last three or four weeks. We need to  find that out, and if he does well enough in the game, we'll give him a good  dose of it. If he isn't as effective, we'll pull him out and wait for another  time to do it again."  </P> <P> Regardless of whether Tolliver or McMahon starts, Henning said the rookie from  Texas Tech will see some playing time Sunday when the Chargers (4-8) host the  Jets (3-9) at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P></p>

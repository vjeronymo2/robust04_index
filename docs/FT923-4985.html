			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Anglovaal not to develop gold mine THE decision by Anglovaal mining house not to develop the Sun gold prospect has effectively put the seal on the development of any new gold mines in the country until the investment climate improves dramatically. The high hopes Anglovaal held out for the mine, near Bothaville in the Orange Free State, are reflected in the R143m (Dollars 51.60m) it was prepared to spend over 11 years drilling the area. Anglovaal said that while the results of the completed drilling programme were encouraging, 'non-geological factors' - the gold price, exchange rate and political developments - were 'too uncertain to justify major capital expenditure on this valuable asset at present'. Johannesburg Consolidated Investments has still to decide whether to proceed with its South Deep project.</p>

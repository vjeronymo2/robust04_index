			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Toshiba warns of 58% fall in profits TOSHIBA yesterday became the latest Japanese electronics company to issue a sharply lower profits forecast for the current year ending next month, in response to the worsening market for semiconductors, computers and communication equipment. Toshiba said consolidated pre-tax profits would be Y110bn (Pounds 489.9m), 58 per cent below last year, and 44 per cent below a forecast three months ago. Toshiba shares closed down Y27 at Y596 in Tokyo yesterday. Toshiba has suffered from falling semiconductor prices, especially of the 4 megabyte D-Ram chip, and competition in laptop computers in Japan and the US. The company last week announced 150 redundancies at its Irvine, California, computer assembly plant and is abandoning the lower end of the US personal computer market, where it says it cannot offer competitively priced products. In Japan, Toshiba has lost market share to NEC and to Apple Computer, whose sales have been growing strongly. The Toshiba board is expected to cut capital spending next year by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. Capital spending this year is budgeted at Y250bn. Company officials are also deciding whether to cut the research and development budget, which they have avoided in the past. Toshiba is expected to spend Y280bn in the current year on R&amp;D. The company admitted that it had expanded into too many areas in the past decade and said it would attempt to concentrate capital spending and research in strategically important sectors. A cost-cutting programme introduced last April has been strengthened. The company continues to be supported by demand for heavy electrical apparatus and home appliances. More than half Toshiba's sales, however, are in computers, telecommunications and electronic devices. Consolidated sales at the company were expected to rise 3 per cent to Y4,820bn, while after-tax income was forecast to fall 67 per cent to Y40bn. NEC and Fujitsu last week revised profits forecasts downward. Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, said on Wednesday its parent corporation would post a full-year loss for the first time since it was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958.

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> L.A. GETS HALF INCH, FIRST RAIN SINCE THANKSGIVING  </P> <P> The luscious clouds that delivered up almost half an inch of rain to Los  Angeles and several inches of snow to the mountains have moved on, leaving but  a 20% chance of rain for the rest of the day and a windy day Wednesday.  </P> <P> The post-midnight thunder and lightning storm provided the first rain since  Thanksgiving, but it left the region still three inches below normal for the  season -- normal being about 4.5 inches, said a National Weather Service  representative.  </P> <P> "We need a lot more of it," he said.  </P> <P> Snow in the mountains was enough to close schools in the Rim of the World  School District in Running Springs near Lake Arrowhead. Four or five inches of  snow fell there and at Big Bear, according to the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> For the second time in five days, snow chains were required but only on the  roads above 6,500 feet, such as those going into the Big Bear area, said CHP  Officer D. A. Walker. "The holidays are over; we're not getting that much  traffic."  </P> <P> Although lows will be lower tonight -- in the low to mid-40s -- highs will be  higher, reaching well into the 60s, according to the Weather Service.  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Waterglade cuts debt to Bank of America with asset sale WATERGLADE International Holdings has agreed a financial restructuring that involves Bank of America, its largest bank, taking control of the property company's biggest asset. In return for Waterglade's shopping complex in Havant, Hampshire, which has a book value of Pounds 16.2m, Bank of America has extinguished all but Pounds 1.7m of debt. This balance will be paid over a two-year period. Mr David Cunningham, chairman, said the deal was crucial to the rescue. The company 'was heading for the iceberg and now there is a good chance it can be stabilised,' he said. As a result of the deal, the group's debt falls from Pounds 41.49m to Pounds 25.3m. Net assets at the last balance sheet date were Pounds 3.3m and the group yesterday reported an attributable loss of Pounds 765,000 in the six months to September 30. Mr Cunningham said the full market value was not wholly reflected in the books as all the properties had been moved into current assets and were held at cost. Waterglade will now embark upon a capital reorganisation. The chairman said debts with some other banks are still to be tidied up. The company would then provide a platform for the building of stakes in other property companies that are in difficulty. Waterglade's remaining assets include property in London and Wales with a book value of Pounds 27m and rent role currently at Pounds 1.9m. The interim pre-tax deficit was Pounds 954,000, compared with Pounds 3.33m in 1991, and the loss per share worked through at 5.9p (12.6p).</p>

The money is part of the recent settlement of a lawsuit  against Hahn by Pasadena Citizens for Representative Government. The group sued  five years ago after its members were denied permission to gather signatures in  the mall for a voter initiative.  </P> <P> The citizens group will conduct the voter registration drive along with the  Pasadena Foothill Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Foothill  Democratic Club, the Pasadena Area Peace Coordinating Council and ACT.  </P></p>

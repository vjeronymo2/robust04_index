			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Account of report of B.K. Shukhostanov, minister of </F> industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria; place and date  not given: "Industrial Upturn--Not Only an Economic but Also a  Social Problem"]    [Text] As already reported in our paper, there has been a  meeting of leaders of the republic's industrial enterprises. A  report on the results of work in 1993 and the tasks to stabilize  the situation in the present year was delivered by B.K.  Shukhostanov, minister of industry of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria.    He observed that the situation in the republic's industry  was  characterized by the continued decline in production, a  reduction in investment activity, the low solvency of the  enterprises, and difficulties in the sale of the finished  product.    At the same time an analysis shows that the first signs of  an  easing of the crisis situation appeared in the latter half,  although the situation has not been stabilized completely.    Despite the fact that in the mechanical engineering complex  production constituted 96.7 percent of the 1992 level, far from  all enterprises operated at the proper level, and 12 out of the  21 showed a decline in production of more than 10 percent. Some  managers reduced their size considerably, not appreciably  increasing wages or running up enormous bank credit debts here.  These included the Sevkavrentgen, Terekalmaz, the Prokhladnyy  Maintenance Plant, the SKEP, Nalchik Telemechanical Apparatus  Plant, NZPP, PZPP, and others.    A characteristic feature of the decline in production in  this  sector was the reduction in the manufacture of high-technology  and intricate products. Thus the production of instruments and  means of automation declined 37.9 percent, of medical equipment,  28.5 percent, high-voltage apparatus, 19.8 percent, and  electronic equipment products, 54.1 percent.    Particular difficulties were experienced by conversion  enterprises of the defense sectors, of which there are six on  the territory of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which  employ more than 10,000 persons. Conversion programs of  modernization and retooling and renewal of the product list  approved in the appropriate departments and committees of the  Russian Federation and included in the Federal Conversion  Program have been devised for them. Realization of the latter  will make it possible thanks to a change in the production  structure to create capacity for the manufacture of civilian  products and consumer goods worth R5 billion a year in prices of  the first quarter of 1993 and to preserve jobs.    But under the conditions of the strict financial and  resource  limitations the conversion programs are not in practice being  funded and are not being fulfilled. The task of the current year  is to ensure the allocation of credit resources in full and to  reorient these enterprises toward the civilian sector of the  economy at an accelerated pace.    No less disquiet is being aroused by the iron and steel  sector, which constitutes 19.7 percent of the republic's total  industrial production, and the results of the work of the TVMK  are directly reflected in the living conditions and living  standard of the population of Tyrnyauz. The main problem for the  TVMK and GMZ in the year under review remained the limited  nature of the sale of output on account of the high prices,  which exceed domestic and world prices by 25-30 percent, the  insolvency of the consumers, and the unchecked growth of the  price of energy. As a result the works' indebtedness to  suppliers, the treasury, and the banks constituted R10.516  billion, of which for electric power, R7.119 billion.    The president and the government of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria are constantly rendering the utmost support  in the solution of the problems that confront the metallurgical  sector. Thanks to this, the question of the depositing in the  state reserves of the Russian Federation of 750 tonnes of  metallic tungsten was solved, which made it possible to maintain  relatively high production in the past year.    Within the framework of state support for the sector it was  decided to grant the TVMK long-term investment credit for  modernization and the preservation of capacity totaling R1.25  billion and to halve the tariff on energy allocated for its  needs. The leadership of the republic found an opportunity to  purchase and deposit in the state reserves R700 million of  concentrate from the working capital allocated the  Kabbalkkontrakt.    The situation in light industry, which perceives the  severance of business ties with the suppliers of raw material  from CIS countries and the sharp reduction in effective consumer  demand the most, remains difficult.    The decline in production in this sector constituted 31.6  percent. A particularly alarming situation has come about at the  Iskozh Works, the Garment Association, the Nartkalinskiy  Production Combine, and the Kubinskaya Footwear Factory.    It is essential to adopt special measures to halt the  complete disintegration of the republic's light industry and  find an opportunity to resolve its problems not only and not so  much thanks to assistance from the federal authorities but by  reliance mainly on our own powers and the use of intrinsic  reserves and resources.    In conjunction with enterprises of light industry the  ministry drew up and approved last year a program of  intersectoral cooperation based on the Iskozh Works. It provides  for the assimilation of new product types at eight enterprises  of light industry, which, it is forecast, will provide  significant economic benefits and will exclude their dependence  on suppliers from other regions. It is essential subsequently to  continue work in this direction with the involvement of  enterprises of the mechanical engineering complex also.    There is also a need now for the elaboration and  introduction  of a system of a republic (Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria)  government contract for products constituting the consumer  basket, basic necessities, and commodities of a social focus.  This would contribute to the filling of the market with  affordable consumer merchandise and would stabilize industrial  enterprises' relations with trade. Another lever, of which more  efficient use needs to be made, is the privatization as soon as  possible of enterprises of light industry in the form of their  sale at public auction on a competitive basis. And use of the  monies earned for the creation of new jobs and investments in  programs of the structural reorganization of light industry.    A year ago we considered the "weakest points" the decline in  production and the sharp reduction in investments in the  national economy inasmuch as this was jeopardizing the  structural reorganization of the economy and emergence from the  crisis. But with time the accents have begun to shift. An  analysis of the actual processes occurring in the country leads  to the conclusion that it is not the decline in production but  social problems, unemployment primarily, which have become  critical today.    The present year could be worrying in this respect.  According  to preliminary estimates, more than 3,500 persons will be laid  off. This means that it is necessary to devise a set of measures  stimulating tax privileges for the enterprises and  entrepreneurial structures which create new jobs and increase  output.    The wages of the employees of industry of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria remain extremely low. In December they  constituted only R59,329 against an average in the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria as a whole of R84,200, and in the Russian  Federation, of R141,200.    Ministry enterprises continued to experience serious  financial difficulties also. True, R16.626 billion of profit  were obtained. But the enterprises' contribution to the  formation of the republic budget is extremely uneven. The  largest profit was obtained by the Kavkazkabel, the Machinery  Plant, and the Avtozapchast. Nine enterprises are unprofitable,  and their sum total of losses constituted R294.6 million. These  include the SKEP, Tekhnopribor, and TZNVA plants, the Kubinskaya  Footwear Factory, and others.    The level of profitability remains low also. Thus with an  annual production of R1.288 billion Telemekhanika obtained a  profit of only R2 million. This means that the outfit did not  form the necessary accumulation fund and did not participate in  formation of the republic budget.    The shortage of enterprises' own working capital under the  conditions of the wholesale increase in prices and the limited  availability of credit resources has caused a most acute  nonpayments crisis. The extent of customers' arrears past due  for supplied products, jobs performed, and services rendered  owed enterprises of the ministry constituted R10.463 billion. At  the same time, on the other hand, our enterprises' accounts  payable to suppliers constituted R14.365 billion.    A reason for this complication of the financial situation  was  the lack of requirement for individual types of products, as a  result of which remnants thereof at warehouses constituted  R13.862 billion. The problem in this sphere could be eased to a  certain extent by the involvement of the Kabbalkkontrakt in the  sale of the industrial product of enterprises of the republic.  It is essential also to revive the functions of the former state  wholesale depots, which undertook professionally both the  purchase and sale of our commodities.    The new market structure has today become a reality. There  are outfits that have already adapted to its conditions. Their  managers did not wait for spectral assistance or instructions  from above but created multiprofile production and increased the  independence and responsibility of the structural subdivisions.  These include the Machinery Plant, the Kavkazkabel, the  Machine-Tool Plant, the Avtozapchast, and others. They are  increasing production and solving questions of sales and  nonpayments independently.    Many problems should be resolved by privatization. It is  being perceived ambivalently in the republic. Because, most  likely, we have yet to obtain the results we were entitled to  expect. The actual progress of privatization is not exerting a  pronounced influence on production efficiency. It is frequently  of a formal nature and is pursued as an end in itself. The  unjustified appropriation of state property is taking place, the  manageability of the economy is declining, and the privatization  process itself is being discredited. It is sufficient to say  that at check auctions a substantial part of the shares of the  Teleavtomatika and High-Voltage Apparatus plants ended up with  three or four persons who had dubious sources of income and who  had never had any connection with these outfits.    It should be noted that the current privatization program is  geared to the accomplishment of a utopian idea--making all  citizens of Russia subjects of private property with the aid of  vouchers. Whence a whole number of negative consequences. For  this reason it is proposed, without calling in question the need  for privatization, to correct some of its conceptual principles.    In conjunction with enterprises of the republic the Ministry  of Industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria also conducted  a "stock-taking" and review of the program of structural  reorganization of industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria  with a view to concentrating resources in the priority areas.  Today the task is to provide them with real sources of  financing. And these may appear only with the inclusion of our  programs in federal programs such as Conversion, Fuel and  Energy, Equipment for the Agro-Industrial Complex, the Farmer,  Consumer Goods, and so forth. Thirty-two projects have been  devised altogether.    But the structural reorganization of the economy, an  acceleration of scientific and technological progress, and an  increase in enterprises' competitiveness must be organized in  the expectation not only of government support but also on the  basis of the active enlistment of private and joint-stock  companies and joint ventures and their capital in the renewal of  production.    The Government of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria will  support primarily those who can step up their business activity,  normalize their financial situation, and ensure profitable work  under the conditions of the market.    There are opportunities for creating the conditions for an  escape from the crisis in 1994. Sufficient production  engineering, scientific, and personnel potential is preserved as  yet. The actual timeframe and scale of realization of this  potential, however, will largely be determined by organization  and a capacity to tackle the tasks confronting the republic's  industry. They consist of a halt to the general decline in  production. Together with winding down and changing the  production structure of nonviable works it will be necessary,  furthermore, to stabilize the manufacture of products in demand  and create the conditions for the revitalization and development  of promising types of activity shaping the republic's actual  economic potential.    The accomplishment of these tasks will depend to a  considerable extent on the ability of the corps of directors to  resolve under the present difficult conditions the problems  confronting the work force, initiative, and an ability to get  one's bearings under the complex conditions of the market. V.M.  Gukepshev, director of the Nalchik Footwear Factory, called  attention to the fact that an increase in the price of  electricity would complicate even further the situation at the  enterprise, which lacks working capital to purchase materials.  Nor, as before, is their quality satisfactory either, on account  of which our footwear cannot compete with foreign footwear and  is not in demand. These difficulties are typical of light  industry as a whole, and for this reason they worry M.O.  Karmova, director of the Nalchik Leather Notions Factory, also.    A whole number of questions concerning the further  development of instrument making was broached by the following  directors: R.E. Buterus of Kavkazkabel, V.Kh. Khabitov of  Elektronmash, V.F. Tishchenko of the NZPP, and A.Kh. Akhokhov of  Telemekhanika. The latter also voiced a number of criticisms of  the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria.  The proposal of D.A. Miziyev, director of the TVMK, concerning  the creation on the River Baksan of a hydroelectric power  station cascade, which would resolve the problem of the  republic's power supply, was interesting.    Yu.K. Altudov, chairman of the State Property Committee,  familiarized those present with the progress of the  privatization process here. He affirmed that only half of the  enterprises outlined by the program had taken part in check  auctions as yet and that the slowing of the process of  privatization was being reflected both in the psychological  restructuring of the work force and in investment in production.  The far from brilliant situation on the labor market was  portrayed by L.V. Pogrebnyak, minister of labor and employment.  The need for an improvement in the tax and banking systems was  described by Minister of Economics M.N. Tsikanov and V.K.  Sokhov, vice premier of the republic.    The debate was concluded by V.M. Kokov, president of the  Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. He emphasized that the period of  political wrangling was over and that the Constitution of the  Russian Federation had been adopted. We have all seen for  ourselves that the people cannot be fed by slogans, and for this  reason the purpose of our entire activity must shift in the  direction of the economy. And the most acute problem, what is  more, is industrial upturn. A considerable part of the  population of the republic, producing material benefits, but  living from pay packet to pay packet, is employed in it.    Unfortunately, he observed, the speeches of the corps of  directors contained more complaints than actual proposals.  Nonetheless, the situation cannot be considered hopeless. We  have a Ministry of Industry, which, with the support of the  Council of Directors, should be the coordinating body and  intermediary in a solution of our problems in the center.... And  great assertiveness locally should be displayed by the  administration chiefs. They have ceased involving themselves as  of late in questions of production, have lost contact with the  work force, and are unaware of its problems.    But the main complaints were leveled at the enterprise  managers. V.M. Kokov recalled how many demands had been heard  concerning the need for protection against party diktat and the  strict planning framework and for independence and freedom of  action to be granted. Sufficient time has passed, and if some  directors have been unable to reorganize, it is hard to expect  this now. The government is trying to support industry. But the  Bankruptcy Act will be applied in respect to enterprises that  are unable to restore production in the very near future.    Lest they perish one by one, the way out of the critical  situation for native enterprises could be the creation of  industrial and financial groups, which would include those  involved in wood processing, the creation of equipment and cable  products for the oil workers, and so forth. This would make it  possible for them to have their own finances and their own bank  and, consequently, conditions for maneuver and product  replacement, without which hoping for a production upturn is  currently impossible. There are reserves within the republic,  and more initiative and perseverance in their use need to be  displayed. We have approached the critical line, V.M. Kokov  said, but the present year must be a turning point for the  industry of Kabardino-Balkaria.</p>

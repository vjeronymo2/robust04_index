But the government issued a formal comment regretting the U.S.  decision to revive the formidable retaliation clause of the  Omnibus Trade Act in the wake of the successful conclusion of  the multilateral Uruguay Round talks successfully ended and the  set-up of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 for a freer  trade order.    The Foreign Ministry said, "Trade disputes between countries  should be solved through settlement procedures of the WTO rather  than domestic legal procedures of any one nation."    Super 301 is initially targeted at opening Japanese markets  as repeatedly reported after the failure of the U.S-Japan summit  talks last month to rectify the snowballing U.S. trade deficit,  a Foreign Ministry official said.    Japan recorded $60 billion trade surplus with the United  States last year. But to avoid criticism from the world for  retaliation against one specific nation, Mickey Kantor did not  pinpoint Japan in announcing the reinstatement of Super 301.    An official of the Economic Planning Board said this means  that the United States intends to take retaliatory action  against an country using unfair trade practices.    The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. [KOTRA] and the Korea  Foreign  Trade Association [KFTA] made similar comments that the United  States is likely to use the weapon as a means to pressure all  its trading partners recording trade surpluses with the United  States to open their markets wider. A KOTRA official cited  China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.    The United States is also deeply interested in the  telecommunications and financial markets of Korea and protection  of foreign intellectual property rights here. If the United  States obtains what it wants from Japan, it is expected to use  the clause against Southeast Asian nations and Korea, the KFTA  and KOTRA officials said.    Korea has a good relationship with the United States thanks  to balanced trade unlike in the late 1980s, they said. But  Washington has not decreased its pressure, calling for advancing  the market opening timetable in nine fields, including  telecommunications and education, at a third conference of the  Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) last month.    Han Yong-su, director-general at the trade cooperation  bureau  of the Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry said, "Now, we have no  outstanding trade disputes with the United States. We have been  carrying out the market opening program at a fast pace. We will  wait and see how the situation develops." But Super 301 is  different from existing Clause 301 by the act that the  retaliation procedures are simple and negotiations are  comprehensive with each nation involved, not item-by-item or  field-by-field negotiations. A a result, its impact on one  nation is wide, a KFTA official said.    Japan, India and Brazil surrendered to the U.S. threat to  use  Super 301 in 1989 and India again in 1990. To escape from the  naming as a nation for priority negotiation in 1989-90, Korea  opened its farm markets wider and drastically eased regulations  on foreign investment in advance.    Since 1989, Korea has been listed as a priority watch nation  for intellectual property rights and has been forced to  strengthen protection of property rights under Special 301 which  is only applied to that sector.    Some businessmen, on the other hand, forecast that Korea  will  be able to benefit from U.S. pressure on Japan. They claimed  that Korea could advance to Japanese markets amid the high yen  in a short-term view. The United States wants Japan's  automobile and semiconductor markets to open to U.S. exporters.    It is reported that Toyota Motor, a leading Japanese car  maker, plans to purchase $6 billion worth of auto parts from the  Untied States in 1996-97 year as a gesture to ease U.S.  retaliation. But Korea should pay keen attention to probable  damage from across-the-board U.S. pressure rather than  short-term benefits, an observer said.</p>

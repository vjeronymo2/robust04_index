			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Gains via R&amp;D, market share and cost-cuts - Three leading European manufacturers employ very different strategies against their international competitors / Michelin Michelin of France, the world's biggest tyre maker, made it the hard way. In 1960 it was 10th biggest, by 1970 it was number six and by the end of the 1980s it was number one. Michelin's approach had a Japanese ring: aggressive international expansion and concentration on market share. Greenfield investments, followed by the acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich in 1990, have resulted in a 20 per cent share of the world market and a clear lead over Goodyear of the US and Bridgestone of Japan. At the same time, Michelin has invested heavily in quality and in R&amp;D, being the first company to develop and market the radial tyre. Michelin's rise has been far from smooth. The Uniroyal acquisition was completed as the US market collapsed. Last year, the European market did likewise. For several years, the group suffered large losses. But most industry observers believe the worst is over. Michelin's ability to pursue its aggressive and sometimes risky strategy partly reflects its ownership. As a family-controlled group in the continental European mould, it can afford to be less concerned with quarterly earnings and more with dominance in markets and technologies. The benefits are evident in the initially costly but ultimately lucrative development of radial tyres and in the strengths of geographical diversity. But now a different message is emanating from Michelin's headquarters at Clermont-Ferrand. With its market position established and little remaining scope for growth through acquisitions or new capacity, the company is shifting emphasis towards increased efficiency and higher margins. This is to be achieved partly through new, higher value-added products, such as the green tyre, which reduces fuel consumption. The company has also embarked on job cuts which have seen staff numbers fall from 140,000 at the end of 1991 to 125,000. Further reductions are expected from the introduction of its C3m automated and flexible production process.</p>

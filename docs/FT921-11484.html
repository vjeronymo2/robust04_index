			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Sterling Eurobond demand lifts interest in new issues A BROAD range of borrowers, including three UK companies, raised funds in a variety of currencies in the Eurobond market yesterday. Pent-up demand for sterling Eurobonds boosted interest in three new issues. Enterprise Oil launched a Pounds 100m four-year deal via Warburg which performed strongly, meeting surprisingly firm demand from overseas as well as UK investors. Dealers said the deal's reception was enhanced by continental demand for short-dated sterling bonds, as well as by the generally positive performance of previous Enterprise deals. The deal was considered fairly priced to yield 95 basis points above the comparable gilt issue. The proceeds will be used to develop the company's continental shelf assets. A Pounds 100m issue of 11 1/4 per cent bonds by the Guaranteed Export Finance Corporation (GEFCO) via Baring Brothers was added to an existing Pounds 250m deal. The deal, structured as a block trade (without any underwriting group), was considered attractively priced to yield 24 basis points above the three-year gilts, and also benefited from firm demand for short-dated sterling paper. A Pounds 100m eight-year deal for Britannia Building Society via UBS was considered reasonably priced at a spread of 115 basis points above the 9 per cent gilt due 2000, but had to rely mainly on UK institutional demand, due to both the maturity and the borrower. In the Ecu sector, British Gas International launched an Ecu150m offering of five-year bonds due 1997, priced to yield 8.45 per cent, 5 basis points below the yield of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau's five-year deal launched on Wednesday. Logically, KFW, a German state agency without an explicit government guarantee is a stronger credit than British Gas, a public company, albeit a utility, even though both are Triple-A rated. However, dealers reported strong demand from retail investors, many of whom still focus on name more than credit and described placement as smooth. The improvement of swap opportunities in the Ecu sector allowed British Gas to achieve cheaper funding than would have been available in the sterling market. The proceeds of the issue, which will be used to replace short-term borrowings, were swapped into fixed-rate sterling at a level 'well under 10 per cent', according to a British Gas official. British Gas's Dollars 200m five-year deal launched last Friday was also swapped into sterling at just under 10 per cent. The deals have also filled a gap in the maturity spectrum of British Gas's debt profile as the company previously had no debt maturing in 1997. The company may return to the Eurobond market later in the year to finance the repayment of the last Pounds 350m tranche of its government debenture. However, the repayment could be repaid from the company's cash flow. In the French market, the European Investment Bank launched a FFr3bn 10-year deal via Credit Commercial de France, priced to yield 27 basis points above the 10-year French government bond. Strong demand for the issue caused the spread to tighten to 23 basis points, which comforted underwriters who have felt the EIB has been skimping on the yield spread and fees of recent deals. (The deal was syndicated, rather than structured as a block trade, as some recent EIB offerings have been.) In the dollar sector, a Dollars 400m five-year offering for the Inter-American Development Bank via Credit Suisse First Boston got off to a rather slow start, which dealers attributed to lack of enthusiasm for dollar securities. The pricing of the deal was considered reasonable, but not generous, at 28 basis points above the five-year Treasury, but poor buying interest caused the spread to widen by 4 basis points.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Golden Peach Pit: "GoodFellas" led the list of movies, TV shows and  commercials receiving "Golden Pit Awards" for ethnic insults.  </P> <P> The awards, presented n the form of gold spray-painted peach pits, were  presented by William Fugazy, chairman of the National Ethnic Coalition of  Organizations. The parody record "As Kosher as They Wanna Be," by "2 Live Jews"  was singled out for self-denigrating Jewish jokes. The NBC soap opera "Santa  Barbara" was also recognized, and Fox's "In Living Color" was tapped for  crossing "the fine line of comedy with its negative reinforcements of ethnic  stereotypes."

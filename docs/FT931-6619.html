			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Notebook: The lone Texan given group's star treatment IT would go to the head of a lesser mortal. But it is to be hoped that Mr Lloyd Bentsen has been close enough to power for long enough to cope with the plaudits heaped on him and the new US administration in the course of Saturday's Group of Seven meeting. After years in which the US has often appeared like a demanding cuckoo in the nest of international economic co-operation, Mr Bentsen could do no wrong. Arriving in London with the US deficit-reduction package in his briefcase and President Bill Clinton's support for the Uruguay Round trade negotiations in everyone's mind, the courtly 72-year-old Texan was given star treatment by his peers. The other G7 partners were unanimous in complimenting the US measures. 'It's a more serious attempt than anyone might have expected,' said one fellow finance minister of the deficit-cutting plan. 'I never thought they would do so much.' Mr Bentsen himself acknowledged that his warm reception owed as much to the Clinton package as any contribution he made in the talks. But Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had a cautionary tale just in case the reflected glory was going to Mr Bentsen's head. He recalled that Robert Anderson, a US Treasury secretary in the 1950s, always used to say that a finance minister who was popular had failed in his job. No problem there, countered Mr Bentsen; any Texan who raised energy taxes was sure of unpopularity. ***** The blunt refusal of Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, to consider any further fiscal stimulus to revive the Japanese economy was about the nearest the meeting came to sparking a quarrel among the G7. Some observers speculated that the Japanese stand may have reflected continued annoyance about Mr Bentsen's out-of-turn remarks that had prompted a sharp rise in the yen's value against the dollar in the preceding week. Others thought Mr Hayashi's refusal to budge could reflect internal political tensions in Japan's Liberal Democratic party. But some grumpiness would have been understandable, given the Japanese delegation's punishing travel plans. They arrived in London on Saturday morning after flying overnight from Tokyo, only to depart again almost immediately after the meeting. The reason? Not so much workaholism as the difficulties of getting the existing fiscal 1993 budget through parliament. ***** Conspicuous by his absence at the end of the meeting was Mr Horst Kohler, the German Finance Ministry state secretary and chief G7 fixer. He left the meeting early to get back to Bonn for his 50th birthday celebrations. ***** In keeping with the subdued mood of the meeting was the Denbies special reserve wine selected for Saturday's lunch of the main participants. Although the Riesling/Muller-Thurgau produced by Britain's biggest vineyard is described by wine buffs as 'piquant' and 'exceptional', retailing at Pounds 7.85 a bottle it is some way from being among the world's finest. Mr Lamont seems to have got to hear about the wine after Surrey-based Denbies presented a case to Mr John Major a year or so ago. Perhaps Threshers should start promoting it.</p>

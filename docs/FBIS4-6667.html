			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tadae Takubo, Kyorin University professor: </F> "`U.S. Stern Expression Which Abandons Japan'; in special  edition `Fearsome Neighbors'"]    [Text] Buchanan's Exasperation    I think there are many people who have forgotten the name  Patick Buchanan. He is the neoisolationist who in the 1992 U.S.  presidential election fought former President Bush for  nomination as the Republican Party's presidential candidate.  Though a neoisolationist, he is not a lightweight who indulges  in irresponsible flattery of the public. He is a political  commentator who served as a special adviser to [former]  President Nixon and as a presidential adviser to [former]  President Ford and [former] President Reagan, and who sets forth  vigorous arguments in newspapers and on television.    Buchanan wrote an article in the 8 September 1991 edition of  THE WASHINGTON POST about two and a half years ago and argued  that "North Korea, which is openly trying to produce an atomic  bomb is fearsome. But why is Kim Il-song's atomic bomb our  problem, not that of the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, and  Russia?" Since the range of the "Nodong-1" ground-to-ground  missiles that North Korea possesses is 1,000 km, it is  impossible for them to reach Hawaii. Why, in spite of this, must  the United States alone worry about North Korean nuclear  weapons? I feel as though the angry voice of Buchanan is  carried to us that the Japanese must think this has nothing to  do with them.    In the same article Buchanan stated that "The United States  should announce the date on which it will withdraw all U.S.  ground units from the Republic of Korea. Why must young American  men be the first to die in the event that North Korea attacks  across the demilitarized zone?" and "The security treaty with  Japan should be scrapped. If the relatively small countries of  East Asia fear the hegemony of Japan and China and desire the  presence of the U.S. Navy, they must pay the cost."    Most Japanese probably feel strange when they hear this kind  of statement because postwar Japan placed security, which is  considered the first consideration for an ordinary country,  completely in hands of the United States. Therefore, when there  is an emergency on the Korean peninsula, most Japanese look on  as idle spectators or make light of it, thinking that in the end  the United States will probably do something. They firmly  believe that since the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty was concluded  at the request of the United States, the United States would  never broach the subject of scrapping it. And they are convinced  that the reason Japan has been at peace is that it has a "peace  constitution." They have frowned upon persons who say things  contrary to this "common knowledge," thinking them to be hawks  or right wing.    But what would they do if they themselves were U.S.  citizens?  Would they try to shed their blood were there an emergency on  the Korean peninsula? Should Japan face danger, would they  rescue, by a war to the death, selfish Japanese who is carefree  while entrusting the safety of their own country to the United  States? Now that the Cold War is over, I think that what U.S.  citizens really feel are reflected in what Buchanan says.  Buchanan garnered 37 percent of the votes in the New Hampshire  primary that was held on 18 February 1992. President Bush, the  incumbent, got 53 percent. Then Prime Minister Miyazawa was  asked his impression by the press corps and answered: "Somebody  like Buchanan is probably big only in that place (New  Hampshire)." Buchanan heard of this and it made him very angry.  In the end Buchanan did not become the presidential candidate of  the Republican Party, but I think we cannot simply overlook the  isolationist trend or the inward-looking posture that is being  born in the United States.  <H5>  The Isolationist Posture of "Postwar Generation" Clinton </H5>   Then, what kind of posture does the Clinton administration  have? I have observed the past five presidents: Nixon, Ford,  Carter, Reagan, and Bush. It is impossible to unreasonably  classify these administrations in a black or white manner as  having been internationalist or isolationist, or  "outward-looking" or "inward-looking," but I think that what the  Clinton adminstration, which was born against the background of  the end of the Cold War, aims at is very distinctive. First,  Clinton is the first postwar-generation president who does not  know what things were like before World War II. Second, it is  necessary to remember that the reason the administration was  born is found in the rebuilding of the domestic economy. Third,  the cold treatment of Japan. Fourth, the patronage of Russia,  particularly of President Yeltsin personally, to an extent which  can be felt to be abnormal. From this my diagnosis is that the  Clinton administration is clearly an "isolationist"  administration and has begun to lose both the will and the  ability to fulfill the role of policeman throughout the world.  In other words, its orientation is the neoisolationist tendency  which Buchanan advocates, so one can assume that it will do its  utmost to avoid action that will shed the blood of young  American men for the sake of Japan or the Korean peninsula.    While he was the Democratic Party's presidential candidate,  Clinton made a speech at the Los Angeles conference on world  problems on 13 August 1992: "In order to play a firm role in the  new world, the United States must restore its economic  strength." In concrete terms he said that it was encouragement  of investment and strengthening of industry's international  competitiveness. This basic view runs through his inaugural  address, the "comprehensive economic policy" announced on 17  February 1993 after his inauguration, and his State of the Union  Address read before a joint session of Congress on 25 January  1994.    What the president stressed in the State of the Union  Address  was probably a request for the cooperation of Congress  concerning job creation, universal national insurance, welfare  reform, promotion of democracy, anticrime measures, and  revitalization of U.S. communities, and making clear the  attitude of stressing domestic affairs. In the small space which  dealt with foreign affairs, only 10 percent of the entire State  of the Union Address, where he advocated that the United States  recover its leadership and support democratization, nothing  differs from what had been said repeatedly up till now.  <H5>  Japan Does Not Notice "Change of Heart" of the United States </H5>   When one gives it some thought, there is reason for the  Clinton administration to become "isolationist," and something  is the matter with those who say such things as that it were  outrageous for the United States to abandon the position of  world policeman. Are not Japanese the only ones who have not  noticed that the world environment changed completely with the  end of the Cold War?    Professor Samuel Huntington of Harvard University wrote an  article titled "Why Is International Ascendancy Important?" in  the Spring 1993 issue of INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, and heaped  scathing criticism on Japan. In the article he listed existence  of a common enemy, a relationship of common economic interests,  and agreement of values as preconditions for an alliance.  Economic friction between Japan and the United States has  existed for some time, but it had only secondary importance when  the common enemy of the "Soviet threat" existed before one's  eyes. However, now that the "Soviet threat" has diminished, one  should judge that Japan and the United States have entered an  economic war. The common values of democracy and market economy  that Japan and the United States hold will probably not  disappear, but it is difficult to think that they will become  the absolute condition for an alliance. It is necessary for  Japan to become aware quickly that the content of the Japan-U.S.  relationship has changed.    The Clinton administration fixed its eyes on the Asia  Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and in November 1993 held an  APEC summit conference in Seattle. President Clinton, who made a  speech at the conference, declared openly that "The United  States has no intention of continuing to bear the heavy burden  of its military presence and regional leadership in Asia if  denied the benefit of growth which produces stability." If told  frankly that the United States participates in APEC because it  can gain economic benefit, and that without such benefit, it  will not shoulder unnecessary responsibility in the region,  people who cannot free themselves from old stereotyped thinking  will probably be shocked. But if Japan tries standing in the  U.S. position, it is a very natural statement. If I were  President Clinton, I would probably just roar at a country that  was shocked by this: "Don't act like a baby!"    In the Gulf war Japan paid $13 billion and left the  dangerous, dirty, and difficult international job to 29  countries, including the United States. Therefore, in the event  that an emergency should occur on the Korean peninsula, it would  have neither qualification nor grounds for rebuttal if it were  informed by President Clinton that "we will leave the dangerous  work to Japan and will shoulder only a suitable amount of  money." It is merely a matter of Japan being convinced  arbitrarily that, although the Cold War has ended, since the  United States is still the leading country in the world, in an  emergency on the Korean peninsula it has a "duty" or a  "responsibility" to control it.    At the beginning of last January an agreement was reached at  U.S.-North Korean working-level talks. But why didn't the U.S.  side insist strongly on a special inspection of the two  unreported nuclear waste storage facilities in the vicinity of  Yongbyon? The 7 January issue of THE WASHINGTON POST criticized  the negotiation method and rapped "virtual unconditional  surrender of the United States," but from the very beginning the  Clinton administration has been timid, not wanting to make a  dangerous gamble on the Korean peninsula. Notwithstanding that  even the WASHINGTON POST would criticize that "the Clinton  administration's adventurism is dangerous," should it reject  North Korea's demands and plunge into an all-out showdown.  Congressional criticism of the Clinton administration's measures  toward Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti was always "refrain from going  too far."    When President Clinton met with President Yeltsin in  Vancouver in April 1993 he advised the Russian leader, who was  about to visit Japan, "when Japanese say yes it means no."  President Yeltsin wrote this down in a note, but forgot to take  the note with him when he left the site of the meeting. In spite  of the fact that Russia's reform policy line has to be revised  and that the extreme right has risen in Zhirinovskiy, it is said  that President Clinton, who visited Moscow in mid-January, was  in high spirits at a dinner party held at President Yeltsin's  villa and played his saxophone. One wonders would President  Clinton ever perform "Summertime" and "My Funny Valentine" at  Prime Minister Hosokawa's villa in Karuizawa?    Presidential Assistant W. Anthony Lake (in charge of  national  security) announced last September that the United States would  change the Cold War era strategy of "containment," and adopt a  "strategy of expansion" which enlarged the group of nations with  democratic government and market economies. That will do for an  ideal, but does the United States have the strength to support  it? It is uncertain whether public opinion will emerge which  demands that at times the blood of young American men should be  shed in order to advance a "strategy of expansion." If the  "isolationist" posture is continued into the 21st century, the  U.S. military presence in Asia may end. Japan is not even  mentally prepared to deal with that.</p>

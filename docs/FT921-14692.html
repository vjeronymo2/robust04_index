			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Cambodian jails opened to Red Cross THE RIVAL Cambodian factions agreed yesterday to allow new political parties and a free press as the Red Cross gained its first access to political prisoners due to be released, western diplomats said, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. The agreement was reached at a meeting of Cambodian faction officials, representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Phnom Penh. Two diplomats representing the five Security Council permanent members called it an important breakthrough, implementing terms of the peace treaty the Vietnamese-installed government and its guerrilla opponents signed in Paris in October to end 13 years of civil war. 'What has been agreed on freedom of assembly and association and the press means that in principle there is no reason for any more political restrictions as of today,' one said. Mr Jean-Jacques Fresard, chief ICRC delegate in Phnom Penh, told reporters Red Cross officials had visited two prisons in the capital yesterday morning. He said 290 prisoners would be released today. Mr Fresard said 118 political or war prisoners were registered in Phnom Penh's T-3 prison and 182 at Prey Sar jail on the city's outskirts. Fifteen were in military hospitals where some would have to remain until their health improved. Mr Fresard refused to give details of the prisoners' health or to describe conditions in the jails. He said the three guerrilla factions that have opposed the Phnom Penh government, including the radical Khmer Rouge, had invited ICRC teams to their respective zones. The two non-communist guerrilla factions said that as far as they knew no prisoners were held in their zones, but there was evidence to suggest prisoners were held in all three guerrilla zones, the ICRC representative said. All sides agreed to allow new political parties to take part in UN-supervised elections envisioned for 1993 as well as to permit a free press, breaking the rigid government monopoly, the diplomats said. Another accord guarantees the right of the 350,000 Cambodian refugees due to return from Thailand to live where they choose, unless there are practical reasons to prevent it, such as overcrowding.</p>

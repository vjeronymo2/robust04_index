			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shell Espana buys 5% of CLH SHELL ESPANA, the Spanish subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch petroleum group, yesterday took an important step into the domestic energy market when it paid Pta12.5bn (Dollars 96m) for a 5 per cent stake in Compania Logistica de Hidrocardburos (CLH), the nationwide oil distribution network which is owned by the three refining companies that operate in Spain. Shell bought the equity from Repsol, the partially privatised Spanish energy group which reduced its stake in CLH from 66 to 61 per cent. CLH, formerly the Spanish government's petroleum monopoly under its previous name of Campsa, reported after-tax profits of Pta35bn last year for its distribution business. Following the break up of Campsa's monopoly at the begining of this year and the formation of CLH, the distribution network's new shareholders, in addition to Repsol, became Cepsa, a Spanish refiner that is a third owned by Elf-Aquitaine of France, with 25 per cent of the equity, and British Petroleum, which bought the domestic refiner Petromed two years ago and holds 7 per cent of CLH. Shell, which becomes the only CLH shareholder not to own refining installations in Spain, has by its acquisition illustrated a short-cut route into the domestic market. Repsol said there were in principle no objections to further reductions of its CLH equity. Repsol's sale to Shell will realise the Spanish energy group capital gains of between Pta8bn-Pta9bn.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Slovenia wears an air of prosperity on road to reform: Elections are unlikely to mean a change of economic policy, although social problems are pressing WELL-GROOMED gardens and tidy houses dot the picturesque countryside giving the impression of prosperity in Slovenia, sandwiched between the Alps and the Adriatic. Ljubljana, the capital, is gripped by the sense of moving forward and has left the war-torn Yugoslavia behind. While Slovene politicians vie to form a coalition after parliamentary elections, economists are confident the new government will not stray from reforms which have made the tiny republic the success story of former Yugoslavia. Mr Mitja Gaspari, the finance minister, says economic policy will not hinge on the 'colours' of the new coalition. 'Any government will be faced with the same problems and will implement the programme of economic reforms.' In last Sunday's elections, ultra-nationalists captured 10 per cent of the vote, accusing Bosnian and other 'foreigners' of taking Slovene jobs. As enterprises are restructured, 30,000 workers are expected to be sacked next year, prompting politicians to consider a social safety net, including retraining programmes and cash grants to stimulate hiring. The cost of independence has been high, but Slovenes agree it was worth it. After a 10-day war in June, 1991, the republic won independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.  Slovenia was spared the devastation of neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Joze Mencinger, a noted Slovene economist, said: 'All the warnings were ignored about the economic cost. Now, after a year-and-a-half in light of all the developments in the rest of Yugoslavia it was worth it to become independent.' He believes the situation is good given the external shocks. After the collapse of the Yugoslav federation, Slovenia moved quickly to bolster trade with other European countries. Germany, Italy France and Austria account for 70 per cent of Slovene exports. Slovenia has applied for, and shortly expects to be given, membership of the International Monetary Fund. Programmes for the improvement of telecommunications, rails and roads are under discussion with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The upsurge in foreign trade helped Slovenia accumulate Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 780m) in foreign currency reserves. The Slovene tolar, introduced last October, has remained stable. Despite the bright spots, Mr Mencinger warns: 'We are in the middle of a depression . . . we lost more than 50 per cent of the so-called foreign market.' But he believes that Slovenia may have 'reached the bottom of the cycle'. Hit by the loss of the exports to the Yugoslav republics, industrial output dropped by 10 per cent in 1991. Unemployment is at 11.5 per cent. Strict monetary and fiscal control reduced the rate of inflation to 2.5 per cent last month from 18 per cent in the same period of 1991. Gross domestic product declined by 9 per cent in 1991 to about Dollars 12bn. Few businessmen or economists hold out hope of burgeoning trade with the former Yugoslav republics. 'We are faced with completely destroyed economies which I don't think can recover within the next decade. They may be in an even worse position than after the Second World War,' says Mr Mencinger. Some 1,216 enterprises were loss-makers accounting for 12 per cent of the GDP. A restructuring programme for 16 of the biggest losers, in the steel, power and railway industries, is expected to start in the spring.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (15): Focus on investors' behaviour / A look at corporate governance after the Cadbury report THE DEBATE on the Cadbury report on corporate governance has tended to focus primarily on the role of directors. Yet institutional investors are required by Cadbury to play a key part in ensuring companies' compliance with the Code of Practice that lies at the heart of the report. That role has been strongly supported by the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, which represents the main groups of institutional investors; and most institutions have welcomed those aspects of the report that have already led to increased disclosure and an improved framework of accountability in advance of the recommended deadline. The principle underlying the Cadbury committee's recommendations for shareholders is that institutional investors collectively own a majority of shares in listed companies and should therefore accept the responsibilities of ownership. In practical terms, that boils down to: A regular dialogue with senior executives on strategy, performance, board membership and quality of management; Positive use of voting rights, unless there is good reason not to use them; and Taking a positive interest in the composition of boards, to ensure proper checks and balances, and the appointment of a core of independent non-executive directors. Since the committee regards voting rights as an important asset, and a vital link in the chain of accountability from management to shareholders, it also recommends that institutional investors should disclose their policies on the use of voting rights. Much of this constitutes a definition of current best practice. But the voting requirement falls into a different category. A survey by the National Association of Pension Funds showed not so long ago that four out of five pension funds did not exercise their voting rights as a matter of course. And many fund managers have complained about the administrative burden of additional paper work that the Cadbury injunction implies. Such complaints may well be misguided. For according to pensions specialist John Quarrell at solicitors Nabarro Nathanson, pension fund trustees already have a legal obligation to exercise votes. Nor, it seems, can discretionary fund managers escape that responsibility. Customer service agreements under the Financial Services Act, says Mr Quarrell, create a relationship that is, in most cases, that of a quasi trustee or constructive professional trustee. 'In my view,' he says, 'investment managers with discretionary management must exercise voting duties and interest in the way the companies they invest in are managed.' This implies that Cadbury may be asking for no more than what is already required under trust law. But because the law takes materiality into account, discretionary fund managers can find themselves under a greater legal obligation than in-house managers. This is because their fiduciary responsibilities are measured not by the percentage stake held by the individual client, but by the aggregate stake of all the clients in an individual company. A handful of investors, including a number of local authority pension funds, regard the exercise of all votes in relation to all their shareholding as an important matter of principle. Others, including some leading City fund management groups, argue that an active approach to voting responsibilities is nonetheless compatible with a cut-off point. At Fleming Investment Management, for example, votes are exercised for companies capitalised at less than Pounds 1bn where Fleming holds 1 per cent or more of the capital; with capitalisations of more than Pounds 1bn, it votes on stakes of half a per cent or more. But an active stance is easier for those, like Fleming, that have a sizeable research department to carry out the analysis that is required for the responsible exercise of the vote. The practicalities of exercising a vote where trustees delegate day-to-day investment decisions to an external fund manager, but retain control over voting, can be complex. If the shares are held in a pooled nominee account, instead of the fund's own name, the fund manager usually receives only one set of proxy material. Obtaining additional material can be a tortuous business, severely squeezing the timetable for the exercise of voting rights. The answer is to establish a segregated account. One of the less publicised reasons that so many external fund managers have preferred not to exercise their votes in the past is that they fear the consequences for their business of being seen to be active in disciplining company boards. While fund managers may formally be paid for their services by the pension fund, a majority of trustee boards are dominated by representatives of company management. It is assumed, probably rightly, that managers have little enthusiasm for tougher accountability exercised by fund managers in the City. Over a long period, British institutional investors have played a part in securing changes in the boardroom, usually through deliberations with the non-executive directors behind closed doors. Few of them are keen on those bits of the Cadbury report which argue for a more active use of the annual general meeting, for example, to question the chairman of the remuneration committee over directors' pay. Nor would it be easy in Britain to conduct the aggressive lobbying and proxy battles that occur in the US. The threshold for proposing resolutions at AGMs is simply too high. Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (PIRC), which runs a corporate governance and proxy voting service for UK pension funds with assets of Pounds 14bn, argued in its submission to Cadbury that the threshold for proposing a resolution at an AGM should be reduced and that timetables for meetings should be more accommodating, so that resolutions can be put and circulated. Cadbury took the point. In its final draft the committee suggested that a successor body should look into the issue. But there are signs that a more active approach by shareholders to corporate governance issues is beginning to have an impact. Anne Simpson, joint managing director of PIRC, believes that the PIRC campaign against company articles of association that insulate executive directors from the need for regular re-election played a part in decisions by British Petroleum, TSB and Commercial Union to amend their articles. One way or another, the Cadbury report has put its mark on institutional investment behaviour.</p>

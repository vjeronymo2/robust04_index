			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, for a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group), information may be available (independent of the requirements of this rule) which may cause EPA to be concerned about potential health effects related to an endpoint not specifically addressed in Tier 2. In such an instance, the alternative Tier 2 provision allows EPA to require additional studies targeted to the identified area of concern, even though these studies are not normally included in Tier 2. While the standard structure of this rule also allows EPA to prescribe the additional tests under Tier 3, the alternative Tier 2 provision enables EPA to prescribe and receive the desired data earlier in the process. This flexibility is particularly important given that this final rule allows up to six years for Tier 2 submittal. When the additional testing can be coordinated with the standard Tier 2 testing program, the alternative Tier 2 provision will also save costs relative to conducting the additional tests at a separate point in time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, independent of the information to be submitted under this rule for a particular F/FA product (or group), EPA may identify a potentially significant public health risk related to a Tier 2 endpoint, such that EPA knows that more definitive testing will be required for this endpoint than is ordinarily required under Tier 2. Again, EPA could require such testing under Tier 3 after the evaluation of Tier 2. However, the alternative Tier 2 provision can facilitate earlier and potentially more efficient acquisition of the required data. If appropriate to the case at hand, EPA would substitute the more definitive endpoint test for the standard Tier 2 test (with appropriate deadline adjustment). In such a case, EPA's authority to waive the requirement to provide the respective Tier 2 test derives from its authority in section 211(e) to provide exemptions from testing when such testing would be duplicative. In this example, because the substituted test would address the endpoint more rigorously than the standard Tier 2 assessment, it would be duplicative to require both evaluations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, EPA may identify concerns about the effects of F/FA emissions involving different engine and/or emission control technologies than those ordinarily required for generating the emissions tested in Tier 2. For example, biological testing using catalyzed instead of non-catalyzed emissions might be required if emission species of concern are present in the catalyzed exhaust of a fuel or additive that are not represented in the untreated exhaust. <FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>  In this case, EPA could prescribe a Tier 2 program using catalyzed instead of non-catalyzed emissions under the alternative Tier 2 provision. Otherwise, the manufacturer of this product would likely be required to conduct a second series of biological tests with catalyzed emissions, under Tier 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As described in Section VI.A, the use of non-catalyzed emissions are normally required in the Tier 2 toxicology tests. Under Tier 1, however both catalyzed and non-catalyzed emissions are required to be characterized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the alternative Tier 2 provision will give EPA the flexibility, when indicated, to prescribe additional tests to be performed along with the standard Tier 2 program, to substitute different tests, and/or to modify the underlying vehicle/engine specifications for Tier 2. When EPA exercises its authority under this special provision, it will allow an appropriate time for completion of the prescribed alternative tests. EPA may also use the alternative Tier 2 authority to waive certain Tier 2 endpoint evaluations (generally on occasions when additional and/or more rigorous tests are being required for other Tier 2 endpoints). However, Tier 2 endpoint tests will not be waived in the absence of adequate information or requirements for more rigorous testing of the endpoint(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to exercise this special authority only in exceptional cases. When EPA decides to use the alternative Tier 2 provision, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified mail letter of the specific modifications in lieu of the standard Tier 2 program, along with a schedule for compliance and submittal of test results. The manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) will have 60 days to comment on the prescribed alternative Tier 2 testing program and timing requirements. If the responsible manufacturer does not provide any comments, EPA will assume that the manufacturer has consented in full with the prescribed testing regimen. EPA will publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to inform the public of its intent to require alternative testing for a particular F/FA manufacturer and that a copy of the letter to the manufacturer is available in the public record of this rule for review and comment. Additional correspondence between EPA and the responsible manufacturer regarding alternative testing requirements will also be placed in the public record. After receipt and review of all comments received (or, if no comments are received), EPA will publish a notice of final action on the proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed to notify manufacturers of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements within 18 months of promulgation of the final rule (for registered F/FAs) or within 18 months of EPA's receipt of intent to register (for currently unregistered F/FAs). Comments received from the industry indicated that this notification period was too long relative to the proposed three year deadline for submittal of Tier 2 results. However, EPA believes the proposed notification period is reasonable, given that this final rule allows manufacturers up to six years for submittal of Tier 2 results. Furthermore, EPA believes that restricting the time period for exercising the alternative Tier 2 authority is unnecessary and disadvantageous to the public interest as well as the regulated industry, since this provision establishes a mechanism to provide needed data on a timely basis and to eliminate unnecessary screening studies when substitute tests will be required. Therefore, while EPA will endeavor to notify manufacturers of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements within 18 months, this final rule permits EPA to notify manufacturers of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements at any time prior to EPA's receipt of Tier 2 data. If a manufacturer receiving such notification has already begun the standard Tier 2 toxicology testing, then EPA will refrain from requiring the testing; however, in such cases, the manufacturer is required to submit the results of the standard Tier 2 tests within one year of the date when testing began. In other cases, EPA will consider the potential costs, burdens, and timing factors in making its final decisions on alternative Tier 2 requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

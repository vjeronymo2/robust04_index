			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Flying into thin air as debt rises: The troubled leasing group GPA Group's recent failure to raise Dollars 752m (Pounds 485m) from the sale of bonds backed by 18 aircraft leases triggered the current talks with its banks over rescheduling its borrowing arrangements. The aborted securitisation of aircraft leases has unravelled the financial strategy that the group put together with its shareholders, lenders and aircraft suppliers in the aftermath of its shelved Dollars 800m flotation in June. Its debt has risen significantly since it issued its prospectus for its failed flotation when it had borrowings of more than Dollars 3bn. They have now risen to around Dollars 5bn. While GPA appears able to pay its interest on its debt for the foreseeable future, an analysis of its accounts shows it may face difficulties in paying back principal on the debt from cash flow. The group reported Dollars 285m in net cash flow from leases - after the deduction of interest - in 1992. In other words, these were the funds generated last year to meet other obligations, such as debt repayment. GPA's latest accounts says that Dollars 451m comes up for repayment in the current year, which ends on March 31 1993, and that a further Dollars 654m is due in the following year. It will have difficulty making these payments, unless there is a sharp increase in net cash flow from leases, which the company says is unlikely. The securitisation of aircraft leases would, however, have helped in making these debt payments. It would also have boosted shareholders' confidence and therefore increased the chances of the company raising a further Dollars 350m from a preference share issue. But this issue has now been shelved, and with it the group's hopes of a Luxembourg public listing. Its lending banks - which include National Westminster, Citicorp of the US and 26 Japanese banks - are aware that in the absence of new liquidity, either from the securitisation of aircraft or from tapping existing shareholders for new funds, the group will need to reschedule some of its debt payments for 1993. A further problem facing the group is that it has signed contracts with aircraft manufacturers to buy 308 aircraft by the year 2000 at a cost of Dollars 11.9bn and it has the option to buy a further 200 for Dollars 9.1bn. These orders represent 48 per cent of all orders and options placed by aircraft leasing companies. The Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), owned since 1990 by the American insurer AIG, is second with 24 per cent. GPA recently persuaded the manufacturers to defer delivery of Dollars 5bn of these aircraft. However, this agreement was conditional on the success of the preference share issue. That tentative agreement will now have to be renegotiated. GPA has paid Dollars 954.1m in pre-delivery payments, with Boeing holding 37 per cent of the payments, Airbus 29 per cent and McDonnell Douglas 26 per cent. Under the current contracts, GPA is committed to spend Dollars 4.7bn by the end of 1993 on the purchase of 146 aircraft. A report by the Wall Street firm MJ Whitman, which specialises in debt trading, says that banks may be reluctant to provide the funds to meet these commitments. The report, called GPA Group PLC: Flying in Thin Air, says: 'Barring a radical change in the global aviation market, we believe GPA will have great difficulty placing most of these new planes (on leases with airlines) in advance of the order dates, yet we doubt their lenders will allow access to credit without leases being in place.' However, Dr Onno Ruding, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which is one of GPA's lenders, said: 'The role of a specialised intermediary in the aviation business . . . remains crucial. There will remain a major need for companies such as GPA. I think the parties involved are aware of it, particularly the manufacturers. I don't have to explain it to them . . . There should be co-operation between suppliers and banks.' GPA's future will be decided by whether there is co-operation between these manufacturers and banks in any restructuring of its finances. But given that there are competing manufacturers and 73 banks - plus other creditors - reaching agreement will not be easy.  ----------------------------------------- GPA MAIN DEBT REPAYMENTS  -----------------------------------------                   Dollars m  ----------------------------------------- 1993                    451 1994                    654 1995                    404 1996                    151 1997                  1,343 After 1997            1,159  ----------------------------------------- Years ending March 31  -----------------------------------------</p>

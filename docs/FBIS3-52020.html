			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 26 Jan (AFP) --  The Coordinating Board of Nongovernment Human Rights  Organizations [Conpaz] today reported that the decomposed bodies  of two young men were discovered on Monday, following their 6  January arrest by police in Las Margaritas Municipality.    In a statement to the media last night, Conpaz member Roger  Maldonado confirmed the bodies of Jorge Solis, 21, and Eduardo  Gomez, 22, were found "in an advanced stage of decomposition"  near a rural road in Las Margaritas.    Citing eyewitness reports, Maldonado said the young men had  been arrested by policemen, transferred to a local jail, and  "moved that same day by Mexican Army soldiers" to another town.  Their corpses, which had been "mutilated" by buzzards, showed  "numerous knife wounds on different parts of the bodies,"  according to Maldonado.    For the past two weeks, international organizations have  charged the Mexican Army with alleged human rights violations  and "extreme abuse" against prisoners. These accusations have  been denied by the Defense Ministry.    Meanwhile, amid expectations of a possible start to  negotiations between the government and the guerrilla forces,  the capital's news media on Wednesday "urged" political and  social reconciliation in southern Mexico. Some 26 days after  the rebellion broke out in Chiapas, the media is viewing as  "positive" the rebels' offer to negotiate a series of demands,  as well as President Carlos Salinas' promise to seek a solution  to the crisis "through dialogue, reason, and harmony."    "The most urgent matter is to work toward reconciliation,"  it  was stated in an editorial in the progovernment morning  newspaper EL MATUTINO. The independent newspaper LA JORNADA  asked both parties to "take action" by way of "specific  decisions that will lead to a dialogue for which the entire  nation is waiting and hoping."    In communiques that were released Tuesday, the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN) proposed a "public dialogue"  with the government based on an agenda that includes its  political, social, and economic demands. "Peace Commissioner"  Manuel Camacho Solis replied he would announce on Thursday a  "detailed proposal" to carry out "a serious, honest, and  responsible dialogue" with those who rebelled on 1 January.  Moreover, Salinas made a quick trip on 25 January to Tuxla  Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas, where peasants and Indians  demanded food and clothing, medical attention, and support for  the reconstruction of areas affected by military clashes.    All of these facts, which have been interpreted by the media  as "encouraging signs" of rapprochement, improve upon last  week's situation in which the possible beginning of a political  negotiation was far from certain. "The EZLN destroyed the  filigree President Salinas had constructed around himself during  his five years in office," and it has "compelled the regime to  take stock of its situation," wrote EL FINANCIERO columnist  Raymundo Riva Palacios.    During his visit to Chiapas, Salinas promised  representatives  of 280 Indian organizations he would help them "promote peace,  development, and justice," adding that the government "favored a  project to improve the people's life."</p>

M.: "Violation of the Will of the People"] </F>   [Text] Knin -- "The SDS [the Serbian Democratic Party] of  Krajina was the winner at the elections that have just ended,"  is stated at the beginning of a statement for the public, signed  by Drago Kovacevic, chief of the party's electoral headquarters.  This conclusion is supported by the fact that the SDS of  Krajina won the greatest number of deputies in the future  republican parliament and an absolute majority in 14 communes,  while Dr. Milan Babic won at the presidential elections.  "Through manipulation by the Republican Electoral Commission,  Babic's victory has been quashed by enlarging the electoral body  for 4 percent of invalid ballots, which is without precedent in  the world."    "The Republican Electoral Commission, which consists of  seven  judges of the highest Krajina courts, in a so far unprecedented  manner, usurped the right to alter laws, although this is an  exclusive prerogative of the Assembly of the republic of Serbian  Krajina, thus violating the legal system and the institutions."    Within the legally prescribed deadline, the SDS of Krajina  has sent a request for protection of legality to the  constitutional court of the republic of Serbian Krajina. "A  decision to hold the second round of presidential elections on  23 January 1994 and not on 9 January 1993, proceeding from the  article 6A of the Law on Presidential Elections, constitutes the  height of violation of legality by the Republican Electoral  Commission. The SDS of Krajina, as a party that strictly  observes democratic procedure has demanded protection of  legality from the constitutional court of the republic of  Serbian Krajina in a belief that the constitutional court will  act in accordance with its authorities and put an end to the  arbitrariness of the Republican Electoral Commission and the  current authorities in the republic of Serbian Krajina.</p>

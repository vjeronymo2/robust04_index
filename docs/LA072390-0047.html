			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO WOMEN TAKE LIVES BY SETTING SELVES AFIRE  </P> <P> A woman who set herself afire in a Highland Park street early Saturday morning  died Sunday of massive burns, authorities said.  </P> <P> Only hours after the incident that led to the death of Louisa Jiminez, a  Tujunga woman killed herself when she torched her car on a mountain road and  climbed inside.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said Rubie S. Poublane, 26, died  shortly after she set her car ablaze on the side of a road in the Angeles  National Forest at about 11 a.m. Saturday, and then sat inside the burning  vehicle.  </P> <P> Although no suicide note was discovered, Poublane was apparently distraught  over an illness and family troubles, Deputy Rafael Estrada said.  </P> <P> Jiminez, 35, doused herself with a flammable liquid and set herself ablaze in  the street in front of her Highland Park home, Los Angeles Police Sgt. John  Johnston said.  </P> <P> Neighbors extinguished the flames with water from a garden hose, although  Jiminez pleaded for them to leave her alone. She was taken to Huntington  Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, suffering third-degree burns over 90% of her  body.  </P> <P> Jimenez -- the mother of a 2-year-old boy and two girls, 1 and 4 -- died at  3:46 p.m. Sunday, said Suzanne Schimpeler, the hospital's administrative  director.  </P> <P> On Friday night, Jiminez had told her husband, Jose, that she was despondent  over the family's living conditions, Johnston said.  </P> <P> "She said she was sick of the cockroaches and her dirty house," the sergeant  said. "She had asked her husband to set her on fire to purify her. He refused  and tried to calm her down. When they went to bed he thought it was over."  </P> <P> About 6 a.m., Johnston said, Jiminez awoke, went outside and set herself on  fire.  </P> <P> Teresa Manzo, a neighbor who was gardening, initially mistook the woman's body  for a pile of burning trash. When Manzo ran closer to investigate the fire, she  saw it was her neighbor.  </P> <P> Manzo alerted another neighbor, then ran home and filled a container with water  to pour on the body.  </P> <P> "(Jiminez) looked up at us and, in a hoarse whisper, said, 'No water, no  water,' " recalled Manzo.  </P> <P> As neighbors doused Jiminez, Jose awoke to the commotion in the street. When he  stepped out of the house, he saw his wife. Neighbors said he stood in the  street with a glazed look, crying his wife's name and asking, "What have you  done?"  </P> <P> "It's unusual to have something like this, where two people try to kill  themselves by fire on the same day," Estrada said. "There are a lot of ways to  commit suicide, but setting yourself on fire . . . well, that's not something  we see everyday."  </P></p>

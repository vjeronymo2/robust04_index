			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Danske set to take Baltica Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, is poised to take control of Baltica, the country's largest insurance company, following the failure of the bank and Goldman Sachs, the international investment bank, to find an alternative buyer. Danske Bank already has a 32 per cent stake in Baltica and yesterday announced it has been given an option to acquire a further 23 per cent, currently owned by Gefion. Until last year Gefion was the parent company to Baltica operating as Baltica Holding. Danske said that the intended sale of Baltica had been stopped following a judgment by the Danish Supreme Court late last year. The judgment appears to mean that Baltica cannot draw a dividend from its life assurance and pension savings arm, Danica.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Scottish Tories in fourth place Scottish Conservatives were yesterday gloomily contemplating the fact that Scottish politics seem to afford them almost infinite space to drop into, after they finished in fourth place in the regional council elections in terms of seats. By contrast the Scottish National party, in second place, was celebrating its best local election result, getting near the 30 per cent share of the vote at which it could make big gains in a general election. The Liberal Democrats in third place also claimed their greatest success. Labour, easily the biggest party, was well content. The Scottish Conservatives had not entered the regional elections with high ambitions, controlling none of the nine regions, but they at least hoped to hold on to the 52 seats they won in 1990. In the event, they lost about 20 seats. They performed especially badly in Lothian, a region they controlled in the early 1980s, losing seven seats and ending with only five. Their share of the vote dropped from 19 per cent to 14 per cent, exactly mirroring a pre-election opinion poll. Yesterday Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, claimed that many Tory supporters had stayed at home and said the party's Scottish performance was similar to that in England and Wales, reflecting general discontent with the government. The result is particularly painful because the party meets in Inverness next week for its annual conference, which closes on Friday with a speech by Mr John Major. Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, yesterday called his party the big winner of the elections. It won a record 27 per cent of the vote, doubled its number of seats to 73; came within one seat of taking control from Labour of Tayside region; and became the second-biggest party in Grampian after the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats won 61 seats, a net gain of 20, gaining seats from all the other parties and taking 11 per cent of the vote. Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the results were 'easily the best' his party had had in Scotland. Labour lost about five seats but still has more than all the other parties combined. It took 42 per cent of the vote and its grip on Strathclyde, Lothian, Fife and Central regions remains impregnable. The outcome of the elections in northern England and the west Midlands, though poor for the Tories, did not match the disaster in Scotland. In Cumbria Labour wrested control from them of Barrow-in-Furness, and the Liberal Democrats won enough seats in South Lakeland to make them the biggest party on the council for the first time since its creation in 1974. The west Midlands saw Conservative hopes thwarted in Birmingham, Dudley, Solihull, Walsall, Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham and Stratford-on-Avon where they either felt their grip loosened or failed to win. Only in Wolverhampton was there a decisive move with Labour regaining control after a Conservative-Liberal Democrat interregnum.</p>

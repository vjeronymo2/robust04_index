			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Falstaff - Theatre Royal, Glasgow Falstaff is one of the supreme comedies about the relations between men and women - about the capacity for self-delusion of the former (at almost all ages) and the clear-eyed wisdom and grace of the latter. Ian Judge's dreadful new Verdi production for Scottish Opera (shared with Bremen, where it was first shown) is about costume and setting, and the schoolboyish japes that can be had with ringing the changes on both. Mr Judge is a producer who always puts on an ingenious, fast-moving show; sometimes, though, his Bright Ideas for updating are insufficiently followed through (remember the ENO Cav-Pag set in the Lawrentian coalfields?), and then the feats of ingenuity become strained and tiresome in the extreme. This super-English 1920s Falstaff, designed by Mark Thompson, is set in a Thames Valley hotel, and dressed in tweeds, tartans, plus-fours and other Mapp-and-Lucia finery (gosh how we roared at Falstaff's yellow top hat and cape]), with the odd ruff and full-petticoated Elizabethan gown thrown in to provide an element of fashionable time-travelling. Maids scurry about with hotel linen, waiters with glasses of sherry; Robin the page is a fat, bespectacled Bunter. The weakness of all this, and much much else, is not intrinsic (after all, David Pountney's semi-updated ENO Falstaff is tough, peculiar, and full of interest). What appears to be the problem is that the producer's ambitions confined themselves to having jolly larks with equivalent-finding. The result is that almost all of opera - its enchanted knots of conspiracy, its blissful moments of concord, its brief outpourings of pain and anger, even violence - plays like a particularly disheartening brand of whoops-a-daisy farce. The staging trades shamelessly on our recollections of a certain kind of English television comedy. There is no threat of real sexuality in Gordon Sandison's Falstaff, a white-haired old party clearly more interested in his grub than anything else - he goes to the midnight revels with Thermos and tuckbox in hand. The Ford monologue, perhaps the nearest the opera comes to tragedy, is enacted in terms of slapstick, of bumping into tables and knocking over chairs (and vocally Steven Page is ill-cast, tight-throated and dry-toned). The final scene is a sort of decorous fancy-dress party on the patio, and at the end of the fugue everyone dons a red nose: so much for Verdi's pessimistic wit and wisdom. The superficiality of the production is breathtaking, overwhelming: as an immature response to an adult comedy I'm hard pressed to recall its equal. It doesn't help that on Tuesday John Mauceri's conducting lumbered along so much of the way. Mr Mauceri can be a vital, stylish Verdian; here he seems to be aiming more at conducting a semi-animated Falstaff lecture than a theatrical event. His tempos are moderate (fine), his rhythms lifeless; the readiness to broaden the phrases with allargando and rubato (also fine in principle) pays no heed to the in some cases limited vocal capacities of the singers on stage - and, since on this occasion so much untidy ensemble was in evidence, the overall effect was of undersinging and uneasy plod. There are good elements in the cast, here wasted. One would be particularly glad to encounter Sarah Walker (Quickly), Fiona Kimm (Meg), Anthony Mee (Dr Caius), and David Gwynne (Bardolph) in another small-house Falstaff; Maria Prosperi, a young Italian Alice with a plump, smiling charm and a voice of lustre and sparkle, is a real find. The young lovers, Susannah Waters and John Mark Ainsley (who shows that a really good Mozart tenor will always do well by Fenton's music), are 'English' in the best way - they are, indeed, the show's saving grace. Mr Sandison, an able character baritone, seems on this showing right out of his league in Verdi. But one says 'seems': when one of the great roles of opera has been presented in such a trivialised reduction, who can tell for sure?</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUST A PAYCHECK;  </P> <P> STUDENTS CAN PICK AMONG SEASONAL JOBS IN AREA WITH A 3% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE  </P> <P> Before Stanford University student Janice Cobolt can leave on her trip to  Africa this summer, she must put in one more week behind the counter of a Costa  Mesa clothing store.  </P> <P> Then, the 20-year-old figures, she will have the $2,500 needed for the flight  to Kenya, which she wants to visit for her research paper in next semester's  Third World history course.  </P> <P> Cobolt of La Mirada is among hundreds of high school and college students  working this summer in Orange County at a variety jobs for a variety of  reasons.  </P> <P> Some hope to make a dent in next year's school expenses, some want the  experience and some simply enjoy working.  </P> <P> And in a county where the unemployment is just over 3% -- the third-lowest  county rate in the nation -- there is no shortage of opportunity for those who  choose to sling hamburgers, punch computers or move couches rather than trek to  the beach or mall.  </P> <P> "I usually work doing something I enjoy during the summer to give myself a  break from the grind of school," Cobolt said. "Working with kids or  volunteering for the Red Cross are preferences. But this year I had a goal in  mind and knew I couldn't accomplish it without making the money to get it  done."  </P> <P> Cobolt said finding jobs related to her history major is next to impossible, so  she opted for what she called the easiest market to enter: retail.  </P> <P> "If all else fails, you know you can get a job selling something," Cobolt said.  "There is always something to sell and someone to buy it. I am just happy I  didn't end up at McDonalds."  </P> <P> But Diane Hertz, a cashier at Burger King in Anaheim this summer, figures that  a paycheck is a paycheck.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter if I like what I am doing; I am making money," said Hertz, a  recent high school graduate who plans to enter San Diego State University in  the fall.  </P> <P> "Sure, it would have been nice to work in an air-conditioned office where I  could wear heels and dresses, but the bottom line was I needed a job fast, and  money is money no matter where you spend it."  </P> <P> Richard Holden, a sophomore majoring in mathematics at Cal State Long Beach,  hopes to make enough this summer working as an assistant foreman at a  construction site in Santa Ana to avoid working during the school year.  </P> <P> "I worked full time last year and took 18 credit hours," Holden said. "It was  self-declared murder, and my grades showed it. So despite a compact disc every  now and then, this money is for fees and books next year."  </P> <P> Another student who has found summer work is Kevin Allmendinger, 24, of Yorba  Linda, who is hauling furniture for the Starving Students Moving Co. in Orange  County.  </P> <P> "I enjoy working for the moving company because there is no one looking over my  shoulder. I'm not restricted to the office," said Allmendinger, a second-year  communications major at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Allmendinger's boss, Tharnwell John Pool, said many students "come back from  year to year and are usually good workers, but we do have a problem with  dependability at times. A lot of them don't feel this is what they will be  doing for the rest of their lives, so they don't always take it seriously and  often don't come in, particularly on weekends, which is our roughest period."  </P> <P> Still, county employers are hungry for summer student help, said John Haesler,  vice president of Temp Associates.  </P> <P> "We are always in need of more people," said Haesler, who estimated that his  company hired 300 students this summer for temporary clerical and computer data  jobs.  </P> <P> Todd Glonek, a senior marketing major at San Diego State, found work through  Temp Associates in the data-entry department of Armour Co. in Irvine. It is a  job, he said, "in a field that will help me after I graduate. Making money is,  of course, one of the reasons I'm working, but looking out for my career after  graduation is equally important to me."  </P> <P> Increasingly, college students want summer jobs related to their majors, said  Gladys De Necochea, assistant director of career planning and placement at UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> "We get students every now and then who just a want any type of job quickly,  but basically most students are career-oriented in thinking and want the  practical experience that will help them in the long run," she said.  </P> <P> Deannie Lucas, 22, of Newport Beach, a senior majoring in engineering at UC  Irvine, found summer work at Mobil Oil in Fairfax, Va.  </P> <P> "I usually work at the YMCA as a counselor, which helped my people skills but  wasn't in my field of interest," she said. "It was a long way to come to get  the type of experience I needed, but I know it's worth it to start out with  something in your corner.  </P> <P> "I did my share of working odd-type jobs, and for my senior year I thought it  was just time to get down to business."  </P> <P> Starr Lee, 30, a law student at UC San Diego, traveled to Newport Beach this  summer to work in a law firm for the experience.  </P> <P> "It's funny, but law school doesn't teach a great deal about practicing law,"  he said. "Without working in a law office, you have no idea what this business  actually about. You have to go out into the real world."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Karl Rendel report: ``Foreign Experts Believe Leningrad </F> Nuclear Power Station Has High Reputation'']    [Text] An international seminar has just finished at the  Leningrad Nuclear Electric Power Station. It was held by the  World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO).    ``Some 60 directors of, and experts in, nuclear electric  power stations [AES] from 14 states came to Sosnovyy Bor, where  the Leningrad power station is located,'' I was told by I.  Valovich, vice director of WANO's Moscow center. ``For the  first time in WANO's four-year existence, the interregional  seminar was devoted to issues affecting the organization of  repair work and technical servicing of nuclear power stations.  We chose Sosnovyy Bor because we believe that the way in which  the reactor units at the Leningrad AES have been reconstructed  is instructive.''    ``There is basically a big difference between the RBMK  reactors we operate today and the ones we operated prior to the  Chernobyl accident,'' Leningrad AES Director Anatoliy Yeperin  stressed. ``We have introduced a number of new features, and  our first reactor unit has been rebuilt and licensed by  Gosatomnadzor [Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation  Safety] to operate at a full power of 1 million kilowatts. At  the moment we are renovating the second reactor unit from both  the engineering and technological viewpoint. Much of the work  being carried out by our personnel, who are relying on creative  collaboration with scientists, designers, planners, and fitters,  is the first work of its kind that has ever been done in the  world. Our experience is already being used as an example at  the Kursk and Smolensk AES's.''    Anatoliy Yeperin categorically rejected as unfounded the  claims made by the authors of an IZVESTIYA article entitled  ``Agent of Extinction'' who said that the Leningrad power  station was unsafe. The efforts made by the collective to  increase the reliability of its equipment and safety of its  operation have enabled the Ministry of Atomic Energy to grant  Leningrad AES the rights of an operating organization. The  station is not part of the ``Rosatomenergo'' concern, but  Gosatomnadzor, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the  foreign experts who have frequented Sosnovyy Bor for all sorts  of reasons see nothing bad about this.    A delegation from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was  here recently. In an interview he gave to me, Commission  Chairman Ayven Selin [name as transliterated] noted that  Leningrad AES has a high reputation in the world's nuclear power  industry, and that U.S. colleagues are well apprised of the  results of station checks carried out by foreign experts.    On 21 December the station will celebrate 20 years since its  first 1-million kilowatt reactor was brought on line. This  means that the station has already done two-thirds of the  ``distance''--its design life lasts until the year 2003. But we  must not put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today.  Now is the time to think about replacement power for a region  of such industrial importance as the Russian northwest.    Together with the Leningrad AES collective, the city and  oblast authorities have acted completely democratically and  thoughtfully. An international ``Energy'' competition was held  in St. Petersburg at which designs for the best reactors in  terms of technical, economic, and environmental features were  selected.    Authoritative bodies will decide what will replace the  existing nuclear power installations at Sosnovyy Bor. But this  decision needs to be speeded up. It takes at least seven or  eight years to construct a single reactor unit, and designs have  to be formulated and translated into blueprints. In order to  gain time, Leningrad AES and its associates, which had the  biggest input in the construction of the station 20 years ago,  have resurrected the ``Union of 18.'' This includes such  enterprises as the Kirovskiy Zavod and Izhorskiy Zavod  production associations, the ``Leningrad Metallic,''  ``Elektrosila,'' ``Elektroapparat,'' ``Elektropult,'' and  ``Obukhovskiy'' combines, the VNIIPIET, the AES All-Union  Scientific Research Institute, NIKIET, and planning and design  collectives.    ``But in order for our plans to become reality,'' Leningrad  AES chief accountant Aleksandr Loginov believes, ``We would like  to receive payment in full for our electricity from the Russian  stock-company `YeES of Russia.' This Russian joint-stock  company, and particularly its central control administration, is  abusing our patience.''</p>

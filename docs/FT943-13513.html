			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Skandia plans US unit sale Skandia, the Swedish insurance group, said yesterday it had agreed in principle to sell Skandia Texas Group, its Texan direct non-life operation, to Omni Insurance Corp, a US company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The move continues the Swedish company's efforts to disengage from direct non-life business in the US, where it is giving greater emphasis to reinsurance. It has sold two other direct non-life groups in the US over the last year. Skandia said its Texan operations, which generate about Dollars 55m in annual premiums and were mainly focused on motor insurance lines, had not been profitable enough. It said there were no plans to divest its remaining US direct non-life businesses.</p>

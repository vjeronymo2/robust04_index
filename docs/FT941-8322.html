			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Balladur slipping Support for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has fallen below 50 per cent for the first time since he took office last March, according to a poll published yesterday, reports John Ridding in Paris. The IFOP poll, in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the percentage of voters satisfied with Mr Balladur had fallen by nine points to 47 per cent over the past month. The proportion of dissatisfied voters increased by 10 points to 43 per cent. This followed other polls of the past few weeks which have shown a decline from an unusually high approval of more than 60 per cent. They appear to reflect concerns about the government's failure to curb the rise in unemployment, as well as issues such as the fishermen's strike this month. Political analysts pointed out that support for Mr Balladur remains high, compared with previous French prime ministers and his international counterparts. The decline in his popularity has, however, given heart to political opponents. Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party leader, who trails Mr Balladur in the polls, said the political left would be in a position to challenge the prime minister in presidential elections due in May next year. Mr Balladur has also faced criticism within the coalition government over the economy.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Mary Stuart - Battersea Arts Centre Friedreich von Schiller's Maria Stuart (Weimar, 1800) has endured because he found drama in history and created a fictional meeting between Queen Elizabeth and Mary Stuart, then the most influential women in Europe. Schiller's spark has ignited a bonfire of imitations; some, outrageously funny (Theatre Wilde Mischung Berlin), and others, like Dacia Maraini's version now at the Battersea Arts Centre, powerful and lyrical testimony to the linked fortunes of two uncompromising monarchs. Mary was executed at Fotheringay Castle on February 8 1587. She had spent 19 of her 44 years in prison. She was buried at Peterborough and then removed to Westminster Abbey in 1612. By then, her son, James, was king of England. The contrasts with her childless cousin Elizabeth are the fabric of Schiller's play: marriage or single life, exile or rootedness, romance or realpolitik. The Battersea Arts Mary Stuart takes place in a dressing room and opens to the strains of Mick Hucknell and Simply Red. One suspects director Nicolette Kay (who in turn translated Dacia Maraini's version from the Italian) has the regal coiffure in mind. But that is the evening's only levity. Pointed, meticulous acting from Anne Firbank (Elizabeth) and Louise Jameson (Mary) keep Schiller's issues alive: 'History,' says Elizabeth, 'asks for a choice: either her or me.' And Mary writes to Elizabeth on the eve of her execution, 'Europe is about to watch you behave justly.' Both actors play the lady-in-waiting to their opposite, creating an easy symmetry and continuity in the evening. While Mary dreams of the Earl of Bothwell, Elizabeth bullies the Parliament; while Mary goes barefoot to the block, Elizabeth stomps around in black work-boots. The production also emphasises the connections as well as the contrasts, trying to show that the ties between women are the strongest and most lasting. It rests on a shrewd feminist regard for the personality that kept Elizabeth in power and Mary in patient exile. What this Mary Stuart adds to Schiller is an undercurrent of sexuality. Elizabeth taunts her maid with sexually violent language or summons a stable-boy strip-o-gram. Mary remembers herself with a face 'flushed by the wind' leading her men into battle. On one side of the stage, Mary gives birth to James; on the other, Elizabeth rails about her dry, barren womb. But there is gentler wisdom from the Virgin Queen: 'love is the consent you give to your own subjection'.</p>

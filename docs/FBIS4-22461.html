			<p>Policy   <F P=102>   944K0934C Moscow ERK in Uzbek 1 Feb 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 944K0934C </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ERK </F> <F P=105>  Uzbek </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Critical Views"] </F>   [Text] ON UZBEKISTAN'S CADRE POLICY    Uzbekistan has opted for the classic path of a totalitarian  state in its cadre policy: cadres change their position every  one or two years. If an official sits in his chair too long,  this will not turn into power. The government does not believe  in its officials, and the officials do not believe in the  government. Officials who have understood the security of their  profession are compelled to think not of the state, but of their  own pockets. They solicit bribes and function poorly because  even if they did their jobs well, their labors would not be  esteemed. They conceal themselves in meetings so the boss will  not notice them. In this way they automatically sabotage the  work, continuity is lost, production speed drops; this, once  again, reflects the material situation of the people.  <H5>  ON SOCIAL POLICY </H5>   This sector is one in which our government takes pride. It  is  also true that this sector is one in which our government has  not worked out a program. The government is not on top of events  in this sector, it lags behind them.    The government does not fear the poverty or the hunger of  the  people, it fears their dissatisfaction. Thus, it acts to please  social groups which are potentially dangerous: students,  teachers, Russian workers and Russian officials.    In Uzbekistan 6 million 770 thousand people are working. Of  these, some fifty percent are workers in various sectors, 16.3  percent in industry, and 32 percent, or almost one-third, are in  agriculture.    This 32 percent are our peasants. Although wages of urban  workers and bureaucrats has risen ten times, that of peasants  has risen only once. In addition, peasants have not received  this wage for three or four months. Whatever their social  guarantees are, they are not demanding them.    These people do not know what social justice is: when they  government speaks about it proudly on television, they do not  know what pride it is talking about.  <H5>  ON UZBEKISTAN'S FOREIGN POLICY </H5>   The minister of foreign affairs has been changed three times  in the last two years. Has this measure been any good for our  foreign policy?    Let us take the last minister who was removed for example:    In may of 1993 the police or the KGB detained an Uzbek woman  at Tashkent airport and beat her up. This woman had been working  at the U.S. Embassy. The embassy protested to Uzbekistan's  government, but this protest received no answer. To top it off,  Uzbekistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement to  the press, saying that "responsibility for this occurrence must  be borne by the embassy itself."    This situation made no contribution to either diplomacy or  policy.    In response to this, the American government expelled a  delegation of Uzbek delegates headed by the chairman of the  Supreme Council who had been invited to visit the United States  from the country, Subsequently, Uzbekistan's government, in  order to ingratiate itself with the United States, replaced the  foreign minister who had only recently been appointed. In fact,  both the minister and the miserable person who had beaten up the  woman had followed the orders of the government. These failures  in foreign policy were a result of the arbitrary action in  domestic policy.    When Uzbekistan declared its independence, countries of the  world began to view this country with great interest. Uzbekistan  has many natural resources, its economic potential is vast, and  it is an historical and cultural center.    Under these historical circumstances, Uzbekistan needs a  strong foreign policy. We need a strong and independent,  intelligent, and unified foreign policy.    Unfortunately, the government has not, and cannot, follow  such a policy because it has destroyed its influence in the  world through anti-democratic actions in its domestic policy.    Uzbekistan has embassies in four or five countries of the  world. Some of the embassies are not able to state their  relationship to world events. Uzbekistan's government has not  even stated its own position with regard to the countries of the  world.    Iraq attacked Kuwait. Uzbekistan did not state its view of  this aggression. The United States bombed Iraq. Uzbekistan did  not say whose side it was on. Armenian occupied Azerbaijan's  soil. Uzbekistan did not state its position on this.    Half a year ago Uzbekistan's president with a large  delegation went to Saudi Arabia, stayed in luxury hotels, and  enjoyed themselves, and...returned with nothing -- an agreement  which would aid Uzbekistan's economy was not drawn up because  Uzbekistan has no opinion and no definite policy on Saudi  Arabia. The government, embittered by the failure of this trip,  expelled a group of Saudi Arabians who had come to the country.  As a consequence, relations between the two countries have been  severed.    In May of this year our president traveled to Germany. At a  request from the Mercedes-Benz company, the German Government  received I. Karimov. The German press made fun of this  reception: "If you want to see a dictator, do not go to Latin  America, come to our own Stuttgart, because Karimov is arriving  here tomorrow."    Recently President Karimov put 32 tons of Uzbekistan's gold  in a French bank, and, for this, he was received as an official  guest for the first time in a Western country. But if every  foreign journey of Karimov costs 32 tons of gold, we will soon  be out of gold.    To sum up, Uzbekistan's foreign policy is the mirror image  of  its domestic policy. Our people have a saying: "If your face is  crooked, do not kiss the mirror. We do not have the right to  exchange kisses with another country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev April 25 TASS -- "The Chernobyl nuclear plant  works in a normal mode. As to its safety, it is in a much  better condition than a year ago," Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said in an exclusive interview with UKRINFORM on Monday.    Its safety had been improved due to help on the part of many  countries of the world, he remarked.    "I am aware that international community is concerned about  the Chernobyl nuclear plant, because it is not a problem of  Ukraine only," Kravchuk said.    "If (foreign countries) want to give us a real help, then  appropriate funds should be alloted and we should solve the  Chernobyl problem jointly," he said.    "Whatever might be said about the Chernobyl nuclear plant,  we  cannot afford to close it down because of energy crisis in  Ukraine," he concluded.</p>

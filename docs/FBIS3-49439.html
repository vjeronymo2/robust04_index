			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic  of Srpska, by Slobodan Kovacevic; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Kovacevic] Mr. President, you have briefed the  deputies about the course of the peace talks to date. Is the  Serbian side changing anything in the platform for the  continuation of the talks in Geneva?    [Karadzic] For the time being we are not changing anything.  We do not wish to add to any sort of confusion in hope that a  peaceful solution will be found. We will leave it until the  18th [January], perhaps the 17th, or perhaps even after the  18th, in order to orient ourselves toward the future situation  that will result from the Muslim-Croatian talks.    I would like to say that we have nothing against the  Izetbegovic-Tudjman meeting in Bonn if this will contribute  toward their reconciliation, which would help the overall peace  in the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, if Germany tries to  reconciliate the Muslims and the Croats and turn them against  the Serbs, we will oppose this, naturally. For this reason we  do not wish to contribute to any sort of disruption of the  constructive atmosphere and will wait to see how the events  develop.</p>

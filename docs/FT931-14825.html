			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Aerospatiale sales climb but markets remain tough AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aerospace company, yesterday revealed its turnover and orders rose slightly in 1992, but markets remained tough and were unlikely to improve in 1993, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Louis Gallois, chairman, said sales rose to about FFr51bn (Dollars 9.44bn) from FFr48.6bn in 1991. Aerospatiale booked orders worth about FFr39bn in 1992, bringing its order book to FFr149bn at the end of 1992, representing three years' work. In 1991 it booked FFr38bn in orders, and its end-1991 order book represented 2.6 years' work. Mr Gallois declined to comment on 1992 earnings, saying he would not discuss these before the company's board had approved them. 'If I were much richer, I'd be much happier,' Mr Gallois said. At the end of 1992 Aerospatiale had debts of FFr16.5bn against FFr14bn a year earlier, he said. The company received a shot in the arm last year from the decision by Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, to buy a 20 per cent stake in it, which took effect on January 1, 1993. In addition to the possibility of acquisitions, Mr Gallois said his company could seek further alliances or deepen existing links.</p>

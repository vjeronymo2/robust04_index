			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / The Markets: Balancing the accounts - Global Investor Socialist prime ministers don't usually provoke celebrations in bond markets, and Japan's new leader is no exception. Bond prices had already been under pressure for most of the year as the market became caught up in global expectations of higher inflation. But now the fixed interest market is under attack from the supply side, as investors fear that the new coalition government is set to pump up a ballooning deficit. Both fears are overdone. Although Mr Tomiichi Murayama, heavily outgunned by his conservative coalition partners, has abandoned most of the nostrums of socialist theology in a few heady weeks, fiscal policy is another matter. Ministers have been queuing up to promise a few trillion yen of extra spending on everything from bullet trains to new houses, and with an election likely in the next year, fiscal rectitude is not high on the government's agenda. But the prospect of a few more public works projects should not cause too much alarm - even the parsimonious bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance don't object to borrowing for the purpose of investing. What really worries them and the bond market is the unresolved debate on revenue. Late last year plans were laid for a Y6 trillion cut in income tax to stimulate the economy. As with most Japanese fiscal stimuli, there was a strong element of smoke and mirrors. The income tax cut was, if the MoF had its way, to be offset by a huge hike in consumption tax - from its current 3 per cent to as high as 10 per cent. The socialists objected, and the income tax cut alone was implemented. That tax cut takes effect this month, and the MoF is back to demand its pound of flesh. Its case is seductively simple. The past few years have seen the government's finances dive into the red. From a surplus of 3 per cent of GDP in 1991, the fiscal balance will have declined to a deficit of 1.5 per cent this year. Hardly a case for alarm. But take out the surplus on the social security fund and the deficit soars - to about 5.7 per cent of GDP. But few people can be unaware that for the past three years Japan has been experiencing its worst recession since the 1930s. Measurement of the output gap - the difference between actual output and trend - is tricky because of the tendency of Japan's rate of growth to slow over time, but a conservative estimate would put it at around 6 to 7 per cent. In other words, the Japanese economy has plenty of slack to make up, and could grow at about 4 per cent a year for the next five years before running into serious capacity constraints. Growth of that level would certainly restore the fiscal balance to order. But, says the MoF, that ignores the longer term weakness at the heart of the public accounts - the unusual age structure of Japan's population - youthful now, but greying rapidly into the next century, presaging a heavy pensions burden on future governments. That, it says, requires a consumption tax increase today to avert a debt crisis tomorrow. But with the economy emerging slowly from a long recession, to impose a huge tax increase now to deal with a problem that might arise in 2010 seems masochistic. Surely better to let the recovery float the public finances back into equilibrium - then decide what to do about the demographics A consumption tax increase now might well choke off the hesitant recovery, creating a short-term fiscal problem as well as along-term one. Inflation If fears of an excess supply of bonds are misplaced, weak demand is already a reality. Investors have been fleeing bonds as global expectations of inflation have spread to Japan. The yield on Japanese government bonds has risen to 4.3 per cent from less than 3 per cent at the start of the year. But it is hard to see how world inflation is going to get to Japan. As noted above, the amount of slack in the economy is so great that there is little or no prospect of a revival in output producing anything more than the slightest of upticks in prices. Deregulation, moving admittedly at a snail's pace, is proceeding nonetheless, and is bringing down prices. And the rise in the yen's value is insulating the country from external price shocks. Core consumer price inflation has decelerated to below 1 per cent. But this is only half the story. The figures seriously underweight purchases in the rapidly growing discount sector. Anecdotal evidence suggests prices may be falling by as much as 5 per cent a year. Sustained deflation might itself create fiscal problems as the real value of government debt rises. But the current public debt/GDP ratio, at 47 per cent, is comfortably within the bounds of manageability. The attractions of low inflation are more important to the bond market than the vague long term dangers of oversupply. Exporters With the yen showing scant sign of coming back to earth, investors might be tempted to dump equity in the major export sectors, such as transport, electricals and precision instruments. But this could be an error. New research by UBS Tokyo shows that, despite the high yen, many firms raised exports last year, and they can be expected to do so again. The explanation, according to Neil Rogers, a UBS equity strategist, lies in the real, as distinct from the nominal exchange rate. With the exception of Europe the major export markets for Japanese companies have been growing strongly. At the same time inflation is much higher in all of them than in Japan. In the major Asian economies, consensus forecasts suggest growth should average over 8 per cent this year, with inflation above 9 per cent. Even in the United States, growth this year of 3.5 per cent could be accompanied by inflation of 3 per cent. With prices and costs in Japan falling, the real appreciation of the yen is much lower than the nominal figure. And the large increases in demand mean companies should be able to remain competitive, either by raising prices and retaining market share, or by cutting margins and seeing market share grow. Meanwhile the deflation in Japan that is keeping the country's goods competitive is likely to depress profits for those companies locked into the home market. The high yen may not help exporters, but neither is it likely to depress their competitiveness vis-a-vis industry as a whole.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 21/7/94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- % change over period                  US    Japan    Germany    France     Italy      UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week         0.08     0.04       0.09      0.10      0.15    0.09   Month        0.36     0.18       0.42      0.46      0.69    0.42   Year         3.63     3.09       6.25      6.56      9.06    5.88  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week         0.01    -0.18      -0.17      0.39     -0.44   -0.12   Month        0.38     0.95       2.09      2.74      1.58    2.55   Year        -0.02     4.63       5.86      4.85      8.70    3.94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week         0.00     0.53      -0.05      0.93     -1.44   -0.37   Month        0.30     1.17       3.89      4.88      2.77    4.49   Year        -2.87     4.41       4.36      3.07      9.83    2.68  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week         -0.7     -0.8        2.5       3.9       3.3     1.6   Month         0.6     -0.8        5.9       8.0       8.0     5.4   Year          3.8      2.1       15.2      11.4      29.5    14.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

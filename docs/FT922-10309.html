			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Leading indicators point to modest US recovery THE Commerce Department yesterday reported a smaller rise than expected in its index of leading indicators in March, a further sign that the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest. The index - used to forecast turning points in the economy - rose only 0.2 per cent following more robust increases of 0.8 per cent and 1.0 per cent in February and January respectively. Only four out of 11 indicators contributed to the increase in the leading index in March. The department's index of coincident indicators, which measures the current state of the economy, was unchanged in March following a 0.5 per cent increase in February. A rise in consumer confidence was the most important of the four indicators contributing to the rise in the leading index. Declines in the real money supply and building permits were the most important of six negative indicators. One indicator, the average work week, was unchanged. The unbroken run of three consecutive monthly increases in the leading index was the first since last summer. However, this provides no guarantee of a sustained recovery. Last year the index rose steadily from February to July, offering little warning of the economy's slowdown in the autumn.</p>

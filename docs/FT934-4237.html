			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Attorney general admits blunder in Nadir case: SFO handed privileged documents to prosecution The credibility of Britain's Serious Fraud Office was further damaged yesterday when the government admitted that privileged documents were wrongly handed to lawyers prosecuting Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive head of Polly Peck International, the collapsed trading company. The admission, in a written House of Commons answer from Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general, bears out one of the allegations about the SFO made by Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, who resigned in June over his relationship with Mr Nadir. Mr Mates claimed yesterday that the SFO had concealed further details from the attorney general: 'He was not told the whole truth by the SFO. He still has not been told all of the truth. There is more to come out.' Sir Nicholas said the error was 'regrettable' but he said there was no evidence to substantiate any other allegations against the SFO, and ruled out an independent inquiry. Mr George Staple, director of the SFO, said he had begun an internal inquiry into the circulation of the documents. 'The right course remains for Mr Nadir to return to this country to face trial, and, should he wish to make any complaints about the prosecution's handling of his case, to raise them with the trial judge,' he said. Mr Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus in May, said he would not return to face 13 charges of theft involving Pounds 34m unless an independent inquiry was established. He said other documents had also been handed to the prosecution, and accused the SFO, Scotland Yard, the attorney general and the Crown Prosecution Service of conspiring to secure a wrongful conviction. The admission of SFO bungling is a severe embarrassment to Sir Nicholas, who was forced to concede he had misled the Commons, which is regarded as a serious offence, with his statement in June that the privileged documents had not been circulated. The opposition appeared unlikely to try to make the admission a resignation issue. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City affairs spokesman, backed Sir Nicholas's call for Mr Nadir to return to face trial. 'Unless and until Mr Nadir comes back to face charges I don't see how these issues can be disposed of,' he said. Mr Mates, who is believed to want to return to the government once the Nadir affair is over, is also thought unlikely to pursue the issue but he will continue to seek a public inquiry. He alleged in his resignation speech that the SFO sought to put 'improper pressure' on the trial judge, that it tried to engineer a 'trial by media' through leaks to the press, and that there was 'illegal collusion' between the SFO and the Inland Revenue.

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ryder System to spin off its aviation business RYDER SYSTEM, the Miami-based transportation group, yesterday announced plans to spin off its aviation business as a separately-quoted company and take a net second-quarter restructuring charge of Dollars 169.4m. The plan involves a large jet turbine overhaul shop in Prestwick, Scotland, bought from British Caledonian in 1986. Existing Ryder shareholders will be offered shares in the aviation company by way of a tax-free distribution of stock. The new aviation group will take in Ryder Airline Services, Ryder Aviall and Inventory Locator Service, and will be based in Dallas. Included in its assets will be the Prestwick facility, which employs about 800 and works on General Electric engines for the likes of British Airways, Continental, USAir and British Midland. Ryder's aviation business is sizeable. The company claims to be the world's largest independent supplier of turbine aircraft engine repair services and the biggest distributor of aviation parts and supplies. Although it plans to shed some peripheral operations - Ryder Aviall's business aviation and helicopter engine repair business, its aircraft and terminal services operation at Dallas's Love Field, and a sales unit in Miami - the new company would have had revenues of Dollars 1.2bn in 1992, and assets, at end-1992, of Dollars 1.2bn. Profits from the aviation interests, however, fell last year - a trend blamed on lower demand, but which continued in the first quarter of 1993. About Dollars 500m of debt - just over a quarter of the total at Ryder - attaches to the aviation interests, and will transfer to the demerged entity. Demergers have become increasingly popular in the US recently, as companies have attempted to generate investor interest by reshaping themselves. Yesterday, Ryder claimed that the deal - due to be completed before the end of 1993 - should allow both its 'highway' transportation interests and the aviation units to 'focus more sharply' on their respective markets. Ryder shares gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: THE BELMONT;  </P> <P> BIG APPLE PUTS BITE ON ANOTHER OUT-OF-TOWNER  </P> <P> Stop me if you've heard this one before. But a horse that won two legs of the  Triple Crown got beat in the Belmont Saturday.  </P> <P> I think I've seen this film before. This was time No. 12 this has happened.  This puts it in the majority. Eleven times, it has happened the other way: The  two-time winner has made it a sweep in the Belmont.  </P> <P> We were supposed to get Dempsey-Firpo. Instead, we got Tyson-Bruno. Easy Goer  flattened Sunday Silence in the stretch.  </P> <P> They ran one of the great races ever run at the Preakness. This one looked more  like the Rose Parade. Sunday Silence looked more like a guy chasing a bus than  a horse in a race.  </P> <P> You've heard of guys going home from a race track in a barrel? Of guys losing a  bundle?  </P> <P> How'd you like to drop $4 million? On one race?  </P> <P> That's what Sunday Silence, Charlie Whittingham and Arthur Hancock III left  lying around Belmont Park Saturday.  </P> <P> Lots of guys have come to New York and gone home wiped out. Usually they buy  the Brooklyn Bridge or a watch from a guy wearing a checkered suit.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence's people didn't buy anything that turned green on their arms.  But they could have walked away with $5 million. All Sunday Silence had to do  was win the Belmont. The Triple Crown. He didn't even come close. The  automobile company that puts up that prize must feel like a club that puts up a  new car for anyone making a hole-in-one on a par-five.  </P> <P> It still might be the biggest one-day drop in the history of racing.  Bet-A-Million Gates never had a worse score.  </P> <P> It could have been worse. The conditions of the bonus are these: Chrysler  guarantees $5 million to any horse winning the Triple Crown. It puts up $1  million to the horse scoring the most points in the three races (five points  for a first, three for a second and one for a third).  </P> <P> Two years ago, Alysheba won the first two races, then finished fourth in the  Belmont. Another horse, Bet Twice, was second twice and then won the Belmont.  He got the million-dollar bonus. Alysheba got the middle of the doughnut.  </P> <P> As unfair as it sounds, it could have happened again to Sunday Silence. A horse  that wins two out of three could shoot the wad by losing one. Sunday Silence  had the presence of mind to finish second. He got the million with 13 points.  The Belmont winner, Easy Goer, ended up with 11.  </P> <P> Chrysler has not yet had to empty the vault to meet its pledge, but it's plain  the bonus conditions are geared to a save-the-Belmont philosophy.  </P> <P> It really wasn't much of a race. Seven of the horses had about as much business  in there as burros. The fourth horse was 20 lengths behind the winner, 12  lengths behind the third horse, and the last horse was 49 lengths behind  everybody. They almost had to delay the next race.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence, who kicked his trainer in the head Friday, got a lick in at the  bettors, too. He took about a million out of their pockets, going off as  odds-on (4-5).  </P> <P> Oh well, nobody's perfect. The story of the race was an immigrant from France.  He did better than anyone from there since Lafayette.  </P> <P> Le Voyageur had not only never raced in this country before, he had never raced  on dirt. He wasn't exactly Man o' War but he proved harder to get rid of than  dandruff. Of course, he was the only horse in the race that had ever run a mile  and a half before. In America, they pack a lunch for anything over  seven-eighths of a mile. Le Voyageur must have thought it was a nice little  sprint. He was just getting warmed up when he hit the finish. He led the race  all the way to the far turn. It took the second fastest Belmont of all time  just to shuffle him back to third.  </P> <P> All the race really proved was one of the hoariest cliches in racing. This has  been heard in every backstretch in America from camptown meetings to the lordly  Jockey Club. It goes -- repeat after me -- like this: "Horses for courses."  Stripped of the doggerel, it means that some horses don't like some race  tracks.  </P> <P> Great race horses can run on glass. But good race horses sometimes curl up  their noses at inferior surfaces and pout.  </P> <P> It doesn't make him all bad, but Easy Goer just doesn't like Kentucky.  </P> <P> He came up to Churchill Downs last November hailed as the greatest thing on  four legs since Pegasus. But when the Breeders' Cup came up mud, he chased an  inferior sort called Is It True (who ran on the undercard at Belmont Saturday).  He lost.  </P> <P> Then, when he didn't lose again until the Kentucky Derby last May under the  same conditions -- greasy track, intermittent rain -- the race track world  concluded he was an indifferent sort. I mean, a great horse doesn't need his  own deck.  </P> <P> But what was overlooked was that Easy Goer hooked up with 15 horses on a track  and conditions he hated in the Derby -- and finished second. In the Breeders'  Cup, he took on 10 horses and a surface that irritated him -- and finished  second.  </P> <P> When inferior horses hate a track, they finish last. They give up. Sulk. Pout.  Refuse the bit. Lug in. Lug out.  </P> <P> Easy Goer had too much class for that. It was just his bad luck the most  celebrated race in America took place in a part of the country he found  difficulty standing up in.  </P> <P> This is a horse that ran a 1:32 2/5 mile this spring. Only one horse in the  history of thoroughbreds has run faster.  </P> <P> Lots of people can't handle Kentucky in the rain. But the burden of the proof  is, Easy Goer is the best in his business when the sun is shining and the track  isn't glassy. And in Kentucky.  </P> <P> Oh, he finished second in the Preakness. If you consider 6 inches off the  winner as second. Only sophisticated optics could determine that it wasn't a  dead heat.  </P> <P> When Long Island came up with the kind of weather that capsizes destroyers all  week, the handicappers all but wrote Easy Goer off.  </P> <P> But this wasn't Kentucky. Easy Goer just stalked Sunday Silence like that  railroad dick after Butch Cassidy. He just swept by him at the far turn as soon  as he got ready. He ran the fastest Belmont this side of Secretariat.  </P> <P> If he stays out of Louisville in the rain, no one can beat him. Of course,  that's a good game plan even if you don't have to run.  </P></p>

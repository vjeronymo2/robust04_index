			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Administrative Vice Foreign Minister </F> Kunihiko Saito by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Japan's foreign policy has so  far been based on the axis of Japanese-U.S. relations. How  about the possibility of Japan altering its foreign policy  following the end of the cold war?    [Saito] Japan should continue to seek the axis of  coordinates  [zahyojiku] of its foreign policy in relations with the United  States. The United States is among the nations that share  Japan's values and systems, and it has the most powerful  influence among them. Japan has relied on the Japan-U.S.  Security Treaty for its security. Now that the relatively  simple structure of the East-West confrontation has changed and  a new complicated structure has emerged in the world, elements  that Japan must take into account are growing in number. The  role to be played by Japan in resolving global problems such as  overpopulation and the environment is increasing, and Japan will  have to make more contributions to maintaining world peace.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As for Japan's international  contributions, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], has put forward a plan to turn Japan into  a "normal nation" that can make even military contributions.    [Saito] It is clear that there are constitutional  constraints  on what Japan can do. Bureaucrats should not debate amending  the Constitution. Nonetheless, there still are things that  Japan can do within the framework of the current Constitution.  The International Peace Cooperation Law has just been enacted,  and it is necessary to proceed cautiously in interpreting the  law. It cannot be said that Japan has made contributions to the  international community to the very limits of its constitutional  constraints.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The February Japan-U.S. summit talks  broke off. Would you comment on these?    [Saito] I think that this was very regrettable. It was a  matter of course for Japan to reject the U.S. demand to set  numerical targets as long as the United States stuck to this  demand. If the Japanese Government committed itself to trade  matters that are beyond its authority, this would force Japanese  enterprises to engage in managed trade. Managed trade runs  counter to what the Hosokawa cabinet intends to do.    If Japan went along with the United States on the demand to  set numerical targets, it would have only deferred the solution  of trade issues between the two countries. Although  Japanese-U.S. relations would have improved temporarily, it is  clear that Japan one or two years later would have been unable  to meet the numerical targets. If the United States were to  criticize Japan one or two years later for failing to live up to  its promises, Japanese-U.S. relations would be worse than they  are now. Japan cannot do such an irresponsible thing.    The breaking off of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks dealt  a blow to Japanese-U.S. relations, and Japan has to make efforts  to patch up relations with the United States. Trade issues  between Japan and the United States stem from Japan's huge trade  surplus with the United States. The United States has contended  that it can no longer tolerate the trade imbalance, and we are  well aware of the U.S. position. Japan should understand the  U.S. position on the trade imbalance and should make its utmost  efforts to correct the trade imbalance.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What should Japan itself be thinking  about?    [Saito] If there is anything that Japan must reflect upon,  it  is Japan's failure to get its message across to the United  States that Japan seriously intends to spur its economy and that  it is resolved to cut taxes deeply to that end. Japan should  have articulated its plans to the United States.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Foreign Ministry is losing its  influence at home. What do you think about this?    [Saito] You are right. It would be good if it had more  influence at home, but....    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have Japanese-U.S. relations  matured into an "adult relationship"?    [Saito] I think that Japanese-U.S. relations have already  matured into an adult relationship. Japan has said no to the  United Sates. Japan has asserted what it has had to do and it  has conceded what it has had to concede. I do not think that  the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks began a completely new age in  postwar Japanese-U.S. relations.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is there not a fear that the Japanese  have become more or less nationalistic?    [Saito] I have not received such an impression.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States has been  criticizing  Japan's bureaucrats. Would you comment on this?    [Saito] I believe that this criticism is based on a  misunderstanding. In some ways, Japanese bureaucrats must  review their practices; Japanese bureaucrats have stuck to their  past practices. In the eyes of Americans, Japanese bureaucrats  are conservatives. Americans appear to have the impression that  "Japanese bureaucrats are bad guys who cause politicians to drag  their feet," but most of their impression is based on a  misunderstanding.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Who is deciding Japan's foreign  policy? Politicians or bureaucrats?    [Saito] What the bureaucrats must do is plan and draft  Japan's foreign policy, and then the politicians must make a  final decision on Japan's foreign policy. The role of  bureaucrats is to use their experiences to compile their  recommendations in an objective way and to present these to the  politicians. Depending on the circumstances, bureaucrats should  make recommendations and submit these to the politicians.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the consistency of  Japan's foreign policy should be maintained despite a change of  government?    [Saito] As far as the present coalition government is  concerned, it announced shortly after it came to power that it  will continue Japan's established foreign and security policies.  My opinion is that, if a political party with completely  different foreign and security policies comes to power, the  Foreign Ministry has the responsibility to present vigorously  its recommendations to the ruling party to keep Japan's foreign  policy as consistent as possible.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Mr. Ozawa has proposed introducing a  "senior vice minister system" [fukudaijinsei] with the aim of  reflecting politicians' ideas in policies. What do you think of  this?    [Saito] Introducing the senior vice minister system is a  great idea. If senior vice ministers assume the responsibility  of answering questions in the Diet, this would leave ministers  free to visit other nations and meet with key foreign officials.  Foreign policy should be planned and drafted calmly and  objectively on the basis of experiences without any specific  position being taken into account. There is no way but for  bureaucrats to do that work.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear development program is heightening tensions.    [Saito] If the United Nations adopts a resolution on the  matter, it is a matter of course that Japan will take full  measures to implement the resolution, within the framework of  the Constitution. Japan's role in implementing the resolution  will be great. The nations that will face a threat from North  Korea are Japan and South Korea. If Japan deals with the  resolution indifferently or reluctantly, it will lose the trust  of the international community and greatly harm Japanese-U.S.  relations.</p>

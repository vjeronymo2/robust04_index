			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cyprus-U.S. relations are going through a crisis  because of the delay in the submission of UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report and the behind-the-scenes  activities of Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's outgoing  special coordinator on Cyprus.    I MAKHI has learned that the government and the political  leadership are furious with the U.S. role and its persistence in  not briefing the Greek Cypriot side on the contents of the  Vienna talks. Political circles in Nicosia are strongly  concerned that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas may  "conditionally accept" the confidence-building measures. They  stressed that one consequence of such a negative and dangerous  development would be to shake Cyprus-U.S. relations.    In any case, yesterday the government explicitly reiterated  its opposition to the current delay and warned harshly about the  repercussions from any amendment to the 21 March UN document.  In a meeting yesterday between Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher which  could be described as a protest move, the government tried to  find out whether Lamb had actually submitted proposals (as  mentioned in the Turkish Cypriot press) that approximate the  negative Turkish positions. According to I MAKHI's information,  Boucher explicitly denied that any assurances or promises were  made to the Turkish Cypriot leader during the Vienna talks.    The Cypriot Government does not appear to have much faith in  the U.S. assurances, because reports from New York speak about a  further delay in the submission of the report (until the end of  May, early June). After meeting the U.S. ambassador,  Mikhailidhis stressed that "the impression that is created by  the delay in submitting the report is that this is designed to  serve the Turkish positions and maneuvers." He added that the  United Nations has described the 21 March document as final, and  that is how our side accepted it.    Despite relevant assurances, Boucher's remarks yesterday  intensify concerns about U.S. activity. Asked whether  Washington had promised anything to the Turkish side, Boucher  specifically said: "The entire procedure for implementing the  confidence-building measures depends on promises made to both  sides." He added that the basic point is "to find an  operational settlement that will enable both sides to use the  basic changes (from the confidence-building meausres) to find a  new way of approaching the Cyprus issue." Boucher said there is  still a chance, stressing that the United States continues to  support the measures. The preparation of the UN secretary  general's report has already begun.    The foreign minister and Tom Richardson, British deputy  foreign secretary, exchanged views on current developments at  their meeting yesterday. The British official, who had earlier  met Denktas, said he did not get the impression that the Turkish  Cypriot leader is trying to buy time. Richardson denied that  the United States and Britain are involved in behind-the-scenes  activities.  <H5>  Kasoulidhis' Statement </H5>   Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis reiterated that if  there are any attempts to change the 21 March UN document, the  Cypriot Government will cease to abide by it. He also said the  Cypriot Government is angry because of the repeated delays in  submitting Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council.    Asked whether President Glavkos Kliridhis intends to hold a  referendum so the Cypriot people can decide if they want the  confidence-building measures, Kasoulidhis said the president has  not yet decided on what he will do if he is forced to pull out  of the 21 March document.    Asked if the Cypriot Government will lodge a demarche with  the U.S. about reports that during the Vienna talks Lamb  submitted proposals for amending the 21 March document,  Kasoulidhis said this is under consideration.

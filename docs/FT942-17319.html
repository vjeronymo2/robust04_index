			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Russians in oil export revenue trap Russia is caught in a vice between falling oil prices and its inability to raise oil exports to compensate for the loss in revenue, according to its trade minister. Exports of raw materials, of which oil is the largest component, now made up some 80 per cent of all Russian exports, Mr Oleg Davydov said in an interview to the Nezavisimaya Gazeta yesterday. It was 'economically senseless' to keep increasing the volume of exports as prices fell, he said. Prices are currently around Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel. Mr Davydov said the rapid fall in industrial production had led to a decline in other Russian exports, especially in the engineering industry. 'The slow process of restructuring in industry doesn't allow us to to change the structure of exports: the share of exports taken by engineering and equipment in 1993 made up only 7 per cent of the total,' he said. However, a sharp cutback in imports led to a trade surplus last year of Dollars 16bn - with exports of Dollars 43bn and imports of Dollars 27bn - up from a Dollars 5bn surplus in 1992. These surpluses had helped support the rate of the rouble against the dollar and paid off part of Russian's foreign debt obligations, Mr Davydov said. But the trade minister quashed hopes by western companies and Russian importers that the high tariffs announced last month would soon be removed. President Boris Yeltsin has publicly expressed reservations about the tariffs and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, last week told Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, that they would be reviewed. But Mr Davydov said 'it makes no sense to change the tariffs so quickly', although he did admit that Russia's application for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would be made more difficult by their retention. Russia should anyway continue to press for membership, he said, in view of the 20 anti-dumping actions now being taken against it. Joining Gatt would protect Russia from such unilateral actions, he said, since Gatt members would have to follow a formal procedure before introducing sanctions. He said that Russia should insist on special terms within Gatt for the fellow members of the Commonwealth of Independent States - or first form a customs-free zone with these states and enter Gatt together. He warned, however, that economic integration with Russia meant 'the loss of a certain part of sovereignty. It's obvious that the former Soviet states still have one thing in mind - receiving energy resources from Russia for the same (subsidised) price as in the Russian internal market'. Meanwhile, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank chairman, said he might lower interest rates later this month. Pointing to a fall in inflation, he said he hoped to halve interest rates by the end of the year. Mr Gerashchenko was speaking at lower chamber hearings on the 1994 budget, on the same day that the upper chamber of parliament was finally cajoled into approving a temporary second quarter budget pending the approval of the budget for the entire year. The present discount rate of 210 per cent could be lowered while still exceeding the rate of inflation, he said. The discount rate is now about 5-10 percentage points higher than inflation, representing a relatively high real interest rate. For part of last year the interest rate charged to commercial banks was negative in real terms as the central bank held off from passing high interest rates onto ailing enterprises.

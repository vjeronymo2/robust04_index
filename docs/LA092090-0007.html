They can  quickly accommodate future technical breakthroughs in energy-efficient and  low-pollution power plants. The flexibility and productivity provided by the  automobile-based personal rapid transit system is thus preserved.  </P> <P> Huge investments in mass transit sufficient to reduce automobile travel will  forever lock us into slow inflexible transportation, causing unacceptable  losses in productivity and quality of social life.  </P> <P> WALTER BREWER  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tesco disappoints with modest 3.4% interim rise TESCO made waves in the retail industry yesterday with its comments on pricing and the threat from discounters, but disappointed the markets with an increase in pre-tax profits of only 3.4 per cent. Interim profits for the 24 weeks to August 14 were Pounds 261.5m (Pounds 252.8m). That included a Pounds 3.7m loss on the sale of properties but was well below analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 268m and Pounds 275m. Total sales increased 9.5 per cent to Pounds 3.99bn. The shares fell 4p to 211p yesterday. Tesco said its gross margin had declined by about 0.1 percentage points during the period, and was currently about 0.2 points down on last year - the first decline for about eight years. The operating margin was unchanged at 6.9 per cent. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said Tesco's decision to sharpen prices was bearing fruit in terms of increased sales, and the seven new stores opened in the first half were among the most successful the company had opened. They were already outperforming the Tesco average of weekly sales of Pounds 16 per square foot, and contributed 8.4 percentage points of the overall sales increase. Like-for-like sales, which exclude the contribution from new stores, increased 2.1 per cent. Although all of the increase was accounted for by inflation, that represents an improvement on last year, when like-for-like sales fell 0.9 per cent after inflation. Sir Ian said sales were currently 10 per cent ahead of last year. Like-for-like sales were up 3 per cent, with inflation about 2 per cent. Mr David Reid, finance director, refused to speculate on future margin movements but said Tesco's commitment to competing on price did not necessarily mean lower operating margins. There was still considerable scope for cutting operating costs through sales-based ordering and better stock control. Tesco also said it was reducing the average cost of new stores from about Pounds 22m to about Pounds 16m, which means it does not need to achieve such high operating margins in order to maintain its current return on capital. It plans to open about 25 stores a year, including large superstores, compact superstores in smaller towns, and the Tesco Metro high-street format. Capital expenditure this year will be about Pounds 725m, of which Pounds 550m relates to new stores. Earnings per share rose 4.5 per cent to 9.45p, and the interim dividend was 2.45p (2.25p). Tesco said Catteau, the French retail chain it acquired in May, had increased sales by 7 per cent so far this year, in spite of the difficult French economic climate.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Clinton appeals to the Japanese heart HEADS of government are allowed to take the high road while mere cabinet secretaries play it rougher. Rarely has this been more evident than in the contrasting performances here of President Bill Clinton and other members of his delegation in their negotiations with the Japanese government. Yesterday's address at Waseda University saw Mr Clinton at his most uplifting. He came to praise Japan far more than to berate it for not playing by global trading rules. He also put the case that the interests of the average Japanese and American citizen were, in effect, identical. The president's theme was 'the new global economy' - the sort of catchy phrase in English likely instantly to enter, if it has not already, the Japanese vocabulary. He defines this as an economy no longer 'based on standardised mass production but dominated by an explosion of customised production and services and by a volume of information increasing at an astonishing rate.' This, he noted deferentially, 'requires little explanation here in Japan,' as the pioneer of Asian modernisation. But it is not merely this brave new world that Mr Clinton sees as threatened by restrictive Japanese government practices. It is the Japanese consumer who mostly takes it on the chin, Mr Clinton said, prompting a clarion call to the students at Waseda. 'I would send this message to all of you and to the people beyond the walls of this hall. You have a common cause with the people of America - a common cause against outdated practices that undermine our relationship and diminish the quality of your own lives. 'The ideas I propose are beneficial to both of us because they will increase the number and lower the costs of the products you will be able to buy, the services you are able to access and they will, thereby, reward the work, the education and the skills that you bring to daily life here in Japan. You are entitled to no less.' Mr Clinton emphasised the indispensable nature of the bilateral relationship (subject to some changes) and the extent to which the US and Japan could help forge a 'new Pacific community.' The president has been publicly kind to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the lame but not entirely dead duck Japanese prime minister, and to the Japanese politicians who have upset the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's applecart. Mr Clinton and Mr Tsutomu Hata, who has broken away from the LDP to form the Renewal Party, were observed comparing notes at a US embassy reception. Back in the bilateral ministerial trenches, however, less apparent sweetness has prevailed, with one conspicuous, but multilateral, exception. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, mentioned Japan's willingness to cut to zero its tariffs on distilled products as instrumental in bringing about the new market access package agreed by the four trade ministers yesterday. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, and his small army of officials continue to insist that quantifiable targets must be agreed with Japan if its trade surplus with the US is to be reduced. 'It won't be easy,' he intones for the umpteenth time, yet again marvelling, as any Texan would, how the Japanese can tolerate paying six times as much for a pound of prime beef as Americans do. One of his senior advisers talks about it being 'better to get a good agreement than a quick agreement' and lists the areas in which the US believes the Japanese government 'manages' trade - financial services, automobile parts, computers and government procurement. Leaning on Japan pays off, he argues. Pressure this year has produced a bigger, earlier fiscal stimulus package than anticipated and goes on to make the case for a second pump priming operation this autumn because of new signs that the Japanese economy is back in first gear again.</p>

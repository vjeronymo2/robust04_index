			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Azeri aircrafts after violating Armenian air  space late on Monday dropped bombs on the border towns of Goris  and Kapan, a Defence Ministry spokesman in Yerevan told  Interfax. Reports speak of destruction but no casualties, he  said.    Armenian defences were unable to thwart the attack because  the two planes flew at a low altitude making it difficult to  detect them.    Two days ago, Azerbaijan carried out a bombing raid on  several areas in Nagorno-Karabakh and its administrative center  Stepanakert; one woman and two children were killed and nine  other people injured, most of them women and children. However,  Baku denies this.    The Armenian villages of Movses and Aigepar in the Taush  region and Armenian positions outside Aigeovit and Vazashen  villages came under intensive artillery fire from Azeri troops  in the past twenty-four hours, the press office of the Armenian  Defence Ministry said. There were civilian casualties, it  informed.    It also said Armenian forces foiled an Azeri advance outside  the Aigeovit village in the Idjevan Region on Monday. There  were casualties on both sides.    For its part, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that  Karabakh forces which received reinforcements from Armenia had  tried to launch an offensive in the northern part of the  frontline outside the village of Gyulistan in the Geranboi  (formerly Shaumian) region. Baku says that about 2,000 Karabakh  troops and dozens of tanks were involved. Azeri government  troops have so far succeeded in containing the Armenian advance,  it said.    In a separate development, Armenian forces launched an  offensive on the eastern Azeri villages of Talysh, Madagiz and  Levonarkh in the Ter-Ter Region. Several people were killed or  injured after Armenian troops mounted rocket fire on the  administrative center Ter-Ter whose population is 20,000.    More fighting is reported elsewhere on the front including  the Agdam Region. Several population centers in the Tauz Region  came under cross border rocket and artillery fire from Armenia  leading to civilian casualties, the Azeri Defence Ministry said.</p>

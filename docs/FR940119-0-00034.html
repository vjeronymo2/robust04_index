Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 11, 1993 (58 FR 42711) to exempt natural cedar pesticides, labelled, or for which claims are made, only to repel arthropods other than ticks, or to retard mildew growth, from regulation under FIFRA. The Agency concludes that use of these pesticides for these purposes poses negligible risks to human health or the environment and that the burden imposed by regulation is not justified. Accordingly, EPA is establishing this final exemption. Natural cedar pesticides labelled with claims of repelling ticks or for which claims are made to repel or otherwise mitigate ticks, are not included in the exemption. Ticks can be vectors of significant diseases affecting humans, and EPA has not yet fully evaluated whether or not such an exemption is justified. Thus, regulation of such pesticides is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption will not apply to any cedarwood product that is treated, combined or impregnated with any additional substances. EPA has determined that natural cedar itself poses little or no risk and does not pose unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. However, EPA has not made any such finding for cedar when it is mixed with any other ingredients. Thus, to qualify for this exemption, the pesticide must only contain natural cedar and cannot contain any inert ingredients. For example, if cedar is painted or soaked in any substance, it would not qualify for the exemption. Likewise, if cedar chips or shavings are mixed with other ingredients, the exemption would not apply. Natural cedar products, however, may be packaged and still qualify for the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Public Comment and Agency Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, the Agency solicited comments on the proposed exemption from regulation of cedar pesticides labelled for use to repel arthropods (except ticks) or to retard mildew. Six sets of comments were received. Three commenters supported the proposed rule and three objected to it. EPA also invited suggestions for additional candidates for consideration for possible future exemption. Two commenters suggested such candidates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's proposal included the term ``chips'' to describe the exempted pesticide. American Wood Fibers of Jessup Maryland, Inc. requested that the word shavings be inserted in the rule in addition to the term chips. Shavings is the term used more often in the industry. In response to this comment, EPA has added the term ``shavings'' to the final rule. This is not a significant change since all forms of cedar products (except cedar oil) were intended to be covered by the exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Zinc Association and Alltrista Zinc Products Company and Roussel UCLAF Corporation responded to the Agency's invitation to suggest other low-risk pesticide candidates for exemption from regulation. American Zinc and Alltrista requested that zinc metal strips used for preventing moss, fungus and mildew on roofs be considered; Roussel UCLAF Corporation requested review of rotenone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the proposal to this exemption, EPA recognizes that there may be other low-risk pesticides that would also be appropriate for exemption under section 25(b). EPA is currently evaluating existing pesticide registrations to identify other potential candidates for exemption or reduced regulation. EPA will include in this consideration the two pesticides, zinc metal strips and rotenone, that were identified as potential candidates in the comments submitted on the proposed cedarwood exemption. Moroever, as discussed in the proposed exemption, EPA plans to evaluate whether or not cedar oil extracted from plant parts is appropriate for exemption. EPA also plans to evaluate in the future whether or not it is appropriate to exempt cedar products for which claims such as ``repels ticks'' are made. If EPA determines that any of the above-described exemptions are warranted, EPA will publish a proposed rule on such exemptions and provide an opportunity for public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chlorobenzene Producers Association [CPA]; Excell Products Corporation; and Willert Home Products opposed the cedarwood exemption. Each are, or represent, producers of alternative products for moth repellence which compete with cedar products. Their objections and the Agency's response to each are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Consumers will be harmed and cedar competitors placed at a disadvantage if natural cedar pesticides are exempted. CPA and Excell Products assert that a number of competing products to cedar are produced and distributed by small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency disagrees that the proposed exemption of natural cedar will result in harm to consumers. As described in the proposal, the risk to humans or the environment associated with natural cedar is low. The natural oils in the wood and other plant parts are present at low levels and little exposure to users or the environment is likely. Cedar products have been sold and widely used for many years with no known health or environmental effects. EPA's regulatory authority under FIFRA is primarily a licensing authority; every decision has some potential effect on competitors. The Agency does not consider potential impact on competitors to be a valid and sufficient reason to preclude this exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Cedar is ineffective for pest control purposes and cedar companies will be emboldened to make false and misleading claims without regulatory oversight. Marketing of refresher oils for cedarwood strengthens the impression that natural cedar is limited or ineffective in pest control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is not endorsing the effectiveness of natural cedar as a repellent or for mildew prevention purposes. Because of the very low risk to man or the environment associated with cedar products, even if the commenters' claims of low efficacy are true, EPA believes the low risk nature of cedar justifies this exemption. EPA believes the marketplace is sufficient to suppress ineffective products. The Agency acknowledges that excessive and misleading claims may be associated with any products exempted from regulation, including cedar products. The Agency does not endorse or encourage use of excessive or misleading claims for cedar, but believes this is a circumstance where market choices will restrain abuse and ineffective products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Agency has already assisted the cedar industry with expedited review procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Expedited review procedures were employed for several cedar registrations in large part because the Agency considered these pesticides to pose little or no risk to man or the environment. All supporting data for natural cedar products were waived except descriptions of processing the wood and analyses for oil content. The Agency concludes that the low risk associated with natural cedar does not justify the cost of regulation, including the reduced costs associated with the expedited review procedures cited above, for either society or the Agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. This proposal improperly implies that natural substances are safe and synthetics are hazardous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees that not all natural substances are safe and that not all synthetics are hazardous. Natural cedar, however, is low-risk for both humans and the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The public health risk from exposure to natural cedar may not be negligible; lack of information suggesting risk does not support a finding of no unreasonable risk. This commenter [CPA] believes the statute requires a finding of no unreasonable adverse effect on the environment to support the exemption. CPA also concludes that exemption based on low exposure is inconsistent with prior Agency pesticide policy and that EPA's statutory obligations are not diminished when a pesticide also has non-pesticidal uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees that lack of information, in and of itself, is not sufficient to justify exemption. In the case of cedar, however, the point is reinforced from many years of distribution and widespread use of cedar with no known adverse effect. There is very little exposure likely for humans or the environment to the natural oils. Cedarwood oil typically occurs in cedarwood at low levels and cannot easily be separated from the wood or plant product. Consumers using cedarwood products are unlikely to be exposed to significant amounts of dust or oil either by inhalation or through the dermal route. Moreover, EPA believes that cedarwood oil, when used as it naturally occurs in blocks, chips, or other plant parts, is not expected to result in any significant environmental exposure and cedarwood oil is not known to persist or bioaccumulate in the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIFRA section 25(b)(2) authorizes the Administrator to exempt a pesticide if it is determined to be ``of a character which is unnecessary to be subject to this Act in order to carry out the purposes of this Act.'' Consistent with the comment from CPA, EPA has determined that cedarwood products, as defined in this rule, pose negligible risks to human health and the environment and do not pose unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Thus, EPA has concluded that these products are of a character which is unnecessary to be subject to the Act. As discussed in the proposal of this rule, the term unreasonable adverse effect is defined at FIFRA section 2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.'' EPA believes that natural cedar pesticides pose little or no risk to human health or the environment and that the regulatory burden imposed by registration of these products is not justified by the negligible risk posed by them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the commenters offered any evidence that would contradict this finding. The only evidence of risk presented was reference to mechanical injury if a child swallowed a small cedar ball. This comment cited a reference in materials submitted by a cedar registrant to their product and labelling warning to keep the product away from children. The Agency agrees that any object small enough to swallow should be kept from small children. If the sole risk posed by cedarwood products is the risk of children swallowing them, that alone is not a sufficient basis for EPA to regulate them under FIFRA. FIFRA was designed to address the unique concerns presented by pesticides. EPA does not believe that this type of physical risk, in the absence of any other pesticidal risk, justifies regulation under FIFRA. Other Federal, State and local authorities exist that could be used to address this type of risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CPA also commented that EPA is required to find that, to be eligible for exemption under FIFRA section 25(b)(2), a pesticide product satisfies ``other objectives'' of FIFRA such as meeting statutory criteria for registration with respect to labeling and composition. In the case of cedar, the Agency concludes that labelling requirements typically applied to pesticides are not necessary to prevent unreasonable risk to humans, including children (excluding products with claims involving public health issues). Determinations regarding product composition, labeling or other aspects of regulatory constraint are unnecessary given the low risk potential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency disagrees with CPA's assertion that consideration of lack of exposure is inconsistent with prior EPA pesticide policy. The Agency has previously exempted pheromones citing low exposure as one factor in the decision to exempt [47 FR 33717]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Excell Products Corporation urged that registrations for natural cedar pesticides issued prior to the exemption not be continued if the exemption is established. They are concerned that this would create a false impression of government endorsement for the registered articles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does not intend to register additional natural cedar pesticides (unless claims for ticks are made _ see discussions above). It is expected that existing registrations will be voluntarily cancelled after the rule becomes effective. Registration is never an endorsement of a pesticide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The low risk associated with pesticidal use of natural cedar does not justify the cost of regulation to society or the Agency. There is no reason to believe that mis-use or disposal of natural cedar pesticides will increase potential risk. The Agency concludes that use of natural cedar pesticides as described in the proposed regulation will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans or the environment, whether regulated under FIFRA or not. None of the commenters offered any evidence that would contradict these conclusions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption will relieve regulatory burdens for those companies and products consistent with the terms and conditions described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with FIFRA section 25, the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) has waived review of the proposed and final rule. The Secretary of Agriculture waived review of the proposed rule and agreed to waive review of the final rule if it is the same as the proposed rule. A copy of the final rule was forwarded to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Copies of the final rule also were forwarded to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has considered the comments received in response to the proposed rule. Except for the one minor change in wording, the Agency concludes that the exemption is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Public Docket <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has established a public docket for this rulemaking (OPP&hyph;2500091 and 2500091B). All comments received in response to the proposed and final rule are available in the public docket. The public docket is located at the Virginia address given under the ADDRESSES section above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another Agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354; 94 Stat.1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). EPA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments or small organizations given the impacts forecasted pursuant to the analysis conducted under Executive Order 12866 as set forth above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, I certify that this rule does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no information collection requirements. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 is not applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with FIFRA section 25, the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) has waived review of the proposed and final rule. A copy of the final rule has been forwarded to the U.S. Department of Agriculture before publication. Copies of the final rule also were forwarded to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 152 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

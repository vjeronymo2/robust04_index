After their fright the more than 100 passengers  are resting, while they wait for the plane to resume its journey  to Algeria. [passage omitted] Concha Flores reports:    [Flores] The three hijackers have given themselves up to the  Spanish police but they cannot request political asylum because  they are the perpetrators of a crime of air piracy. Therefore  they are prohibited from being granted political asylum. They  are three members of the Algerian police force who decided today  to leave their country and come to Spain. For this reason they  hijacked the Boeing 727 as it was on an internal flight from  Oran to Annaba. The three hijackers are at the moment making  statements to the Spanish police and after these statements have  been made, the necessary measures will be taken. However, the  right to request political asylum is ruled out, as the Alicante  Civil Governor, Alfonso Calve, said:    [Begin Calve recording] What I said was that international  laws and agreements exclude any possibility of political asylum.  What is going to happen, as I said, is that following police  investigations, they will be referred to the courts and it will  be the judge, and the National High Court, should the judge  decide that this case be referred to the High Court, who decides  the future. [end recording]    [Flores] [passage omitted] Further conclusions made public  by the Civil Government reveal that they have no connection with  Islamic fundamentalist movements.

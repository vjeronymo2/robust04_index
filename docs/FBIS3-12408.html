They called on the PLO to "revoke the Gaza-Jericho and  the Cairo document" signed with Israel and to request the  dismantling of the settlements in the occupied territory.    Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] (led by George  Habash), has told AL-HAYAH that "today's (yesterday's) crime was  premeditated. Nobody should believe that the Israeli officials  were not linked to the operation, for they want to combine the  PLO leadership's political submission with military submission  through massacres."    He said that yesterday's PLO call yesterday for the  dismantling of the settlements "came too late and its aim was to  contain the people's fury." He urged the Democratic Front for  the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] (led by Nayif Hawatimah) and  the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) to overlook their  differences.    Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas representative in Damascus,  dismissed the claim that the perpetrator of the massacre was  mentally deranged. He emphasized that Hamas "pledges  retaliation for the crime." He told AL-HAYAH that the massacre  "will not affect the implmentation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement." He accused the Israeli forces of complicity. He  said that the "operation was planned by the army and the  settlers. No armed person can enter the mosque without  coordination with the army and no single person can kill about  50 people and wound over 200." He added that "the only language  those (Israelis) understand is the language of military action."    Hamas' information office yesterday issued a statement  calling for an urgent enlarged meeting of the Islamic movements  in the Arab and Islamic states "to consider ways of reacting to  the Zionist massacre and of supporting the Palestinian people."  The statement added: "Let the confrontations escalate and let  the land erupt in flames and earthquakes under the feet of the  occupation. Let (Yitzhaq) Rabin know that our people's flesh is  very bitter."    Hamas later issued another statement calling on the  Palestinian and Arab negotiators to withdraw from the  negotiations with Israel. It added: "We call on the Tunis  leadership to return to the option of resistance as the only  strategic option for our people to regain their rights and  avenge the blood of the martyrs."    Hawatimah said that escalation of military action and the  downfall of the Oslo and Cairo agreements "would open the way  for a political settlement based on withdrawal, termination of  [Israeli] settlement and massacres, and fulfillment of our  people's right to self-determination and independence." He  called for a three-day general strike in the West Bank,  Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip."    Palestinian Popular Struggle Front Secretary General Khalid  'Abd-al-Majid has urged the Security Council to "take the  necessary measures to prevent the Zionists from committing their  crimes." He called on Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to  stop the negotiations with Israel.    The PFLP and the DFLP have issued a statement requesting  international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied  territory and promising to "avenge" the Hebron massacre and  "punish the occupation forces and the settlers." The statement  called on the Palestinian president to stop the negotiations  with the Hebrew state. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Now's the time to buy German - As prices for Mittelstand companies tumble, David Waller offers advice for potential buyers Now may be the best time in decades to buy a small or medium-sized German company. Recent research* published by Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows that the market for corporate acquisitions has turned dramatically in favour of the buyer. The report suggests that the number of deals in the German mergers and acquisitions market shrank by 12 per cent last year, as the number of companies for sale increased substantially. According to Peter von Windau, head of DGM, a large consultancy firm specialising in advising the German medium-sized company sector, prices for companies have dropped between 20 and 40 per cent over the past year. This reflects the severity of the economic downturn, which has forced many owner-managers of Mittelstand (medium-sized) companies to consider selling up. Potential buyers are thin on the ground; bigger German groups, which in better times might have been natural purchasers, have had to pull in their acquisition horns, whilst foreign companies have been put off by Germany's economic problems. Buying a company is not easy and the first piece of advice for a potential buyer is to hire an adviser, preferably one who speaks fluent German or is German. The key to opening successful negotiations is to understand the mentality of the seller. As David Young of Deutsche Bank merchant banking subsidiary Morgan Grenfell pointed out at a recent conference, this is likely to be very different from that of the typical buyer, an Anglo-American manager working for a stock-market listed company. The most important thing to know is that money is not everything for the owner of a German private company. 'A third- or fourth-generation owner often does not need the money and it can be an insult to try to persuade him to talk by promising an excellent price,' explains Young. Loyalty to the company he has built up over decades, to the community in which it is based and in which he lives and to the workforce are likely to be more important. Any proposal with an opportunistic, asset-stripping flavour is likely to be given short shrift. As Young puts it, the owner will feel the company is likely to be destroyed, with disastrous consequences for his standing in the local community. 'This view is strongest in respect of English and American purchasers who are famed (in Germany) for their short-termism,' he adds. Often, the owner will speak perfect English - but do not on that account imagine he thinks like an Anglo-American businessman. The best tactic is not to suggest a deal at all, Young recommends. An initial meeting should focus on a more limited objective, such as exploring joint-venture possibilities in a certain segment of the market. Make sure the agenda for the meeting is established in advance; that whoever attends from the buyer's side is senior enough - and old enough - not to deal a blow to the owner's sense of self-esteem; never cancel. Cancellation at the last minute would be considered an irreparable breach of business etiquette. Aim to develop a relationship with the target company over the medium-term. 'How and where you raise the issue of whether the owner wishes to sell is very like a marriage proposal and very much depends on how the relationship is progressing,' he says. 'The advantage of discussions about co-operation is that it is a fairly short step to suggesting that this is backed up with an equity shareholding.' Having taken the plunge and received a favourable reply, the would-be buyer will encounter new problems. The key issue is to obtain the elementary financial information which can be used to establish a basis for an offer price. German companies are required to file a copy of their audited profit and loss account with the German equivalent of the UK's Companies House. According to the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report, though, most companies, particularly the smaller ones, pay no heed to these requirements. Probably 90 per cent of companies do not bother with the filing. Having persuaded the vendor to part with his accounts, the purchaser will have to adjust the accounts to reflect commercial reality. German accounts are driven primarily by tax considerations and are likely to understate the company's true profitability. 'It is therefore important in price discussions that both foreign buyers and German vendors ensure that they are referring to the same figures,' Coopers counsels. 'This is best achieved by normalising the results and by both parties agreeing to the adjustments that have been made. Perhaps the most sensitive issue is the owner's tax position. Morgan Grenfell's Young explains, many owners of Mittelstand companies have 'an obsession with taxes which only comes with living in a country with high nominal tax rates'. Under German tax rules, selling a business outright can give rise to a substantial 'wealth tax'. But Young says tax considerations may drive many entrepreneurs to sell their businesses next year in the hope of avoiding an extra 7.5 per cent solidarity tax which is to be imposed for one year from January 1, 1995. *Coopers &amp; Lybrand: M&amp;A in Germany, a review of 1992.</p>

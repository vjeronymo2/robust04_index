			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 11 (CTK) -- Europe needs a new  "vision of openness" to solve many of its present problems,  similar to the era of "Renaissance, free trade and states  without borders", Polish President Lech Walesa said in an  interview with CTK today.    Among topics discussed at the meeting of the seven Central  European presidents on Friday [8 April] and Saturday would be  "how today, at the end of the 20th century, we can build a new  `amber road' for people, ideas and goods from the Adriatic along  the Odra River to the Baltic," Walesa said.    Walesa will be attending the meeting, to take place in the  east Bohemian town of Litomysl, along with the presidents of the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and  Slovenia. He hopes the two-day event will open new prospects  for European unity and kick off debate on the matter, he said.    The countries of the Visegrad Four -- Poland, the Czech  Republic, Slovakia and Hungary -- have justified the existence  of the group, he said: They have rid themselves of foreign  soldiers, they have established close ties with the European  Union, signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)  and joined the Partnership for Peace project. "It could be  asked: What would have happened if there hadn't been the  Visegrad group?" he said.    When asked for his views on Polish-Czech relations, he said  the two countries had many aims and activities in common and  managed to conduct good neighborly cooperation. "On Good Friday  half a million Czechs crossed the border at Tesin. It delights  us that they have reason to come," he said.    At the same time many bad facets and absurdities remain in  bilateral relations, remnants of the former communist regimes.  "People telephone across the border by means of an international  exchange; in a number of border towns the communal network has  been artificially divided by the border," Walesa said. Despite  this "border regions are prospering and trade is picking up," he  said.    Besides cooperation in the border regions, Poland and the  Czech Republic should in his opinion carry out more joint  projects. "That is the task of governments, which are already  working on it," he said. "The possibility of contacts between  the peoples, momentous in our history, allows negative  stereotypes of Czechs and Poles to be overcome. All this allows  us to talk about a new page in our relations and in the history  of uniting Europe," Walesa said.</p>

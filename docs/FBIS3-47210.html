The meeting will formulate its recommendations to a  UN-sponsored conference in Cairo next September.    Some 20 high-level scholars, academics and political leaders  who are well-versed in the problems of population will attend  the meeting at the UN University in Tokyo, Terada said.    Participants will include such prominent figures as  Norwegian  Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Mexican President  Miguel de la Madrid, former World Bank President Robert McNamara  and Taro Nakayama, former Japanese foreign minister.    The meeting is to be held under the cosponsorship of the  U.N.  Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN University and the Foreign  Ministry.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will address the  opening ceremony.    The participants are expected to adopt a Tokyo declaration  on  the closing day.    The deliberations at the meeting will be recommended to the  U.N.-sponsored International Conference on Population and  Development, which is to be held in Cairo in September to  discuss measures for problems related to the rapidly increasing  world population.    Terada said Japan is by far the largest donor country for  UNFPA, donating 59 million dollars in 1992 and as much as 63  million dollars in 1993.</p>

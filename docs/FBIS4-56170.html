			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Miguel Lozano: "The Cuban Assembly Began Debate on </F> Improving Finances"]    [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- In the midst of a complex  economic situation, the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP] began a special session devoted to defining  policy to improve the country's internal finances.    This is the second time since last December that Cuban  deputies have debated the difficult current situation, which is  marked by a budget deficit of more than 4.2 billion pesos  (equivalent to the dollar) and a liquidity surplus of more than  11 billion pesos.    During the prior session, the ANPP decided to suspend  analysis so as to summon a consultation with the people, held  from January to March with the participation of three million  workers in more than 80,000 meetings presided over by labor  union representatives, a process dubbed the "workers congress."    The deputies are facing the difficult task of establishing  general guidelines to improve finances and promote the  reactivation of production without resorting to a "shock policy"  that would entail additional sacrifices for the neediest  segments of society.    President Fidel Castro, who is attending the ANPP special  session, warned an unquestionable principle of the policy of  recovery is that "the revolution will not leave anyone  unprotected."    Authorities also made it clear that though not all the  measures to be adopted will be popular they hope to get the  people's understanding on the need to make "a shared sacrifice"  so as to achieve industrial recovery.    Local experts believe it is indispensable to lower the  budget  deficit and the money surplus to cope with the economic crisis  provoked by the drastic reduction of the country's importing  capacity due to the disappearance of the European Socialist Bloc  and the tightening of the U.S. blockade.    According to sources, the chief guidelines to improve the  economy include raising prices, eliminating undue benefits  created by the revolution, and reducing subsidies given to state  enterprises for losses. These are aspects the ANPP must debate.    The authorities and people queried during the assemblies  concur on the need to halt and eliminate illicit enrichment  through speculation and the black market, which flourished in  the last [words indistinct].    This special session was preceded by a state overhaul, which  included the elimination and merger of several ministries,  institutes, and state committees, in search of a better  organization, as part of the general efforts to lift the country  out of the difficult economic situation.    In this context, the almost 600 deputies of this session,  which should conclude tomorrow, are tasked with establishing the  guidelines for improving finances, which are considered vital  for reactivating the economy, eliminating the crisis, and  preserving the gains of the Cuban socialist program.</p>

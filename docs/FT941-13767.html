			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Observer: Parkinson's law There they go again. A pillar of the Tory establishment, Lord Parkinson, took to the airwaves yesterday to repeat the hoary old allegation that Lord Healey, Labour's last chancellor of the exchequer, once promised to tax the rich 'until the pips squeak'. Lord Healey, speaking on the BBC's World This Weekend programme, denied he ever said it and bet Parkinson Pounds 100 to prove otherwise. He has collected on a similar bet with William Keegan, the Observer's economics editor. But just in case, Parky will be getting a letter to remind him that he accepted the wager on air.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  proposed here Thursday [7 April] that all driftnet fishing in  European waters should be outlawed by December 31, 1997, and  that particularly long driftnets should be banned at the end of  1994.    Driftnets, known as "walls of death," are used to catch  white  tuna in the North Atlantic, salmon in the Baltic and swordfish  in the Mediterranean.    But they are blamed for also indiscriminately entrapping and  killing seabirds and mammals such as dolphins.    The European Union's executive European Commission quoted  scientific studies estimating that 1,700 dolphins were captured  by driftnets last year in the north-east Atlantic.    The Commission agreed that French fishermen should be  allowed  an extra year, to the end of this year, to stop using driftnets  measuring between 2.5 and five kilometres (1.6 to three miles).    An EU spokesman said the Commission would propose to a  ministerial council next week that the extent of fishing by  means of driftnets up to 2.5 kilometres long should be frozen at  end-1994, then gradually phased out by end-1997.    The longer nets have been banned since 1992. But fishermen  which had used them before that date -- mainly 31 French boats  operating in the north-east Atlantic -- were given until the end  of last year to phase them out.    EU fishing ministers have been unable to agree whether to  prolong the extension, despite strong pressure from the French  driftnet fishermen.    But a Commission spokesman said the French boats should be  given the right to use the longer nets for one more fishing  season.    EU Fisheries Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas also urged  tighter controls on driftnet fishing. He quoted a report saying  that illicit use of the larger nets was widespread.</p>

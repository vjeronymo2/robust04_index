			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Anzacs over England - Theatre Death haunts the skies over Stroud, Gloucestershire in David Goodland's vivid Anzacs Over England at the Swan, Worcester. This theatre is beginning to specialise in local social history with wider appeal. Goodland has already adapted the rural writers Winnifred Foley and John Moore for the stage; with Anzacs he uses social history leavened with imagination. Anzacs represents an increasingly popular kind of drama, where families and individuals are the crucible for larger social reactions. Arthur Miller's plays set the modern type, and its best exponents now are Ronnie Harwood and Brian Friel. Here, David Goodland charts the impact of 1,000 Australian Flying Corps volunteer airmen on two Cotswold villages during 1918-19. In Stroud, the Pope family represents English feudal life at its most static. They work on the local estate, and feel the pain of war when one son is lost and another gassed in France. But it is the daughter, Annie (Miranda Pleasance, making her debut), in love with Australian airman Jeff (Richard S. Huggett of Neighbours) who encapsulates the tension between the hierarchy of the old world and the democracy of the new. She marries Jeff, and leaves when the Australians ship out in 1919. Goodland finds 'fair dinkum' humour in the meeting of Oz and Blighty; he tempers this by recounting the deaths of 35 airmen who crashed their Sopwith Camels in training. So far, the pace is slack, and the inset 'revue' scenes, where the Aussies perform for the locals, should be cut down. However, Pat Trueman's direction gives scope to good performances in the Pope household, with Vivienne Moore as the mother offering sympathy or stew, and Owen John O'Mahony as the outraged father clutching his newspaper in crumpled irascibility. Anzacs will shortly be recorded by BBC Radio, and should be sharper when cut. The question it tackles but never answers is about loyalty: why did so many men volunteer to fight and die for a far-off country? By the end of the war, Australian casualties numbered over a quarter of a million, at two thirds of those who volunteered, the highest proportion among combatants. They deserve this tribute. Anzacs Over England, Swan Theatre, Worcester until October 3 (0905 27322)</p>

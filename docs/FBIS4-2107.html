			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Builders from  northeast China's Liaoning Province have established an image in  overseas markets, according to a local official.    Yang Shuaibang, deputy director of the provincial  construction department, said the construction companies in the  province have signed 562 contracts involving 730 million U.S.  dollars with foreign construction firms from 1988 to 1993.    This was 5.1 times the total value contracted in the  previous  seven years. Last year, the contracted investment registered a  record high of 150 million U.S. dollars.    The province's cooperation with foreign counterparts has  been  strengthened, when builders in the province have so far set up  ties with 41 countries and regions and the number of joint  ventures have seen an increase from 32 to 84 since 1992, Yang  said.    The local construction enterprises have also launched 45  branches abroad. Some of them have branched out into other  fields, including food, real estate and building materials.    Meanwhile, the province has seen good results in boosting  exports in this field. The export volume just to Russia in  recent years has amounted to 15 million U.S. dollars.    As their capabilities have grown, these enterprises have won  contracts to build entire projects for foreign employers. In  Malaysia, they have won bids for eight projects which were worth  120 million U.S. dollars.    The industry in the province began to explore overseas  market  since the early 1980s, focusing on labour exports at that time.</p>

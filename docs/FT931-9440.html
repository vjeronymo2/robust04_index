			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Savers to get less SAVERS will be relieved to discover that the building societies have not taken advantage of the last one-point base rate cut to widen their margins by more than a fraction. Halifax, the UK's largest, this week announced gross interest rate cuts of between 0.6 and 0.8 percentage points on its savings accounts. When it cut its mortgage rate by just over half a percentage point (from 8.55 per cent to 7.99) on January 26 - the day base rates came down to 6 per cent - Halifax said it had given 'special consideration' to its savers in setting the new level. In most cases, the gross rates on its 90-day savings and instant access accounts are coming down by 0.65 of a point. In some cases, they are reducing by 0.6 of a point. This means that someone with Pounds 25,000 or over in Instant Xtra Plus (Halifax's main instant-access savings account) will receive 5.5 per cent gross, while a similar deposit in 90-Day Extra will earn 6.2 per cent. The Tessa rate has been reduced from 7.5 to 6.75. There had been fears that societies might be tempted to follow the banks, which have cut savings rates by larger percentages to widen their margins. Abbey National reduced its mortgage rate by 0.51 of a percentage point but cut gross rates by 0.95 of a point on the highest band (Pounds 25,000 plus) of Instant Saver, its instant-access savings account. The rate on this band is now 5.1 per cent gross. Lower balances have seen smaller reductions of 0.65 per cent, but this represents a high proportionate drop. The gross rate on deposits up to Pounds 500 has been cut from 1.15 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Midland has also cut almost all gross savings rates by 1 point, with a handful going down by 0.75 of a point and one by 1.25 points - but it has also reduced rates on its credit cards. The annual percentage rate will drop from 25.3 per cent to 23.1 per cent from March 2. Overdraft rates have fallen by 1.3 to 1.4 points but the reduction on the bank's mortgage rate was only 0.56 of a point. The societies, which depend on savers for their funds, have, like Halifax, been reluctant to cut savings rates too steeply for fear of losing deposits. They had a net outflow of funds in five months of last year, and net receipts for the year totalled only Pounds 295m compared with Pounds 5.8bn in 1991. Chelsea building society, which cut its mortgage rate by 0.51 of a point to the market rate of 7.99 per cent, reduced its gross savings rates by up to 0.75 of a point this week. Leeds Permanent reduced gross rates on Liquid Gold, its instant-access savings account by between 0.5 and 0.75 of a point following its mortgage rate cut of 0.56. The rate paid on Pounds 25,000 and above is 5.6 per cent gross. From today, gross rates on Solid Gold, Leeds' 90-day savings account, are cut by 0.7 of a point on the top and bottom of its five bands with the middle bands, covering deposits of between Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 49,000, reduced by 0.55. Someone with Pounds 50,000 and above will earn 7 per cent gross, while deposits up to this level but over Pounds 25,000 will earn 6.55 per cent.</p>

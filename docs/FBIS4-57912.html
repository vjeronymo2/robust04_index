			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ``special correspondent'' Roberto F. Campos: </F> "In Varadero, `The Best is the Best'"]    [Text] Varadero, Cuba -- A luxurious sun caresses the  tourists who come to this beach resort, which in 1880 was  absolutely pristine but now has plenty of excellent hotel  facilities.    Those who make repeat visits to the Hicacos peninsula claim  that here, where the finest sand delights visitors for more than  20 km, the sun is more than a star.    This is also a good place for tourist businesses and this is  why the Cuban Tourism Convention, which is being held from 16 to  20 May, every year becomes more significant. The convention has  been held in Havana, but the so-called blue beach is undoubtedly  its pinnacle.    Seeing visitors walk along the streets of Varadero or travel  by car toward the end of this narrow sweep of land one might  think this beach has always been a haven for vacationers, but  this is not the case.    The first luxury hotels emerged in the 1950's following a  long period of neglect, during which pirates plundered the area  and only a handful of landowners were present.    The Internacional Hotel and some residences of the Kawama  housing project are the oldest structures enhancing this  landscape. Around the time these installations were being  built, the peninsula also began to host Boston-style homes that  were dismantled in Boston and moved to Varadero.    The Ambrosio cave, which contains aboriginal drawings, and  cays such as Mono Cay where seagulls make annual visits, is in  Varadero. These and other characteristics make Varadero a  superb and beautiful destination.    [Words indistinct] green branches and glass-walled  elevators,  or the back-and-forth journeys of catamarans, yachts, and  motor-boats cruising the sea.    In spite of blistering heat, the 15th Annual Cuba Tourism  Convention attracted many people to the 464-square meter  Puntablanca Fair Room.    While attending their own exhibition rooms or walking around  in search of pleasant conversation, businessmen from 88  commercial firms in 26 countries are informing interested  journalists from around the world about the possibilities of  Cuba's nascent tourist industry.    Cuba's Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos reported that Cuba  expects some 1 million tourists in 1995. Many other Tourism  Ministry officials, however, say they are getting ready to  receive more than that.    The island, which has many other beautiful attractions in  addition to Varadero, has more than 7,000 rooms available, and  negotiations are under way so that every year 2,000 new rooms  become available, according to official reports.    There are two especially significant attractions: the  beaches, or let us say, the landscape; and the people. This is  what we mean when we say "the best is the best," keeping in mind  a suggestion by Rene Capriles, a Rio de Janeiro colleague who is  one of the 85 foreign reporters covering the convention, which  will close tomorrow.    This blue beach located in an area that began to be utilized  in 1883, when 10 people from the neighboring town of Cardenas  decided to buy land, today is the standard of Cuban tourism.    Many people from that town would have acquired peninsula  land  had they foreseen the admiration held for this paradise, which  today is hosting numerous tourist installations.    One gets the impression that without Varadero there might be  no sun and no warmth anywhere else, when just the opposite is  true. Varadero has become, perhaps, the standard for multitudes  of Cuban tourist attractions. This is the reason why all of the  businessmen at this convention are saying "the best is the  best." It is true.</p>

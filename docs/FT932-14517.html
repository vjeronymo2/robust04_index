			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Showdown in US-EC procurement row THE denouement of the latest US-EC feud over government procurement is scheduled to come today and tomorrow during the third meeting between the top trade officials, Mr Mickey Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. Either Sir Leon, the EC commissioner for trade, will agree to waive the offending Article 29 of the EC Utilities Directive, which the US argues makes it more difficult than ever for US companies to win telecommunications and heavy electrical equipment contracts in Europe. Or Mr Kantor, US trade representative, will ban EC companies from bidding on various US government procurement contracts, a retaliation estimated to cost Dollars 45m-Dollars 50m a year. Furthermore he will proceed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to complain that the offending article extends government rules to private sector activities, a Gatt violation. The real contest between them has been and continues to be over the shape of the negotiations. The US insists the subject is utilities procurement - telecommunications and power equipment. The EC wants to bring in the entire body of Buy America provisions, which apply to defence, transportation, airports, waterways and other services. The US complains that the EC is throwing in the iniquities of American state governments, while ignoring the discriminations of its own sub-federal procurement agencies. In this week's face-off, Mr Kantor is in the enviable position of being unable to lose. He is seeking, as an 'interim' agreement, a real opening of the Dollars 15bn-Dollars 25bn a year EC utilities procurement market. This would be achieved by a waiver of Article 29 upon certification that the US gives EC companies 'comparable' access in the market. If he fails to get the waiver and institutes the threatened sanctions, Mr Kantor will have demonstrated his grit to Congress. This could leave the administration free of the kind of congressional initiatives foisted on previous presidents, who seemed more reluctant to act. The US does not argue that it is without sin in discrimination in the awarding of its government procurement contracts. Its transgressions are rooted in the Buy American Act of 1933, discriminating against foreign companies in federal, state and local bidding. In fact a more unbiased source than the EC - a Gatt dispute settlement panel  -months ago found that the US government had violated its multinational obligations by applying a Buy American provision to the procurement of a sonar mapping system by the National Science Foundation. The US, which complains about others blocking Gatt panel reports, has yet to adopt the conclusion itself. However, both US and EC procurement markets are riddled with domestic preferences. Comparisons are tricky because of systemic differences between the Community, where publicly-owned utilities predominate, and the US, where most companies are privately owned. US officials say they have 'incontrovertible evidence' that foreign companies have gained at times great chunks of the US government utilities market. However, this is not all that much, as 92 per cent of the US market is in the private sector. And if Asian companies have been better able to overcome the 6 per cent bidding preference given to American companies under Buy American laws, then the US still offers the EC twice as many 'bidding opportunities' in overall government procurement contracts. According to the US figures, EC companies get to bid on Dollars 16.8bn (Pounds 11bn) in the US market, compared with Dollars 7.8bn for American companies in the EC market. All these numbers have been presented to EC officials in talks leading up to this week's showdown. If Sir Leon agrees to the waiver of Article 29, he will get US agreement to the joint study he has proposed of the US and EC procurement markets. It does not matter that this proposal was more probably meant to delay than hasten a settlement; Mr Kantor has taken it up as a route to the multilateral negotiating table. US officials say an 'interim' agreement will have a salutary effect on the US mood as the two economic powers continue to work on an expanded market access package to wrap up the Gatt Uruguay Round.</p>

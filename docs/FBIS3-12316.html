Accordingly, there is a need to rethink the  Oslo, Davos, and Cairo agreements, as well as the Gazaz-Jericho  accord itself. The proposed phased settlement on the  Israeli-Palestinian track -- envisaging an interim five-year  period followed by a final settlement, the outlines of which are  by no means clear -- also needs to be reexamined. Inevitably,  then, the Palestinian leadership will have to back out from a  stage-by-stage settlement that it concluded with Israel under  U.S. pressure. Having done that, the Palestinian leadership  will have to push for the implementation of UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as Resolution 181, which calls  for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The  Palestinian leadership has a strong case to advance to the U.S.  sponsor of the peace process and the international community;  namely, that the U.S. initiative and the Madrid conference were  launched on the basis of UN resolutions, the land-for-peace  formula, and the Palestinian people's national legitimate rights.    The international community, including the powerful,  permanent members of the UN Security Council, are now all too  aware that Palestinians in the occupied territories are being  subjected to a genocidal effort. Hence, it is not reasonable to  act as if nothing has happened and carry on with the  negotiations with Israel while the physical liquidation of the  Palestinians continues, especially since there is not a single  piece of evidence for an Israeli willingness to pull out from  the entire Gaza Strip and the West Bank and Jerusalem. Nor is  there any indication that Israel is willing to entertain the  idea of an independent Palestinian state -- now or in the  future. All of which is not lost on the Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat, who has indicated that he is not pursuing an  independent Palestinian state, but a confederation with Jordan!    That being the case -- in other words, since the Palestinian  leadership has renounced the right to self-determination and an  independent state as stipulated by UN resolutions -- why not  walk out of a sham peace exercise holding no promise of  fulfilling Palestinian rights?    The Palestinian leadership has exhausted its bargaining  chips  at the negotiating table with Israel and failed to get anything  of significance in the way of the national rights of the  Palestinian people. This is because it did not treat UN  resolutions, or the Madrid conference and the land-for-peace  formula as a point of reference. Instead of giving an  affirmative response to President Clinton's invitation for  Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to go to Washington to  conclude a final deal, which, in any case, can by no means  advance national, legitimate Palestinian rights, the Palestinian  leadership might have suspended the talks, or attached  courageous strings to their resumption.    It is worth recalling here Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres' remark that Israel was negotiating with itself and  dictating terms.    I will go so far as to call on the Palestinian leadership to  withdraw from the peace process if only to keep from bargaining  away Palestinian rights. I will call on the Palestinian  leadership to let Jordan and Egypt negotiate the future of the  West bank and Gaza on its behalf, since the two territories were  caputured from Jordan and Egypt. The two countries can conduct  the negotiations on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338  stipulating Israeli withdrawal from all the territories Israel  conquered in June, 1967.    If Israel has an interest in true and comprehensive peace,  it  will have to pull out from all occupied Arab territories -- the  Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and south Lebanon  -- in compliance with Resolutions 242, 338, and 425.    If the United States wants to make a go of its peace  initiative and see durable peace, security, and stability  prevail in the region, it will have to talk or coerce Israel  into complying with the UN resolutions on the basis of which its  initiative and the Madrid conference were launched.    I believe the Palestinian leadership must acknowledge its  failure to regain Palestinian rights, and then go on to entrust  this historic and momentous mission to Jordan and Egypt, both of  which are better positioned to do the job. With the right  amount of coordination and solidarity, the cordon states --  Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon -- can regain the occupied  Arab territories. Subsequently, the Palestinian leadership can  take the initiative and claim self-determination from Jordan and  Egypt, and the Palestinian people can exercise their rights  either by setting up their own independent state, forging  confederal or federal ties, or entering into an outright merger  with any of the cordon states. Obviously such a move on the  part of the Palestinian leadership calls for a rare degree of  courage.    I dare say that such a courageous stand would win the  support  of the political and popular circles in the Palestinian, Arab,  and Islamic communities. Will the Palestinian leadership take  inspiration from the holy month of Ramadan and summon the  courage to do the right thing, and thus rob Israel of the chance  of keeping up its genocidal effort against the Palestinian  people?    The bloody dawn's massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque is a  meaningful lesson that ought to be learned.    The Palestinian leadership and the Arab nation must hold  Israel and the U.S. Administration responsible for the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre and its consequences.</p>

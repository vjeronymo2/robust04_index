			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter and "Official Explanation" sent by Carlos Morfin </F> Otero, member of the Mexican Chapter of the Society of Jesus, to  LA JORNADA; place and date not given]    [Text] Mr. Director: On 8 April, the daily newspaper SUMMA  published on its front page a report identifying subcommander  Marcos [of the Zapatist National Liberation Army] as one Father  Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez.    I would appreciate your publishing in your newspaper a note  from the Jesuits of Mexico that denies the information published  in that newspaper.    As we indicated in our communique, public opinion needs  truth. False opinions encourage -- during the difficult times  the nation is experiencing -- slander, violence, instability,  and insecurity.    I reiterate my appreciation for the objectivity that has  characterized LA JORNADA's reporting.    [Signed] Carlos Morfin Otero, S.J.    Member of the Mexican Chapter    Official Explanation by the Jesuits of Mexico:    On 8 April 1994, the daily newspaper SUMMA, whose director  is  Jose Antonio Perez Stuart, published on its front page the  following news: "Marcos" is the Jesuit Jeronimo. This was an  exclusive report for SUMMA by special correspondent Ernesto  Esparza.    The report says that this information came out of an  investigation conducted by a special federal government group  whose operations are headquartered in Chiapas.    The Society of Jesus in Mexico (the Jesuits), reports:    1. Jesuit priest Jeronimo Alberto Hernandez Lopez is not  subcommander Marcos. We would like to state clearly that from 5  August 1992 to 5 April 1994, Father Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez,  S.J., was assigned as a pastor to Guatemalan refugees in  Campeche State.    This information was made public and is known to national  authorities, as is demanded of anyone who wants to work with the  refugees.    2. As of this date, Father Jeronimo Hernandez has been  assigned to our project in Bajon-Arena, Chiapas State.    Attorney General Diego Valades and Goverment Secretary Jorge  Carpizo were duly informed of the preceding.    3. Several days ago Father Jeronimo was interviewed and  photographed by National Security agents from the Campeche State  delegation, allegedly to confirm his whereabouts and his work  with refugees. These agents were provided with the requested  information.    4. We strongly condemn the report published in SUMMA. It is  unprofessional to contribute to slander and insecurity based on  false reports, without indicating who is responsible for the  mentioned investigation. It is very serious to involve the  federal government in general. That report should be added to a  long list of false information orchestrated by some media.  Public opinion demands the truth. False opinions encourage --  during the difficult times the nation is experiencing --  slander, violence, instability, and insecurity.    [Signed] Carlos Marfin Otero, S.J.    Member of the Mexican Chapter</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As reported earlier, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, arrived in Bishkek  yesterday. Vladimir Shumeyko and Medetkhan Sherimkulov, chairman  of the Jogorku Kenesh, addressed journalists.    [Begin recording] [Sherimkulov] I am pleased to greet  Vladimir Philippovich in Kyrgyzstan. He is highly respected by  all of us. We have centuries-old friendly relations with Russia  and I hope that we, with Vladimir Philippovich and our  parliaments, will do everything so as to maintain and facilitate  friendly and close cooperation between our states and our people.    [Shumeyko] A parliamentary delegation from Azerbaijan has  visited us recently. It was led by the chairman of its Supreme  Soviet, and he and I have agreed to give an impetus [words  indistinct] to the meeting in Bishkek and peacemaking efforts,  which are being taken by a group from the Interparliamentary  Assembly led by Medetkhan Sherimkulovoch, his personal visit to  [words indistinct].    I believe it is useful for three heads of parliaments of the  three member-states of the Interparliamentary Assembly to gather  here. We have agreed to consider Nagorno-Karabakh as one of the  sides involved in the conflict. I emphasize here: one of the  sides of the conflict. You know that Azerbaijan's policy was  that only two states are involved in the conflict, Armenia and  Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh is [words indistinct] of the  conflict. I believe that considering it as one of the  participants of the conflict is a (?major step). A possibility  for holding talks at the level of heads of parliaments [words  indistinct] the previous activity of our peacemaking group which  is led by Medetkhan Sherimkulovich. It has done quite a lot in  preparing grounds for the talks. I pin hopes on common sense.    [Sherimkulov] [Words indistinct] the Interparliamentary  Assembly led by Vladimir Philippovich Shumeyko will give a  certain weight to the talks [words indistinct]. Indeed, we hope  that we will be able to get off the ground in solving this  problem. We know that both Azerbaijan and Armenia and  Nagorno-Karabakh [words indistinct] this pointless bloody war  which killed people, has made thousands of people homeless,  increased the number of refugees and destroyed their homes.  There has never been a case before when heads of parliament  gathered together and sat around a negotiating table. This has  never happened before at such a level. I think that this is a  good sign.    [Shumeyko] You can't look without optimism at life. I can't  give any other example [words indistinct]. We, at the  Interparliamentary Assembly, or in other words parliamentarians,  representing their own people, do not have the right to leave  this mattter unattended and to be pessimistic about it despite  all the difficulties. We should work hard on settling this  conflict, no matter how long it takes. That's what we intend to  do. [end recording]</p>

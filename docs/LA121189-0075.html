			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMIT ON BANK INVESTMENTS NOT EXPECTED TO FALL;  </P> <P> LAW: A PROPOSAL TO REPEAL GLASS-STEAGALL GETS A MIXED REACTION. FEW BANKS IN  CALIFORNIA ARE MOVING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BROADER POWERS.  </P> <P> Banking's Berlin Wall is still a long way from coming down, even though it is  showing new cracks.  </P> <P> The barrier is the federal Glass-Steagall Act, which since 1933 has established  a legal barrier prohibiting commercial banks from entering investment banking  activities, such as underwriting stocks. The law, passed during the Great  Depression amid fears that securities operations could cause banks to collapse,  has long been criticized by banks as outdated.  </P> <P> Despite advances made the past two years by banks taking advantage of softening  regulations and an apparent weakening this month in opposition by the  securities industry's trade group, few believe that the barrier will fall soon.  What's more, it also is uncertain how interested banks are in getting into the  securities business while it is so soft.  </P> <P> Major New York money center banks, such as Bankers Trust, J. P. Morgan, Chase  Manhattan, Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover, are leading the way and have  been moving into areas allowed by banking regulators.  </P> <P> On the West Coast, Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles has clearly been the  most active, and its desire to expand into investment banking is clear, as  evidenced by stakes that it owns in securities firms in London, Australia and  Canada.  </P> <P> Beyond that, few West Coast banks have made serious moves toward investment  banking, mainly because federal regulations make it hard for all but the  nation's largest banks to get involved.  </P> <P> The most recent breakthrough came earlier this month when the Securities  Industry Assn., the brokerage-industry trade group that has fought bank entry  into the business in the past, adopted a position that would repeal  Glass-Steagall in exchange for various privileges for brokerages, such as  direct access to the Federal Reserve funds in a crisis.  </P> <P> Bankers have criticized the proposal because, they say, it provides murky  rights for banks and may include too many restrictions on their activities,  such as curbs on making loans to companies that receive underwriting services  from a bank's securities operation.  </P> <P> Reaction was mixed as well among banks on the significance of the announcement.  Some said it was significant if only because the association moved on the  issue. Yet others disagree, saying that the proposal contains too many strings.  </P> <P> "The proposal is nothing terribly novel," said Security Pacific Corp. Vice  Chairman David R. Lovejoy. He argues that the proposal contains more  restrictions than are already in place.  </P> <P> Banking companies have been allowed some securities-related activity under  Glass-Steagall, such as operating discount brokerages and underwriting  government securities.  </P> <P> During the past two years, regulators have chipped away at the law by allowing  banks such expanded powers as underwriting commercial paper (which is a  short-term IOU), securities backed by mortgages and, most recently, corporate  debt. Next year, regulators are expected to grant the power to underwrite  stocks.  </P> <P> There is a big catch. The operations must be set up in a subsidiary, and the  newer powers granted in the past two years may make up only 10% of the unit's  business. The rest must be in business long allowed under Glass-Steagall, such  as underwriting U.S. government securities and general-obligation municipal  bonds. In addition, there are barriers designed to put distance between a  bank's securities and banking operations.  </P> <P> Jerry Loeser, senior vice president in the legal department for First  Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, notes that the 10% restriction means that  banks must do a huge business in the areas where they traditionally have been  permitted to operate in order to generate any meaningful business. As a result,  he said, the huge money center banks in New York, which are already active in  such areas as government securities and municipal bonds, have been the primary  ones to take advantage of the chipping away at the law.  </P> <P> He said First Interstate has been inactive for several reasons, including the  10% restriction and a change in its strategic direction, which has seen it  restructure and emphasize such areas as consumer banking.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in California, BankAmerica in San Francisco also has been less active  as it has gone through its recent turnaround and pushed harder into consumer  banking. Wells Fargo has been relatively inactive, emphasizing consumer banking  as well as real estate lending and financing leveraged buyouts, in which  companies are purchased with large amounts of debt that is paid off with funds  generated from operations or asset sales.  </P> <P> Although relatively inactive for now, Union Bank, which is controlled by the  Bank of Tokyo, ultimately is interested in investment banking, a bank spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Lovejoy said one area that could be lucrative for banks if the restrictions  fall is mortgage-backed securities. He notes that banks could underwrite  securities backed by the billions of dollars in mortgages that they generate  themselves.  </P> <P> Samuel J. Baptista, president of the Financial Services Council, a group of  banks, brokerages and financial services firms that favors breaking down  financial industry barriers, said it will take lengthy negotiations among  banks, brokerages and insurance companies to reach agreements so that they  enter each other's businesses.  </P></p>

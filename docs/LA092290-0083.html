			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZULUS' LEADER BUTHELEZI WELCOMES MANDELA TALKS  </P> <P> Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi on Friday cautiously welcomed an  invitation from Nelson Mandela's African National Congress for talks next month  on ending South Africa's township carnage.  </P> <P> It would be the first meeting since Mandela's release from jail last February  between the ANC deputy president and the conservative Buthelezi, whose  supporters are fighting a bloody battle for supremacy in black townships.  </P> <P> Buthelezi, head of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, said he would be  delighted to attend if the ANC is sincere in wanting to end the strife between  the two movements.  </P> <P> "I state firstly that these are welcome developments. Secondly, however, I must  state that they need to be seen in their proper perspective," Buthelezi said in  a statement.  </P> <P> He said the ANC had suggested Oct. 5 for the meeting.  </P> <P> Buthelezi said he had been invited along with the leaders of South Africa's 10  quasi-autonomous homelands, created by the white government to perpetuate the  apartheid system.  </P> <P> He said he will attend "because Dr. Mandela and I must get together as  respective leaders of the two dominant black political organizations involved  in the violence."  </P> <P> About 760 people have died in fighting between Inkatha and the ANC in the past  six weeks. More than 4,000 people have died in a four-year virtual civil war  between the two movements in South Africa's Natal province.  </P> <P> Mandela has until now refused to meet Buthelezi face to face, accusing the Zulu  leader of trying to shoot his way into the ANC's negotiations on black  power-sharing with President Frederik W. de Klerk's government.  </P> <P> But after three days of talks between ANC and Inkatha officials, the parties  decided that a meeting with all homeland leaders, including Buthelezi, is  necessary to get to the root of the violence.  </P> <P> Mandela toned down his previous criticism of Buthelezi, describing him on  British television as "My old friend. He is still my friend."  </P> <P> In interviews on ABC and NBC Friday, Mandela said the peace process is  threatened and he will arm ANC members unless De Klerk's government does  something to stop the violence.  </P> <P> Townships around Johannesburg remained calm Friday, and South Africa's top  policeman, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, said a weeklong lull in the fighting  resulted partly from a security clampdown ordered last weekend by De Klerk.  </P></p>

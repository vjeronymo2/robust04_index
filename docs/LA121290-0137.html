			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOLLARS AND SCENTS;  </P> <P> FASHION: IN THE PERFUME GAME, A CELEBRITY'S IMAGE MAY MEAN THE SWEET SMELL OF  SUCCESS -- BUT NOT ALWAYS.  </P> <P> Lips are sealed as to what actually happened in that out-of-court settlement  between Elizabeth Taylor and her onetime boyfriend, Henry Wynberg. But some  perfume pundits suggest that Liz should have given Henry a generous settlement  for all the free publicity her lawsuit and his countersuit generated for her  best-selling fragrance just as the holiday season kicked into high gear.  </P> <P> Indeed, the dispute over who got what profits and just who concocted the floral  scent seemed as if it could have been devised by a diabolically clever  advertising team. Lurid sexual histories, greed and long-dead passions were  splashed across front pages of newspapers across America generating name  recognition that publicists drool over.  </P> <P> "Given that it's a few weeks before Christmas, the timing is extraordinary,"  sighed Lawrence Pesin, whose firm, Colonia, puts out a celebrity fragrance  called "Moments," personified by Priscilla Presley. Analysts say the fragrance  industry rakes in about half its $4 billion in sales during the December  shopping frenzy.  </P> <P> With eyes of violet and a perfume bottle to match, Liz is reigning comfortably  over the celebrity scent market with $70 million in annual sales from the  fragrance she launched with Chesebrough-Ponds in 1987. (Two years later she  added Elizabeth Taylor's "Passion for Men.")  </P> <P> But a host of other celebrity scents with such coy names as "Only," "Misha,"  "Moments," "Listen," "California," "Spectacular," "Sophia," "Deneuve," "Forever  Krystle," "Electric Youth," "Undeniable" and "Uninhibited" are now jockeying  for space on the increasingly crowded shelves of department stores and  drugstores and even in the satchels of door-to-door Avon ladies.  </P> <P> Overkill, you might ask?  </P> <P> Not on your life, say most distributors, who add that as long as American women  have ears, they will yearn to dab the newest celebrity perfumes behind them.  </P> <P> There are 800 fragrances on the market and 60 new scents debut annually. But  with six out of seven failing, and fragrance sales down 40% this holiday  season, celebrities offer perfume manufacturers an invaluable  cachet-by-association in an industry that hawks hope by the pricey half-ounce.  </P> <P> Celebrity scents are most successful when a host of intangible and mundane  variables come together, including the star's image, the way that image is  promoted in an attempt to strike an emotional chord with the buying public,  relentless in-store appearances with all the trappings of a three-ring circus  and lastly, a pleasing "juice," as scents are known in the industry.  </P> <P> Besides "Passion," "Jaclyn Smith's California," Priscilla Presley's "Moments"  and Mikhail Baryshnikov's "Misha" are some of the success stories cited by  analysts.  </P> <P> But celebrity scents can belly-flop when even one variable veers out of orbit.  Cher's "Uninhibited," Joan Collins' "Spectacular" and Catherine Deneuve's  "Deneuve" show that star quality does not necessarily ensure a successful  perfume. Analysts say all three were potential mega-sellers whose marketing  campaigns failed to capture the imagination and pocketbooks of the fickle  public.  </P> <P> The complicated tango that brings stars and fragrances together varies with  each set of players. Contact is often initiated by manufacturers, who present  marketing proposals and vie with each other to make a deal. But celebrities are  often just waiting for a good opportunity to license their names.  </P> <P> Some are content to adopt a laissez-faire attitude and leave the fragrance  testing to the experts, collecting a licensing fee and customary royalties of  3% to 5%. Others shudder at slapping their name across a product they haven't  personally supervised, tested and approved.  </P> <P> Ballet dancer, choreographer and actor Mikhail Baryshnikov, for instance, whose  women's fragrance "Misha" has enjoyed success, insisted on creative control  over all details from the design of the bottle -- a conical shape suggesting  twirling, or perhaps a pirouette -- to the packaging, marketing and the scent  itself, according to Richard Barrie, president and chairman of Richard Barrie  Fragrances Inc., a small perfume marketer in New York.  </P> <P> Baryshnikov received $250,000 last year for putting his name on the fragrance.  He is guaranteed an annual licensing fee that increases to $750,000 by 1995,  according to reports. Barrie, who spent 23 years with Faberge before launching  his own firm, said he wooed the ballet star for months, winning a commitment by  promising to start a company devoted to the fragrance.  </P> <P> Credited in the fragrance industry with running a shrewd marketing campaign,  Barrie expects $7 million in retail sales for 1990, recouping his $4 million in  initial promotional costs.  </P> <P> "We weren't looking for big dollars. We were looking for a foothold and an  opportunity to grow and establish a world-class brand that . . . in 10 years  will be a classic," he says.  </P> <P> Some public relations departments go to great lengths to paint their  celebrities as people of infinite creativity who spend months tracking down the  elusive blend of orangeflower, patchouli, sandalwood, gardenia, jasmine and  ylang-ylang that will make the public swoon.  </P> <P> "Jaclyn was involved in every step of the process," says a press release by Max  Factor for "Jaclyn Smith's California," which also quotes the actress: "My new  fragrance has the freshness of flowers and warm wood undertones. It's very  sensuous, but with California's lively sparkle." The perfume debuted in April,  1989, and sales were in excess of $50 million in the first year.  </P> <P> Billy Dee Williams, whose fast-moving fragrance "Undeniable" is sold  door-to-door by Avon Products and is expected to pull in $22 million in sales  this year, was not involved in creating the scent, according to Evette O.  Beckett, Avon's director of fragrance marketing.  </P> <P> "We pretty much led the project ourselves," she adds. "Of course, we reviewed  it with him and he was pleased with it. But he didn't necessarily have  approval."  </P> <P> Sometimes scents can backfire even when celebrities participate in the entire  process. Cher's "Uninhibited," manufactured by a subsidiary of Avon Products  called Parfums Stern, shows how easily star fragrances can turn into stinkers.  </P> <P> "Don't quote me, but it bombed," sniffs one competitor of the scent, whose  bottle mixes Art Deco and heavy-metal hardware. The flash is capped by an  opaque plastic seashell nestled in a studded metal crescent moon -- but it has  disappeared from most department stores.  </P> <P> "The fragrance and the packaging didn't work at all," says Annette Green of the  Fragrance Foundation in New York. "Cher is a sexy, opinionated woman and I  don't think the marketing campaign conveyed that. I mean, what does Cher have  to do with Art Deco?"  </P> <P> To be sure, purchases zoomed whenever Cher made in-store appearances.  Salesclerks dutifully doled out chain-mail earrings with each purchase to evoke  outfits worn by the well-sculpted star, and sales were $15 million in 1988. But  sales tapered after Cher stopped stumping for "Uninhibited," and analysts say  the fragrance did less than $10 million in sales last year.  </P> <P> Considering that the scent may have outsold Barishnikov's, is that so bad?  </P> <P> "That was a brand they had high expectations for a certain size market and  longevity," says Susan Babinsky, a market analyst who tracks the fragrance  industry for the Kline Group in New Jersey.  </P> <P> In March, Sanofi Beauty Products, which bought Parfums Stern from Avon this  year, put "Uninhibited" on the auction block, and industry analysts say Cher  bought back the distribution rights and is shopping for a new distributor.  </P> <P> "Cher felt that it would not be fair to ask (her fans) to continue to buy a  perfume that did not live up to her quality standards," her publicist said in a  prepared statement. "Cher maintains that Parfums Stern did not live up to its  initial promises regarding the packaging, marketing and distribution."  </P> <P> Another scent that nose-dived was "Deneuve," named after classically beautiful  blond actress Catherine Deneuve and distributed by Avon Products. Women  apparently were put off by Deneuve's ice-queen look and the scent evaporated  alongside Avon's profits.  </P> <P> In contrast, Cheseborough Ponds' research into the popularity of Elizabeth  Taylor indicated the actress's romantic, schmaltzy image and her series of  personal misfortunes inspired awe as well as empathy in men and women of all  ages, sexes and colors. Almost everyone could relate to Liz on some level, from  her well-publicized marriages and love affairs to bouts with substance abuse  and illness, charity work and lifelong battle with weight.  </P> <P> "People love Liz, they feel protective of her. She's the last great star," says  the Fragrance Foundation's Green.  </P> <P> She is also a great target, analysts say. Wynberg's suit was the second one  filed over her perfume. Several years ago, Parisian perfumer Annick Goutal sued  Taylor for using the name "Passion," which Goutal had trademarked and used for  one of her own best-selling perfumes. La Liz's fragrance -- which her publicist  said she was intimately involved in selecting and marketing -- is now known  officially as "Elizabeth Taylor's Passion."  </P> <P> Squeaky-clean teen singer Debbie Gibson's "Electric Youth," which did a brisk  $15 million in sales last year, illustrates that perfumes don't need universal  appeal to succeed.  </P> <P> "Electric Youth" comes in a hot-pink half-ounce bottle ($8.50 per half-ounce)  and smells like strawberry bubble gum. Gibson's teen-age fans have spritzed  themselves silly on the stuff and Revlon tied in marketing to Gibson's 1989  "Electric Youth" album, which sold 4 million copies.  </P> <P> Some advertising ploys seem downright hokey. When Jaclyn Smith couldn't make  some of the in-store appearances that Max Factor had scheduled for her  "lifestyle" fragrance "Jaclyn Smith's California," the firm put up life-size  cardboard cut-outs instead.  </P> <P> And some press agents get carried away, too. A spokeswoman for "Undeniable" by  Billy Dee Williams suggests that the perfume bottle "is very curvaceous. It  sort of reminds you of a woman."  </P> <P> "Billy Dee is not just a pretty face," she says. "He has an artistic side and  he's a very sensual person. Who better than Billy Dee Williams to know what a  woman would want in a perfume?"  </P> <P> It's too early to know whether many of today's celebrity scents have the "legs"  (staying power in perfume parlance) to take their place among classics such as  Chanel No. 5 and Guerlain's "L'Heure Bleue." Some released in the past 10 years  -- Sophia Loren's "Sophia," Linda Evans' "Forever Krystle" (after her  character, Krystle Carrington, on the soap opera "Dynasty") and Candice  Bergen's "Cie" -- had strong heydays but are faltering or have already fizzled.  </P> <P> Dionne Warwick's "Dionne" fragrance dropped off perfume counters last year and  reappeared as prizes for dancers on the TV show, "Soul Train."  </P> <P> But research has shown that it's never too late to begin marketing a celebrity  scent.  </P> <P> The executors of the estates of Ernest Hemingway and Elvis Presley are  considering licensing the dead stars' names for celebrity scents.  </P></p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Indonesia's fixed cellular revolution A revolution waiting to happen in the telecommunications industry is the development of radio-based local networks able fully to replace the fixed wire. When it happens, the cost of building and maintaining local connections could plummet, with incalculable consequences for competition and the extension of telecoms in developing countries. Like many revolutions, it is unlikely to happen overnight. Radio technology is already integral to telecoms, notably in cellular mobile telephony. Imminent is the development of local radio networks for 'fixed' telephones, which are price competitive with existing wireline networks. In the developed world, such networks are likely to be feature mainly in niche markets. Telia, Sweden's state telecoms company, already provides many of its remote rural subscribers with cellular phones instead of 'wireline' connections. Ionica, a private UK operator, plans to launch a nationwide service next year to closely targetted markets. Indonesia, however, may offer a significant pointer for the developing world. Indonesia boasts 16 telephone lines per 1,000 people, compared with 460 per 1,000 in the UK. This puts it towards the bottom of the telephony league, even in the Asia-Pacific region. To help achieve rapid line growth the Indonesian government has licensed a company to build a 'fixed cellular' network in urban areas. The network is for fixed phones serviced by radio base stations. Connection and call charges will be the same as for conventional fixed-line phones, but the monthly rental will be at a premium to reflect the shorter waiting period for connection. It currently takes about two years to get a phone line: Ratelindo, the new fixed cellular operator, claims it will be able to meet demand within months. Ratelindo, a joint venture between Indonesia's state-owned telecoms operator and Bakrie Electronics, a private company, is licensed to provide 280,000 fixed cellular connections - 250,000 in Jakarta and 30,000 in West Java. In effect it is competing with the state operator, and hopes to have made 50,000 connections by the end of the year. Ratelindo's fixed cellular system - supplied by Hughes, a US manufacturer - is a flexible overlay network based on the TDMA system. Ratelindo claims that it provides a voice quality equal to that of a fixed-wire phone. Hardianto Kamarga, president-director of Ratelindo, hails the Hughes system as a breakthrough. He claims it is 'the most spectrum efficient digital cellular technology commercially available today,' with about three times the capacity - that is subscribers per base station - of GSM, the digital cellular mobile system used in Europe. 'The fixed cellular system has a subscriber capacity equal to between 10 and 20 per cent of the fixed network,' says Kamarga. As for the cost: 'land-line telephones are inherently less expensive than comparable wireless systems for the same traffic capacity, but in the operating environment we have in Indonesia the balance can swing in favour of wireless.' Put bluntly, that means a price-competitive service can be provided because of the inefficiency of the existing state operator. Yet the same is likely to be true across the developing world. For 280,000 Indonesians, the immediate choice is a fixed cellular phone or nothing. Faced with the same choice, millions on waiting lists across Asia, Africa and Latin America may embrace fixed cellular phones with alacrity.</p>

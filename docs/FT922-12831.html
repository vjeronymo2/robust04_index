			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Parliament's champion takes on Yeltsin SCARCELY noticed by the outside world, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Russian parliament's powerful chairman, has been pulling the strings in this week's showdown between the government and parliament, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Although a tentative peace was reached yesterday without his involvement, he will remain a key figure after the dust settles from this conflict and the ground is prepared for an inevitable second round. The cabinet, pushed to the brink of resigning by Mr Khasbulatov's attempts to be the key influence over both economic policy and the government, will today try to make the settlement of the reform issue as final as possible. 'I think he wants absolute power,' warned one cabinet minister. 'He wants to have the government under the full control of parliament, one that is his own.' Sometimes his behaviour is counterproductive, however. On Monday he described the government as 'kids who had lost their nerve', causing such a storm that he felt he had to appear on nationwide television to apologise  - and ended up aiding the government he was seeking to criticise. Behind him stands a solid majority of deputies, elected under an antiquated electoral system which makes them fear for their survival in the new Russia. They initially refused to elect the former economics professor when his candidacy was put forward by President Boris Yeltsin last year, but they have now rallied round him because of his struggle for more powers for parliament. Despite distaste for his often sharp and contemptuous behaviour, their interests now fully coincide. As Russia's parliamentary chairman, Mr Khasbulatov has greater powers than a western-style parliamentary speaker, especially in the legal limbo while Russia decides a new constitution. For months he has carefully cultivated all the interest groups  - from state industry to collective farms to ethnic minorities  - which have been alienated or hurt by the radical market reforms of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister. Making much of his own background in economics, his claims of less painful ways to build a market economy have found lively support. Mr Plotnikov said Mr Khasbulatov was now intent on distancing parliament from the government which he described as 'a deadweight which would drown any swimmer'. 'This cabinet is clearly doomed to go - but only sometime this autumn. At that point it will have to be replaced by others because the population of Russia does not approve of being dragged through such misery.' Mr Khasbulatov has little respect for democratic niceties, saying of Moscow's directly-elected mayor: 'We can remove him as easily as we installed him.' Such a fate might one day befall him. Asked if Mr Khasbulatov could win, Mr Pyotr Filippov, a radical deputy, says: 'In the short-term maybe but not in the long term. The president needs to deliver just one blow.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 2 June, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] disclosed that it plans to conduct a  comprehensive review of its policies regarding the basic  materials industry. Concerns have been voiced about the  industry's losing international competitiveness brought about by  the continued appreciation of the yen against other currencies.  MITI hopes to indirectly promote mergers and tie-ups among  businesses by re-examining the managing of the Antimonopoly Law,  among other ways. It also plans to retain the industry's  competitiveness through cost reduction methods and to improve  the technological infrastructure to establish a technological  information network. In the past, MITI has discussed industrial  policies separately with individual industrial sectors. This  will be its first effort at working out policies for the entire  basic materials industry which transcends the boundaries of  separate industrial sectors.    MITI plans to start full-fledged discussions by setting up  early next month an "Informal Panel on Policies Regarding the  Basic Materials Industry" to serve as a private advisory panel  to the directors of the Basic Industries Bureau and the Consumer  Goods Industries Bureau. The panel will consist of  president-level officials from companies which manufacture basic  materials such as steel, nonferrous materials, chemicals,  cement, and paper and pulp.    The following topics comprise the pillars of the planned  policy review: 1) improvement of the distribution system; 2)  improvement of the technological infrastructure; and 3)  contributions to an environmental-friendly society.    Comcerning improving the distribution system, MITI plans to  take such measures as reviewing the managing of the Antimonopoly  Law in order to laterally support mergers and tie-ups among  firms which are being forced to streamline their operations as a  result of poor business performance. In this way, it plans to  enhance the industry's competitiveness. In addition, the  ministry plans to propose setting up a system of commending  firms which have been able to overcome the problems of  maintaining excessive product quality and providing excessive  services. MITI also plans to have a thorough investigation made  concerning differences in commodity prices at home and abroad  and to urge promoting deregulation to help reduce distribution  and energy costs.    Regarding improving the technological infrastructure, MITI  plans to establish safety standards for basic materials and  chemical products. It also plans to encourage establishing  databases and networks which deal with technological information  related to the bio-technology field.    Computer chemistry has been considered essential to  developing chemical substances. While this has been pointed  out, Japan has lagged behind the United States. Therefore, MITI  plans to respond to this situation by launching a state project.  To break away from the malpractice of excessive quality  maintenance, the ministry also plans to embark on developing new  methods to gauge the durability of basic materials.</p>

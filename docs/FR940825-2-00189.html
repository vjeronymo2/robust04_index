			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Authority for the RERC program of NIDRR is contained in section 204(b)(3) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 760&hyph;762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards to public and private agencies and organizations, including institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations, to conduct research, demonstration, and training activities regarding rehabilitation technology in order to enhance opportunities for meeting the needs of, and addressing the barriers confronted by, individuals with disabilities in all aspects of their lives. An RERC must be operated by or in collaboration with an institution of higher education or a nonprofit organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed priorities support the National Education Goals that call for all children in America to start school ready to learn and for every adult American to possess the skills necessary to compete in a global economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the regulations for this program (see 34 CFR 353.32) the Secretary may establish research priorities by reserving funds to support particular research activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary will announce the final priorities in a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of the Department. Funding of a particular project depends on the final priorities, the availability of funds, and the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice of proposed priorities does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  concurrent with or following the notice of final priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RERCs carry out research or demonstration activities by: (1) Developing and disseminating innovative methods of applying advanced technology, scientific achievement, and psychological and social knowledge to (a) solve rehabilitation problems and remove environmental barriers, and (b) study new or emerging technologies, products, or environments; (2) demonstrating and disseminating (a) innovative models for the delivery of cost-effective rehabilitation technology services to rural and urban areas, and (b) other scientific research to assist in meeting the employment and independent living needs of individuals with severe disabilities; or (3) facilitating service delivery systems change through (a) the development, evaluation, and dissemination of consumer-responsive and individual and family centered innovative models for the delivery to both rural and urban areas of innovative cost-effective rehabilitation technology services, and (b) other scientific research to assist in meeting the employment and independent needs of individuals with severe disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute requires that each applicant for a grant, including an RERC, demonstrate how its proposed activities address the needs of individuals from minority backgrounds who have disabilities. Each RERC must provide training opportunities to individuals, including individuals with disabilities, to become researchers of rehabilitation technology and practitioners of rehabilitation technology in conjunction with institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes that the following requirements apply to the RERCs pursuant to these absolute priorities unless noted otherwise:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RERC (except the RERC on universal telecommunications access) must have the capability to design, build, and test prototype devices and assist in the transfer of successful solutions to the marketplace. The RERC must evaluate the efficacy and safety of its new products, instrumentation, or assistive devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RERC must provide graduate-level research training to build capacity for engineering research in the rehabilitation field and to provide training in the applications of new technology to service providers and to individuals with disabilities and their families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RERC must develop all training materials in formats that will be accessible to individuals with various types of disabilities and communication modes, and widely disseminate findings and products to individuals with disabilities and their families and representatives, service providers, manufacturers and distributors, and other appropriate target populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RERC must involve individuals with disabilities, persons from minority backgrounds with disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members in planning and implementing the research, development, and training programs, in interpreting and disseminating the research findings, and in evaluating the Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RERC must share information and data, and, as appropriate, collaborate on research and training with other NIDRR-supported grantees including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers and other related RERCs and RRTCs. The RERC must work closely with the RERC on Technology Evaluation and Transfer at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priorities.

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The American Way): A beer with a diva in New York's front room / City of bars In Manhattan, diversity is everything. There is something in this inexhaustible city to meet every need, or indulge every fantasy, and its bars are no exception. If you hunger for reggae with your sushi, bikers' leather with your beer, or simply want to prolong the night with a strong drink and a sympathetic ear, Manhattan's bars have it all. There is the saloon that has survived two world wars, two stock market crashes, prohibition and flared trousers, twice. The jazz joint that is so laid back it never bothers to take down the Christmas decorations. Or the bar where regulars gather around an upright piano to belt out Broadway show tunes late into the night. No other city can boast such variety, and nowhere else are bars so tightly woven into the fabric of everyday life. They are not just the preserve of the boisterous male; they are New York's front room. Here are a few of our favourites. ARTHUR'S TAVERN The old man with chalk-white hair and thick black spectacles has been an Arthur's regular since the late 1940s. 'No Cover / No Minimum,' has little to do with his unfailing patronage; it is the music, played in a way and in a place that reminds him of his youth. Arthur's is a rare holdout from the Truman era - Greenwich Village unplugged. Although it is a jazz joint, you do not have to be a jazz buff to enjoy Arthur's. The music never overwhelms, even if you sit at the rickety counter that surrounds the musicians' podium at the back of the bar. The place is so relaxed and unpretentious that it never even bothers to take down its Christmas decorations. There are no cover charges, cappuccino makers and no-smoking signs. 'Look at this place,' says one patron. 'You'd think you were in the 1940s.' MARIE'S CRISIS The barmaid is a diva with thick, false eyelashes, diamond earrings and a provocative walk. His name is Albert Walsh and his large frame is too lumpy for taffeta and velvet. He wears a white tank-top and white shorts. While the drag effect may be half-hearted, the singing is not. Albert puts down his tray of drinks. Pianist Sam Austin, in the middle of a medley from Show Boat, strikes up the crowd-pleasing 'Your Love'. Albert clasps his hands together, cocks his head and bats his eyelashes. His voice soars as if he were on Broadway, centre stage. The patrons, mostly gays and lesbians, are enthralled. Brava diva] they shout. A moment later, Albert is back slinging vodka-and-cranberries and greeting the regulars with a peck on the cheek. Welcome to Marie's Crisis. This old bar - Thomas Paine, author of the Revolutionary War's 'Crisis' papers, died on the site in 1809 - is roaring good fun whether or not you are gay. An appreciation for Sondheim and Rogers and Hammerstein is more important than your sexual preference. People come here to gather around the piano and sing, and almost everyone joins in. There is something wonderful about belting out show tunes with complete strangers and not feeling self conscious. PETE'S TAVERNNestled south of Gramercy Park on a quiet, tree-lined back street, Pete's Tavern fits like a favourite wool cardigan. A 'speakeasy' during the Prohibition era, Pete's has played host to numerous Gotham notables in its 130 years, including the turn-of-the-century writer and celebrated boozer O Henry, and the Tammany Hall Democrats, who struck many political deals here. The atmosphere of those times still lingers in its dark, woody interior - a place for serious drinking and scheming. Pete's is also a bar for all seasons. In winter it is warm and welcoming, in summer, tables snake around the corner of the block outside, and the dark rooms inside offer a blessedly cool refuge from the humid heat. It has all the features of an old New York tavern - a tin ceiling, tiled floors, and cosy wooden booths - and serves food in a couple of converted carriage-house rooms at the back. It is the bar in the front room, however, which lures drinkers back. Often cramped, usually cheerfully noisy, and staffed by wise-cracking bartenders, Pete's is authentic, timeless New York. CAFE LUXEMBOURGIt is midnight and Cafe Luxembourg is changing from Art Deco bistro to Art Deco bar. The kitchen cools down. Three pretty waitresses in tight black dresses and wine-dark lipstick share a strawberry sorbet at the end of the bar. The slinky redhead behind the zinc counter pours Veuve Clicquot into a crystal flute and greets a patron with a kiss while Can't Help Loving That Man Of Mine plays softly in the background. The bar at Cafe Luxembourg, one of the more urbane and vibrant restaurants near the Lincoln Center, is no afterthought even though it is fairly small. Its style is Tenth Arrondissement, pre-war, with its Deco light fixtures, mirrors, black and cream tiles and chrome cash register. Vodka martinis, Chardonnay and champagne are the preferred drinks here. The bartenders are invariably exotic-looking women, some of whom can legitimately say they are between roles. CHUMLEY'SLealand Stanford Chumley, a stage-coach driver turned journalist, would not approve of the 1990s' rendition of the bar he founded in 1927. Back then, the West Village speakeasy was the sequestered court of New York's young Bohemians. It was full of trendy writers, actors and socialists. Die-hard 'Wobblies' - members of the rebellious, left-leaning union that had blossomed before the Great War as the Industrial Workers of the World - made it their refuge. Today, Chumley's is a cacophonous fusion of restaurant and bar, the patrons of which look like they spent their formative years reading MBA textbooks, not Marx. Nonetheless, it is well worth a visit. The food is decent, the beer selection is superb and, clientele aside, it retains the dark, smoky aroma of its Prohibition past. Finding Chumley's is half the fun. It is located behind an unmarked door on enchanting Bedford Street. The original structure was built before the Revolutionary War, in 1732. During any one week, as many as 60 brands - all of them from American micro-breweries - are on tap. A warning: ever faithful to its past, Chumley's does not accept credit cards.

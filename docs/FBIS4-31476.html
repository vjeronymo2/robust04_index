			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 Jun (MTI) -- "The election victory of  the Socialist Party does not mean a leftist turn in Hungary, as  the votes reflect, by and large, equal support for the three  political trends: the left, the conservatives, and the  liberals," President Arpad Goncz and Christian Democratic  People's Party (KDNP) Chairman Laszlo Surjan agreed in talks at  Budapest's parliament on Thursday. The consultation was part of  Goncz's recent series of political discussions with  parliamentary party leaders.    Surjan said he had agreed with the president on the key  importance of a smooth transfer of governmental affairs. They  both supposed that a coalition government would be formed.  Regarding the KDNP's future, Surjan said the party should break  out from the category of a religious party, and emerge in  political life as a socially-committed party with its own system  of values and its own message for the whole of society.</p>

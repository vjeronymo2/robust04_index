"By announcing this change at this time, we  feel that it will give Garry sufficient time to seek alternate employment in  the National Hockey League."  </P> <P> Lariviere, 34, joined the Toronto organization in 1985 as a playing assistant  coach to John Brophy at its AHL affiliate in St. Catharines, Ontario. When  Brophy replaced Dan Maloney as the Maple Leafs' coach for the 1986-87 season,  Lariviere moved up as an assistant.  </P></p>

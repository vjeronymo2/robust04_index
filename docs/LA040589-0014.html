			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAFFITI  </P> <P> Please, please, please don't call these vandals "graffiti artists." This label  lends an air of respectability to this blatant defacement of our neighborhoods,  our freeways, and even in our wilderness areas. Animals spread their scent to  mark their terrority. I think that graffiti is closer to that in spirit than to  art, which evokes creativity, ability and beauty.  </P> <P> Save me from your euphemisms.  </P> <P> CAROL THOMPSON  </P> <P> Anaheim Hills  </P></p>

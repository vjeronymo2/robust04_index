			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> New Sticker Bills: Despite the recent agreement by the Recording Industry Assn.  of America to label explicit recordings, a new stickering proposal was  introduced in the New Jersey Legislature earlier this month by State Sen.  Gerald Cardinale.  </P> <P> A similar bill passed the Louisiana House of Representatives at the same time  by State Rep. Ted Haik. In a related move, Congressman Howard Nielsen (R-Utah)  also introduced a federal resolution calling for the music industry to revise  its voluntary stickering plan. The resolution, which carries no legal  authority, calls for implementation of a warning label "displayed in a  prominent and standard location in eye-catching color" that would reveal "full  disclosure of lyrical content."

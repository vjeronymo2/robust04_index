			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zapaca Governor (Augusto Cesar Riaza) and </F> Antonio Ramirez Rivas, president of the Department Electoral  Board, by reporter Elias Castro at the Department Electoral  Board Headquarters in Zapaca--live]    [Text] [Castro] We now have a report from the Department  Electoral Board Headquarters. We have statements by the Zapaca  Department governor as well as by Antonio Ramirez Rivas,  president of the Department Electoral Board. We will listen  first to Governor (Augusto Cesar Riaza's) comments on this  event. The department governor will now address our listeners  via Emisoras Unidas, and he will let us know if any incidents  have occurred and announce any other information he can provide  concerning the referendum. Good morning, Mr. Governor; the  microphones are yours.    [Riaza] Since the voting centers opened this morning at  0700,  voting throughout the ten municipalities has been taking place  quite peacefully. We know of no abnormal incidents that could  tarnish the referendum.    [Castro] Mr. Governor, have you traveled throughout the  other  municipalities or just certain ones?    [Riaza] I personally toured three municipalities, but some  of  ny assistants are keeping me abreast of what is developing in  the various municipalities. They have advised me that voting is  taking place quite normally and that there are no problems now.  We expect [words indistinct] there has been low voters turnout  in certain places. I believe this is because it is still too  early. About 10 or 20 minutes ago we received reports from  [word indistinct], where only 6 percent of the total number of  voters has already voted.    [Castro] Mr. Governor, we have observed security forces near  the voting centers. Have you received any special instructions  in this regard?    [Riaza] Yes we did. The security forces have been placed  near the voting centers. According to a request by the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE], the security agents will not be  stationed inside the voting centers, but they are close by  should any incident take place. As I already mentioned, no  incidents have occurred so far.    [Castro] I appreciate the information provided by Governor  (Augusto Cesar Riaza) and his participation here today. The  Department Electoral Board president will now state why the  Zapaca voting centers will be closing at 1700 and cite other  information he can about the voting centers.    [Ramirez] First of all, I would like to thank you for the  opportunity to address the Guatemalan people. You are always  where the news is to be found. I would like to say the  legislation regulating the referendum and the political parties  allows us to establish when voting is to conclude. Considering  the events that have been taking place during the past days  regarding attacks and the possibility that electricity may be  cut, we have decided it would be better to conclude at 1700,  because there will still be enough light at that time, and we  will be able to receive information from the voting centers. We  have already issued a press bulletin in which we officially  announced that voting will conclude at 1700. So far, the  municipalities have reported that voting is taking place quite  normally and peacefully. Our observers have noted, however, low  voter turnout. By 1000, our observer at Rio Hondo reported that  only 200 voters had participated.    [Castro] Will we be having another report soon, and what  time  will it take place? [Ramirez] I would like to say, according  to information I have received, every municipal Electoral Board  president must report to us by 1400 and 1600. They must notify  us via telephone.</p>

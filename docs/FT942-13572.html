			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Delays on DTI initiatives worry industry A backlog is building up on a number of important initiatives promised by the Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Mr Michael Heseltine. The delays  - some of many months  - are creating uncertainty and threatening to damage business, according to industrialists. The longest delay  - 21 months  - is over plans to privatise the Post Office. The Post Office's future was reviewed by the DTI in the summer of 1992 but the department is yet to decide on how it should be privatised. Other areas affected are the domestic gas market, where deregulation plans are now several months overdue, and the power generation market, where a review of the nuclear industry promised for last December has yet to materialise. Further initiatives which appear to have stalled include plans announced last July to privatise the Patent Office and Companies House. The DTI was last week unable to give any indication of when further announcements on these initiatives might be expected. A senior official said: 'With all these reviews it is more important to get it right than stick to an artificial timetable. It is far worse to get it wrong and publish quickly. 'The accusation that we have been dithering is unfair. We are determined to publish the reviews in our own time and we will not be pushed by the outside vested interests saying 'publish now, now, now'.' Close colleagues of Mr Heseltine in the Commons argue that it would be 'political suicide' for him to publish the conclusions of some of the reviews so soon before next month's local elections and June's elections to the European parliament. 'The headlines would not be worth thinking about,' said one senior backbencher, fearful that his constituents would link Post Office privatisation to closure of rural post offices. According to DTI officials, many of these measures have been held up by technicalities and the weight of work on privatisations. In the case of the nuclear review, a decision to expand the nuclear power industry could be threatened by legal challenges. Fear of a backlash in the local and European elections may also have been a factor in the delay on gas deregulation which  - according to critics  - could lead to price increases. The delays are creating uncertainties among investors and managers in the industries affected. In the gas industry, where dozens of independent companies are gearing up for the planned ending of British Gas's monopoly, the delay is holding up investment decisions. In the nuclear industry, where state-owned Nuclear Electric is hoping to be privatised, there is concern that the delay in the nuclear review could indicate that privatisation might be scrapped as too controversial.

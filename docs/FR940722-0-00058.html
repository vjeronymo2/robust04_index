			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The commission will determine the minimum data collection requirements for each applicant or group of applicants. Data collection and analysis may proceed concurrently with the development of mining and reclamation plans. The data requirements will be based on: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The extent of currently available hydrologic, geologic, and other information described under [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The data collection and analysis guidelines developed and provided by the commission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to expand the basis upon which the requirements will be based, as outlined at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a). Specifically, as proposed, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) will now require that the data requirements be based upon all information described at proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) is consistent with the recently revised Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.9(b), which lists the specific technical services authorized for the SOAP and provides, among other things, that ``[t]he program administrator shall determine the data needed for each applicant or group of applicants.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Director finds that NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) is consistent with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9(b) and is approving the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> f. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1), Small Operator Assistance_Assistance Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to delete the portion of NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1) that prohibits the use of SOAP funds to cover the costs of test boring or core sampling. The proposed revision is consistent with section 507(c)(1)(C) of SMCRA and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.9(b)(2), which allow the use of SOAP funds to cover the cost of geologic drilling and statement of results of test borings and core samplings required by section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed revision at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> g. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a) Through (e), Small Operator Assistance_Applicant Liability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a) through (e), the regulatory provisions that outline the circumstances under which an applicant must reimburse the commission for the cost of SOAP services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08, Introductory Text <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The introductory text at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1) provides: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant shall reimburse the commission for the cost of all services rendered under this chapter [i.e., NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29] if *&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(h) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 795.12(a) require, under specified circumstances, that a small operator reimburse the regulatory authority for the cost of all SOAP services, which, in accordance with section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA, includes the cost of training assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By comparison, North Dakota's proposed statutory change at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), proposed by the State in ``Amendment XVIII'' did not include training costs as an obligation for reimbursement by the operator. (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue). Moreover, the proposed introductory text to NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08 only refers to ``services rendered under [NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29]'' which do not include training assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as discussed in the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue, section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA specifically references only ``the Secretary.'' OSM currently interprets ``the Secretary'' to mean the Secretary of the Interior, and not State regulatory authorities. Therefore, at the current time North Dakota is not obligated to provide training under SOAP. Accordingly, North Dakota's proposed introductory text at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08 is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA and no less effective than the recently revised Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and (c) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and (c) to require that the applicant shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all SOAP services rendered under the NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the applicant submits false information, the applicant fails to submit a permit application within one year after receiving the approved report from the qualified public or private entity, or the applicant fails to mine after obtaining the permit. North Dakota's proposed revision of its rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and (c) are substantively similar to and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the corresponding Federal provisions at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

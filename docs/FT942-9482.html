			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Direct Line may launch credit card Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, is considering launching a credit card as part of its attempt to step up sales of other financial services products to its customers. The move could lead to stiffer competition among credit card issuers because of Direct Line's ability to use its customer database to target lower-risk card users. Card issuers are competing to attract such customers. Carmakers including General Motors and Ford have issued credit cards which offer users savings on new cars. But although these cards have been successful, large banks still dominate the market. Direct Line might use its successful red telephone-on-wheels advertising logo as a trademark for a credit card. However, the idea is seen as a long-term project, and would follow launches of other financial products. Mr Peter Wood, the company's chief executive, said: 'We are queuing up products to go out, but you can't do everything at once.' Direct Line is to launch a pilot scheme to sell mortgages in the summer and plans to begin sales of simple protection life assurance products next year after the expected authorisation of its life assurance subsidiary. Direct Line Life Assurance would specialise in sales of term assurance and income-protection plans, again mainly cross-selling to existing customers. Another new initiative is a separate motor insurance company, jointly owned by Royal Bank of Scotland and Mr Wood, which would specialise in so-called 'non-standard' risks, such as fast cars and younger drivers.

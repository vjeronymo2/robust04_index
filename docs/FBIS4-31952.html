			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 17 June carries in its  regular four-minute newscast several reports confirming  cease-fire violations in the republic.    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation  overnight and says that "this has been one of the hardest nights  since the beginning of the chetnik aggression and particularly  since the outbreak of the armed rebellion organized by the  Kladusa outlaw [Fikret Abdic] in the border areas of the Cazin  and Velika Kladusa communes. Overnight, and particularly after  0300, the chetniks from the so-called Serbian autonomous  province of Krajina used artillery to pound the wider areas of  Skokovi, Pecigrad, Todorovo, and [name indistinct]. In addition  to howitzers, they used multiple rocket launchers, so that the  Cazin citizens are in shelters. The forces of the traitor army  savagely attacked Pecigrad and Todorovo. As the attacks are  still in progress we have no information on the consequences."    The 206th Chivalrous Zvornik Brigade Information Service  correspondent reports that "the aggressor is continuing the  usual cease-fire violations. In the course of the afternoon  hours until late into the night, antiaircraft machine gun and  small arms provocations were registered in Sapna, Kraljevici,  and Kobilici, and along the forward defense lines in the area.  The aggressor used 120-mm mortars to target our positions on  Skakovica and Pandurica. The chetniks are continuing their  provocations in the morning hours, but our troops are not  responding."    Kladanj correspondent (?Muris Seho) reports that "in the  course of the night, our defense lines on the southeastern part  of the Kladanj front were targeted by the Romanija chetniks.  The enemy mortars, Praga, and antiaircraft machine guns were  particularly directed at the region of Konjevici. Ten 82-mm  shells landed in the area. The chetniks from Hadzici continued  small arms' provocations."    The 3d Corps Press Center correspondent reports that "the  chetniks must have signed the cease-fire agreement using  invisible ink, because events on the fronts in the 3d Corps  theater of operations cannot be described as a cease-fire. The  attacks were fiercest on the Zavidovici front, where the attacks  began with the pounding of our defense lines in Hajdarevici and  Imamovici. An infantry attack followed. Antiaircraft and small  arms' provocations were registered on the Doboj and Teslic  fronts. The rapid passage of buses and trucks on the  Doboj-Pridjel-Preslica route is proof that they are preparing to  launch fresh attacks in this area. The situation was similar on  the (?Seric) front. Our troops are not responding to the  provocations."</p>

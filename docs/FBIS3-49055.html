			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pawel Jablonski: "Inflation Still Dangerous"] </F>   [Text] The National Bank of Poland [NBP] has prepared  another "Report on the Condition of Money"; this time the report  is devoted to the situation in 1993. The authors of this report  attempted to evaluate the way money is fulfilling its  fundamental function: the function of a measure of value. A  lot of attention was given to inflation as a process that  restricts purchasing power. In 1993, it was possible to limit  inflation quite considerably; however, it is still high and the  sources that cause it have not disappeared.    The main factor that increases inflation, on the side of  demand, is the persistently large budget deficit. As a result  of the need to service this debt, instead of extending credits  to companies, banks are loaning money to the budget, which  offers high interest rates. This, in turn, has brought on  higher interest rates for credits to companies.    The growth of wage levels also contributed to the fact that  demand inflation lingered on. In the costs of obtaining  incomes, the share of wages increased from 11.3 percent in 1991  to 11.5 percent in 1992, and to 12 percent in the first six  months of 1993.    The factors that are the main sources of cost-induced  inflation are increases in prices regulated by the government --  prices that are raised until they reach world levels, or until  they reach the level corresponding to the costs of production or  maintenance (apartment rents). It is estimated that the  23-percent price increase in the first three quarters of 1993  was caused, in at least 67 percent of the cases, by  cost-and-price impulses brought on by government's decisions.  In addition, the creeping devaluation of the zloty is a  constant cost impulse. Costs also increased as a result of the  fixed devaluation of the zloty in August. Moreover, higher  inflation was the result of the raising of the turnover tax and  the introduction of the VAT.    NBP believes that despite stabilization measures, there is a  danger that inflation may increase. This becomes particularly  clear if we collate the indicators of the growth of prices for  consumption goods and services after the first three quarters of  1993 (23 percent) and the indicators of the prices for  industrial production (26.4 percent). Therefore, there may be a  pressure that retail prices be raised, which in turn, if  financial policy is slack, may bring about higher inflation.    At this point, the NBP elaboration needs to be supplemented.  Last November, inflation increased by 4 percent; in December the  indicator will certainly be even higher.    Combating inflation only through a sharper financial policy,  without coordinating it with fiscal and budget policies, may  yield no results. In line with NBP evaluations, in the present  conflict between fiscal and financial policies, the goals of the  former seem to dominate, which is favorable in terms of  stimulating inflation.  <H5>  Fluidity </H5>   In the first ten months of last year, the money supply  increased by 22.6 percent. This means that in real terms, in  1993 the supply of money decreased. It achieved the lowest  level in May and June, which was related to the low increase of  cash money. This year, the share of cash money as a percentage  of the overall money supply gradually decreased. In December  1992 it constituted 21 percent; last August -- 18.9 percent.  However, this is not a result of a relative decrease in the  importance of cash money in the economy, but a result of an  increase of the role of other components of the money supply,  primarily foreign currency deposits. Their share in the money  supply increased from December 1992 to October 1993 by 3.81  percent -- to 28.56 percent. This was only partially caused by  the fixed devaluation.    To regulate the money supply, the central bank employed  several instruments: obligatory reserve rates, open market  operations, and interest rates. The short-term fluidity of the  banking sector was steered by means of open market operations.  However, it was first of all Treasury bonds that helped absorb  the fluidity. By determining interest rates, NBP defined its  expectations concerning inflation and exerted influence on the  interest rates offered by deposit-and-credit banks. Actually, a  policy of positive interest rates was implemented all year,  which was supposed to encourage people to save their money,  especially in zloty accounts. There is a close relationship  between the rates of the Central Bank and commercial banks as  far as interest rates on deposits are concerned. The interests  on one-year deposits were actually set at the level of  refinanced credits. However, the interest rates on credits,  even though the Central Bank rates have not changed since  February, dropped from 41 percent in March to 39 percent in  November of last year. The interest rate of pawn credits is the  price of the credit which NBP can extend for a short period of  time to banks in lien on securities.    In the first months of last year, the rate of this credit  started to deviate clearly from the interest rate on inter-bank  deposits, which is the market price of money. Nevertheless,  from July the levels of these rates started to draw closer to  one another, which, according to NBP, proves that the inter-bank  market is functioning better.  <H5>  Between the Zloty and the Dollar </H5>   Last year the structure of saving changed in households.  Apart from the growth of foreign currency deposits from 41.8  percent in December 1992 to 48.1 percent in October last year,  we saw a decrease in the share of fixed-time deposits in the  overall value of savings kept in banks, from 80.3 percent in  December 1992 to 75.3 percent last October. In the first six  months of last year this share was at one level -- 81.6-81.2  percent. It started to drop in July and became more rapid in  September.    According to NBP, last year the form of saving money  changed.  In 1992 the increase of zloty savings of households was, in  real terms, twice as big as the increase of foreign currency  changes; in the nine months there was quite a different trend --  this year the real increase in savings was first of all the  result of an increase in foreign currency deposits.  <H5>  Stock Exchange As a Competitor for Banks </H5>   The last year is associated with the stock exchange. The  exchange rates of stocks, measured with the Warsaw Stock  Exchange Index, increased 1,200 percent. Some of the funds  invested in the stock exchange come from bank deposits, as a  result of which the increase in depositing money in the banks  was curbed. Another source of the funds were bank credits,  including consumption credits. However, analyses show that the  role of bank credits is not significant.    In the past few years, we have noted increasingly more cases  of Polish banknotes being forged. In 1991 the number of  revealed forgeries was twice as large as in 1990. In 1992, it  was eight times as big. Also in the first eight months of last  year, we noted eight times as many cases as in all of 1992. One  of the reasons for such an increase in the number of forgeries  is the fact that the zloty became the money desired by  foreigners, especially those from the former Soviet Union.</p>

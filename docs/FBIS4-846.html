			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Liberal Democracy -- South Africa "has now joined the  nations  where political choice is a matter of of weighing freedom  against welfare, the efficiencies of the market against the  bureaucracy of government, liberty against order" or "crudely  put, how much government, how much freedom," an editorial in  Johannesburg SUNDAY TINES in English on 17 April on page 34  notes. THE ANC "has tried to define the future" putting forward  a "comprehensive `plan' for reconstruction and development"  which is "attractively populist, showing a sincere concern for  needs of deprived and relatively helpless communities," but "it  perceives solutions not in the disorderly process of a free  society, but only in the coercive interventions of government."  "To its left is the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], mired in  primitive socialism and driven by an anger that is deeply  racist" and the SACP [South African Communist Party], intent on  "dragging the ANC and the country leftwards and backwards."  President de Klerk wears his new "liberal democracy" clothes  "uncomfortably and his party is simply bewildered by the  change." The Democratic Party, DP, "does at least understand the  principles of liberal democracy, but it has fallen on hard  times." The Federal Party is considered "a lobby rather than a  political movement." "A vote for any of these would serve to  strengthen opposition to the ANC, but only the DP -- given fresh  leadership -- can possibly form the base around which a  liberal-democratic alternative must, sooner or later,  consolidate. To change leaders is easy, but to create a new  institution to serve as the vehicle of liberal-democratic values  would be the work of a generation."  <H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>   Inkatha Defiance -- As "past experiences gained during  Inkatha demonstrations" have shown "we ought to be concerned  about the safety of those that will chose not to heed the  stayaway call" and to prevent violence "serious measures" have  to be taken, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in  English on 17 April on page 6. "The marches cannot be allowed to  go ahead in the Witwatersrand at least" because "several areas  have been declared as unrest areas." "We expect the security  forces to be out in full force to enforce the law by preventing  unlawful marches from taking place, take action against any  transgressors and protect all those wishing to go about their  day-to-day business. Those intending to defy the ban and unrest  regulations against the carrying of dangerous weapons should be  prevented from leaving their hostels." "The police also need to  show their capacity and will to enforce the law, as what we  might see this week, could be a rehersal of what we are likely  to see next week when millions of people are supposed to go to  the polls."    Rightwing Sabotage -- "The SA Police Union (SAPU) has  threatened to disrupt the elections and refuse to perform  election protection duties" unless salary demands are met, the  second editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION on 17 April  notes. "Clearly, this threat is nothing but the pursuance of a  well-known rightwing agenda to sabotage the forthcoming  election." The South African Police campaign against the  National Peacekeeping Force, NPKF, since the NPKF "started  training," "is something Law and Order Minister Hermus Kriel  should be ashamed of."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Inkatha Youth March -- The Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans  on 17 April cautions in a page-18 editorial: "Even in the  confusion of the final days of transition to a new dispensation  two wrong actions do not make a right. The fact that the police  failed to thoroughly search the ANC's headquarters at Shell  House in Johannesburg after the massacre of Zulus was totally at  odds with the generally held view of the authority of the law."  "But the march planned by the Inkatha Freedom Party Youth  Brigade to the -- to them -- hated ANC headquarters is equally  ill-considered and wrong. By marching in their thousands  through the streets of the country's financial capital they are  not only challenging the law. They are exposing innocent lives  to danger and playing with the kind of fire which makes even the  most peace-loving and law-abiding citizens shudder. Not to  mention a week's mass action. The IFP youth may argue that in  the ANC they have outstanding teachers for this kind of action.  After all, the ANC and its allies conducted strikes, marched,  and demonstrated -- and then patted themselves on the back over  the sucess of this kind of action, ignoring the cost to the  country." "The public shakes its head at the futile attempts to  maintain law and order by the people involved in the Peace  Accord and by the police. Through their office windows in the  city center they have actually seen bodies being carried past,  and now they look with suspicion at what they perceive to be a  cover-up of what actually happened. Even at this late stage the  guilty, regardless of who, what and of whatever political  conviction they might be, must be brought to justice by the  guardians of the law. In this they must have the full  coooperation of all parties, and all doors open to them. Fast.  Because if that does not happen, the next error, worse than the  first, will take place, namely, people beginning to march, and  continuing to march through and after the election, out of a  feeling of injustice and revenge. With all the accompanying  dangers for the future."    Moderates Must Show More Muscle in Election -- In his  "Actuality" column on page 18 of RAPPORT, Izak de Villiers  writes: "When South Africa became a republic in the sixties,  the English-language press referred to the `silly season.' If  that period was silly, the present one is certifiable." "After  the De Klerk-Mandela debate this week, the names of the parties  which will contest the election rolled across the television  screen: Trotskiites, black racists, old-world socialists,  liberal democrats. Names which did not appear were those of the  communists sailing under ANC banner, the Inkatha Freedom  Party...and the Conservative Party..." "Will an election be  able to satisfy all these participants and nonparticipants?  That is the question facing a dazed electorate which must make  their crosses in little more than a week." To keep things  together "will demand more than a handshake from Mr. Mandela and  Mr. de Klerk. It needs statesmanship, wisdom, and realistic  planning. For decades the world's successful countries have not  been faced with choices across such a broad political spectrum."  "These days if a politicl party wants to become the government  of a couuntry it must walk the middle of the road and look after  all its people, but must also be committed squarely to the  proven ways of democracy and the free market." "During the past  few weeks international impatience has been clearly evident. In  particular, after the happenings in Bophuthatswana, the massacre  of IFP members at Shell House in Johannesburg, and the struggle  to get Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi involved in a constitutional  settlement, there has been growing skepticism towards the ANC  and its authoritarian lust for power and flirtation with  socialistic dinasaur politics. Prominent overseas newspapers  which used to be in the front ranks against apartheid have been  critical." RAPPORT warns that "Western opinion makers will give  an ANC-dominated government very little time to prove its good  sense or stupidity. And only one test will be set: to what  degree does the new regime satisfy the recipe that works,  particularly with regard to the economy and human rights."  "That is why moderate voters have such a tremendous  responsibility to form an effective counter to the ANC in a new  parliament. Should the ANC and its communist and socialist  allies opt for all kinds of wild and ill-considered courses,  there must be sufficient muscle to pull them back sharply in  their tracks."</p>

These safety zones are necessary to control spectator craft and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters during this event. Entry into these zones is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation will be effective from 11 p.m. December 31, 1994 until 1 a.m. January 1, 1995 with an alternate date of January 1, 1995 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Chief Warrant Officer Eugene Zimbalkin, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, Baltimore Custom House, 40 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202&hyph;4022, (410) 962&hyph;5118. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rule Making has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The original application to hold this event was not submitted until October 25, 1994 to Coast Guard Group Baltimore. Because of the late original submission date and the additional changes there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest since immediate action is needed to prevent hazards to the boating community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Baltimore Office of Promotion requested a safety zone for the Baltimore Inner Harbor fireworks display to take place December 31, 1994/January 1, 1995 with an alternate date of January 1, 1995. Because of the way the fireworks display will be set up, the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore has determined that two separate safety zones will be necessary to protect the public and control spectator craft during this event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing safety zones around two fireworks barges that will be anchored in the Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland. One barge (Barge A) will be anchored in the middle of the Inner Harbor Basin, 250 yards off of the west sea wall and the second barge (Barge B) will be anchored approximately 400 yards west of the West Channel Turning Basin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Zone (A) will be around barge A and will encompass all waters of the Inner Harbor that lie within a circle with a radius of 200 feet, with the center of the circle being the fireworks barge A. Safety Zone (B) will be around barge B, and will encompass all waters of the Inner Harbor that lie within a circle with a radius of 840 feet, with the center of the circle being fireworks barge B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spectators that wish to watch the fireworks display aboard their vessels may anchor outside of the safety zones, but they may not anchor in or block a navigable channel. Patrol craft will be on hand to assist the boating public and ensure safety of life and property during the event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Inner Harbor will not be closed for an extended period during these safety zones, vessel traffic should not be severely disrupted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The drafters of this regulation are Chief Warrant Officer Eugene Zimbalkin, project officer for the Captain of the Port, Baltimore, Maryland and Lt. Kathleen A. Duignan, project attorney Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation will only be in effect for two hours, therefore, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this rule to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, Subpart F of 165 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 165_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

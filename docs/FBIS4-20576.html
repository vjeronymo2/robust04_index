			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Yukinobu Kumashiro, Mariko </F> Matsumoto, and Harumi Yoshizaya, Department of Engineering,  Yokohama National University]    [Text] We have studied the vapor phase growth of BP on  sapphire to examine the mechanism of epitaxial growth and to  perform direct measurements of semiconducting properties of BP  single crystal, so that we have succeeded in growing BP single  crystal film on sapphire for the first time.    The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of BP on near  (1120) oriented sapphire substrates was conducted by the thermal  decomposition of a B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]-PH[.sub]3[/]  mixture in hydrogen atmosphere.[.sup]1[/] After the heat  treatments of susceptor and the substrate,[.sup]1[/] growth  was made at gas flow rates of 20, 500 and 2500cc/min, for  B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/] (1% in H[.sub]2[/]),  PH[.sub]3[/] (5% in H[.sub]2[/]) and H[.sub]2[/],  respectively, in the temperature range of 800 to 1050C at a  deposition time of 1.5hr. The films growing at the temperature  ranges of 950 to 1050C, and 800 to 900C were colored  orange-red and black, respectively. They were polycrystals  except for the growth temperatures of 1000 and 1050C. The  BP films grown at 1050C were peeled after several days to  remain ultra thin film on substrate showing strike RHEED  pattern. X-ray diffraction pattern of the peeled film was to be  BP with the lattice constant of a[.sub]0[/]=4.54 Angstrom.  The BP film grown on the ultra thin film indicated single  crystalline RHEED pattern. Some areas showed similar RHEED  pattern as that of BP on Si (111). The Si (111) grows  epitaxially on Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  (1120),[.sub]2[/] suggesting that BP (111) would also grow on  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] (1120). But the surface of the  films were not smooth.    The films grown at 1000C indicate highly oriented  single  crystalline pattern. In order to alter the crystal quality, we  have adopted crystal growth by buffer BP layer at low  temperatures (450-600C for 40-80 sec). After low  temperature growth and annealing process at 1000C for 5 min  under B[.sub]2[/] or PH[.sub]3[/] atmosphere, crystal  growth was carried out at the temperature of 1000C under  the above mentioned conditions. BP single crystalline layers  were grown by growing buffer layer of BP at 550C and  annealing at 1000C in hydrogen atmosphere, which is  confirmed by X-ray diffraction and RHEED patterns. The  orientation relationship was (111) BP/(0001) sapphire; [110]  BP//[1120] sapphire, and [112] BP//[1010] sapphire, and (111)  BP/-(1120) sapphire.    The obtained film exhibited p-type conductor. The Hall  measurements by van der Pauw method indicate that the film with  buffer layer has highermobility than that without buffer layer.  Then the buffer layer would diminish the autodoping from the  substrate.    This study was performed through Special Coordination Funds  of the Science and Technology Agency of the Japanese Government.  <H5>  References </H5>   1. Y. Kumashiro, et al., J.

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Management: Accident prevention at a premium for local councils Every time a pedestrian has tripped over an uneven paving stone, Britain's local authorities have been used to passing on claims for twisted ankles to their insurance company. In most cases, that has been Municipal Mutual. The multitude of claims, plus an epidemic of burning schools and a potential wave of claims from former residents of children's homes, is currently threatening the very survival of MMI. Last week it abruptly withdrew from the market, leaving some councils with no option but to close facilities to the public. The immediate problem of councils' lack of cover has been overcome: other insurers have stepped in, but at a price. Councils are not only having to pay higher premiums, they are also being forced to change their approach to risk. Risk management programmes, which include the installation of safety equipment and tighter operational management designed to reduce small claims, are common in industry and have already been adopted by some larger councils. According to Ken Kennedy, risk and facilities manager at Surrey County Council, more local authorities may be forced to follow suit. 'Risk management will be a 'lever' which local authorities can use to negotiate lower insurance rates,' says Kennedy, who chairs the recently-formed Association of of Local Authority Risk Managers. 'Funding risks through insurance alone just isn't an option any more,' says Terry Sparkes, chairman of the Institute of Risk Management. MMI insured 90 per cent of Britain's district, county and metropolitan councils, covering their buildings, vehicles and liabilities to employees and the public. The relationship was mutually convenient. Local authorities were highly loyal customers. Until relatively recently, MMI placed little demand on the councils to control their losses, offering comprehensive cover relatively cheaply. Insurance companies stepping into the breach created by MMI's demise are likely to make much more demand on councils to control their risks and limit claims. 'The first question insurance companies are going to ask local councils is 'what is your risk management strategy?',' says Kennedy. Bigger county and metropolitan authorities - which spend between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m annually on insurance premiums - are meeting claims of under Pounds 100,000 from their own resources and deploying risk management techniques to reduce the likelihood of claims. Risk managers point to successes in a number of authorities. In Nottinghamshire losses from arson which grew sharply in the late 1980s, totalling Pounds 1.6m in 1989, have fallen since risk manager Bill Sulman introduced a prevention scheme in 1991. Sulman has spent Pounds 500,000 on security measures - better fencing, alarm systems and lighting - at vulnerable schools in inner city Nottingham. Cheshire County Council, which has also been badly hit by arson in its schools, has just completed fitting sprinklers to the Park Primary School in Runcorn, one of a number of schools to be set on fire last year. Both Cheshire and Nottingham are also taking measures to reduce a steady trickle of small claims from local authority employees who have suffered back injuries and members of the public who have suffered accidents because of badly maintained roads. David Bull, a risk manager who doubles as Cheshire's legal officer, says that under new insurance arrangements negotiated recently, the authority must meet the cost of most small claims itself, providing an incentive for managers to stop accidents happening. 'We are trying to end the tyranny of small claims which take up so much time. The handling of the claims can simply bleed the organisation of resources,' he says. 'We're getting people to think much more about the risks to which they are exposed. Accidents at work can be stopped by relatively minor changes.' Sulman warns that claims from people who have suffered from abuse when they were children in council controlled homes, have risen sharply recently. Victims of the 'pin-down' disciplinary regime, for example, recently won settlements of Pounds 2m in Staffordshire.</p>

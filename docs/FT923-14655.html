			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: US steel groups reduce second-quarter deficits LEADING US steelmakers continued to reduce their losses in the second quarter of the year, though recent difficulty in winning even modest price increases indicates their troubles could linger, AP-DJ reports from Pittsburg. After failed attempts to increase prices by up to 5 per cent, steelmakers are having trouble enforcing smaller increases. Mr Peter Marcus, an industry analyst with PaineWebber, says the increase has 'failed', adding: 'There's not going to be any price increase in the third quarter.' One major producer said that while the increase has held, at least partially, for its hot-rolled steel, increases for the pricier cold-rolled steel would have to wait until August or later, and coated steel price hikes would not stick at all. Because of the fragmented nature of the steel industry, buyers have been able to keep prices down despite an increase in shipments in the second quarter of about 5 per cent from the first quarter and 7 per cent from a year ago. As a result, major integrated steelmakers - with the possible exceptions of USX, US Steel and NKK's National Steel - will again record losses. Barring a flight of imports from the market because of recent trade lawsuits, or a strike at LTV, which has asked the bankruptcy court for permission to reject its labour contract, analysts expect most steelmakers to remain in the red for the third quarter and not to see profits until the fourth quarter or first quarter of 1993. If there's any good news among integrated steel producers, it's that National Steel, which has outperformed rivals in the downturn, should record a modest profit, and that the giant US Steel component of USX, may return to profitability. Analysts on average expect US Steel to earn a nickel a share, according to First Call, though most include a pension credit in their estimates.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED WAY'S $95-MILLION GOAL REACHES HALFWAY MARK  </P> <P> Since its start in September, the United Way's fund-raising campaign has  yielded a record $50 million dollars -- more than half of the charity's goal  for this year, a spokesman announced.  </P> <P> Campaign chairman James P. Miscoll said the organization was already 9% ahead  of last year's campaign, which netted $88.3 million.  </P> <P> This year's goal is $95 million.  </P> <P> In his first "progress report," released last week, Miscoll attributed the  campaign's success to an increase in giving in all major categories. Corporate  giving was up 8%. Employee contributions, which normally represent about  two-thirds of campaign revenues, increased by 10%. Miscoll also noted an  increase in giving by members of organized labor.  </P> <P> "These efforts will result in expanded capacity to serve our communities  through the 350 health and human service agencies United Way supports," Miscoll  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe February 25 TASS -- The Tajik Foreign  Ministry has bluntly denied recent reports, appearing in the  foreign press with references to the "International Amnesty"  human rights organisation, that there are secret concentration  camps on the territory of the republic.    Tajik Foreign Ministry's Department Chief Zafar Saidov told  a  briefing here today that not a single official representative of  the foregoing human rights organisation had addressed such  information to the Tajik Foreign Ministry or other state bodies  over the past six months.    "The leadership of Tajikistan," the diplomat said, "have  asked representatives of the mission of permanent U.N.  observers, currently visiting the republic, to undertake a  fact-finding trip to the spots, where these concentration camps  are allegedly located, and to carry out the most careful  investigation."    "For its part," Saidov stressed, "the Tajik leadership,  which  has always honoured all the international human rights acts and  which is now busy building a democratic law-government state,  believes that no goals can justify the use of tortures, physical  violence and other actions humiliating human dignity, about  which the foreign mass media have reported.</p>

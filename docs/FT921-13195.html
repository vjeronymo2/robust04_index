			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market falters after early gains CONCERN about the strength of the long hoped for upturn in the UK economy, political worries and disappointment at the performance of the two key overseas markets - Wall Street and Tokyo - took the shine off an early good showing by UK equities. Adding to a general feeling of anti-climax around London's dealing desks was the continued absence of the strongly rumoured bid for one of the leading UK stocks and a sharp downturn in the Footsie futures market. The latter has been instrumental in leading the primary market sharply higher in recent sessions. Overall activity in London, however, was substantially higher as a healthy two-way pull developed among the leading trading houses. The FT-SE 100-share index moved up strongly at the outset, peaking at 2,561.6, up 16.7, some 40 minutes after the opening of business, but thereafter came under modest but persistent downward pressure to close a net 1.5 down at 2,543.4. Early trading in equities was highlighted by a general mark-up of some of London's so-called takeover favourites. The initial strength was also encouraged by an early spurt in the Footsie future, which moved to a 50-point premium over the cash market and well ahead of the fair value mark which allows for dividend flow and financing costs of the underlying stocks. The widespread rises in the blue chips, however, proved short-lived. A series of heavy programme trades, a flurry of institutional selling orders in both the future and the cash markets and a slightly disappointing opening by Wall Street took the wind out of the market's sails. Responding quickly to the pressure, the Footsie went into reverse and dipped to register the day's low point - a 4.9 decline at 2,540.0 - immediately the depressed money supply and bank lending figures were made public. Thereafter the market moved narrowly. The Footsie future settled at a premium of 34 over the cash market. Dealers noted at least three, and possibly more, hefty trading programmes, one weighted heavily on the sell side and two more said to have been evenly spread across the range of blue chips. The programmes gave a big boost to market turnover, which picked up significantly to reach 619.4m shares. This compared with Monday's 418.2m shares and last Friday's 687.2m. Another market depressant was a suggestion that one of the leading brokerage houses had prepared a bearish note on the UK economy and downgraded its Footsie estimates. Oil shares attracted keen interest, with the 'majors' responding to recent broker buy notes and tending to ignore yesterday's dip in crude oil prices, which occurred in spite of news that Saudi Arabia proposes to cut its crude oil output by 100,000 barrels a day. This comes hard on the heels of news that Iran and Algeria have implemented output reductions. Dealers were intrigued at the rumours of an imminent and sizeable bid for one of the big UK stocks but no news emerged. Food retailers responded to a broker buy recommendation, while Smith New Court, London's 'bought-deal specialist', was said to have carried out a big trade in London International Group.</p>

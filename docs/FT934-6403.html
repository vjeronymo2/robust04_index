			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / People: BPB Industries anoints Cuny as future group chief executive Plasterboard manufacturer BPB Industries, which parted company with its chief executive John Maxwell in September, has now promoted Jean-Pierre Cuny to the position of group deputy chief executive, as well as chairman of the gypsum division. He is expected to become group chief executive in due course. In considerable contrast to Maxwell, who had no experience in the industry before joining the company in the spring of 1992, 53-year-old Cuny, who is a French citizen, has been with the group since 1977. Cuny joined the main board in 1988 and has most recently been deputy chairman of the gypsum division, running gypsum interests in continental Europe, from his Paris base. An engineering graduate of the Ecole Centrale de Paris and metallurgy post-graduate from MIT, Cuny now moves to London. There his immediate task is to sort out the gypsum division as a whole and organise the succession, according to Alan Turner, BPB's chairman and chief executive. 'His promotion to deputy chief executive is intended to signal his stepwise progression. When he has got gypsum sorted out, he can raise his head and become chief executive,' says Turner. Turner declined to comment as to why Cuny was not deemed a suitable candidate for the chief executive seat before Maxwell was appointed.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'BREAKER MORANT,' 'LUCY'S PLAY' IN REP AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> DRAMA: THE STORY OF A TRUMPED-UP BRITISH COURT-MARTIAL IS GIVEN ITS U.S. STAGE  PREMIERE.  </P> <P> "Breaker Morant" is well known as the 1979 Australian film, but the true story  of a trumped-up British court martial during the Boer War is unfamiliar here as  a play.  </P> <P> A new repertory company, CalRep, is presenting the American stage premiere, and  the production is a crackling military drama with first-rate period detail.  </P> <P> Playwright Kenneth Ross' drama, the basis for the 1980 Oscar-nominated  screenplay, echoes the theme of Stanley Kubrick's great anti-war film, "Paths  of Glory," and jars memories of the aftermath of the My Lai massacre.  </P> <P> Director Ashley Carr and a 10-member cast invest the show with a metallic sheen  and a crisp rhythm that signal promise for CalRep, which is the resident,  professional arm of the Department of Theatre Arts at Cal State Long Beach. The  theater is comfortable and intimate with tiered seating but, a propos of  sprawling campuses, the site is a devil to find, even with a campus map.  </P> <P> What is striking about the production is its vocal distinction. Rarely do you  hear actors with such strong diction. We are with Aussies and Brits (in 1902  South Africa), and the texture of the accents and the pristine delivery rivet  and propel the action.  </P> <P> The Boer War is grinding to a close. Three bush-ravaged Aussie soldiers are  hauled up for murdering Boer prisoners of war -- a practice, we learn, that was  directly encouraged by Britain's own pompous, hypocritical Lord Kitchener (G.  L. Shoup in a cartoony interpretation that misses the skulduggery of the  character).  </P> <P> There's no question that the gritty defendants (led by Robert M. Hefley's fiery  Lt. Harry (Breaker) Morant) parroted commands and shot Boer prisoners upon  their capture. But the court-martial is a scapegoat job, a political showcase  for the British, who suddenly want to look fair minded and noble in order to  get the Boers to sit down at the peace table. After all, Empire building is at  issue here.  </P> <P> The production's tuning fork is Steve Brady as the defendants' initially  inexperienced counsel, Maj. Thomas, a man who has drama thrust upon him and  takes on Kitchener's lackeys with a growing anger that glows with heat.  </P> <P> Two actors, Russell Schmid and Russell St. Clair, are chameleons, playing  multiple characters with flavorful touches. Ronald Allan-Lindblom's big lug of  a defendant, Ron Statler's strong-willed president of the court (his bald head  gleaming like a lamp), and John Ross Clark's dutiful prosecutor are uniformly  strong.  </P> <P> Underscoring the spit and brass are the coppery tones created by lighting  designer Bernard J. Skalka, the safari-like beiges, boots and leathers of  costume designer Judith Tucker-Snider, and the woody, burnished decor of the  tribunal setting by set designer Herbert L. Camburn.  </P> <P>  At 1250 Bellflower Blvd., Long Beach, Thursday and Friday, also Nov. 11,  16-17, Dec. 7, 8, 16, Jan. 26-27, Feb. 10, 16-17 at 8 p.m.; a matinee, Nov. 15  at 2 p.m. Tickets: $8-$12. (213) 985-5526.  </P></p>

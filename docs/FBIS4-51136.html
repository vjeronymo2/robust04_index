			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Tax Break Expected For Mines"] </F>   [Text] The government is considering cutting the taxes on  nonferrous metal mines as heavier tax burdens and spiralling  costs are forcing almost all State-owned nonferrous metal mines  out of business.    The China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp (CNNC)  directly controls 87 mines around the country. About 85.5 per  cent of them were running in the red last year.    The expected tax break will avert bankruptcy for the mines,  which were burdened with new taxes beginning this year.    The value-added tax on mines was raised from 9 per cent to  17  per cent under the current taxation system. The mines also have  to pay a newly added resource tax and resource compensation fee.    Putting these levies together nonferrous metals mines will  have to pay 510 million yuan ($58.6 million) more this year if  not granted some relief, said CNNC officials.    At the same time price hikes for electricity, coal, oil,  steel and construction materials have driven up production costs.    Unlike other industries, nonferrous metal mines cannot raise  prices because of the sluggish world market.    CNNC officials hope the government will provide favourable  treatment and lighten the burdens to help these debt-stricken  mines survive.    Most of CNNC's mines have been in operation for 30 to 40  years. Some are exhausted and have to be closed.    Since 1992 the government has been lending money to these  mines to help them relocate surplus labourers to other  industries.    This is not an easy task, officials said, because these  mines  are located in remote areas.    In the past few years CNNC has not opened any new mines.  Only a few are even being planned.    Without incentives, investors are not likely to inject money  into mine constructions said CNNC officials.    In another development, China's first-quarter output of 10  major nonferrous metals reached 829,600 tons, up 10.6 per cent  over the same period last year.    However, profits and taxes dropped by 53.6 per cent. More  than 75 per cent of the country's nonferrous metals producers  are losing money.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The devaluation of the CFA franc was one of the  topics discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting. The government  plans to adopt protective measures to prevent indiscriminate  price increases. The government is also planning to launch a  sensitization and explanation campaign. Here is the report on  the cabinet meeting deliberations presented by the government  spokesman, Theodore Holo:    [Begin recording] [Passage omitted] The cabinet took note of  the decision of the heads of state and government of the 14  member states of the franc zone in Dakar, Senegal, on 11 January  relating to the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc. After  examining the report presented by the minister of trade and  tourism on the foreseeable consequences, the cabinet envisaged a  number of measures whose implementation can only be effective  after the government has held discussions with its social  partners and the business community.    In the meantime, preventive measures will be adopted to  avoid  any indiscriminate price increases throughout the national  territory, and in order to stem the baneful effects of the  devaluation on our economy and on the purchasing power of our  hardworking people. A mass sensitization and explanation  campaign will also be organized to enable our people in general  and the business community in particular, to understand  correctly the phenomenon of devaluation which, unfortunately, is  being wrongly interpreted today. Consequently, the cabinet calls  on all national as well as foreign businessmen to refrain from  any restless action that could seriously jeopardize our young  recovering economy.    Finally, the minister of public works and transport reported  to the cabinet on the situation at Cotonou Airport where  personnel of the Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and  Madagascar [ASECNA] embarked on an indefinite strike as of 11  January. From the report presented by the minister of public  works and transport, it was observed that some ASECNA staff, who  were individually requisitioned, in conformity with the  prevailing laws, to perform minimum duties at the airport,  simply reported to their work place but did not work, thus  paralyzing air traffic at Cotonou Airport totally.    While recognizing that ASECNA staff have the right to strike  under conditions defined by the law, the cabinet strongly  condemned their refusal to perform minimum work. However,  faithful to the spirit of dialogue and concertation which the  government of democratic renewal has always demonstrated vis a  vis its various social partners, the cabinet set up a  ministerial delegation in charge of meeting ASECNA personnel  today in order to examine with them the ways and means of  reconciling their interests with those of their employers and  our national economy.

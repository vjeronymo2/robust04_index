He lives in a  modern apartment block constructed in the typical style of the  homes of the former Soviet nomenklatura -- a fenced garden,  porter's desk, immaculate entrance lobby, and four elevators.  It is the same block where I came to interview Leonid  Brezhnev's grandson some months ago. The former parliamentary  speaker's apartment seemed even larger and more comfortable than  that occupied by Brezhnev's grandson -- a labyrinth of rooms,  mahogany and oak "empire" style furniture, paintings by  well-known artists on the walls, and soft carpets. The man who  opened the door for us wore no shoes, only socks. As soon as we  entered, CORRIERE DELLA SERA's Paolo Valentini and I followed  suit and removed our shoes, as is usual in Russian homes, in  order to avoid dirtying the floor with snow and mud. In  stockinged feet, we followed him to the office where Khasbulatov  was waiting for us.    It was his first morning of freedom. He wore a black shirt,  blue jeans, and slippers. He held a big cigar, from which he  drew from time to time. He was pale, rather as he was when we  interviewed him 4 October with Rutskoy in the White House under  the gunfire. But of course he was in a much better mood. He  got up from a divan covered with a large bearskin, on which we  then sat. He shook hands with us and said: "I wanted to meet  with you out of politeness, out of respect for what you did that  day." He was referring to the appeal that he issued through us  for the Western countries to intervene vis-a-vis the Kremlin to  save his life and the lives of others, if they surrendered.  "But the Russian newspapers printed a lot of nonsense, as  though Rutskoy and I had sought help only in order to escape who  knows where." We told him how we conveyed their appeal to the  Italian diplomatic service and how it reached the EC foreign  ministers at their meeting in Brussels.    "This is the first time I have heard about it. The Russian  press misled our people. Be that as it may, we came out of  parliament alive 4 October not thanks to the help of the  European governments but because the commandos of the Alfa and  Vympel group sent by Yeltsin to kill us all refused to obey  orders. As you know, Alfa and Vympel were dissolved, destroyed  as a punishment, a few days ago.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you tell us how exactly your arrest  took  place?    [Khasbulatov] Two young commanders reached us. We had moved  to the room next to that in which we received you for the  interview a little earlier, because shots were still reaching  that one. They said: "Our group has met and decided not to  carry out the order to arrest you and to execute you, Ruslan  Imranovich [Khasbulatov], Aleksandr Vladimirovich [Rutskoy],  whom we greatly respect, and all the others here. We are  officers, we have a heart, we reason with our own brains, we  love our homeland, and we know that you are defending a just  cause -- the constitution. If you trust us, follow us, leave  here with us, and we will protect you from those people. We will  guarantee your safety, even if they attack us." We did trust  them, and all went well.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you feel now, after five months in  prison?    [Khasbulatov] After 144 days, to be exact. Well, the air of  freedom is always better, it is a great help. Now I want to  finish writing my book on economics, then I will think about a  book about what happened in October. The book about the 1991  coup has been translated in several countries, including Italy.  I would like a publisher who pays well...    [LA REPUBBLICA] You do not intend to be just a writer, do  you?    [Khasbulatov] I must think about it.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Don't you want to return to politics?    [Khasbulatov] In the past three years it has become  difficult  to find political interlocutors who are really worthy from the  viewpoint of integrity. Those with whom I have had dealings  behaved like petty criminals, always prepared to break their  word. Petty tricksters who adopt the guise of great  politicians. They disgust me. I do not know when a new  leadership class will emerge. Be that as it may, I am an  economics teacher, a respected and well-known academic. I will  write books, return to my students.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that Russian democracy is in  danger?    [Khasbulatov] Unfortunately democracy in Russia has taken a  great step backward. Until 21 September (the day Yeltsin  dissolved parliament -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) there was a  democratic system, a democratic constitution, better chances of  emerging from the economic crisis. Now there is an  authoritarian system. Ask the Western leaders whether they are  pleased with the result. I would like you to convey my question  to Mr. Kohl, Mr. Major, Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Clinton: Are they  pleased with what they have done to Russia? They have helped  Yeltsin to become a dictator with no limits or controls, they  have driven the country to the brink of destruction. For our  people there is no longer any democracy or freedom: Are people  in the West happy about this?    [LA REPUBBLICA] Yeltsin and the government are espousing  many  of your positions in economic policy, in foreign policy...    [Khasbulatov] All they can do is repeat my words. They  cannot act. At least they have realized something, despite  their lack of intelligence: They have realized that parliament  and I were right. Now they are saying what the people want to  hear, but I have my doubts about whether they are capable of  acting. If they do something, they do so clumsily,  unprofessionally. This irritates both the Russian people and  the world community.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What is your opinion of this Duma, the new  parliament?    [Khasbulatov] It is too early to issue a final assessment.  After all, it has only been working for little over a month.  For the present, I am grateful to the deputies who, by  approving the amnesty, respected the voters' wishes: None of  them could have been elected if he had not pledged to struggle  to restore some justice.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Was the amnesty a surprise for you?    [Khasbulatov] No, because I know the Russian people and  their  ability to bring pressure to bear. We owe our freedom entirely  to the people. There has been talk about my release for weeks  now. In any case there was no evidence; all their attempts to  fabricate it were in vain. Their story no longer stood up.  They were obliged to release me and Rutskoy. Parliament and I  did not take a single illegitimate step, but they wanted to  blame us for certain mistakes, the street incidents, and the  actions of the armed gangs, which acted autonomously. I never  ordered the television station to be attacked.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you consult with Rutskoy before deciding  whether to accept the amnesty?    [Khasbulatov] No, we were always totally isolated in prison.  But I would remind you that to accept an amnesty does not entail  acknowledging your guilt.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you ever hit or maltreated from the day  of your arrest until your release?    [Khasbulatov] Never. Everyone always treated me with  respect. I will tell you a story in this regard. It was the  commandos of the Alfa group that brought us to prison in a bus.  Perhaps somebody did think that I was public enemy number one,  because Kortsakov, the head of Yeltsin's personal bodyguard, was  in the bus too, and there were two armored cars behind. The  young commandos were forbidden to speak, so as they entered the  bus, one by one, each of them placed a hand on my arm and  squeezed it as a sign of solidarity.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How did you spend your time in prison?    [Khasbulatov] I had a lot of time to reflect. I read a great  deal. Books on philosophy. And novels -- all of Dreyser's,  Sue's "The Mysteries of Paris," and Prosper Merimee.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you never depressed?    [Khasbulatov] Never. In my heart I always believed that this  is how things would turn out. I never lost hope.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you speak with Rutskoy Saturday evening  [26 February], after your release?    [Khasbulatov] I phoned him at home but he was already  asleep.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What time did you go to bed?    [Khasbulatov] At 0500 this morning. My desk was covered in  mail and documents. I spent the night sorting them out.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Did your wife experience any problems during  this period?    [Khasbulatov] She received telephone calls telling her that  she had to leave this apartment. It is said that Yeltsin has  created a new system. It is not true: He uses the same  communist methods from before.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You used to be great friends with Boris  Yeltsin. How did you become arch enemies?    [Khasbulatov] I would not say that we were great friends. It  would take a book to answer your question. We will talk about  it again next time.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But if you could say something about Yeltsin  now...    [Khasbulatov] I will not say anything. As far as I am  concerned, he no longer exists. I regard him neither as a  political leader nor as president; this man no longer exists; he  is neither dead nor alive. As far as I am concerned, he is  finished.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that Russia shares your opinion  and that Yeltsin will not remain in power long?    [Khasbulatov] Yes, I am absolutely sure.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Ruslan Imranovich, pardon me for asking: Why  do you always wear a black shirt? Were you wearing one when you  were arrested?    [Khasbulatov] No. In parliament I wore a white shirt. But  after two weeks of being without water and unable to wash, it  became black. This one really is black, though. I put it on  precisely in order to recall 4 October.</p>

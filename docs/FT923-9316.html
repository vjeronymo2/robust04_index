			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Arts: Much Ado About Nothing - Theatre THE Oxford Stage Company's Much Ado About Nothing has arrived at Oxford on the home stretch of its national and international tour. The production is bold, colourful and ambitious. At the moment, it jeopardises itself by trying for too much diversity. The first ten minutes of the evening, before a syllable of Shakespeare, offer a battle-scene with Yoruba war chant. Why is it here? why does the director (Alexandru Darie) change the ending to make the action a respite between wars? Much Ado sits awkwardly between the safety of As You Like It and the seriousness of Hamlet. The Oxford Stage Company looks into the void and fills it with variety: Benedict is a clean-cut WASP, Beatrice an Irish ranter, Don Pedro a shaven-headed bully, Don John an Eastern prince, Margaret a shrieking washerwoman and Borachio a mewling sot. Shakespeare did bring a range of characters from Padua, Aragon and Florence to the scene in Messina, so Darie's direction recognises the excuse for ethnic mix in the characters themselves. In social terms, if you believe John Stuart Mill, diversity is liberty in theatrical terms, it is a heavy three hours wrenched from a light play. The Company courts weakness from strength. The very fine styles available within the cast impinge on Shakespeare: after the war chant, the pre-nuptial party is a ceilidh, the song 'Sigh No More' is a Cha Cha, Hero's wedding is Malay ceremony followed by voodoo necromancy to revive her. The impact is not diversity but dissipation; other 'politically correct' productions (Othello at the Liverpool Everyman 1991, and the current RSC The Odyssey and The Taming of the Shrew at Stratford) make political points without giving up dramatic integrity; so the fine line between delighting and instructing an audience can be drawn. However, this show has two great strengths. First, as a touring idea, with an eye on the closing dates in Malaysia and Japan, the design works well: sparse attention to a rough wood frame and fabric hangings, and lavish attention to the costumes. Set and costumes draw on Far Eastern and Balkan design, as does Karl James' fine score carried by Jan Alphonse's powerful singing. Second, this Much Ado gets along without leaning on Beatrice and Benedict (both well played by Marie Frances and James Simmons). Shaw thought it a shocking bad play saved only by Dogberry at the end, when the unfunny Beatrice and Benedict were exhausted. Unhappily, Dogberry's scenes are truncated and the character who remains is too stupid to be serious and too brash to be funny.

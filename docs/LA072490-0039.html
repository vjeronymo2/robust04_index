			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CYA INMATES CONCEIVED 8 CHILDREN SINCE '87;  </P> <P> PRISON PREGNANCIES: YOUTH AUTHORITY SAYS ISSUING CONTRACEPTIVES AT  CO-EDUCATIONAL VENTURA SCHOOL WOULD MEAN CONDONING SEXUAL ACTIVITY. CRITICS  CALL THAT POLICY UNREALISTIC.  </P> <P> Their jailers forbid intimacy beyond hand-holding, but male and female  prisoners of the California Youth Authority's Ventura School have nevertheless  paired off to conceive eight children in state custody since March, 1987,  records show. The eighth baby is due in November.  </P> <P> The Camarillo compound, which houses virtually all of the state's incarcerated  female youth offenders, is the California Youth Authority's only co-educational  facility. National authorities say it also is apparently the only youth  facility in the United States where prisoners regularly get pregnant.  </P> <P> "Every time it happens, I'm amazed," said Terry Cole, an  obstetrician-gynecologist who has been making monthly visits there since 1981.  "You would think that the authorities out there would have it figured out. But  obviously, where there's a will, there's a way."  </P> <P> Many outside specialists say major reforms are needed to solve the problem, and  some decry the Youth Authority's refusal to distribute birth control devices as  unrealistic. But Youth Authority officials discount the severity of the  situation and say that aside from revised security procedures and possible new  courses in sexuality and self-esteem, they expect to leave the institution  largely as is.  </P> <P> The Camarillo facility sits on a grassy plain and houses 610 male and 250  female prisoners, who sleep in separate buildings but gather together for  classes and counseling under the scrutiny of 450 staffers and a network of  video monitors.  </P> <P> The CYA's prisoners in Camarillo are guilty of offenses from misdemeanors to  murder, with robbery the most common offense. Although their average age is 19,  more than 100 prisoners there have been convicted of homicide. A 1987 survey  found that 18% of the CYA's incoming female prisoners had given birth at least  once.  </P> <P> If an inmate 18 or older conceives a child while incarcerated, the Youth  Authority recommends to the parole board that the prisoner's sentence be  extended, said Kate Thompson, the facility's acting superintendent. Those  extensions, Thompson said, often last six months to a year.  </P> <P> If the prisoner is under 18, Thompson said, "we refer that to law enforcement"  and parents are notified. In two of the eight recent cases, Thompson said, the  mothers were minors.  </P> <P> Usually, arrangements are made for the prisoners' families to take over the  infants, Youth Authority officials said. Others are put up for adoption.  Abortions are available, officials said, but seldom chosen.  </P> <P> Contraceptives are not available at the facility, nor are birth control pills,  except to female prisoners complaining of irregular periods and those expecting  to leave within three months.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, it would be an act of condoning their sexual activity in the  facility," Thompson said.  </P> <P> For critics of the Youth Authority, the pregnancies and absence of  contraception raise a red flag -- one that could signal an AIDS threat or a  prisoner lawsuit, and one that sets the institution apart from others around  the country.  </P> <P> "The CYA can't have it both ways. If they're going to mix boys and girls,  they're going to have to provide more education, and birth control," said Ellen  Barry, director of Legal Services for Prisoners With Children, a San  Francisco-based legal advocacy group.  </P> <P> "These kids are sexually active," said Pat Marrone, who directs Allied  Fellowship, an Oakland-based halfway house that takes some pregnant CYA  prisoners. "It's not only that we need to prevent them from getting pregnant.  We need to prevent the spread of AIDS."  </P> <P> No AIDS cases have been reported among CYA prisoners in Camarillo. But critics  say state officials are inviting trouble, given the facility's many prisoners  with histories of substance abuse or promiscuity, or both, and the lack of  condoms.  </P> <P> "They can't adequately supervise the kids, so not to give them birth control is  such a head-in-the-sand decision," said Elizabeth Jameson, staff attorney for  the Youth Law Center, a San Francisco advocacy group. Jameson added that,  although she knew of no such cases so far, the pregnancies among minors could  leave the state vulnerable to accusations of negligence and possible litigation  by prisoners' families.  </P> <P> "I was supposed to be getting interviewed for a play," said Piper Moore, 20,  who conceived four months ago while in custody and is still a CYA prisoner.  "The staff wasn't paying attention, so we just did it. . . . What do they  expect?"  </P> <P> Some of the pregnancies are premeditated, Moore said. "They want to get  pregnant. They're young, and they got a lot of time, and they want to be  pregnant."  </P> <P> For officials at other juvenile institutions around the country, Camarillo's  reality is an unfamiliar problem complicated by rare circumstances.  </P> <P> In New York, Washington, Idaho and Texas, where state facilities house youth  offenders in co-educational populations of 100 to 300, authorities said they  could recall no reports of prisoners impregnating other prisoners.  </P> <P> Officials at the American Correctional Assn. in Maryland said the same. John  Zachariah, juvenile projects coordinator for the American Correctional Assn.,  called the Camarillo facility's size "a thing of the past," noting that it  holds three or four times as many prisoners as many comparable institutions.  </P> <P> "Today," he said, "you will find very few institutions with more than 200  capacity. It's better for kids and it's better for management."  </P> <P> On their list of possible reforms, Thompson and her staff have included sex  education classes, which Thompson said have not been offered for several years,  if ever; a tighter system of passes for prisoners; separation of boys and girls  in choir classes and other leisure activities; a more rigidly structured  academic schedule; staff training sessions to improve security; new locks for  all doors; and self-esteem counseling for female prisoners.  </P> <P> On June 28 and 29, the state Commission of Juvenile Justice, Crime and  Delinquency made its annual inspection of the Ventura School. The group's  findings are not expected to be released for several weeks, but Commissioner  Donna Clontz, who lives in Ventura County, said she did not expect the  pregnancy figures to surprise commissioners.  </P> <P> Given the facility's population, she suggested, a record of just eight  pregnancies in three years among 250 females may be "a good sign that  everybody's doing what they're supposed to be doing."  </P></p>

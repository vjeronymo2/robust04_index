			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: India raises export limit for sugar in bumper season THE INDIAN government has raised the export limit for sugar in the 1990-91 season by a further 100,000 tonnes to 525,000 tonnes. Up to the end of March, the industry produced 9.2m tonnes, 800,000 tonnes more than the corresponding period of the previous season, and has been seeking to export at least 500,000 tonnes in order to maintain prices in the domestic market. The government has only gradually increased the amount it is prepared to see exported, and has been reassured by the fact that sugar prices have not moved up even after export releases. However, the low domestic prices have kept the pressure on sugar mills, which have not been able to clear their cane bills. The Indian Sugar and General Industry Export Import Corporation, which is now handling exports independently of the state, has finalised procurement of 125,000 tonnes of sugar from mills in Maharashtra, 65,000 tonnes from Tamil Nadu and 35,000 tonnes from Karnataka. Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for the corporation, said it should be possible to ship 225,000 tonnes of sugar by May. Sugar export was reviewed at a recent meeting of the corporation. Sales contracts settled so far are for delivery to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Belgium and the US.</p>

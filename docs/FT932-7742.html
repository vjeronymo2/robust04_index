			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Matsushita to borrow Y200bn MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, a leading manufacturer of electronic goods in Japan, plans to issue Y200bn (Dollars 1.8bn) of straight corporate bonds next quarter, the company announced yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. The company said it had not determined terms and conditions for the borrowing, which is to finance the Y185bn buy-out of the company's longstanding semiconductor joint venture with Philips Electronics of the Netherlands. The borrowing, which could comprise several issues, would represent a sizeable tap on the growing corporate market. Companies have increasingly been turning to bonds to raise funds because of the weak equity market and because bank finance is more expensive. Alcatel Alsthom, the Paris-based telecommunications and transport group, said a ADollars 500m domestic commercial paper programme would go towards working capital used throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Reuter reports from Sydney.</p>

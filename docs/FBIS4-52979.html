			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Pak Tae-ho, chairman of  the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists Federation [KBF],  released a statement on May 14 urging the South Korean puppets  to scrap the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) and the  multi-purpose research reactor, stop the development of a fast  breeder reactor and promptly give up the nuclear arms  development.    He said the PHWR in Wolsong which the South Korean puppets  claim to be a "commercial" reactor and the multi-purpose  research reactor in the Taedok complex which they call a  "research" reactor were designed to develop nuclear weapons.    "The Buddhists, who consider killing as the blackest crime  against mankind and peace as the greatest charity, will never  tolerate their nuclear arms development for plunging the nation  into a nuclear disaster," he declared.    "The KBF Central Committee calls on the Korean Buddhists in  the South and overseas to actively join in the struggle for  checking the South Korean puppets' nuclear arms development and  getting the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South  Korea, thus fully discharging the mission and duty of Buddhists,  who consider avoiding sin of killing any living creature most  important in the Buddhist commandments.

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: That old family magic It is nice to see an old fashioned show for all the family back in the wicked West End. The star of The Magic Man is, of course, Paul Daniels, but there are good parts for son Martin, a softer, cuddlier, version of Dad, and for Mrs Daniels, who spends most of her time de-materialising. Elder son Paul gets a brief drive-on role, but, like Mrs D. soon disappears, complete with Harley Davidson, into the absolute. Martin's fiancee is just starting in the family business, as dancer and prop carrier, but can draw inspiration from her future mother-in-law, who when she was young Debbie McGee, hoofed for ages before being allowed to tackle dialogue. Apart from losing some hair, and gaining an extra staff member, this is basically the show that Paul Daniels played to great acclaim at the same theatre in 1980. Over time Daniels has allowed his prickly personality fuller rein. He is like a grumpy pixie, superb at chatting up the audience, but an obvious martinet behind the scenes. I felt sorry for the drummer who missed a roll; and for Martin when he fluffed a gag. They were probably turned into rabbits later. Daniels is a tough law and order man - he thinks judges should be strung up for softness - and the steel behind the banter makes for an intriguing show. He is an excellent improviser, and rides his luck, which, on Thursday, kept coming up aces. One magical secret is to get members of the audience to take responsibility for tired material. So the boring solid, or not so solid, ring trick was entertaining because a sweet nine-year-old birthday girl acted as stooge. Daniel also hit gold with a police inspector from Essex and a medical student from Malaysia who were happily humiliated as first they handed over their cash to Daniel, and were then ejected from, and stuck to, their chairs. There seems little new in the world of magic. Mrs D still disappears from the box in which she has been transfixed by spears, and atomises as she is wafted to the flies in the final illusion. A postman from Camden Town, who foolishly shed a shoe to be more comfortable, was painlessly guillotined. A troupe of six dancers proved that revue is dead. Martin Daniels is the nice one, who sings and tells jokes and would make a wonderful children's entertainer. Paul has the world weary air of the old pro. But the joins do not show and the audience was well pleased. I did spot a flaw. The policeman was asked to think of an international celebrity and Paul promised to read his mind and conjure up a photo. Presumably back stage they were well prepared for Mrs Thatcher, John Major, Madonna, etc. The Essex man came up with Ted Heath. It was well in period with the show, but no photograph was forthcoming. There is a difference between magic and miracles.</p>

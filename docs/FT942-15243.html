			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): Zulu king holds key to peace in Natal - The colourful traditional monarch has to be taken seriously Watch out for King Goodwill Zwelithini. It is easy to dismiss the slow-spoken king, hereditary monarch to South Africa's 9m Zulus, as merely the toy of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and chief minister of the KwaZulu black homeland. But the king will live on after apartheid - and talks with him will continue despite the spectacular collapse of all other constitutional negotiations this week. Chief Buthelezi will soon have lost his position as KwaZulu head, and Inkatha will be in the extra-parliamentary wilderness. But the threat which King Goodwill poses - of inflamed Zulu nationalism - will endure. Indeed, the new government will face few more dangerous challenges. That is why Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, has spent so much time trying to woo King Goodwill. For the king is Inkatha's biggest political asset, the key to unlocking the support of millions of traditional Zulus. Recent opinion polls show a steady decline in support for Chief Buthelezi, but a rise in support for Inkatha. This seems to be explained by a surge of allegiance to the king - cleverly provoked by Chief Buthelezi himself, who dragged the king on to the political stage to demand Zulu autonomy once Inkatha's efforts to negotiate regional devolution had failed. The ANC responded by trying to strike a separate peace with the king, to isolate Chief Buthelezi and neutralise the threat of Zulu ethnicity. So far, this has failed, because the ANC tried to entice the king with no more than what one local columnist called 'the trinkets of monarchy': the promise of pomp and circumstance, and a ceremonial role. There can be no such cheap deal with the king to bring peace to KwaZulu and the surrounding Natal province. If he poses a real threat to stability - as the ANC seems to believe - a substantive and not a symbolic solution will be needed to remove it. And that will mean satisfying Chief Buthelezi as well as King Goodwill. Not since the days of King Shaka, the 19th-century founder of the Zulu nation, has so much attention been paid to the Zulu monarch. Goodwill, the eighth Zulu king, was installed in 1971; within a decade, he had been subdued by Chief Buthelezi, his uncle, who castigated him publicly before the KwaZulu legislative assembly and threatened to cut his stipend when he thought the king was nurturing independent political ambitions. Since then, he has used the king cleverly as a focus to build a new Zulu nationalism, now the basis of Inkatha's support. Dressed in leopard skins, or the double breasted suits and dark sunglasses so beloved of African leaders, King Goodwill regularly stirs Zulu pride with complaints of slights, real or imagined, to the nation and its monarch. This is powerful stuff, in a country where the trappings of modern industrial society only thinly mask the more traditional world - at least in KwaZulu/Natal - of tribal chiefs and spirit healers. Even ANC radicals believe Inkatha can use the institution of the king to undermine a new government, as well as to provide an alternative power base for Chief Buthelezi. As prime minister to the king, a role he has long filled under Zulu custom, the chief will at least have a phone, fax and photocopy machine in the king's palace. For his part, the king says he is preparing for the final fight to liberate the Zulus from decades of foreign oppression, under the British, the Afrikaners and soon the Xhosa-dominated ANC. That may sound like bluster - but it is a brave person who ignores it.</p>

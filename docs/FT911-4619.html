			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / EC agrees Mideast peace role THE US and the EC agreed last night that Europe should be 'associated' with the Middle East peace process but both sides stopped short of suggesting the Community co-sponsor the direct Arab-Israeli negotiations which Washington is trying to launch. This interim formula emerged after a meeting between EC foreign ministers and Mr James Baker on the eve of the US secretary of state's third peace mission to the region. It did not meet the EC's request to be more directly involved but, diplomats said it reflected a state of play where it was still not clear whether Washington could get talks started at all. Prior to the meeting, senior European diplomats insisted that the EC would accept only full 'co-sponsorship' of peace talks, along with the US and the Soviet Union. Israel, which has accepted in principle the US plan for face-to-face talks with the Arabs, objects to close European involvement because of the EC's long-standing call for a UN-sponsored peace conference which would include the Palestinians. Mr Baker said after the meeting that his primary objective was 'to establish a process that has some reasonable chance of success and of being begun in the first place'. But he added that 'we have made it very clear to Israel that Europe can contribute to this process and should be involved.' The EC's usefulness is in part because it has favoured the 'international' peace conference sought by Syria and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Such a UN-backed conference would have at the top of its agenda Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the 'land-for-peace' formula requiring Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for a settlement.</p>

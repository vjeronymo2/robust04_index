			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (13): Weekend still a problem for hotels - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks at different parts of the regional economy Hotel and catering business across the region is picking up as the economy moves out of recession. 'Sales are moving forward for everyone,' said Mr Clive Stone, managing director of Redcliffe Catering. For Birmingham, he puts the increase in business, compared with 1993, at up to 7 per cent during the first nine months of the year. 'In the last six to nine months, we have seen a general upturn and a strengthening of bookings, and that seems to be spreading to advance bookings,' Mr Stone said. But the advance is off a low base. There was a surge of hotel building in Birmingham during the late 1980s and early 1990s - just in time for the recession. Birmingham Marketing Partnership's hotel-occupancy figures for 1993, covering eight city-centre hotels, showed an average occupancy rate of 56.42 per cent. Although mid-week business is described by Mr Stone as 'reasonably good', Birmingham hotels face the perennial problem of finding weekend occupants. Moreover, hoteliers are forced by immediate market conditions to offer keener prices than their peers in London and Edinburgh. Yet the underlying conditions are sound. According to Department of National Heritage figures, based on the number of staying visits, Birmingham is the fourth most visited city in the UK after London, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The region has its share of tourist attractions, including Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon; Ironbridge, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, in Shropshire; and the Alton Towers theme park. But the main aim of policymakers since the 1970s has been to build up the regional services sector. There has been extensive public-sector investment, both in the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena; and also in the growth of a cultural sector based on the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the inward migration of the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Yet the pattern of future development is difficult to predict. 'There is nervousness about long-term capital investment,' suggested Mr Stone. 'There is no problem for the next one to three years. The concern is three to 15 years out.' In his view - which is not unique - the key to future growth in the sector is: first, the continued development of Birmingham Airport and the NEC-ICC-NIA complex; and second, a substantial tourist attraction to draw in daily visitors. The distribution-hotels-catering category of employment is already one of the three largest in the West Midlands, accounting for 21 per cent of jobs. Birmingham Economic Information Centre forecasts a growth in sectoral output of over 30 per cent by 2005. PROFILE: Solihull Moat House is the only 4-star hotel in Solihull, the town nearest to the National Exhibition Centre. But, unlike the Metropole, which is adjacent to the NEC and drawing much of its business from the centre, the Moat House depends on local business. 'The majority of our customers are local privileged people on contract rates,' said Mr Brian Dunn, the manager. 'To get a consistent base through the year, we prefer to deal with local companies.' He had in mind groups such as British Gas and Lucas. As such companies undertake more training courses, so they bring their employees into the hotel. Like the hotels in Birmingham, the Solihull Moat House has seen business pick up this year. But, said Mr Dunn, 'the growth is not in occupancy volume but more in price'. The hotel has 115 bedrooms, and is currently running on a 72 per cent occupancy rate. This opens up the possibility of hardening the rates charged to customers. 'At a top-class hotel, the challenge is getting the rate. A 4-star hotel could (be filled) every day if it charged the same as a 3- or 2-star: it would be just offering better service for less,' said Mr Dunn. It is an indication of the recovery in the sector that, as Mr Dunn put it: 'The whole market is beginning to firm up and we can firm rates up. It's like the aircraft business. If BA has seats available, then there are more offers available.'</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / People: Electronic switches Steve Rowley's appointment as general manager of Cellnet, the highly profitable mobile phone joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, heralds a further advance by the IBM faction within the higher reaches of BT. Rowley joins Cellnet on the coat-tails of Howard Ford, Cellnet's new managing director. Ford was recruited this June from IBM, where he was responsible for the group's personal computer business in Europe. Rowley, 35, worked with Ford as head of IBM's personal computer business division. As managing director of Cellnet, Ford succeeded Stafford Taylor, another former IBM executive, who is now managing director of personal communications for BT's main business. The key BT post of corporate relations director was filled this summer by Ian Ash - yet another IBM veteran. All this bears the imprint of Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, who has been systematically filling senior BT posts with outsiders used to life at the sharp end of sales and marketing. Hepher was recruited three years ago from Abbey Life, the insurance group, and has little time for the old utility mentality still strong at BT. Unsurprisingly, Rowley's brief includes sales, marketing, products and customer service.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Banham offers one rule for Essex and another for Dorset Southend and Basildon are to become free-standing local authorities, but the rest of Essex will retain a two-tier system under proposals from the Local Government Commission for England inadvertently sent to homes in the area yesterday. The leak, a week early, confirmed the commission's intention to leave the two-tier status quo intact in most of England outside the main cities, in spite of government requests that it recommend unitary authorities in all but 'exceptional' circumstances. Under the plans Thurrock would merge with Basildon New Town to form a unitary authority while Southend would be given independence on its existing boundaries. The county and 11 district councils would continue to provide local government services in the rest of the county. As an alternative, the commission suggests that the county council be abolished and split into six unitaries. But this would involve merging Colchester and Tendring districts, which have announced that they cannot work together. Under this option, the other unitary councils would be Braintree and Uttlesford; Harlow, Epping Forest, Brentwood and Billericay; Thurrock and Basildon New Town; Chelmsford and Maldon; and Southend-on-Sea, Castle Point and Rochford. Essex County Council welcomed the commission's preferred option, while the Association of District Councils was unwilling to comment. The Essex leak overshadowed the commission's formal announcement of plans for Dorset, which would see Poole split from Bournemouth/Christchurch, with both becoming unitary all-purpose authorities. The rest of Dorset - including the present district councils of North Dorset, East Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset and Weymouth and Portland - would be merged into a unitary authority. The county council would cease to exist. This contrasts with the plans for Essex, and for neighbouring Hampshire, where the commission recommended retaining the two-tier system outside the bigger towns. The plan to split Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch angered the business community, which had argued strongly for one new authority to cover the conurbation. The managing director of one of Bournemouth's largest employers said: 'Christchurch, Bournemouth and Poole look like one conurbation from the air and they feel like one when you drive through them. Services I need come from those three areas and they need co-ordination.' Start-up costs of the plan would be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 22m, according to the commission, generating annual savings of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 7m. The commission is offering an alternative which would create four unitary authorities for Dorset by splitting rural Dorset into two councils.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: High days, holidays and hard work Today is a statutory public holiday in Britain - one of a dozen or so, depending on where people live. What is the occasion for celebration that warrants the loss of billions of working hours? Is it Trafalgar Day, VE Day, St George's Day? No, it is merely the last Monday in August - a cause for national rejoicing. Britain has about the same number of public holidays as the US, France and Italy. But Switzerland, the country with the highest GDP in the world, has only seven, though individual cantons do have their own as well. This set me thinking whether I could do a latter-day Weberian analysis. It was the sociologist Max Weber who 90 years ago showed that the Protestant countries were (and still are) richer than the Catholic countries. He attributed this to the now-famous Protestant work ethic, with its emphasis on hard work, asceticism, industriousness and frugality. Is it possible, I wondered, that a country's number of public holidays is a simple index of its economic success? So I looked up the economic dragons of the Pacific Rim - Hong Kong and South Korea have as many as 18, Japan 14. Even Germany appears to have one of the highest numbers in Europe. It seems there is a link, but opposite to my theory. Could it be that the hard-working citizens of the Pacific Rim need to rest more often because of their long-hours of toil? Or perhaps they simply need more time to spend their yen. The sight of a male colleague dousing himself with an expensive cologne rather surprised me recently. Had he, I wondered, been influenced by research that has indeed shown there is a sweet smell of success? In an American study conducted in the 1980s by a social psychologist, a woman was interviewed for a job by a number of interviewers. It was the same woman, in the same room, applying for the same job and giving standard answers. But for one group of selectors she wore no perfume, for another a less-preferred brand and for a third a popular musk-based brand. The selectors were required to rate her on abilities such as communication skills, conscientiousness and numeracy. The researchers showed reliably that those who interviewed the woman when she was generously sprayed in the popular brand of fragrance gave her higher ratings on nearly all the competencies. Whilst it might be true that after-shave won't exactly compensate for lack of ability, it might just help to pip others to the winning post. And my friend splashing it on - he was trying out a new wasp repellant. Britain's long-running rail strikes provide management researchers with an excellent opportunity to measure the (intrinsic) motivation of their staff. The central question is who makes the effort to come to work and who prefers a spot of rose-pruning. A number of favourite hypotheses could be tested, such as the higher your rank in the organisation, the more likely you are to make the effort. Interesting and important, though difficult and time consuming, this research is unlikely to be pursued because few organisations attempt to keep accurate and reliable measures of absenteeism. Having no way of monitoring absenteeism leaves organisations susceptible to skivers, hypochondriacs and moonlighters. Further, it makes estimates of days lost through strikes (or illness) vague and open to manipulation for political purposes. How many organisations have any accurate idea of the cost of this rail strike to them? Some time ago I 'came out' as chronobiologically incompatible with my peers and the preferences of most organisations. I am a 'lark' - an early bird who prefers to get up and start work early. In at 6am, home at 4pm. My colleagues, indeed most of the world, are 'owls' who come alive at the end of the day. They prefer to saunter in at 10am and leave at 7.30pm. Why are important meetings scheduled at 11am and 4pm and not 9am and 2pm? And why is staying late heroic but arriving early eccentric? The business breakfast imported by the Americans in the heady 1980s seemed not to have caught on in Britain. The benefits of life as an early bird are manifold - less traffic, lower rates of crime, better quality of air - but all are unheeded. Alas the data are against me again. A string of British studies (funded by the Medical Research Council) of biological rhythms - measured by body temperature - show the lowest point is about 3am and the highest about 5pm. Because people are more vigilant and attentive when warmer it does make sense, even for larks, to schedule meetings later in the day.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Adamchik, a senior official at the Russian  State Nuclear Safety Agency, told Interfax that Russia at  present cannot modernize the power units of first generation  nuclear stations that do not meet modern safety standards. He  said that because of inadequate financing the agency cannot  afford rapid checking of the reactors. "The government can  economize on everything, except safety at nuclear facilities,"  Adamchik said.    He said safety at first generation power units was discussed  at an international conference in Obninsk held under the  auspices of the International Nuclear Energy Agency. In  addition to Russia it was attended by 12 West and East European  countries as well as Japan. The conference stressed the burning  need to modernize first generation stations depending on the  economic and political situation in each country.</p>

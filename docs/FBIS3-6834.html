Though Japan had invested a historical total of 400 million  dollars in Vietnam as of the end 1993, Doan Duy Thanh, president  of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vietnam, said in an  interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Japanese investment  should "dramatically increase."    Thanh cited construction materials, cement and food  processing as promising areas for Japanese corporations  considering investment in Vietnam.    Thanh said Washington's February 3 lifting of its 19-year  trade embargo against Vietnam may increase the number of rivals  for Japanese companies.    "But Japanese firms, well versed in Vietnamese business  practices through years of dealing with the country, have an  edge over companies from other countries," Thanh said.  "Japanese companies have the capability to make products  well-tailored to the needs of Vietnamese people."    Thanh said he would like to see Japan boost investment  particularly in central Vietnam.    The infrastructure of the area is still "poor" compared with  Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and this problem could hinder quick  recovery of investment in the area, Thanh said. But due to a  vast amount of untapped natural resources, investment in the  region should prove "highly lucrative" to foreign companies in  the long run, Thanh said.    Thanh said Vietnam hopes to introduce a rice-breeding  technique from Japan with an eye toward rice exports in future.  He said Vietnam's infrastructure is insufficient, calling that  the main factor in discouraging foreign investment in the  country.    Thanh said Vietnam is doing its utmost to improve the  situation, using Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds.    Vietnam is also upgrading its legal and administrative  framework to smooth international business deals while striving  to infuse a market mechanism through economic restructuring, he  added.    On overall economic development, Thanh said Vietnam needs to  raise between 45 billion and 50 billion dollars within this  decade, including 15 to 20 billion dollars in foreign investment  and aid.    Japan's cumulative investment in Vietnam was the sixth  largest as of the end of 1993 after Taiwan, Hong Kong, South  Korea, Australia and France. When figures so far this year were  taken into account, Japan might have surpassed Australia and  France on a cumulative basis, becoming the fourth biggest  investor in Vietnam, Thanh said.    He welcomed the U.S. decision to lift its trade embargo but  said relations between the two countries could still be  improved. Vietnam hopes the U.S. will soon grant  most-favored-nation trade status, he said.    Thanh said that in the first one month and a half since the  removal of the U.S. embargo, the number of U.S. businessmen who  came to Vietnam reached 25 percent of the total number for the  whole of 1993. He said that Hanoi is now formulating an  investment guideline on the U.S. and other countries with  particular emphasis on foreign interest in such sectors as heavy  industry, machinery, food processing, forestry, mineral  development, light industry and tourism.    Thanh came to Japan for a business conference sponsored by  the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). The  three-day meeting of top businessmen from 12 countries in Asia  ended Monday.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (3): A sea-change in politics - Robert Graham on the parties' prospects THE STATE of the political parties in Italy has never been so confused and fragmented as in the wake of the April 5 general elections. These were the first elections since the breach of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent collapse of communism. In Italian terms this had a particular relevance because the behaviour of the main parties of government and opposition had been heavily conditioned by Cold War considerations. The ruling Christian Democrats in the last resort always relied on an anti-communist platform, and, in the eyes of the influential Catholic Church, this was the raison d'etre to call out the faithful in support. The Communist Party (PCI) was the largest in western Europe and played the role of the alternative in opposition, delicately juggling independence from Moscow and deference to Marxist ideals. Thus the rationale for these two dominant parties has been pulled from under their feet. Stripped of their ideology, the Christian Democrats have proved to be no more than a divided party united by a crude desire to enjoy the fruits of power. The PCI has disappeared, with most of its members transforming themselves into a social democrat movement, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The nostalgic rump split to form Reconstituted Communism. Torn between being an opposition in reduced circumstances or joining government as a junior partner, the PDS is directionless. The effect of this sea-change can be gauged from the fact that in the 1976 elections these two parties accounted for 73 per cent of the vote. They offered genuine alternatives of government and opposition. In the April elections their combined vote shrank to 45 per cent and the choice had ceased to be between two dominant parties. These elections for Italy's 11th post-war legislature were fought virtually without reference to programmes of government. Instead, the campaign boiled down to a poorly co-ordinated claim by the outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals that they should be allowed to continue governing. Ranged against them were some 14 parties. In no formal sense were these an opposition because they were not organised as such. Nevertheless, for different motives they all wanted to prevent the coalition from continuing. Given that the outgoing Christian Democrat-led coalition was profoundly discredited, the large protest vote was not surprising. Indeed, it was only a surprise to the Christian Democrats because they were so out of touch with reality, never imagining their vote could fall below 30 per cent. The most spectacular instance of the protest vote was the success of the populist movement, the Lombard League, which emerged as the second largest party in northern Italy. However, the league is not a transient phenomenon: rather, it reflects a deeply-felt need, especially in the rich industrial north, for a political party with a new moral ethos capable of making government work and devolving power to the regions. Other parties did well, such as the newly-formed Sicily-based la Rete (the Network), and the Greens for similar reasons. The two long-running government partners, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, more or less retained their vote in Rome and to the south; but lost heavily in the north. There is now a huge 15-point gap between the Christian Democrat vote of 24 per cent in the north and its 39 per cent in the south. In the south, the corrupt client system of politics, fed by party-controlled state investment, still has no rivals. There is a clear risk of the country being divided into two political halves - a reformed north and a corrupt south. The league's influence extends to Tuscany and Emilia Romagna and is essentially a phenomenon of northern nationalism. The old communist heartland of Emilia Romagna and Tuscany has switched its loyalties to the PDS. This belt across north-central Italy remains politically sui generis with its efficient small industries and legacy of competent local administration by the left. But the PDS, which cast itself as a new reformist party with a strong commitment to clean up government, failed to convince the voters and lost support to the league (which also adds to the difficulty of putting an ideological tag on the movement). If the outgoing four-party coalition stays together and there are no dissidents, it can muster 331 votes - a majority of 16 in the Chamber. However, given internal divisions and the April 5 protest vote against the abysmal record of the previous government, the new Amato administration has to seek broader cross-party backing. Christian Democrats. Although their vote fell to 29 per cent, with 206 deputies (234 in 1987), the Christian Democrats remain the largest party. has encouraged internal divisions and weakened the authority of key historic figures such as Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister and Mr Arnaldo Forlani. The latter's candidature for the presidency failed to gain full internal backing, forcing him to resign as party secretary. Squabbles over this post and the party's direction have paralysed decisions. A broad division exists between those who favour institutional reform and those who fear such reform will weaken the party's profitable grip on the state apparatus. The party also has to decide on its attitude to Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement, whose reformist activities make him an increasingly uncomfortable Christian Democrat. Socialists (PSI). The Milan corruption scandal has profoundly damaged the party's image and that of Mr Bettino Craxi, its leader. Developments in the scandal could further compromise the party and encourage the anti-Craxi faction. Poor election results with 13.6 per cent of the vote (14.3 per cent) and 92 deputies have weakened the party's position as a coalition partner. It remains socialist only in name and appears unable to establish a dialogue with the PDS. Liberals (PLI). The party's vote rose from 2.1 to 2.8 per cent against 1987 elections, with 17 deputies. Votes were won from Republican supporters and its prestige enhanced. However, it remains a minor player in the four-party coalition and its position is vulnerable under electoral reform. Social Democrats (PSDI). Elections marked a further stage in the progressive decline of the party, with the vote falling to 2.7 per cent (3 per cent) and 16 deputies. It survives by hanging onto the coat-tails of the Socialists and Christian Democrats. PDS. The party is going through an uneasy self-analysis, rocked by the unresolved tensions of the metamorphosis from communism to ill-defined social democracy. Also unresolved is whether the party should regard itself as the natural focus of opposition, uniting the left. The position of Mr Achille Occhetto as leader has been undermined by the 16 per cent vote in April, returning 107 deputies. In contrast, the break-away grouping, Reconstituted Communism, held the hard-core former PCI vote with 5.6 per cent and 35 deputies. Whether this schism is temporary or permanent is still unclear. Italian Social Movement (MSI). These neo-fascist nostalgics no longer benefit from the communist menace as a vote-catcher. Inability to adapt to changing circumstances has added to the party's marginalisation, despite the asset of its glamorous new deputy, Ms Alessandra Mussolini (grand-daughter of Il Duce and niece of Sophia Loren). But with 5.4 per cent of the vote (5.9 per cent) and 34 deputies, the MSI can be an important ally of the government. Lombard League. Under the fiery leadership of Mr Umberto Bossi, the league is the main novelty in parliament with 55 deputies and 8.7 per cent of the vote. Lack of experience is counter-balanced by a strong mandate from league supporters to reform government. Although a federal movement with strong local roots in each region of the north, electoral success has provided cohesion. Mr Bossi has promised constructive opposition but he also pledged to found a 'republic of the north' if Rome fails to address the league's grievances. The Republicans (PRI). Under Mr Giorgio La Malfa this traditional party of the intelligentsia can play a key balancing role in government. But the party failed to gather the support it hoped for in the elections, the vote rising from 3.7 to only 4.4 per cent with 27 deputies. This has weakened Mr La Malfa's bargaining position and to retain credibility he may find it more convenient to be in opposition to the government. The Greens. The party continues to pick up a small share of the protest vote  -2.8 per cent against 2.5 per cent in 1987. With 16 deputies and credibility as environmentalists, the government is likely to court their overt support. Similar considerations apply to La Rete. This party, formed to fight regional elections in Sicily last year by Mr Leoluca Orlando, has aspirations to a national following. It picked up 1.9 per cent of the vote and 12 deputies. Slightly more quixotic, but also potentially important in a narrow parliamentary majority is the support of Mr Marco Panella's Radical grouping. This veteran polemicist obtained 1.2 per cent of the vote and 7 deputies, and was influential in securing the candidacy of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for the presidency.</p>

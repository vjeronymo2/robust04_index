			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Defense Ministry "responsible military </F> source"; date not given]    [Text] With God's support and out of a firm belief in the  victory of the people's will, the entrenching of justice, and  the defeat of wrong in the battles of confrontation of the  forces of rebellion, apostasy, and secession in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP]; and to continue wiping out their dens and  their collapsing fortifications, the brave heroes of our Armed  Forces are completing their valiant tasks on the various axes  and sectors.    On the Shabwah axis, our brave forces succeeded in  destroying  the advanced positions of the (?Madram) Brigade in Najd, Marqad,  Jabal Bulayq, Jabal Shaqir, 'Ayn Hajar, and al-Saq. Our forces  continue their advance to complete their tasks in the Bayhan  District. Our forces captured several tanks, equipment, and  military hardware while a large number of officers, NCO's, and  soldiers from the (?Madram) Brigade joined the forces of unity  and Constitutional legitimacy.    In the southwestern axis, the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah and  al-Dali'-al- 'Anad sectors, the forces defending unity and  legitimacy are waging fierce battles with all field guns. Our  forces continue their intensive pounding of the al-'Anad Base  fortifications after having purged the defensive pockets around  it and forcing the defenders of the base to flee. Our forces  continue to complete their missions in these two sectors.    In the same axis, our forces continued their advance to  complete their set missions. They pursued the remnants of  apostasy and secession in al-'Awadhil and al-Sha'ibi. The  citizens turned out to meet the forces of unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy, chanting God is great, and cheering  the victory over the remnants of secession and apostasy.    In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of apostasy and secession  carried out an air raid on the Ja'ar area that sought to destroy  the 7 October Factory and a number of the homes of citizens whom  they had tried to terrify and annihilate in the past days with  missiles. Their aggressive actions met with failure. That  hysterical obsession led to the commission of criminal acts by  targeting defenseless citizens and populated areas, firing a  rocket the day before yesterday [14 May] at Sanaa. But God  disappointed their bitter grudge and the rocket did not cause  any damage.    Our Armed Forces are still receiving groups of officers,  NCO's, and soldiers who are progressively joining the Armed  Forces -- the forces of unity and democracy and the defense of  constitutional legality. They thus declared their rejection of  the separatist plot of the sinful gang within the Socialist  Party, joining the side of the Armed Forces and Security Forces  in defending unity and democracy and standing up to all the  enemies of the people and the homeland. We applaud the high  morale of the dignified Yemeni people who are rallying around  their Armed Forces and Security Forces and their national role  to destroy rebellion and the plot of secession.    We applaud all our people in the Lahij Governorate for their  cooperation and support for their Armed Forces. We urge them  and all the citizens in the Aden Governorate to feel reassured  about this great national role of the lofty Armed Forces -- the  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, which protect  them and their security and property, the forces protecting  their stability, their present, and future.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If ye  will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet  firmly. [Koranic verses]</p>

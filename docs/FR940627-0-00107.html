			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the Florida DEP, the closure of the EEZ north of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida's Dade/Broward County line to live rock collecting may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect approximately 12 individuals who reported live rock landings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1993; however, the ex-vessel value of these landings was only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about $800 per Florida Saltwater Products License (SPL). In Dade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Monroe Counties, Florida, live rock landings in 1993 were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported by 96 SPL holders. These fishermen will be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confine their harvest to loose rubble rock, which may have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal effect on the total value of their catch. A 485,000-lb  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (219,992-kg) quota will probably reduce potential 1994 landings by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 15 percent or about $1,000 per SPL holder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 2 is expected to be submitted by the Gulf and South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atlantic Councils in July 1994 for review and, if approved, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation by the Secretary of Commerce. Amendment 2 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the measures in this emergency interim rule on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent basis and include a phase out schedule for live rock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvests in other areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The South Atlantic Council and NMFS have concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present situation constitutes biological and conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergencies, which are properly addressed by this emergency interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of emergency rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The situation: (1) Results from recent, unforeseen events or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently discovered circumstances; (2) presents a serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management problem; and (3) realizes immediate benefits from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency interim rule that outweigh the value of advance notice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment, and deliberative consideration expected under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal rulemaking process. The basis for the conclusions regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency guidelines (1) and (2) is summarized above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the realization of immediate benefits, the South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atlantic Council has determined that an emergency rule under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act is the only means for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately addressing the biological emergency involving the live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rock resources of the Florida Keys and the remainder of the areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off the southern Atlantic states. Going through the formal FMP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment process without the emergency rule would delay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the required measures and would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial damage to live rock resources and fishery habitats off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the southern Atlantic states. The immediate benefit of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency interim rule is that it will prevent expansion of live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rock collection in the area north of Florida's Dade County, protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Florida reef tract from chipping, and limit the rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvesting that causes serious damage to habitat in the area of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida Keys until a phase out can be implemented under Amendment 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the normal FMP amendment and rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS concurs with the South Atlantic Council's findings about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the biological emergency and the need for immediate regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action. Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective initially for 90 days, as authorized by section 305(c) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Magnuson Act. By agreement of NMFS and the South Atlantic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council, this emergency interim rule may be extended for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional period of 90 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This emergency interim rule has been determined to be not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AA finds that the immediate need to prevent environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), as such procedures would be contrary to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public interest. Similarly, the need to implement these measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a timely manner to address the conservation and biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergencies described above, constitutes good cause under authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), to waive the 30 day delay in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 638  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Henry R.

Patwell, M.D.; Continuation of Registration</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 28, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Steven W. Patwell, M.D., (Respondent), 866 Plumas Street, suite B, Yuba City, California 95991. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BP0597508, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More specifically, the Order to Show Cause asserted that on November 7, 1990, a search warrant was executed at Respondent's residence. During the execution of the warrant, police officers found one and one-half pounds of marijuana, trace amounts of cocaine and methamphetamine, and assorted drug paraphernalia. The Order to Show Cause referred to Respondent's February 15, 1991, plea in the Superior Court of California, County of Placer, of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo contendere <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana. The Order to Show Cause further pointed to the action of the Division of Medical Quality of the Medical Board of California (Board.) On June 22, 1992, the Board accepted a Stipulation in Settlement staying revocation of Respondent's physician and surgeon certificate and placing said certificate on probation for a period of five years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the allegations raised in the Order to Show Cause and the matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. On August 18, 1993, a hearing was held in Sacramento, California. On September 29, 1993, the administrative law judge issued his opinion, recommended ruling, findings of fact and conclusions of law. Neither the Government nor Respondent filed exceptions to the recommended ruling. On October 29, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator. Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testimony provided at the hearing by a Roseville Police officer revealed that during the execution of a search warrant at Respondent's residence, officers found 81 individually wrapped plastic baggies containing marijuana, approximately one and one-half pounds in total. In addition, the officers found drug paraphernalia, including roach clips, pipes and bongs, a green powder sifter containing trace amounts of cocaine, a small glass vial containing methamphetamine, ephedrine tablets, an Ohaus triple beam scale, a grooved mirror with the image of a $100 bill which also contained trace amounts of cocaine and assorted prescription bottles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the hearing, Mrs. Patwell testified that, with the exception of the prescription bottles, all of the contraband found at the Patwell residence during execution of the search warrant belonged to her. She stated that she had had a drug problem since age 14 but that she had been drug-free since November 1990. Mrs. Patwell further explained that she packaged the marijuana in small plastic baggies in order to limit her daily consumption and hid her use of drugs from her husband. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent testified that he was not aware that his wife had been storing marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine in their house. While he knew that his wife used marijuana, Respondent explained that he usually chose to ignore the situation and chose not to confront his wife about her drug use. With respect to the Ohaus triple beam scale found in his house, Respondent stated that he was a scale collector and that the scale was simply one of many scales in his collection. According to Respondent, the prescription bottles found by the police were mistakenly brought home by him after patients from the office gave them to him. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Deputy Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or deny any application for registration if he determines that the continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 51 FR 17556 (1986);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anne L Hendricks, M.D.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly noted that factors (4) and (5) were relevant to a determination of whether Respondent's continued registration would be in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

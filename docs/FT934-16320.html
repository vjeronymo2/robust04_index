			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Cross-party backing for rival US healthcare plan A GROUP of conservative Democrats and centrist Republicans joined forces yesterday to present an alternative plan for reforming the US healthcare system. Some supporters believe it could be the principal rival to President Bill Clinton's health programme. The group, led by Congressman Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, and Congressman Fred Grandy, a Republican from Iowa, backs some of Mr Clinton's proposals but wants a bigger role for the market and a reduced one for the state. The Cooper-Grandy scheme, like the Clinton plan, embraces the 'managed competition' concept introduced by academic economists as a way of improving the healthcare market by grouping consumers in alliances. Unlike the Clinton plan, which would compel employers to provide health insurance for their workers and pay for 80 per cent of the premiums, it relies on a more voluntary approach. 'We object to employer mandates, global budgets, price controls, restrictive regulatory purchasing co-operatives, excessive state flexibility and the continuation of the unlimited corporate tax deductibility for health benefits,' Mr Cooper said. Critics charge, however, that without some form of compulsion no reform plan can achieve universal coverage, a key selling point of Mr Clinton's plan and an increasingly popular guarantee. Mr Cooper and Mr Grandy, backed by 44 colleagues from both parties, would offer a standard package of healthcare benefits, and would pay for their reforms principally by stopping companies from deducting from their taxable income the cost of health coverage exceeding this standard. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this kind of limit on deductibility could increase tax revenues by about Dollars 113bn (Pounds 74.8bn) over five years, and would also add to market pressure for slower increases in medical costs. The Clinton administration has repeatedly said it is open to suggestions on changing its plan, which is still a long way from satisfying most members of Congress. Criticism has focused on the administration's estimates of future cost savings, essential to pay for an expansion in the sorts of healthcare coverage provided, and on subsidies to small businesses, which will now be obliged to offer health insurance to their workers.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac It is easy to groan at Tarmac's decision to pay an unchanged dividend. It is also wrong. Maintaining an annual payout which costs Pounds 40m certainly looks rash in the face of zero profits this year and perhaps only Pounds 25m in 1993. But the profound shake-up now under way - aimed at positioning the group's assets for the 1990s and getting the balance sheet under control - means that earnings will in any case be largely irrelevant for at least the next two years. Paying the dividend out of the cash flow from disposals might not seem prudent either - but given that the group is being shrunk it is not unreasonable for shareholders to be handed back a part of their stake. It is late in the day, of course, but the evidence suggests that Mr Neville Simms, the new chief executive, really is now in charge. Chopping back the housing division is as important symbolically as it is financially. One suspects, moreover, that the determination to put businesses on the block will not necessarily stop with industrial products and building materials. None of this disguises the fact that the trading outlook in most of Tarmac's businesses is grim, and that sector overcapacity will not quickly be resolved. It will be 1994 at the earliest before there will be serious earnings growth from the shrunken core. Meanwhile, though, a 9.4 per cent yield provides reasonable support. While there is still no case for being overweight in the builders, Tarmac looks as good a way as any to gain exposure to the sector.</p>

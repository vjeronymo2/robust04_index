During his inspection of Guanghan, Comrade Xie Shijie  stated:  Guanghan City is the banner of Sichuan's county-level  comprehensive economic structural reform and has had a positive  influence on the entire country in this connection as well. At  present, Guanghan should continually make every possible effort  to seize each and every opportunity to further emancipate the  mind, intensify reform, and expand opening up to the outside  world and should strive to take the lead in the county-level  comprehensive economic structural reform in the years ahead.    Comrade Xie Shijie emphatically stated: Reform has  substantially boosted Guanghan's development. In the years  ahead, Guanghan should continually hold aloft the banner of  reform, firmly bear in mind all major tasks set for this year by  the central authorities, and firmly seize each and every  opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push ahead with  development, and maintain stability. We are currently being  confronted with a completely new situation in which we should  follow good examples and help relatively backward areas to catch  up. Only by successfully developing the economy will we be able  to remain in an invincible position.    Comrade Xie Shijie expressed the hope that Guanghan City  will  conscientiously draw upon the successful experiences and  practices of all fraternal counties and cities across the  province. It is a good phenomenon, he noted, that various  counties, cities, and prefectures across the province have  already started competing with one another and learning from  each other. Only by invigorating and successfully developing  the county-level economy will Sichuan be able to stand a very  good chance of success.    Comrade Xie Shijie maintained: The leading organs should  both strengthen internal solidarity and support and help each  other. Within each leading organ, given each individual's  different personal experiences, members play different roles.  It is therefore necessary for members of every leading organ to  learn from one another's strong points and offset any  weaknesses. Only by so doing will we be able to create a  unifying force, fully develop collective superiority, and lead  the broad masses of the cadres and people to overcome all types  of difficulties and push Guanghan's economic development onto a  new stage.</p>

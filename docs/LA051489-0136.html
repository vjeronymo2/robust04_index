			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARGUING THE RACE OF 'THE MOST FASCINATING FIGURE IN HISTORY'  </P> <P> Stanford's claim of Greek/Macedonian/Iranian (Persian) ancestry for Cleopatra  is historically accurate. Her Ptolemaic ancestry (Greek/Macedonian) goes back  to Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great; she was also  descended from the Seleucid dynasty of Persia. No historian has discovered any  trace of African blood in either the Seleucids or Ptolemies.  </P> <P> Just because Cleopatra's father was depicted as black doesn't make him so: Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. has been called the second coming of Gandhi, but does  that make him Indian?  </P> <P> It may interest Kiela Jamal to know that Osiris is a god of vegetation, and as  such has been depicted with green skin.  </P> <P> JAMES CLINK  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

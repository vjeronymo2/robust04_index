			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Implementing a Personal Respiratory Protection Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If personal respiratory protection is used in a health-care setting, OSHA requires that an effective personal respiratory protection program be developed, implemented, administered, and periodically reevaluated ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 54,55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All HCWs who need to use respirators for protection against infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should be included in the respiratory protection program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators to wear while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of HCWs included in the respiratory protection program in each facility will vary depending on (a) the number of potentially infectious TB patients, (b) the number of rooms or areas to which patients with suspected or confirmed infectious TB are admitted, and (c) the number of HCWs needed in these rooms or areas. Where respiratory protection programs are required, they should include enough HCWs to provide adequate care for a patient with known or suspected TB should such a patient be admitted to the facility. However, administrative measures should be used to limit the number of HCWs who need to enter these rooms or areas, thus limiting the number of HCWs who need to be included in the respiratory protection program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information regarding the development and management of a respiratory protection program is available in technical training courses that cover the basics of personal respiratory protection. Such courses are offered by various organizations, such as NIOSH, OSHA, and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. Similar courses are available from private contractors and universities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be effective and reliable, respiratory protection programs must contain at least the following elements ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 55,154 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assignment of responsibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Supervisory responsibility for the respiratory protection program should be assigned to designated persons who have expertise in issues relevant to the program, including infectious diseases and occupational health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standard operating procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written standard operating procedures should contain information concerning all aspects of the respiratory protection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Medical screening.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCWs should not be assigned a task requiring use of respirators unless they are physically able to perform the task while wearing the respirator. HCWs should be screened for pertinent medical conditions at the time they are hired, then rescreened periodically ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The screening could occur as infrequently as every 5 years. The screening process should begin with a general screening (e.g., a questionnaire) for pertinent medical conditions, and the results of the screening should then be used to identify HCWs who need further evaluation. Routine physical examination or testing with chest radiographs or spirometry is not necessary or required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Few medical conditions preclude the use of most negative-pressure particulate respirators. HCWs who have mild pulmonary or cardiac conditions may report discomfort with breathing when wearing negative-pressure particulate respirators, but these respirators are unlikely to have adverse health effects on the HCWs. Those HCWs who have more severe cardiac or pulmonary conditions may have more difficulty than HCWs with similar but milder conditions if performing duties while wearing negative-pressure respirators. Furthermore, these HCWs may be unable to use some PAPRs because of the added weight of these respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCWs who wear respirators and the persons who supervise them should be informed about the necessity for wearing respirators and the potential risks associated with not doing so. This training should also include at a minimum:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The nature, extent, and specific hazards of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transmission in their respective health-care facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A description of specific risks for TB infection among persons exposed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of any subsequent treatment with INH or other chemoprophylactic agents, and of the possibility of active TB disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A description of engineering controls and work practices and the reasons why they do not eliminate the need for personal respiratory protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An explanation for selecting a particular type of respirator, how the respirator is properly maintained and stored, and the operation, capabilities, and limitations of the respirator provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Instruction in how the HCW wearing the respirator should inspect, put on, fit check, and correctly wear the provided respirator (i.e., achieve and maintain proper face-seal fit on the HCW's face).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An opportunity to handle the provided respirator and learn how to put it on, wear it properly, and check the important parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Instruction in how to recognize an inadequately functioning respirator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Face-seal fit testing and fit checking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCWs should undergo fit testing to identify a respirator that adequately fits each individual HCW. The HCW should receive fitting instructions that include demonstrations and practice in how the respirator should be worn, how it should be adjusted, and how to determine if it fits properly. The HCW should be taught to check the facepiece fit before each use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Respirator inspection, cleaning, maintenance, and storage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an integral part of an overall respirator program. This maintenance applies both to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators that are classified as disposable but that are reused. Manufacturers' instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be followed to ensure that the respirator continues to function properly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Periodic evaluation of the personal respiratory protection program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program should be evaluated completely at least once a year, and both the written operating procedures and program administration should be revised as necessary based on the results of the evaluation. Elements of the program that should be evaluated include work practices and employee acceptance of respirator use (i.e., subjective comments made by employees concerning comfort during use and interference with duties).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

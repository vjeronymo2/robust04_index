There is wide range of consensus on ways of  settling the Bosnian conflict following the agreement which was  signed in Washington and the Zagreb talks involving the Russian  side. Kinkel and Kozyrev are convinced that, even after the  Hebron tragedy, areas for Palestinian-Israeli contact have  emerged. Bonn will support us over cooperation with the G-7,  the European Union and the Council of Europe. Kinkel noted that  there were two reasons for the visit: firstly, the meeting of  the mixed commission on the return of cultural treasures and,  secondly, preparations for the May visit by President Yeltsin to  Germany.</p>

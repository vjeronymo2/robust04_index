			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report News of a substantial fall in US COFFEE stocks pushed futures prices higher in New York and enabled the London Commodity Exchange coffee contract to maintain its early strength. By the close the LCE's January futures position was quoted at Dollars 1,256 a tonne, up Dollars 29 on the day. Some London traders thought there might be a retracement, however. 'There may be a little more room on the upside. But if the Brazilians do not buy much coffee tomorrow (for the export retention stockpile), we'll be struggling to maintain current levels,' one said. At the London Metal Exchange confidence was undermined by what one dealer described as 'a somewhat shaky technical picture' in the COPPER and ALUMINIUM markets, which both added to Monday's losses. NICKEL prices had been firmer but fell sharply in thin after hours trading to end at Dollars 4,620 a tonne in the three months delivery position, down Dollars 35 on balance. The three months ZINC price slipped below Dollars 950 a tonne, but was well supported near Dollars 940 and prices edged off the low to close at Dollars 945 a tonne, still down Dollars 7 on the day.

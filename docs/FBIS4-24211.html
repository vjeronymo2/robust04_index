			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN representative Alioune Blondin Beye by </F> unidentified correspondent in Luanda on 24 June--recorded]    [Text] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos  today received Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of  the UN secretary general in Angola and mediator at the peace  talks in Lusaka. He also received the Brazilian Ambassador to  Portugal.    The audience granted to Alioune Blondin Beye lasted about 40  minutes. Beye arrived in Luanda today from South Africa where  he received assurances of the personal engagement of President  Nelson Mandela in the peace process.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] I would like to know if  the  Angolan peace talks will be transferred from Lusaka to any South  African city.    [Beye] It is true that I was in Cape Town yesterday to meet  with President Mandela. It was, therefore, normal for me to  come to Luanda today to meet the president of the Republic. Our  meeting obviously centered on the peace process.    [Correspondent] We should not think that the peace talks  will  be transferred to South Africa, given the readiness expressed by  President Mandela?    [Beye] As you are aware, I have on several occasions visited  heads of state of countries neighboring Angola. The visit to  President Mandela, the president of a democratic South Africa,  is therefore normal. He can certainly contribute toward the  peace process.    [Correspondent] What will happen after 30 June, that is,  after the meeting of the UN Security Council?    [Beye] At present it is difficult to give a reply, because,  the UN Security Council is examining the situation in Angola and  as an international official, I cannot speak about a decision  that the UN Security Council has yet to take. I can say,  however, that the international community is concerned with the  Angolan problem and it will not remain indifferent.    [Correspondent] Mr. Beye, the war is intensifying in Angola  at a gigantic pace, while peace talks in Lusaka are moving at a  chameleon's pace. Is it possible to speak of deadlines in the  peace talks?    [Beye] That is true, but there was a worse situation in  August and September last year. Despite that, we began talks in  Lusaka and we have made progress. Last week Dr. Savimbi told me  that 90 percent of the work has been done. All the same, it is  also true that in the past days or weeks, the military situation  has deteriorated and this does not help the peace talks and the  humanitarian action.    [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Beye. Only 10 percent  of the work remains to establish peace in Angola. Can we then  say that peace is a fait accompli, that the 10 percent will not  make the war continue?    [Beye] I am convinced that we can bring peace to Angola  because the Angolan people want peace. The role of the press is  to make the Angolan people believe in peace and in that way  peace will be irreversible. I know that we are facing very  difficult periods but I known that there will be light at the  end of the tunnel. [end recording]    Alioune Blondin Beye is also expected to meet with Angolan  Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura. He leaves for Lusaka  tomorrow.</p>

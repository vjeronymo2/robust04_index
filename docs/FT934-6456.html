			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Germany and UK share Gatt worry Germany and Britain are concerned that failure to meet the December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round of international trade talks will let the US distance itself further from Europe, diplomats said yesterday. Speaking on the eve of the annual Anglo-German summit, which will take place in Bonn, officials said the collapse of the Uruguay Round, whose deadline is December 15, would be 'catastrophic'. 'Germany and Britain are so dependent on exports. It would be very damaging if there was no agreement,' a British official said. But a senior German official went further in highlighting what it would mean for Europe as a whole. 'The case of Nafta, and the talks in Seattle with Asian countries last week, was the first time in which Europe was not involved. This is a signal. Despite what is said in public to the media, the US and Canada are focusing on Asia, and shifting away from Europe.' The official added that while the Uruguay Round will be 'very much top on the agenda' in the one-day summit between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr John Major, British prime minister, parallel talks between trade, defence and foreign ministers will focus on social, bilateral and security issues. These include: Ways to tackle unemployment in the European Union. British officials implied the Delors white paper on reducing unemployment was 'too Keynesian', adding that they would prefer to seek more emphasis on training, flexibility and innovation; Steel subsidies. German officials are angry about Britain's continuing opposition to proposed federal subsidies for Ekostahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill on the grounds that the modernisation of the mill will contribute to over-capacity in the steel sector. Security, particularly ways in which to bring the countries of eastern Europe - and Russia - closer to Nato. German officials yesterday said there is still disagreement in Bonn about how to define, let alone extend security guarantees to eastern Europe.</p>

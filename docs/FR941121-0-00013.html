			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(3)(iii) When Dividends Begin to Accrue <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One national trade association commenter requested that the NCUA delete proposed comment 4(b)(3)(iii)&hyph;1, as in the commenter's opinion, such disclosures are not necessary for credit unions that begin accruing dividends for all deposits on the day of deposit. Even if all credit unions did begin to accrue dividends for all deposits on the day of deposit, which even the commenter admits is not the case, the Board believes that its commentary should remain substantially similar to that of the FRB. Therefore, the Board has left the proposed comment unchanged in the final commentary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(4) Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FRB provided additional guidance in comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1 for fees imposed for sending to consumers checks that otherwise would be held by the institution. Comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;2 clarifies that photocopying fees are incidental fees not required to be disclosed. NCUA has adopted both of these changes to conform to Regulation DD. In response to a national trade association commenter, other clarifications have also been made by the NCUA Board: (1) That ``fees related to the routine use of an account must be disclosed;'' and (2) that fees for statements returned to the credit union because of a wrong address need not be disclosed. However, the Board disagrees with the commenter, and believes that it is necessary, in order to conform with the final Regulation DD commentary, that dormant account fees and inactivity fees be disclosed. This clarification is also made in the final commentary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters requested that the Board classify fee types not discussed in the proposed commentary: dormant account fees, locator fees, overdraft line of credit access fees, wire transfers, and automated clearing house (ACH) transfers. These fees have been classified in comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1. In response to another commenter, the Board has added a reference that merely providing fee information to members in an account disclosure may not be enough to gain the legal right to impose the fees involved under applicable state law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(5) Transaction Limitations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eleven commenters, including two national trade associations, requested that NCUA not require disclosures based upon a credit union's bylaws that could be imposed and act as transaction limitations upon an account. The commenters stated that it would place credit unions at an unfair competitive advantage with banks. One national trade association argued that since the bylaw requirements were rarely invoked, that they should not be disclosed unless they were to be invoked, in which case members would be notified through a change-in-terms notice. After consultation with FRB staff, NCUA learned that the FRB does not require disclosure of notice of withdrawal, and other unusual, rarely invoked, requirements under state and local law under Regulation DD. For reasons of parity, uniformity, and conformity, NCUA also adopts this approach, reflected in comment 4(b)(5)&hyph;1(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Board does encourage credit unions to publicize bylaw limitations, and other policies, that could potentially affect a member's ability to use his account. Credit unions are different from other financial institutions in that the bylaws form a contract between the members and the credit union. Any restrictions upon a member's account arising from the bylaws is as real as a restriction arising from the account contract. In fact, many members are unfamiliar with their bylaws. There are presently no federal requirements for a credit union to publicize its bylaws among its members, even though it has long been NCUA policy to encourage credit unions to educate their members regarding the content of their credit union's bylaws. The Standard FCU Bylaws only require that FCUs make their bylaws ``available for inspection by any member.'' Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. XIX, &sect;6. In state-chartered credit unions a member's right to view the bylaws is dependent upon state law, which laws sometimes require a proper business purpose. If credit unions believe the transaction limitations in the Standard FCU Bylaws to be too restrictive, it is suggested that they consider petitioning the appropriate NCUA Region for a nonstandard bylaw amendment. However, FCUs are cautioned that NCUA will not entertain petitions to change either Art. III, &sect;3 (allowing members at least 6 months to increase a membership share to par in order to retain membership) or Art. III, &sect;5 (reserving the right to require 60 days' notice on withdrawals, historically to be sued in the event of an emergency). Seven commenters agree with this approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One national trade association commented that credit unions should not have to disclose suspension of services policies, because such policies are not a common practice. For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, NCUA agrees with this approach. While not encouraging their use, NCUA has opined that an FCU may suspend services to members who have caused a loss to the FCU if a proper suspension of services policy is adopted by the FCU's board of directors. A proper suspension of services policy should state: (1) When the services will be suspended; (2) which services are suspended (e.g., ATM services, credit cards, loans, share draft privileges, preauthorized transfers, etc.); (3) note that the member has a fundamental right to maintain a share account and vote in annual and special meetings; and (4) provide for methods of reinstatement of services by the member. In addition, the suspension of services policy should be publicized to members, and not operated discriminatorily, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Regulation B (12 CFR part 202), the Bankruptcy Code, or any other applicable law. Due to the consequences deriving from a suspension of services policy, NCUA believes that those credit unions having such policies should publicize them in detail to their membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(6) Features of Term Share Accounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(6)(ii) Early Withdrawal Penalties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For uniformity and parity reasons, the NCUA Board has adopted comment 4(b)(6)(ii)&hyph;4. The comment was added to Regulation DD in response to FRB commenters requesting guidance for disclosing early withdrawal penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(6)(iv) Renewal Policies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the request of a national trade association commenter, the last sentence of proposed comment 4(b)(6)(iv)&hyph;2 regarding club accounts has been removed as being unnecessary, especially in light of the revised comment on club accounts. Comment 2(x)&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(8) Nature of Dividends <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A national trade association commenter requested a revision of proposed comment 4(b)(8)&hyph;2, to reflect that if a member already had a share account at a state-chartered credit union offering deposit accounts in accordance with state law, share account disclosures would not be required. The commenter's position is unfounded. Since the share account is a currently offered account, there are no grounds under either TISA or Part 707 to exempt it from the disclosure requirements. Therefore, the final comment is unchanged. Similarly, two other commenters from Georgia requested that the comment reflect certain unique provisions of Georgia law. NCUA believes that state law determines whether an account is a deposit account or a share account for accounts in state-chartered credit unions. However, to revise the comment to reflect one state's laws, to the exclusion of other states, would not be useful. Therefore, the NCUA Board has modified comment 4(b)(8)&hyph;2 to reflect that state law controls the nature of accounts for accounts in state-chartered credit unions. The Board believes that this action will enable state credit union supervisors to provide proper guidance to state-chartered credit unions by interpreting various state laws without federal interference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

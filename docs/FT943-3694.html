			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): When big is seen as better - How Trinity Capital found a way to grow More consolidation within the UK venture capital industry will be announced today. Trinity Capital, founded 10 years ago by John Walker and Ron Sheldon with a brief to invest in high-technology growth companies, is to become part of Advent International. Walker will take over as managing director of Advent International's European operations, replacing Doug Brown who becomes chairman of Advent International Europe and worldwide chief investment officer. The two groups say they will be combining Advent's European strength in speciality chemicals, media companies, information technology and communications with Trinity's expertise in the healthcare and environmental sectors. But the fundamental reason is that Trinity would not have been able to raise a new fund to invest at the size it desired in growth companies. By finding a home within Advent International, another specialist lender, which has Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 909m) under management worldwide and has just raised Dollars 315m to invest in western Europe, that is no longer an obstacle. 'This allows us to do the kind of investing that we could not do before,' says Walker. Trinity had wanted to move towards investing in companies at a later stage of their development, when they would generally already be making profits and require larger sums of development capital. 'Our experience was telling us we needed larger deals,' Walker says. He needed to raise a Pounds 100m fund and would not have been able to do that given the returns on Trinity's existing funds. Brown says the merger gives Advent two sectors in Europe where it has not been very active and also more British directors. 'We are redeploying Trinity's skills into that sector of the market that will be dominated by larger deals,' he says. 'Trinity was really relegated to the smaller ranks by the size of the funds they were managing.' The market has known for some time that Trinity has been considering a merger. Other groups talking to Trinity included Rothschild Ventures, industry sources say. The financial structure of the transaction is interesting. When Mercury Asset Management bought Grosvenor Ventures in February in one of the most significant consolidations in the industry, it paid Pounds 4.5m. Walker says no money is changing hands in Trinity's merger with Advent International; Trinity's partners will retain rights to any carried interest in its four funds which have invested Pounds 75m. 'This is an investment in the future and not in the past,' he says. The consolidation is more proof that the ranks of early-stage development capital financiers are thinning out. Walker says Trinity's returns have been 'on the border line'. While its venture capital returns would be competitive with other early-stage investors, this return does not stack up against the returns achieved by funds concentrating on management buy-outs, he says. Trinity and Advent International have co-operated on deals over seven years, and say they share a common style in trying to develop growing businesses. Five of Trinity's active executives will join Advent, including Sheldon. Of the other three, two will remain with responsibility for a 3i-backed innovation fund and will be found a home by 3i, according to Walker. The other partner, Philip Percival, who concentrates on IT and therefore overlaps with an existing area of Advent expertise in Europe, will be 'pursuing other interests', Trinity says. As Walker moves forward with a new partner and more power to underwrite deals than he has had before, he has a word of advice for other smaller fund managers. 'It is my view that those who sort their future out now have better options than those who run out of money,' he says.</p>

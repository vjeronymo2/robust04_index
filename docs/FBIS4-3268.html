			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Le] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A task force of the  ruling Kuomintang [KMT] Friday [15 April] completed a draft  proposal on amendments to the Constitution, [word indistinct]  the lay for several key changes in Taiwan's future political  operations.    As expected, the task force has recommended that  presidential  elections be carried out by popular vote rather than by the vote  of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past. It also  recommended that the immunity from prosecution that legislators  enjoy in speaking during legislative sessions be cut back.    The draft proposals were reached after 52 rounds of  discussions among ranking party officials and legal scholars.    The KMT will formally introduce the changes at the coming  session of the National Assembly after they are approved by the  party's policy-making Central Standing Committee at a special  meeting Monday.    Other key changes the ruling party will propose include  electing a speaker and vice speaker at the National Assembly,  extending the tenure of legislators from three years to four,  adjusting the premier's right to co-sign laws promulgated and  mandates issued by the president, and changing the official name  of the "Shanpao" people to "aborigines."</p>

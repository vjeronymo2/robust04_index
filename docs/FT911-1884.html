			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Management: (Electricity flotation): A voice-over with a Scottish accent - Scottish Privatisation / The campaign to sell power shares is aimed at the mass market in its home base and the more sophisticated investor in the rest of the UK For television viewers in Scotland, it is 1314 and Robert the Bruce has just gloriously routed the English at the battle of Bannockburn. An eager fourteenth century reporter, parchment at the ready, accosts the triumphant and dishevelled Scottish king as he leaves the field. 'You must be well-pleased, Robert. A great result on the night.' 'Oh yes, Jimmy. The boys done well. It was a game of two halves and we've proved once again we're a very hard team to beat at home,' pronounces Bruce. The two carry on reviewing the battle in the idiom of the football field until the reporter mentions the Scottish electricity companies' share offer. 'Well, Jimmy,' Bruce replies, 'the boys still have time to apply themselves.' Meanwhile, viewers in England find themselves at the court of Queen Elizabeth I. A foppish Sir Walter Raleigh is summoned to the royal presence and instructed to go and find a prospectus for the share offer. He tries to get out of it but excuses are stifled with a sharp retort: 'On your bike, Raleigh]'. At this point, much to the delight of the court, the handlebars of the said velocipede are shoved straight at his most sensitive parts; exit Sir Walter. These two jokey interpretations of history form part of a series devised by Faulds, an Edinburgh-based advertising agency, for the marketing of shares in Scottish Power, which covers the southern part of Scotland, and Hydro-Electric in the north. The two companies are due to be floated later this month. This jolly romp through history features Forbes Masson and Alan Cumming alias Victor and Barry, a Scottish comedy duo, in roles as various as Robert the Bruce, Macbeth and a witch, the Emperor Hadrian and - in a particularly camp scene - Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora Macdonald. The series is the successor to the 'Frank N Stein' theme devised by WCRS for last November's sale of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies and the Collett, Dickinson Pearce 'Have you got the power?' theme for February's sale of the generators. But Faulds faced a different, perhaps trickier, task in devising the campaign for the Scottish companies than had the other two agencies because the marketing drive in Scotland is quite different from that in the rest of the UK. In Scotland, the shares are being marketed on a mass scale, as were those of the regional companies. But elsewhere, as in the generators' flotation, the campaign is being targeted at the more sophisticated private investor. The reasons are clear: in Scotland, take-up of privatisations has been low. Sale of these companies, of which the local population are customers, is seen by the government as a good opportunity to convert Scotland to share ownership. In England, by contrast, the government started off with an extensive list of privatisation share buyers, but without the customer connection. Scottish investors are being offered the choice of applying only for shares in their local company, or for a package comprising shares in both. Elsewhere, people can buy only the package. The minimum first payment for customers is set at Pounds 100; others will have to put up three times that. So television advertisements and posters are appearing in only the more affluent south-east of England. There are press advertisements in the Daily Express and the Daily Mail but not in other tabloids. In Scotland, by contrast, posters, television advertisements and press ads are appearing across the country. Despite these differences, Faulds decided against running separate campaigns in the two regions. James Faulds, managing director, explains: 'That could have been confusing, since you can buy national newspapers in both Scotland and England, and it would also have been more expensive.' Stressing the Scottishness of the companies, he says, was found to be a useful device in England. As far as business goes, people associate being Scottish with positive characteristics, such as canniness and prudence. But one might think sending up revered Scottish figures would be a risky strategy north of the border. However, Faulds says research before the campaign started did not bear that out. 'Scots enjoy having a laugh at themselves though they can get annoyed if outsiders do it,' he says. But with Cumming and Masson playing the leading roles and Stanley Baxter and Ian Cuthbertson doing the voice-overs, it has very much a home-grown feel. As in other privatisations, the series provides a simple guide to the steps prospective applicants have to take. First they are reminded to register to ensure that they are eligible for shareholder incentives. Later, during the offer period, they are told how to get an application form and the deadline for submitting it. For the most part, these simple messages are conveyed in the same way in both regions, although in England the phrase 'Scots or not' is tacked onto the end of the voice-overs. However, in some cases the messages had to diverge, for instance, during the offer period. There were worries that people in England would not realise prospectuses were widely available outside Scotland, and this message could not be got across in the Bannockburn advertisement. Hence Queen Elizabeth's reminder to Raleigh that prospectuses can be found at banks 'throughout my realm'. Different shareholder incentives and minimum application levels also presented a stumbling block; so one advertisement is being screened only in Scotland at the moment. It is a conversation between Robert the Bruce and the spider which, according to legend, he Bannockburn. Bruce raises various objections to registering for the share offer, including the fact that he is 'a wee bit short' at the moment. The spider finally persuades him to do so by saying he need pay only Pounds 100 upfront. Faulds hopes that the historical characters theme gives 'durability' to the series because it allows new people and situations to be introduced as the campaign progresses. Once people realise what the theme is, they start wondering who will appear next. But however evocative and entertaining the advertisements may be, no one thinks they will actually persuade people to apply for the shares. The one crucial factor in persuading them to do that is whether the offer is endorsed by financial journalists and there is nothing Faulds' creative team can do about that.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Ke'-signed report: "Support for the Development of Air </F> and Space Travel Is Essential"]    [Text] "State scientific support for the air and space  industry is essential," said Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt,  opening the International Air and Space Show at Berlin's  Schoenefeld Airport on Saturday [28 May]. "Although this  industry is relatively small in terms of the number of employees  and turnover, it is nevertheless of great strategic importance.  The existence of an efficient air and space industry is of  vital importance for Germany, if only because of its enormous  technological development possibilities," said the minister.    "Although on the one hand the aviation and space market  offers enormous growth opportunities over the next decade, and  on the other hand the state's financial capabilities are  becoming increasingly constrained, the state must nevertheless  offer help because the German aviation and space enterprises  will probably be unable to face competition from stronger  enterprises on their own," Rexrodt continued. In this  connection the minister spoke out in favor of the government  concentrating on key technologies in Germany and gradually  abolishing subsidies for those industrial branches that are of  diminishing importance.    He recalled that the most successful joint European  industrial program, the Airbus project, initiated by means of a  German-French agreement exactly 25 years ago on 29 May 1969, or  the development of the Ariana carrier rocket, which is used on  60 percent of commercial satellite launches these days, would  not have been possible without state assistance. "In this way,  we also succeeded in constructing a competitive European  counterweight to the market- dominant American space industry,"  said Rexrodt.    Against this background, Rexrodt sharply criticized German  Aerospace's [Dasa] decision not to take part in this year's  show. He said he was sorry that this enterprise did not  consider it necessary to support the Berlin Air Show's efforts  to regain its international importance. Earlier on, Wolfgang  Piller, president of the Association of German Air and Space  Industry, had said that the German aviation industry requires  greater security, and warned that with the coming into effect of  the GATT Treaty, the industry still lacks the opportunities that  the U.S. aviation industry has.    The Berlin show, which was visited by over 40,000 people on  its first day, was first of all overshadowed by a disaster. On  the morning of opening day, a small Russian Yak-58 aircraft  crashed on approach. The show lasts until 5 June. Some 134,000  people visited it two years ago.    There is no doubt that a subject of great interest this year  will be the new Airbus A-321, as a result of which the show is  developing into an important trade and information forum between  East and West. Thus, the countries of Central and East Europe  are particularly well represented at this year's International  Air and Space Show, which is organized by the Berlin Fair  Committee and the Association of German Air and Space Industry,  with the support of the Brandenburg and Berlin Laender and the  German Federation.</p>

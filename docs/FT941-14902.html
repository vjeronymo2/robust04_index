			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Nokia and Hewlett in alliance Nokia, the Finnish tele-communications manufacturer, has joined forces with Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics group, to develop the next generation of telecoms infrastructure. They have forged a strategic alliance to develop 'intelligent network' systems. The move underlines the convergence of computing and telecoms. Intelligent networks use advanced electronics to provide new services such as freephone, personal numbering and call forwarding. The alliance pools Nokia's telecoms expertise with Hewlett-Packard's computing platforms. The value of the deal is undisclosed, but 'several hundred' employees will be involved. Nokia, the world's second largest manufacturer of infrastructure for cellular networks, is keen to broaden its telecoms business, which last year accounted for nearly half its Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2bn) turnover. It will take responsibility for marketing and sales, expected to start later this year. Research and development will be carried out at Nokia's base at Espoo, Finland, and Hewlett-Packard's European centre at Grenoble, France. For Hewlett-Packard, the venture is one of several recent moves into mainstream telecoms. A year ago it launched a venture with Ericsson, the Swedish telecoms manufacturer, to provide network management systems. It also has links with Northern Telecom of Canada. Ovum, the London-based consultants, estimate annual expenditure on intelligent network systems could reach Dollars 5bn in Europe by 2000. By then, these services are expected to account for 10-15 per cent of call-charge revenue, up from 3 per cent. Mr Matti Alahuhta, president of Nokia Telecommunications, said: 'It was an obvious step for us to seek a long-term agreement with Hewlett-Packard, a leader in open-systems computing which also has a strong commitment to the telecom industry.' Mr Jeremy Ledger, a UK analyst with the consultancy Dataquest, said the deal was 'a notable stage in the convergence of different IT sectors in a field where the market opportunities are strong and growing'.

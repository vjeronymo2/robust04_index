			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Relief as modern work takes record: Saleroom THERE were sighs of relief at Sotheby's in New York on Tuesday night when Rebus, a painting by Robert Rauschenberg, sold for Dollars 7.26m (Pounds 4.2m), a record for this contemporary American artist. The canvas, painted in 1955, is an anthology of modern art, incorporating dripped paint, collage, comic strip, photography, graffiti, and more. Rebus last appeared at Sotheby's little more than two years ago, when it was sold to Mr Hans Thulin, a Swedish industrialist, for Dollars 6.3m. It signalled the arrival of contemporary art as a lucrative market. Since then prices, and Mr Thulin's fortunes, have declined. He and Sotheby's were taking a gamble by offering Rebus again so prematurely. The buyer was Mr Larry Gagosian, a New York dealer who often acts for Mr Charles Saatchi, a director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. In spite of the financial difficulties of the company, in which he is a significant shareholder, Mr Saatchi has recently been busily buying the big names of modern art, paying Dollars 3.08m for Third Time Painting by Rauschenberg at Sotheby's last November. To finance his acquisitions, Mr Saatchi is selling the minimalist and neo-expressionist art that he acquired in the 1970s. He is disposing of about 30 paintings in the New York auction rooms this week, and sold four at Sotheby's on Tuesday - two works by Cy Twombly and two by Philip Guston, and a Brice Marden. The auction totalled Dollars 21.256m for 68 lots, with 18 per cent by value unsold. One of the Saatchi Twombly's called Untitled made Dollars 2.2m and the other, Untitled Grey Painting, Dollars 880,000. Both sold below estimate, suggesting that although buyers - mainly US private collectors and German dealers - were bidding, they were not prepared to pay the prices of a year ago. The results were more depressing at Sotheby's auction of modern British art in London yesterday which totalled Pounds 906,180, but with 37.5 per cent unsold. Of two paintings by Stanley Spencer, one, The Baptism, sold within estimate for Pounds 462,000. But the other, Hilda and I at Burghclere, was unsold at Pounds 190,000. Mr David Kerr, a dealer, paid a record Pounds 60,500 for a work by John Craxton - Boy, Girl and Cat, dated 1948.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Yemelin: "What Is the Way Out? Agrarians' </F> Conference in State Duma"]    [Text] The State Duma has been working for six months now  but there are still no laws whatever regulating relations in the  economy's agrarian sector. Why is this? What are the reasons  for such a long period of disorder?    It emerges that the answer is fairly simple. An extremely  irregular situation has arisen with regard to the passage of  draft laws on agrarian reform. The list of priority legislative  acts in this area was decided long ago, and work on them has  been and continues to be carried out. However, the government  has not officially submitted a single draft law to the State  Duma. And the drafts which the Duma committee on agrarian  questions has elaborated do not receive support from  the...government. This is a vicious circle!    In order to get a clear and unequivocal picture of the  sides'  positions, last Friday (17 June) members of the Duma's agrarian  faction and leaders of the agrarian sector met -- Vice Premier  A. Zaveryukha, V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture and food, N.  Komov, chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Land  Resources and Land Management, S. Ignatyev, deputy minister of  economics, A. Krasnopivtsev, deputy minister of finance, and  other executives from government structures.    The deputies were unanimous that the draft agrarian laws are  clearly being blocked by the government team. All references to  difficulties in coordination were deemed to be unfounded. Our  draft laws, M. Lapshin emphasized, are being blocked not for  technical but for ideological reasons.    What remains in Russia that has not been privatized? Only  the land, it seems. For this very reason radical reformers are  stubbornly seeking to adopt first of all a Civil Code  incorporating paragraphs which make land a commodity, and only  then to enshrine these provisions in a Land Code.    In the opinion of Deputy V. Vershinin, the agrarian sector's  leaders are today powerless to change the situation somehow. It  is necessary to appeal to the president and the public. It has  actually been decided to make such an appeal. These most  important questions for the fate of rural areas will be broached  in the course of the forthcoming meeting between agrarian  deputies and the Russian president 27 June.</p>

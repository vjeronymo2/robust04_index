			<p>BFN     [Text] Rafah, 14 May (MENA) -- The Palestinian Liaison  Committee has resumed its work in the Gaza Strip to take over  the rest of sites allocated for the Palestinian national  security forces and to take the final measures for the police  forces' deployment.    Liaison officer Brigadier General Ghazi al-Jabali said the  handover of police and civilian authority sites in the Jericho  area has been completed and that the Palestinian authorities  have begun work. He added that police forces are being deployed  in the northern part of Gaza in preparation for its handover to  the civilian authorities. According to the agreement, he said,  the civilian authority should remain in place for a three-year  transitional period under the PLO leadership.    Coordination official Colonel Zakariya Ba'lushah said that  obstacles impeding the entry of some personnel of the  Palestinian national security forces have been removed and the  civilian police will assume their duties in providing security  as soon as they enter.    Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majayirah said the forces  coming from Libya, Sudan, and Algeria continue to assemble  inside Rafah on the international border with Egypt and enter  the Gaza Strip in stages according to a timetable being drawn up  in coordination with the Israeli side. He added that the  Palestinian national security forces are made up of several  groups, such as the civilian police, security forces, and  intelligence, in addition to civil defense and other police  services, who will perform their roles in maintaining internal  security and order; guarding military posts, border crossings,  and public figures; and maintaining the security of the country,  its citizens, and the self-rule areas.    Elsewhere, Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander in chief of  the forces, and members of the civilian authority continue to  follow up on the withdrawal from various sites, the Israeli  withdrawal from the few remaining places, and the deployment of  Palestinian personnel in them. This procedure is scheduled to  be complete by Wednesday, when the self-rule authorities will  assume their role inside the Gaza Strip and Jericho area.</p>

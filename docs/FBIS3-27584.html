Bank vice-chairman Huang Diyan yesterday said difficulties  included managing the bad debts arising from policy-driven  lending, and maintaining a stable yuan.    In a speech on China's financial system, Mr Huang, who is  also the chief executive of the bank's Hong Kong-Macao Office,  said inherent problems were a result of the wide exposure of the  reform measures.    "Their success will mainly depend on transformation of the  mechanism of state-owned enterprises, and a healthy fiscal  system," he said.    Mr Huang said the latest financial reforms were the most  thorough in China over the past 15 years. China, since January  1, has launched a series of financial reforms on exchange rates  and taxation, following the economic austerity programme  introduced last July in a bid to rein in the country's heated  economy.    He said the current financial system had problems which had  not been touched by previous reforms. They included a confusion  of responsibilities among financial institutions that limited  their ability to tune the economy, and an incomplete financial  regulatory framework, which had led to a proliferation of  lending.    He also pointed to the limitations of interest rates as a  tool of regulating the demand for funds.    The latest reforms, gave the People's Bank of China greater  authority over note issue, monetary management, credit  adjustment, foreign exchange policy and interest rates,  strengthening its role as a central bank.    The reforms also took away the responsibility for  policy-driven decisions from the four specialist banks, which  include the Bank of China, freeing them to act as commercial  banks.</p>

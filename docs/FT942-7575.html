			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: 'Our share of world trade in services has continued to fall' - The problem Scattered through the 163 pages of the government's competitiveness white paper is a frank assessment of the UK economy's relative standing. The authors say: 'The white paper sets out the government's view of the UK's competitive position. It provides, in a time span outside the normal cut and thrust of party politics, an assessment of the UK's relative strengths and weaknesses - those factors which fundamentally determine a nation's international standing.' Therein lies its originality. As the paper itself acknowledges, most of the policy discussion describes initiatives which the government has already announced. But governments, especially those which have been in power for 15 years, are not in the habit of subjecting themselves to a critical audit. The paper also stresses that the white paper will be updated and that the ministerial group on competitiveness, which has helped to draw it up, will remain in existence. 'At the head of this approach is a recognition that the UK needs a culture of continuing improvement. Competitiveness is dynamic. We cannot ever afford to stand still. For as we change and innovate, the outside world also changes,' the paper says. The authors have had to negotiate a fine line between being honest about the UK's problems while remaining positive about how they have been tackled over the past 15 years. Similarly, the authors have attempted to justify limited intervention by the government without undermining the government's belief in free markets. Both of these issues are tackled in the first chapter - Setting the Scene - as is the question of 'What is Competitiveness?'. The economic landscape, says the white paper, is changing before our eyes. The economies of the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development now produce only around half of world output as the non-OECD countries, such as the Asian 'tigers', catch up. 'Hong Kong and Singapore now have average incomes which match those of the UK.' International trade has been one of the main forces behind faster growth since the second world war. Trade barriers are continuing to fall. These changes will increase living standards throughout the world but will also increase competition. 'The rapid spread of capitalism, the opening of closed economies and the removal of rigid systems of central planning could bring a low cost labour force of 1.2bn people on to world markets as producers as well as consumers.' Advances in technology and communications, and rapid changes in demographic structure, will also shape economic growth in the coming decades. Amid these changes, what does it mean for a nation to be competitive? The paper quotes approvingly the OECD definition: '. . . the degree to which a nation can, under free and fair market conditions, produce goods and services which meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real incomes of its people over the long term'. The analysis then traces the weaknesses in UK performance back to the end of the 19th century. After 1945 Britain's standard of living rose faster than ever before 'but other countries did still better'. The 1980s saw a marked improvement. 'Manufacturing productivity grew faster than the US, France and Germany. Our share of the volume of world trade stabilised after decades of decline. Our overall growth rate was similar to France, Germany and Italy. The climate of industrial relations was transformed and the business sector invested a similar proportion of its value-added to our major competitors. There was also a dramatic rise in the number of small firms. At the end of 1991 there were 900,000.' But there are no grounds for complacency. 'The improvements of the 1980s mean that we are now back in touch with the leaders, but there remains a lot of ground to make up . . . Although we have many world beating companies, average productivity levels in manufacturing have not yet risen to those of our major competitors . . . And our overall share of world trade in services has continued to fall.' GDP per head placed the UK in 16th position in 1993 among OECD countries, up from 18th position in 1991. Is manufacturing special? The paper says that all sectors of the economy are important but continues: 'A competitive manufacturing sector is essential for our long-term prosperity . . . Manufacturing is a major employer and a 1 per cent change in exports of manufactures would be balanced by a 3 per cent change in the exports of services.' And what is the government's role? 'Business - not governments - create wealth . . . The government's role is to create the conditions in which firms throughout the economy can improve competitiveness by providing the stable macroeconomic environment which enables business to plan ahead with confidence, making markets work more efficiently and broadening the influence of market disciplines on resource allocation, pursuing tax policies which encourage enterprise and do not hinder economic efficiency, and improving value for money in those services which are best provided by the public sector.' That is not all. In a more interventionist passage the paper talks about regulating to reduce uncertainty and adds: 'Where markets do not work well in delivering the goods and services that people want, the government has a positive and pro-active role to play. It has a central role in areas critical to the process of wealth creation.' The paper goes on to justify government intervention in education, funding research and development, the supply of capital to small companies, removing barriers to employment and encouraging employers to train their workforces. The section on education and training and the section on management contain the white paper's sharpest criticism of past UK performance. 'We have to aim higher than in the past. We have to develop the self-confidence and self esteem which make good citizens and good workers. We have to demand respect and rewards for vocational education and training as well as academic study. Above all, we have to give all our people - not just some of them - every opportunity to give of their best . . . For too long the UK's levels of participation and achievement have dragged us down the international education and training league.' Employment, by contrast, is largely a success story according to the white paper. Industrial relations has dramatically improved and the labour market is more flexible. There are worries that unemployment remains 'uncomfortably high' and that earnings grew faster than justified by improved performance in the 1980s. But the paper says the position is now improving on both fronts and adds that low non-wage labour costs remain an important competitive advantage. On management and innovation the paper says that, by any standards, the management of some UK companies equals or exceeds that of its international competitors. 'But overall national performance is determined not by the standard of the best but by the average. It is here that the UK lags behind the competition.' The paper also cites a report from the Cranfield European Enterprise Centre which found a large 'perception gap' among UK managers who considered themselves the best in Europe but were considered third out of five countries by managers in other countries. Responsibility for improving management performance lies with companies but the government can help by disseminating best practice, improving management education, and providing access to appropriate business services, the paper says. On innovation, too, while some companies and sectors are world class, too many are not. The need for improvement shows in a number of ways: 'Total UK expenditure on research and development has declined relative to our main competitors . . . The UK has a declining share of US patents . . . Technical qualifications tend to be less common and less well rewarded than in other countries.' On finance for business the paper says the UK financial system is among the most sophisticated in the world but adds 'there have been expressions of concern over the supply of finance to industry'. The tone here is neutral - the government reporting complaints rather than endorsing them - and includes: inflexibility in dividend payments; excessive reliance on overdrafts; small businesses complaining that banks place too much emphasis on security; and late payment. But the paper does also note various initiatives to improve corporate governance, to encourage the supply of long-term finance, and to improve the financing of small- and medium-sized businesses. The paper deals with several other areas. The section on the macroeconomic framework stresses the need to keep inflation and public debt low. On the European dimension, the paper praises the European Union's single market initiative but warns that the EU is becoming over-prescriptive in some areas. The section on 'Fair and Open Markets' covers trade policy, state aids, export promotion and inward and outward investment. 'Communications and Infrastructure' deals with telecommunications, broadcasting, transport and other utilities. Other chapters include London, Regeneration, Commercial Framework (regulation and law, and taxation), the Business of Government, and Public Purchasing. In conclusion the paper states: 'This white paper is, in effect, a snapshot of the work in hand across government. It shows a formidable agenda of action and initiatives. It reveals the comprehensive nature of the government's work and how it can support wealth creation.'</p>

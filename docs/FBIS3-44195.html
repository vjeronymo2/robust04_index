			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The group chief executive of the SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation], Mr. Wynand Harmse, says  private broadcasters may have to contribute to the  corporations's funding in future. Addressing a conference on  radio broadcasting in Johannesburg, he said the imminent  deregulation of the industry would mean a loss of income for the  SABC, as many new broadcasters would enter the advertising  market. [passage omitted]    The chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters,  Mr.  Stan Katz, told the conference that the Independent Broadcast  Authority would probably be established towards the end of  March. He said permanent licenses for new broadcasters would be  granted in about six to eight months from now. Mr. Katz said he  did not believe that private broadcasters were needed before the  April election to ensure adequate voter education and coverage  of political events.</p>

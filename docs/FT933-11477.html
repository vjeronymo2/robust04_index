			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Observer: Changing station Will Gianni Locatelli, Italy's rising media star, find his next challenge as easy to master as his last one? During his editorship of Sole 24, Italy's pink financial daily, sales have doubled and the paper has become essential reading. But RAI, Italy's state broadcasting corporation, could be a far tougher nut to crack. As the new director-general, Locatelli inherits an organisation which exhibits one of the most flagrant examples of the way the political parties carved up the institutions of state. The Christian Democrats control the main TV channel, the Socialists the second and the third has been handed as a sop to what were once Communists. Locatelli's brief is not only to introduce greater objectivity in news and limit the politicking but also to tackle the organisation's disastrous finances and overblown staff. This could mean cutting the number of state channels to two, and preparing for a more general broadcasting reform that would also reduce Silvio Berlusconi's near monopolistic grip on commercial television. It makes John Birt's job at the BBC look a doddle.</p>

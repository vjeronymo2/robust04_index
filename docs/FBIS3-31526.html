			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic Arpad Goncz  has received Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Our  reporter, who was present at the event, has just got in touch,  so we go over to Jozsef Barath:    [Barath] Good morning. Arpad Goncz began his talks with  Andrey Kozyrev with congratulations. Russian diplomacy has  saved the world from the dangers which the deterioration of the  circumstances in Bosnia might have meant, he said. And it has  saved NATO from the loss of prestige which would inevitably have  followed from an intervention, or from unavoidable withdrawal.    At the same time, Russian diplomacy has once again  strengthened its prestige, which increases the region's  stability.    At the discussion, which was longer than planned, Arpad  Goncz  praised the cooperation of the West and NATO, which has led,  which could lead, to the negotiated settlement of the Balkan  crisis. The key to this, however, lies in the hands of the  region's people.    Kozyrev conveyed the greetings of President Yeltsin to Arpad  Goncz and said that in making foreign political decisions, Boris  Yeltsin begins with what would increase security. If Russia had  been left out of the Bosnian settlement, this could have  destabilized the Balkans and the whole of Central Europe. That  is why there was a need for Russia to assume an increased role.    Russia supports cooperation -- the Partnership for Peace --  with NATO. And within the CSCE process, it is ready for  cooperation also in the matter of the national minorities and  other issues as well.</p>

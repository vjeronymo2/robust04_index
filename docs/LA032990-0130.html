			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> COMPELLING DRAMA OF HIROSHIMA SURVIVORS  </P> <P> Shohei Imamura's "Black Rain" (at the Westside Pavilion) -- not to be confused  with the recent Ridley Scott set-in-Japan action-thriller -- takes its title  from a phenomenon that occurred in the aftermath of the atomic bombing of  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Moisture in the air, permeated by radioactive ash,  condensed into rain and fell in dark, lethal drops.  </P> <P> The heart of the the matter is the psychological torment of those who must live  with the uncertain, unpredictable nature of having been exposed to such  radioactive fallout. They worry for themselves and for each other; they are  terror-struck by merely feeling under the weather. Imamura makes palpable the  agony of living with the unknown.  </P> <P> "Black Rain," which was shot appropriately in black-and-white and has a  discreet Toru Takemitsu score, is of course implicitly an anti-nuclear protest  and a very strong one at that. But it also a protest of discrimination against  the atomic bomb survivors, who number today approximately 370,OO0, and it  furthermore belongs to a large group of Japanese films concerned with exposing  the terrible price exacted of ordinary citizens by World War II.  </P> <P> Based on a 1969 novel drawn from diaries and interviews with actual Hiroshima  survivors, "Black Rain" opens in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of  Hiroshima and tells the story of a family of survivors, a middle-aged couple,  Shigematsu and Shigeko Shizuma (Kazuo Kitamura, Etsuko Ichihara) and their  niece Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka). Only the aunt and uncle actually were in  Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, although Yasuko was exposed to the black  rain.  </P> <P> Of all the major films of Imamura, one of the most distinctive and powerful  filmmakers in the world, "Black Rain" is the most conventional, perhaps because  of the enormity of the catastrophe with which he is trying to come to terms. It  is in fact a tribute to his ability to compel us that his film recovers and  develops a timeless sense of urgency from what seems a major miscalculation at  its start. For instead of relying upon archival footage, Imamura re-creates the  immediate after-effects of the bombing upon the citizens of Hiroshima, with  scores of people wandering about with their flesh literally melting like wax.  Their hideous wounds, however, are patently fake yet so horrible as for us to  resist suspending disbelief -- we're relieved and glad to be able to realize  that it's all just make-up. As a result, it takes a considerable amount of time  to get caught up in the story -- to accept its reality in all its  relentlessness.  </P> <P> Eventually, however, Imamura's abiding preoccupation, which is obsessive  behavior, comes into play. The Shizumas commence resuming a semblance of normal  existence at the country estate of the uncle, a wealthy landowner and the  dominant figure in a small, idyllic-looking rural community. All three seem  perfectly healthy, and they look forward happily to Yasuko's imminent arranged  marriage. But when the engagement is broken off -- Yasuko's prospective in-laws  fear she really is not healthy -- a heartbreaking pattern is set in motion, for  Yasuko discovers she is permanently stigmatized by her exposure to the black  rain. Meanwhile, the Shizumas and their neighbors are learning that the atom  bomb has in effect set off within all exposed to it a time bomb in the form of  radiation sickness.  </P> <P> Imamura is most effective at getting his actors to suggest what it is like to  confront and live with an enduring, slowly-consuming sense of horror. By the  time "Black Rain" (Times-rated Mature) is over its impact is akin to that of  Lynne Littman's galvanic nuclear holocaust drama "Testament."  </P> <P> 'BLACK RAIN'  </P> <P> An Angelika Films release.

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Observer: Diversons Instead of having its mind concentrated wonderfully, the Lloyd's community seems to be bracing itself for impending dire underwriting results with fin-de-siecle diversions. For example, diaries are being starred for May 7, the start of the disciplinary hearing of Ed Cowen, former underwriter of non-marine syndicate 529, at London's Great Eastern Hotel. It is the first such hearing to be held in public. Cowen's alleged misdemeanours - the reason for his suspension from Lloyd's last winter - centre on the arcane world of reinsurance, where the only testimony that counts is that of expert witnesses. He is claimed to have gained personal advantage at a level which would hardly have bought a second-hand BMW. But there are principles at stake, and Cowen's supporters believe his defence will - as one put it - 'open a few eyes'. So dark glasses and false beards may well be the order of the day at the hearing, not only for spectators, but for some of the witnesses.</p>

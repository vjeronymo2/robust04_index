			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The idea of establishing alternative television in  the Crimea has been voiced by [passage indistinct]. The  Crimeans, Averkin noted, are currently offered a poor medium in  Ukrainian state television, meaning the Crimean Broadcasting  Company, which, in his opinion, protects the interests of  Ukraine, rather than Crimea. The new broadcasting company --  says the chairman of the association Impact 55 that has a  criminal record -- will serve the Crimean people and protect  their interests.    Averkin suggests that the new broadcasting company be  financed by the Crimean budget, all revenues of which now remain  in Crimea. We will establish and finance our own broadcasting  company, the businessmen-politician said, and later we will  assess how Crimean television is doing. Averkin's idea, in the  correspondent's opinion, will undoubtedly be backed by Crimean  President Meshkov, who has asked Valeriy Astakhov, the current  president of the Crimean Broadcasting Company, to resign. There  are, however, no legal grounds for dismissing the latter or any  other inconvenient radio and television journalists.</p>

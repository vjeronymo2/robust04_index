BORBA has learned from reliable dealers' circles  that the value of one German mark was between 1.42 and 1.5  dinars in gray hard-currency transactions between banks, and  banks and companies.    The erosion of the national currency has already been going  on for 10 days. According to the decision by Dragoslav  Avramovic, the National Bank president, the National Bank tried  to intervene on the money and securities market by selling  state-owned securities the day before yesterday [7 March]. The  central monetary authority thus tried to prevent the further  growth of the commercial banks' liquidity since it established  that the money surplus in bank accounts was enabling the banks  to pay the difference between the real and the official exchange  rate.    Although the response of the banks to buying state-owned  securities was good, the devaluation of the dinar was not  halted. It is considered that the national bank intervention has  not borne fruit because the cause of devaluation was  ill-defined. The appearance of the difference between the real  and the official exchange rate is not a result of the high  liquidity of banks, but of the mistrust that companies have in  the program of monetary reconstruction and the economic recovery  of the country.    Representatives of the Federal, Serbian, and Montenegrin  Governments met with [Federal Prime Minister] Kontic the day  before yesterday and decided to try to take all possible  economic steps to stop the devaluation of the national currency.  Mistrust in the economy is growing from day to day, however,  which can be seen from the exchange rate of the dinar against  German mark over the last 10 days. It has constantly been  falling--from 1.10 to 1.50 dinars for a German mark. Some  businessmen and banks are pessimistic and predict that the state  and the national bank could apply an administrative measure. If  this happens, the prognoses are not favorable.    The commodity markets have already responded to the gray  zone  in hard-currency transactions. People who went to the market  during the weekend noticed that the prices of agricultural  products had risen. Apart from agricultural products, the  prices of some other products, such as cement, iron, and other  construction materials as well as ferrous and nonferrous  metallurgy products had risen by 30 to 40 percent.</p>

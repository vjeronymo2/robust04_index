			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CITY HALL GAG ORDER WINS FINAL APPROVAL  </P> <P> The City Council has given final approval to an ordinance that prohibits  council members, city officers or employees from publicly disclosing  information discussed in private meetings.  </P> <P> The council also unanimously passed a resolution that will exempt the city  attorney and city manager from the new law when "necessary to perform their  duties."  </P> <P> The ordinance was proposed in July by Councilman Daniel E. Griset, who said he  wanted to stop information leaks around City Hall. He particularly objected to  "calculated" leaks that he said came from closed-door council sessions where  sensitive personnel matters or pending litigation is discussed.  </P> <P> The council holds at least two closed sessions each month before or after  regular council meetings. Under the new law, individuals sitting in on the  closed portion of the meeting can only disclose the content of discussions with  permission from a majority of the council.  </P> <P> The ordinance was given preliminary approval by the council on Aug. 6 by a 4-3  vote. Councilmen John Acosta, Ron May and Richards L. Norton voted against the  measure. The votes remained the same during the final approval process this  week.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana law is similar to one in Costa Mesa, the only other city in  Orange County to pass a law which prohibits closed-session information from  being discussed.

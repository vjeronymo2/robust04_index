			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Belfast gets centre for badly addressed letters THE POST OFFICE is creating 300 jobs in Belfast with the opening of a national processing centre to handle badly addressed mail from all over Britain, it was announced yesterday. The new handling centre for undeliverable letters will be opened in May at Donegall Quay, part of the Laganside inner-city redevelopment area. Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director of Royal Mail, said: 'We are setting up a new national centre with state-of-the-art computer technology in place of numerous manually operated offices to make our return-letter service faster, more efficient and cost-effective. We are one of the few postal administrations in the world which offers a return-letter service - and which does not make any additional charge to the customer for this service.' The sender of an undeliver-able letter will get it back within two weeks with an explanation. The Royal Mail spends Pounds 8m a year dealing with mail that cannot be delivered, accounting for 120m of the 15bn items handled each year. The government's policy of decentralising jobs to the regions has created about 1,500 jobs in the province in the past 18 months. There will be two centres for stray mail. Belfast will deal with letters only and Portsmouth will handle packets. The European Community awarded a Pounds 900,000 grant to the centre because Northern Ireland is designated a special development area. Man of letters, Page 8</p>

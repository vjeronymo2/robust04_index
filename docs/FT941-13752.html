			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Next/Burton - Other Companies The spate of retailers' Christmas trading statements draws to a close this week with announcements expected from fashion groups Burton and Next on Thursday. Analysts are expecting only a moderate increase in sales at Burton, with a stronger performance from department store group Debenhams than from the high street chains. They are also nervous that earlier hopes that margins would have been held may not be fulfilled. Next is thought to have had a strong Christmas, with sales up as much as 14 or 15 per cent.</p>

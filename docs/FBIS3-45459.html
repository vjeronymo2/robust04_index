			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter in London: "China Plans Large-Scale </F> Capital Raising, and 20 Enterprises Are To List on Hong Kong  Stock Market in 1994"]    [Text] London, 16 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Professor Liu Hongru,  chairman of China's Securities Supervision and Administration  Committee, said here that 20 state-owned enterprises would list  on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this year, and some would also  have secondary listings on the New York and London exchanges. A  small number of these enterprises would have their primary  listings in New York. In addition, feasibility studies on  listing shares of some state-owned enterprises on the London  Stock Exchange or in southeast Asian markets, such as Singapore,  are also being conducted.    At a promotion hosted by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,  Professor Liu Hongru revealed that in 1994, China's securities  business will undergo its greatest changes. This year, over 100  companies will list their shares on the stock exchange, raising  a total of 5.5 billion yuan.    He said that the two existing stock exchanges in China are  located in Shenzhen and Shanghai, both of which are in the  southern part of the country. This limits their capacity. The  authorities are now considering the establishment of another  stock exchange in the north of the country.    As for the future prospects of the securities markets in  Shanghai and Hong Kong, Liu said that there are many differences  between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a financial center  in which international investors had great confidence. After  1997, the "one country, two systems" policy will enable Hong  Kong to maintain its current status. China attaches great  importance to Hong Kong's bridging role.    Professor Liu Hongru is visiting Britain at the invitation  of  the British Government. During his visit, he will meet with  British officials from the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the  Department of Trade and Industry, and the stock exchange. He  said that China should learn from Britain's finance industry.    When asked whether the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's  political arrangements would affect Sino-British economic and  trade cooperation and the performances of H-shares in Hong Kong,  he said that the number of Chinese enterprises listed on the  Hong Kong Stock Exchange would increase from nine to 20 this  year, and the Hang Seng Index had topped 10,000 points. These  facts gave the answer.    Liu Hongru also talked about China's macro-control measures.  He said that in 1994, measures to prohibit real estate  companies from listing on stock exchanges would be relaxed, but  only those engaged in renovating old urban areas and  constructing houses for ordinary residents would be allowed to  list. Companies engaged in real estate speculation would still  be forbidden to list.    At present, six state-owned Chinese enterprises are listed  on  the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and another three are arranging  listings. Lee Yik-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong Joint  Exchange, said that the three Chinese enterprises would be  listed in February or March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the biggest contingent of Commonwealth  observers put together to monitor an election have begun  arriving in Johannesburg. The Commonwealth secretary general,  Emeka Anyaoku, arrived in South Africa on Friday [8 April] and  will brief members of the mission who are already here. Former  Jamaican prime minister, Michael Manley, who will lead the  120-strong Commonwealth Observers' Group to South Africa, is  expected to arrive on Wednesday. The aim of the mission is to  form an independent judgment on whether conditions exist for a  free election, and if the result of the election reflects the  will of the people. Mission members will be deployed throughout  the country from 16 April.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Face change, US steelmakers told THE big integrated US steel companies and their unions were accused yesterday of being resistant to change, and told that protectionism was not a solution to their problems. Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, speaking at a steel conference in New York, said the US integrated steel industry 'puts me in mind not of the dinosaur, to which it is often compared, but rather the ostrich.' He said movements in competitive positions based on cost/price relationships and exchange rate swings, along with new technology, should by now have led to a fundamental reassessment by US integrated steel of its position in the market place. 'Instead,' he said 'there has been a tendency to push the blame for the growing problems onto some external agency, the curbing of which might facilitate a return to prosperity. This comfortable response allows companies to avoid facing up to the necessity of change, and to defer their problems for the time being.' Mr Moffat's speech comes a day after he criticised continuing state subsidies for steelmakers in Spain and Italy, and urged the European Commission to press ahead with its restructuring plan for the European steel industry. Mr Moffat said the US provided a good example of the problems which arise from recourse to protection. Imports' share of the US market had risen by 6 percentage points to 18 per cent over the period from 1973 to 1992, in line with the worldwide trend towards expansion of trade. Yet in the same period the US integrated producers' share of the US market had fallen by 29 percentage points to 33 per cent. The beneficiaries had been the mini-mills, up 16 percentage points to 22 per cent, and the 'reconstituted mills' - companies reorganised under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and management buy-outs, which now take 27 per cent of the market. Mr Moffat said that, while he did not dispute the right of countries to take action against genuinely unfair and injurious imports, 'I strongly believe that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should play an increasingly important role in the determination of such decisions.' He suggested industry should enter into a multilateral steel agreement, which would underpin the elimination of subsidies, encourage privatisation and result in less government interference. 'Anti-dumping actions and subsidies are merely delaying actions. They will not solve the problems the industry faces.'</p>

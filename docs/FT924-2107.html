			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Dispute over repair to pit A ROW has broken out between Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, and Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, days before the committee completes taking evidence for its inquiry into the future of the energy sector. The dispute centres on whether British Coal should take immediate steps to repair a deteriorating coalface at the Silverhill colliery in Nottinghamshire, one of 10 pits where mining has stopped, pending completion of the government's review of the coal industry. In a private letter written earlier this month, Mr Caborn accused Mr Clarke of 'a direct breach of British Coal's commitments to the committee'. Mr Caborn has asked Lord Justice Glidewell and Mr Justice Hidden to consider whether failure to repair the face during the review period might be a breach of British Coal's commitments to the High Court. In his correspondence with Mr Caborn Mr Clarke repeated British Coal's assurance that 'any deterioration in the condition of faces' would be dealt with 'if this might jeopardise either the fabric of the mine, or our ability to re-establish coaling at that mine.' He insisted: 'This is not the case at Silverhill.' He added: 'The integrity of Silverhill Colliery has not been and will not be jeopardised.' British Coal has undertaken to maintain the fabric of the 10 pits so that if it is decided to re-establish coal production at any or all of them, it will be possible to do so.</p>

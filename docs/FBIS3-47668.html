"Future consumption tax must be indicated... and should be  stated in a package of tax reform bills" on cuts in income tax  and taxes levied by local authorities on their residents, Kan  Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a press conference  called to correct his comments.    Earlier, the head of the advisory panel to the prime  minister  told reporters, "It's not necessary now" to include the  consumption tax rate as long as the package includes the timing  of the hike.    The consumption tax, currently 3 percent, is levied on  practically all goods and services.    Kato's earlier statement was apparently aimed at mollifying  members of the ruling coalition -- most notably the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan] -- who are strongly opposed to  raising the consumption tax rate.    His retraction came after the Finance Ministry objected that  his comments could be interpreted as virtually allowing a tax  cut to be carried out separately from hiking the consumption tax.    Kato said the tax cut will stimulate the economy even if a  consumption tax hike is included in the package for later  implementation.    "The tax cut might have been ineffective last year, but  would  be effective this year" with the economy "starting to show signs  of hitting bottom," he said.    A consumption tax hike would therefore not undermine  consumption, and the government and politicians should clearly  state the "consumption tax rate and its timing" in the proposed  tax law to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds to fund the tax  cut, Kato said.    He said the argument that a consumption tax hike would  dampen  consumption is "absolutely a fiction," especially in Japan where  savings are still high compared with other countries.    "Last-minute" spending can be expected, as happened in China  when the government there announced in December a new  consumption tax, he said, adding the panel is to study the  Chinese case.    Many computer simulations show that the economy may "suffer  sluggish consumption for six months to a year" after the  spending spree subsides, but will "recover in the following  year," he said.    Japanese politicians and U.S. Government officials have  voiced concerns that a tax cut would be ineffective if linked to  a future consumption tax hike.    Referring to opinions that an income tax cut would spur  economic recovery, leading to increased tax revenues, Kato said  such a scenario has been proven wrong in the United States under  the administration of President Ronald Reagan.    Concerning deficit-covering bonds, he said, "Bridge bonds  are  for repayment in the short term, and it's irresponsible... to  borrow without any scheme for paying back."    "Politicians may not win votes with a consumption tax  hike...but those who correct public views instead of just  following them are the true politicians," he said.    As for signs of the economy hitting bottom, he cited  recovering spending mainly on housing resulting from lower land  prices, impact of the yen's exchange rate changing favorably for  Japanese companies, and an expected increase in automobile  purchases because of a cut in the tax on automobile sales.    He also said the bribery scandals involving general  contractors that have held up public works projects are "near  settlement," and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks may lead to lower prices.    Meanwhile, a senior member of the tax panel told reporters  the panel cannot support any issuance of deficit-covering bonds  and wants the government to launch the tax cut and hike in a  single law.    But the panel, which resumed discussing the tax reform  Friday  after a break since mid-December, confirmed its stance of  "leaving the decision to the government and coalition parties,"  he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.    As for a timetable, the panel will meet on Tuesday and  Friday  next week and hold meetings almost evevy day from the following  week with a target of issuing final proposals by the end of  January, he said.</p>

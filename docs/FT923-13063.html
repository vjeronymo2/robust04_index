			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / KIO chief summoned for talks: Kuwait seeks to clarify role in threatened collapse of Spanish company THE London-based president of the Kuwait Investment Office has been summoned for an urgent meeting with the Kuwaiti government today after mounting criticism of the KIO's role in the threatened collapse of Ercros, Spain's biggest chemicals company. Mr Ali Rashid Al-Bader is to meet Crown Prince Sheik Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, prime minister, the Kuwaiti finance ministry said in a statement reported by news agencies yesterday. The report said he had been asked to explain why the KIO, which manages Kuwait's overseas investments and which owns at least 39 per cent of Ercros, had forced the holding company and one of its affiliates to seek protection from creditors two weeks ago. Ercros owes Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.12bn) to creditors. The KIO has refused to make new funds available without a broader agreement on assistance from creditor banks and the Spanish government. A spokeswoman for the KIO in London would neither confirm nor deny that Mr Al-Bader had been recalled. 'My only comment is no comment,' she said. It is understood that Mr Al-Bader is already in the emirate and that he will meet Mr Nasr al-Rowdan, the finance minister, today. He is expected to return to London tonight. The position adopted by the KIO, which surrounds its affairs with the utmost secrecy, has been harshly criticised in public by Spanish ministers and bankers. The Ercros crisis has also led to calls from the political opposition in Kuwait for an investigation into KIO's investments in Spain. At Ercros, it is the holding company and its fertiliser divisions which have been forced to suspend payments. Its smaller mining, chemicals and explosives divisions have been operating normally, but Spanish banks have demanded early payment from some of them in the past few days of loans worth more than Dollars 20m. Late last week, a small Ercros road transport affiliate filed separately to suspend payments to its creditors. Many small suppliers face ruin if they are not paid by Ercros, which itself employs 10,500 people. The company fears that some of its fertiliser plants may close this month if KIO or the Spanish government do not provide funds. Madrid says European Community subsidy rules prevent it from making new funds available to Ercros. The KIO has also been subject to intense criticism within the emirate, with both the local press and opposition members of the National Assembly alleging that bad management had led to large losses. The value of the KIO's investment holdings is believed to have shrunk from about Dollars 65bn to about Dollars 35bn. KIO disposals include heavy selling in Japan. It also sold most of its 10.3 per cent stake in the Midland bank in the UK shortly before Midland shares were boosted by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid.</p>

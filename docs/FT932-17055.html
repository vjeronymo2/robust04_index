			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Observer: Club matters The Overseas Bankers Club, opposite the Bank of England, has always been a bit of an oddball. Was it set up for British banks which operated mainly overseas such as the Bank of London and South America, Barclays DCO and Grindlays? Or was it a dining room for foreign banks in London which couldn't afford their own facilities? Whatever the origins, the decision to change its name to The Bankers Club should help clear up the confusion. Although the number of foreign banks in London is much the same as ever, the number of foreign bankers with big expense accounts has been falling and the club badly needs more members. Interesting to see whether the change of name will also lead to a change in the tradition of the club president being a Brit, and preferably titled.</p>

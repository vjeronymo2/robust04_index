			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Paternoster Square proposal nears final clearance ONE OF the longest-running planning controversies in London neared an end yesterday when Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, cleared the way for the Pounds 800m redevelopment of Paternoster Square next to St Paul's Cathedral. Mr Howard has decided not to exercise his right to judge on the planning applications to redevelop Paternoster Square, and the adjacent Sudbury House. His decision will allow the Corporation of London to proceed with granting planning permission as it intends. The developer, Paternoster Associates, said construction at the seven-acre site, of which Paternoster Square forms 4.2 acres, might start next year. There have been growing doubts about whether Paternoster Square will be redeveloped because of the depressed state of the commercial property market, but the company said it wanted to start work 'as soon as practically possible'. Mr Howard said there was 'a pressing need for this largely vacant site to be redeveloped in a way that enhances the setting of St Paul's Cathedral'. He was satisfied that the current proposals for the two sites met this need. The corporation referred the planning applications to Mr Howard in October after resolving to approve them both. The scheme, which was revised in July, includes 72,000 square metres of office space and 13,700 square metres of shops. The site has been controversial for more than five years, since the Prince of Wales condemned the original modernist design for the redevelopment as 'deeply depressing'. Paternoster Associates' plan was unveiled by the prince in May 1991. Paternoster Associates is a partnership between Greycoat, the UK developer, Park Tower Group of New York, and an affiliate of Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan. The group paid Pounds 160m for the site when it was acquired in 1989. The group said construction would start at the earliest next year and be completed by 1998. The redevelopment would replace buildings laid out in the late 1950s following bombing near St Paul's in the second world war. Mr Howard also approved proposals to convert the Harrods Depository in London into a 141-bedroom hotel. The decision follows the recommendation of a planning inquiry.</p>

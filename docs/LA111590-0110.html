			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICAHN PICKS PANEL TO KEEP AN EYE ON USX BOARD;  </P> <P> STEEL: THE INVESTOR SAYS HIS COMMITTEE WILL CHECK ON WHETHER THE FIRM  RESTRUCTURES THE WAY HE WANTS. IF NOT, HE'LL SEEK TO REPLACE THE DIRECTORS.  </P> <P> Investor Carl C. Icahn unveiled a "shareholder enhancement committee" for USX  Corp. on Wednesday and said its five members would seek election to the board  next year unless the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate restructures itself along  lines he wants.  </P> <P> Icahn, who owns 13.3% of the steel and energy firm once known as U.S. Steel  Corp., portrayed the committee as a "liaison" between USX and shareholders. It  is headed up by well-known shareholder-rights advocates.  </P> <P> In a letter to USX Chairman Charles Corry spelling out plans for the committee,  Icahn -- himself the chairman of Trans World Airlines, which he took over in  1985 -- said the group wouldn't seek board seats if USX enacts "a meaningful  restructuring plan and corporate governance changes."  </P> <P> The restructuring refers to Icahn's longstanding effort to get USX to spin off  its steel division, which he says has depressed the price of USX stock. About  70% of USX sales and 80% of profits this year have come from its Texas Oil  &amp; Gas Co. and Marathon Oil Co.  </P> <P> Icahn lost a proxy fight on the issue last May, when shareholders defeated a  proposal requiring the board to split the steel and energy divisions into two  corporations to be owned by existing shareholders.  </P> <P> However, USX has since taken steps toward selling at least part of its steel  operations. Last month, its board approved the transfer of USX's steel division  to a wholly owned subsidiary in what is viewed as a precursor to the sale of  those assets, either to the public or various steel companies that have shown  interest.  </P> <P> As to Icahn's latest thrust, USX said it "will review (his) demands in due  course."  </P> <P> In his letter to Corry, Icahn applauded his "apparent change of heart" and  urged that any proceeds from the sale of steel assets go directly to  shareholders as a special dividend.  </P> <P> Just how the special shareholder committee fits into Icahn's strategy wasn't  immediately clear. But one of its directors, Harvard University Prof. John  Pound, said it "absolutely isn't" a prelude to a takeover attempt.  </P> <P> Compared to the hostile takeover efforts of the 1980s, it is "a less  confrontational mechanism" for making publicly held corporations more  accountable to shareholders, said Pound, who heads a corporate voting research  project at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.  </P> <P> Pound and Stanford University law professor Ronald Gilson are co-chairmen of  the group, which also includes Darius Gaskins, former Burlington Northern  Railroad chief executive who now is a Harvard economist; Paul Quirk, head of  the Massachusetts state pension fund board, and Katherine Schipper, professor  at the University of Chicago business school.  </P> <P> According to Icahn's letter, they will consult with shareholders on various  issues, including the steel spinoff. Icahn is paying the members $15,000 each  and giving them 300 shares of USX stock, which was worth $32.125 a share at the  close of trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Pound and Gilson  will get an extra $7,500 as co-chairmen.  </P> <P> Icahn said he was paying them in advance "to ensure the independence" of their  findings. However, he said they all agree with him that "U.S. corporations in  general have lost their competitive edge in world markets because managements  are not held truly accountable to shareholders, the real owners of our public  corporations."  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Donors back environment fund accord Three days of negotiations in Geneva on setting up a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) Global Environment Facility to fund projects in developing countries were nearing a successful conclusion last night. The GEF's grant aid will enable third world and former communist countries to help combat global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, pollution of international waters, and ozone depletion. Mr Mohamed el-Ashry, chairman of the fund which has operated on a pilot basis since 1991, said lingering disagreements over procedure had been resolved following 'solid indications' from donor nations that the full Dollars 2bn would be forthcoming. Donors were due to make formal pledges, but by far the biggest contributors will be the US, Japan and Germany. The US is expected to pledge about Dollars 430m, Japan about Dollars 410m and Germany about Dollars 395m for the three-year replenishment, to run from mid-year. This week's deal increases the likelihood that the fund, jointly managed by the World Bank, UN Environment Programme and UN Development Programme, will be the chosen permanent financial mechanism to fund projects under the international conventions on climate change and biodiversity. The GEF is already named in the conventions as the interim funding body. The procedural issues reflected a North-South clash on who should control the GEF, which has 87 participants. Developing countries wanted the fund run along UN lines, with an elected chairman, and each country having equal weight in decision-making. Donors wanted voting weighted by financial contributions, as practised by the IMF and World Bank. The outcome is a curious hybrid. Voting, in the absence of consensus, will require a 60 per cent majority of countries, and approval by donor countries representing at least 60 per cent of contributions. This gives both donors and recipients a veto and as Mr El-Ashry observed, should be an incentive to reach consensus. The governing council will be chaired jointly by the GEF's chief executive and an elected chairman. Sixteen of its 32 seats will go to developing countries, 14 to industrialised nations and two to former communist countries.</p>

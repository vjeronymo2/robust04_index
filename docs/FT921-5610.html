			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over immigration plans - Asylum Policy IMMMIGRATION threatened to fight its way on to the election agenda last night as Mr Roy Hattersley, the shadow home secretary, accused the Tories of wanting the asylum bill to fail in order to capitalise on the race issue. His charges came during a debate on asylum policy in which Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, said Labour was planning to relax rules preventing overseas nationals resident in Britain from marrying to pass on UK citizenship rights. Opening the debate, Mr Baker forecast a 'very substantial' rise in would-be spouses seeking entry to the UK if Labour changed the criteria used by immigration officers. He went on announce measures to crack down on fraudulent benefit claims by asylum-seekers by restricting their income-support order books from 26 to six weeks, payable only at nominated post offices. Mr Baker said: 'For the bona fide asylum seeker, this will not be a hardship. However, it will act as a deterrent for those intent on fraud.' But his tough stance immediately provoked a defensive response from Mr Hattersley. Insisting that Labour would introduce new objective criteria for entry applications, he said it was wrong for decisions to be left to the discretion of immigration officers. The shadow home secretary gave notice that the Opposition suspected the Conservatives wanted to shelve the bill in order to keep immigration alive as an issue for the election. 'It may well be that you want the Asylum Bill to fail, and if that is the case you can prevent its passage,' Mr Hattersley told the home secretary. Pointing out that Labour had made clear it was ready to support updated laws, he pressed for an Asylum Bill which deals with bogus applicants but protects the genuine. Mr Baker told the Commons that last year there were 44,000 asylum seekers receiving income support. The problem of multiple applications for asylum and social security had now reached 'quite unacceptable levels,' he said.</p>

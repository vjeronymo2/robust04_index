			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. IP/94/487: "EU-China Environmental </F> Cooperation"]    [Text] For the two weeks from 23 May to 3 June 1994, a  delegation of nine officials from the Chinese Government visited  the European Commission. The group, headed by Mr. Gan Shi Jun,  the director general for social affairs in the State Science and  Technology Commission (SSTC) also included representatives from  the State Planning Commission (SPC) notably Mrs. Chen Yu Lian,  assistant director general in the regional department of the  municipality of Beijing.    The invitation to visit the Commission was made last  November. Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the global nature  of many environmental problems has become even more evident.  Cooperation between the industrialised countries needs to be  complemented by co-operation with other major players, China in  particular, so that a comprehensive approach to solving global  environmental problems can be made. As well as visiting centres  of environmental excellence in France and Germany, the visitors  heard presentations on EU-China relations, scientific  cooperation and from various units in the environment  directorate general (DG XI).    The main objective of the visit was to achieve effective and  fruitful cooperation in the field of the environment between the  Commission and China, especially in so far as the implementation  of Agenda 21 (the medium term-plan for achieving sustainable  development agreed at Rio) is concerned. A key factor in this  process is the way in which environmental concerns are  integrated in the planning and execution of economic development  policy.    Commissioner Paleokrassas said that "this visit marks a  further step in what is expected to become a broader and deeper  form of environmental cooperation between the Commission and  China."</p>

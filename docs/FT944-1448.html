			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Berisford statement on US acquisition expected soon Berisford International is expected imminently to make an announcement regarding its Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) takeover talks with Welbilt, the US kitchen equipment group. The talks are thought to be stalled on price. Berisford, which yesterday requested a suspension of its shares at 228p after news of the deal was leaked in London at the weekend, is believed to have set a deadline for the negotiations. Welbilt, which manufactures commercial kitchen equipment for fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King, yesterday sought to emphasise the uncertainty of the negotiations. It issued a statement saying there could be 'no assurance that an agreement will be reached with respect to any such transaction, or that any such transaction will be consummated'. There was also speculation in the US that Welbilt had been in discussions with other parties about a possible takeover. Berisford yesterday denied any knowledge of potential rivals. US analysts suggested that a price of Dollars 35 a share, or roughly Dollars 500m, would be enough to tempt Mr Jerome Kohlberg, Welbilt's 47 per cent shareholder. 'At that price I do not think they would want to lose their bidder,' said one. However, there were some reservations over the possibility that a bid would have to rely on a rights issue. In the UK, however, investors have long known about the ambitions of Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive, to build a global business in the services or manufacturing sectors. He arrived almost three years ago, after a series of asset disposals rescued the former property and commodities group from the brink of collapse. At the time, he said he intended to build Berisford with finance raised from property sales or rights issues. An attempt last year to take over C&amp;J Clark, the shoe company, was unsuccessful. Earlier this year, however, Berisford bought Magnet, the kitchen and joinery manufacturer and retailer, for Pounds 56m.</p>

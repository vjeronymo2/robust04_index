			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Greece welcomed into revived WEU THE Western European Union will today expand its role as the fledgling defence arm of the European Community by welcoming Greece as a full member. At a meeting in Rome, the WEU's foreign affairs and defence ministers will also sign agreements offering associate membership to Turkey, Norway and Iceland. But in a setback to the WEU's ambitions, Denmark and Ireland, both EC members, have agreed to observer status only. Mr Wim van Eekelen, WEU secretary general, said yesterday he hoped Denmark, a member of Nato, and Ireland, traditionally neutral, would become full members after a period of transition. France, Germany and some other members see the WEU as leading gradually to a common European defence policy under the political direction of EC governments as sketched out in the Maastricht treaty. Britain, however, has stressed the WEU's continuing close relationship with the Nato alliance. Mr van Eekelen said the WEU was fast becoming the European 'pillar' of the Nato alliance. A new planning cell will focus on peace-keeping, humanitarian aid, and crisis management and the WEU will move from London to new headquarters in Brussels. The Greek government sees WEU membership both as an extra security guarantee at a time of regional upheaval, and as confirmation that Greece will not be excluded from helping to shape future EC policy on security and defence. However, Greece had to make concessions during almost a year of negotiations, to ensure it would not exploit WEU membership as a guarantee against a perceived threat to its security from Turkey, a Nato ally. Under Article 5 of the pact, WEU members must assist each other if attacked. Greece has accepted, as a condition of joining, that the assistance clause cannot be invoked in a dispute between Nato members. Greece has also accepted Turkey's admission to the WEU as an associate member, with the right to participate in its activities. Turning to Yugoslavia, Mr van Eekelen said the WEU would strengthen the naval blockade in the Adriatic through stop-and-search operations on vessels suspected of carrying banned cargo to Serbia and Montenegro, in accordance with a UN security council resolution adopted this week. If a blockade had been enforced earlier, the Serbian bombardment of the historic town of Dubrovnik might have been prevented, he said. The WEU secretary general conceded that the Europeans had a 'credibility' problem in Yugoslavia, particularly in the light of recent failures to ensure food convoys reached their destinations in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Although he raised the possibility of dispatching troops under the WEU banner, he said this could not be done without a clear mission. 'No one wants to intervene massively in Yugoslavia.' A Turkish proposal to convene a meeting of Balkan countries to discuss the Yugoslav crisis was immediately rejected yesterday by Greece, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The Turkish move came in response to fears that recent violence in Macedonia and the Serb province of Kosovo could draw regional powers into the war. It was also aimed at countering criticism at home of the government's inaction in the face of Serb attacks on Moslems in Bosnia. At Geneva peace talks yesterday, Bosnia's rebel Serbs told international mediators that Croats, Moslems and Serbs could never again live together. In a draft constitution, the Serbs, who control 70 per cent of war-torn Bosnia, insisted the country must be split into three ethnic mini-states.</p>

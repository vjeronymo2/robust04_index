			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Five Companies Would Prospect for </F> Oil in Hungary. Three Are Eyeing the Trans-Danubian  Region"--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction]    [Text] The five companies that submitted tenders for  concessions to produce oil and natural gas would be spending  more than five billion forints on prospecting and exploration.  The invitation to tender closed Monday, and its results will be  announced in June.    As Antal Fust, the deputy chairman of the Hungarian Bureau  of  Mines, told our reporter, initially 22 international companies  had bought the package of data on oil and natural gas deposits  in Hungary, and five of them submitted tenders for concessions.  Three of them would like to prospect and explore in the  Trans-Danubian Region; and the other two, in the Danube-Tisza  interfluve. Of course, they would also want to produce oil or  natural gas if their prospecting and exploration proves  successful.    First, experts will examine and comment on the submitted  tenders, from the viewpoint of technological, economic and other  considerations. Then a jury, consisting of representatives of  the central agencies concerned, will review the tenders and  submit its recommendations to the minister of industry and  trade, on which companies should be awarded concessions. On  first reading it appears that all the tenders satisfy the  requirements, Antal Fust said.    If all five companies get concessions, that will mean a  foreign investment of about 5.0 billion forints in oil and gas  prospecting and exploration in Hungary.    According to the plans, the foreign companies will use  Hungarian enterprises as their subcontractors.</p>

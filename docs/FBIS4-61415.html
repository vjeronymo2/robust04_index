			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the "Money" rubric: </F> "Budget Committee Intent on Tightening Control Over Foreign  Debt. Draft To Be Considered Following State Duma's Move"]    [Text] The State Duma budget committee's subcommittee on  currency regulation has drawn up the draft federal law "On the  Maximum Amount of Foreign Borrowing by the Russian Federation  and the Maximum Amount of Credits To Be Granted by It to Foreign  States in 1994." The draft law is designed to tighten control  over the growth in Russia's foreign debt, which has already  exceeded $80 billion. Under the draft law, Russia's  international treaties on attracting or granting state credits  are subject to mandatory ratification by parliament. In that  respect the draft law is a logical follow-up to the presidential  edict "On the Procedure for Decisionmaking on the Conclusion of  International Treaties" of 8 November 1993.    It is well known that thanks to negotiations with its  creditor countries, Russia paid only $2 billion in 1992 and $2.2  billion in 1993 instead of the $20 billion due under the initial  payment schedule. In 1994, payments toward debt servicing and  debt repayment, taking into account those postponed from 1993,  are expected to reach $32 billion or an estimated 70 percent of  overall exports forecast for 1994 by committee specialists and  IMF experts -- of course, unless Russian negotiators manage to  reach an agreement with Western creditors on debt rescheduling,  restructuring, or canceling a part of the debt altogether. At  the same time, according to the draft's authors, "International  experience has shown that countries exceeding the debt-servicing  rate of 25 percent tend to be unable to cope with the debt  problem on their own, without a partial cancellation of the  debt."    Given that, the lower chamber's budget committee has  proposed  that the parliament ratify not only agreements on attracting or  granting credits that exceed the upper limit it would set  annually, but also where the amount of money to be attracted or  granted exceeds $100 million.    The subcommittee has also proposed that the limit of foreign  borrowing for 1994 be reduced to $4.7 billion, whereas the  Finance Ministry, drawing on its calculations, has suggested  that it be raised to $5.7 billion. It is expected that the  draft law will be considered by the State Duma at one of its  first meetings after it moves to its new building.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dell to lift demand for computers Dell Computer of the US is beginning to restimulate growth in computer demand with more competitive pricing, AP-DJ reports. But the company said that as a result the rate of improvement in its gross margin might moderate. However, Mr Joel Kocher, president of worldwide sales, marketing and service operations, said margins were such to allow this pricing competition. The gross margin was 22.2 per cent in the first quarter ended May 1, against 18.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Dell also said it expected to introduce new portable computers this summer.</p>

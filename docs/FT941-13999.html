			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Focus on student legislation Sir, Your report, 'Education bill stalled by angry Tory peers' (January 17), overlooks the main deficiency of the government's proposed legislation on student unions - that it concentrates more on the question of funding than on the question of voluntary membership which lies at the heart of the issue. Students are currently forced to belong to college unions which engage in partisan and politically contentious activities. Only a small proportion of political abuses by student unions involves significant financial expenditure. For example, in the run-up to the 1992 general election, both the National Union of Students and individual student unions carried out the 'Target 70 campaign' designed to help defeat Conservative candidates in 70 marginal constituencies. As the then NUS president, Stephen Twigg, stated: 'Let's work together, united on this campaign. The government is our enemy.' (The London Student, February 27 1992). In the recent past, more than 200 Conservative MPs and an overwhelming majority of the public, as shown in opinion polls, have backed the proposition that individual students should have the right to belong or not to belong to a student union. It is this widespread opinion which initially prompted reform - and which needs to be reflected in the bill. Only when individual students have the right to 'vote with their feet' by walking away from politically partisan college unions will most of the abuses be ended. This need not mean that college authorities must take over the provision of student facilities. The education bill would be improved if it provided for the establishment of a facilities association which would offer only those services which a college would supply if it were responsible for student facilities. The bill should also provide for separate student unions, not in receipt of public money and staffed by different personnel, and with membership being voluntary. It has wrongly been claimed by opponents of the bill that political abuse is a thing of the past. Yet, in recent years, there has been a catalogue of union discrimination against Conservative student associations in such universities as Lancaster and Bradford. The focus of the bill should be upon student democracy and the voluntary principle, rather than funding.

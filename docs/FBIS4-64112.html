			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 26th [dateline as received] -- Boris  Kakubava, an MP and chairman of the Abkhazian Liberation Union,  has made a speech at a rally held by opposition parties in front  of the Tbilisi Cinema House today. He said that the  parliamentary minority fails to oppose a policy conducted by the  Georgian head of state. He referred to the parliamentary  majority as a society of deaf- mutes.    In Boris Kakubava's opinion, Georgia will not be able to get  back its lost territories while Eduard Shevardnadze is the head  of state. He has demanded that Eduard Shevardnadze resign  voluntarily.    According to Boris Kakubava, the Union of Georgia's Citizens  is trying to mislead and deceive the Georgian people. The  Georgian authorities have used 26 May, Georgia's Independence  Day, to demonstrate the strength of Russian troops in Georgia.    In Boris Kakubava's words: "We will not allow anyone to  overthrow the present authorities by force. If we are together,  we will survive. If we stay apart, we will be destroyed one by  one."</p>

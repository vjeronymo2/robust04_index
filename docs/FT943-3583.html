			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Echenique steps down as chief of Santander Banco Santander, the Spanish bank, has accepted the resignation of Mr Rodrigo Echenique, the chief executive, as part of wider management changes at the bank, AFX reports from Madrid. The bank said Mr Echenique, who also headed its brokerage arm Banco Santander de Negocios, would remain on the bank's board. It offered no reason for his resignation. Santander said Ms Ana Patricia Botin will replace Mr Echenique as chief executive of its brokerage arm and will also become a general director of the bank. It did not refer to the vacant post of chief executive. The bank has named Mr Juan Rodriguez Inciarte as its director responsible for finance, which includes management of the group's treasury, capital markets and investment fund operations. Dealers said the changes at the bank's treasury and capital markets were widely expected after these divisions posted large first-half losses. Santander said it had appointed Mr Matias Rodriguez Inciarte as its second vice-president, responsible for retail banking, human resources and planning. Mr Casto de la Mora Mata has been appointed director responsible for retail banking division, while Mr Jose Antonio Villasante del Cerro will replace him as head of Santander's Madrid operations.</p>

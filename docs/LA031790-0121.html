			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST POINT-PEPPERELL SELLS DIVISIONS TO BIDERMANN  </P> <P> Bidermann Industries Corp. said Friday that it has agreed to buy three  divisions of Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co. at a price an analyst said was well  below what cash-strapped industrialist William Farley had hoped to get.  </P> <P> The purchase price was about $350 million cash and a $60-million note. The sale  follows renegotiation with bankers Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co.  of a $1.2-billion loan, which buys Farley more time to complete his takeover of  Georgia-based Pepperell.  </P></p>

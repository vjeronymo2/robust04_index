			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Japan may be permanent Security Council member JAPAN may become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council after a wide-ranging review of the council's structure, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said yesterday. 'There is a lot of possibility of Japan having a permanent seat, but it is a decision of the member states,' Mr Boutros Ghali said at the end of a four-day visit to Japan. The country's case for a permanent seat was also backed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who begins a visit to Tokyo in a week's time. Mr Kohl told a Japanese television interviewer that it was natural that Japan should become a permanent member, following changes to the make-up of the Council, to reflect the rise of Asian economic power. Germany itself is seeking a permanent seat on the Council. Mr Boutros Ghali's comments are likely to rekindle the debate over reform of the Security Council, which has 15 members and five permanent members. The UN is in the midst of asking its 180 members their views on the subject. Any reform would have to be supported by all five permanent members, at least nine of the overall membership, and a two-thirds vote of the UN General Assembly. It could, however, be subject to a veto, perhaps from Britain or France, neither of which is enthusiastic about Japanese permanent membership. It might also open up a flood of applicants from other states claiming similar status. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, recently supported reform of the Council through agreement among its members, which would allow Japan a permanent seat. His remarks provoked a sharp response from the British government, a permanent member, which is concerned it may lose its seat under a restructuring. Mr Boutros Ghali seemed intent on wooing Japan, partly because a greater Japanese involvement in the UN might ease some of the organisation's financial pressures. The secretary-general said he would welcome Japanese peackeepers as part of the UN's operations in Mozambique, as a step towards Japan deepening its involvement with the organisation. Japan's involvement in peacekeeping activities was not, however, a precondition for it gaining a permanent Security Council seat. Japan's first peace-keeping unit took up its post in Cambodia last September, after years of agonising over whether such a role was appropriate under the pacifist constitution. It is barred from combat zones. 'Those with more economic and political power have more responsibility than others,' the secretary-general added. 'Important countries have important responsibilities. We need more participation from major countries. Japan is a great power and we need its participation.' The UN's credibility would be damaged if it was seen to be too much influenced by a single power such as the US. Japan should become more involved in the UN's activities to reinforce its international credibility. 'If the United Nations is under the influence of one power, this is because that country is very powerful and because other countries are not paying enough attention to the UN.'</p>

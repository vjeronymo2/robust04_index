			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SOIL NEAR RECYCLING PLANT MAY BE TESTED;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: OXNARD IS CONCERNED THAT LEAKING CHEMICALS FROM THE ORMOND BEACH  FACILITY ARE CONTAMINATING NEARBY WETLANDS.  </P> <P> As part of a $1-million restoration project, the city of Oxnard may conduct  soil tests to determine whether an aluminum recycling plant is leaking  dangerous chemicals into the wetlands at Ormond Beach.  </P> <P> Redevelopment Director Steven Kinney said the restoration project probably will  include soil testing around the Halaco aluminum recycling plant in the 6200  block of Perkins Road.  </P> <P> The City Council approved the $1-million project in June when it adopted the  1990-91 budget. The council will discuss the project and the soil-testing  proposal sometime in the next three weeks, Kinney said.  </P> <P> If testing shows that Halaco has contaminated the adjacent wetlands, the  council will be asked to direct a cleanup project, Kinney said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said Friday that she would support soil testing and  the removal of the recycling plant from the site.  </P> <P> "Anything to move that thing," she said, referring to Halaco.  </P> <P> For years, Halaco has been the target of criticism by local environmentalists,  who believe that chemicals from the plant are leaking into the wetlands, which  are home to hundreds of species of birds and fish.  </P> <P> The recycling plant includes a huge settling pond, which has spawned  unsuccessful lawsuits by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the  California Coastal Commission and Ventura County.  </P> <P> However, none of the investigations preceding the lawsuits determined whether  the plant endangers the wetlands, Kinney said.  </P> <P> Halaco Plant Manager Dave Gable said the plant, which melts down about a  billion aluminum cans a year, complies with every requirement of state and  federal environmental agencies.  </P> <P> "We're an environmentally healthful group," he said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, news that testing is being considered elicited cheers from  environmentalists.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy," said Jean Harris, an Oxnard resident and member of Ormond  Beach Observers, a group dedicated to the restoration of the area. "I think  that is a real positive move."  </P> <P> Roma Armbrust, a Ventura resident who heads the group, said the Ormond Beach  Observers requested such studies about a year ago.  </P> <P> "Since we made such an effort already, we therefore would definitely support  soil testing," she said.  </P> <P> Kinney said he is not sure how much the testing would cost, but said the  council will be asked to hire a private firm to outline the necessary work  needed to restore the area, which has been the home for several industrial uses  over the years.  </P> <P> Some of the money would go toward restoring a portion of wetlands near Arnold  Road that has been devastated by off-road vehicles, he said.  </P> <P> The purpose of the testing is to determine once and for all whether Halaco  poses a danger to the wetlands, Kinney said.  </P> <P> Much of the Halaco controversy surrounds its settling pond, where the plant  dumps the byproducts of the recycling process, including dirt and aluminum  oxide.  </P> <P> Halaco's Gable said the settling pond was built on top of a huge deposit of  clayey soil, which helps keep liquids in the pond from leaking. But even if  there were a leak, Gable said that aluminum oxide is not harmful.  </P> <P> "It comprises a major component of the earth's crust," he said. "So we are not  putting anything new in there."  </P> <P> However, Wayne Ferren, a biologist at UC Santa Barbara, said aluminum oxide is  not completely safe.  </P> <P> "Certain types of lead can be associated with aluminum," said Ferren, who has  directed several field trips through the wetlands at Ormond.  </P> <P> Ferren said he is happy to hear that Oxnard is considering testing near Halaco,  which he called "the worst use of coastal habitat that I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Ferren oversees a saltwater reserve in Carpinteria and said development has  eliminated almost all of the wetlands in Southern California.  </P> <P> He said testing near Halaco will put to rest many unanswered questions, and he  suggested that the city also test "animal tissue to determine whether there is  a possible contamination entering the food chain."  </P></p>

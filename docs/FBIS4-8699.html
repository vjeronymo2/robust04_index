			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["24 CHASA" staff report: "United States and Turkey Said To </F> Be Pressuring Zhelev on Corridor"]    [Excerpt] Government sources claimed yesterday that U.S.  Ambassador William Montgomery has recently been insisting that  Turkish Blue Helmets be allowed to pass through Bulgaria.  According to the sources, very heavy pressure has been applied  to the president and top Bulgarian diplomats. To some of them,  it was allegedly even hinted that if Sofia gives way, its  problems in connection with debt negotiations with the Paris and  Frankfurt Clubs will be solved.    U.S. Congress representatives and Turkish Parliament  deputies  have reportedly called upon the government and head of state to  decide to grant a corridor for the Turkish peacekeepers.  According to their thesis, these troops would not be under the  Turkish flag but serving in UN units; therefore Bulgaria has no  grounds not to allow them in.    According to the Constitution, only parliament can permit  the  passage of foreign troops through Bulgarian territory. William  Cook, press attache at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, yesterday  categorically denied that U.S. official authorities were  launching an attack on our institutions to pressure them to  allow the passage of Turkish peacekeeping units.

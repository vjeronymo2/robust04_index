			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Mitrofanov: "Patriots Dream of </F> Becoming Europe's Policemen, but so Far They Specialize in  Women's Purses"]    [Text] Chairman Dmitriy Rogozin apparently took the words  cast from the podium of the Second World Congress of Russian  Communities by participants in the patriotic gathering, "the  time has come to act," too literally: The author of the  television program "Compatriots," Lidiya Malash, had her purse,  containing a dictaphone and documents, stolen during an  interview with Cossack Captain Gruzinov.    But that, as they say, is small stuff. Having proclaimed  that  "a person who is not a part of the Russian community is not a  Russian," nationalists from all regions of the former USSR  agreed on the creation of a political organization that is  "Russian in spirit and in deed." It will bring to power a  "Russian government" which, as Rogozin stated, will not  recognize "as full-fledged state borders" those borders with  neighboring states that have now become independent--the "zone  of vital interests" of Russia. The distant geopolitical future  was sketched by the representative of an offshoot of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] (Zhirinovskiy was too  liberal), the legal radical party: The Russian people in  alliance with those same Aryan people, the Germans, are destined  to become the "policemen of Europe."    The "new right," as they call themselves, when they come to  power will deny Russian citizenship to all who have "pursued an  anti-Russian policy." Above all, as was revealed at the  congress, citizenship will be denied to members of the country's  current leadership. Perhaps for the first time the solid Hall of  Columns in the House of Unions resounded with whistles and  catcalls. That is how the patriots greeted the appearance at the  podium of the deputy minister of nationalities and regional  policy, who read an invitation for cooperation sent by Sergey  Shakhray and a representative of the Ministry of Defense.    While in the corridors of the House of Unions, where the  congress took place, there was a whole sea of anti-Jewish  printed products, in the Hall of Columns itself there were calls  to learn to survive precisely from the Jewish people. Russians,  in the words of the deputy editor of NASH SOVREMENNIK,  Kaznitsev, must also provide themselves with a ministry of  reunification and wise men who "think about the fate of the  nation." To fulfill the role of the latter, they suggested the  writer Rasputin and the mathematician Shafarevich (Solzhenitsyn  was rejected).    But, as a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent managed to  establish, the community members hold somebody altogether  different in highest esteem. The merchant selling photographic  portraits of numerous opposition leaders who had set up in the  foyer of the House of Unions sold the most portraits--for 130  rubles each--of the leader of the Russian Nazis, who is now  being held under guard, Aleksandr Barkashov.</p>

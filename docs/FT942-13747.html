			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / South Africa 'holding 100' in pre-election crackdown More than 100 people are being held under a pre-election security crackdown, some without access to lawyers or family, South African human rights officials said yesterday. Senior police and army officers, speaking at a press conference held under the auspices of the country's Independent Electoral Commission, yesterday outlined measures designed to ensure security during next week's election, but declined to elaborate on pre-emptive arrests that have already taken place. 'I don't think it is necessary that people should know (how many) at this stage,' said one security force officer. 'But to put your mind at ease, it is more than 10.' Monitors and foreign observers say that more than 100 people have been detained under South African security acts. Mr Patrick Kelly, national director of the country's Human Rights Commission, an independent South African organisation, said: 'We are concerned about this increasing denial of human rights.' Judge Johan Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, who took part in yesterday's press briefing, said he could provide no information about the arrests. The IEC is overseeing the electoral process and is responsible for determining whether next week's poll is 'free and fair'. Professor Jacob Ruiter, spokesman for the European Union monitors, said: 'I have no comment. We are here only as observers.' According to human rights monitors, at least 100 people are being held under the Public Safety Act imposed on Natal and in several magisterial districts around Johannesburg. An additional unknown number of detainees are also being held under the notorious Section 29 of the Internal Security Act.</p>

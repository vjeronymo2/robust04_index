			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bor": "Slovakia's Orientation Toward European </F> Structures Confirmed"]    [Text] "The orientation that we keep stressing and our  ambition to make headway in political, security, and economic  integration processes have been confirmed," Minister of Foreign  Affairs Eduard Kukan said after a meeting of the Western  European Union [WEU] Consultative Forum, where the Slovak  Republic was granted the status of associate partner. As of 9  May, we can participate in meetings of the WEU Council and in  the work of working groups, maintain contacts with the WEU  "planning cell," and participate in various peacekeeping  operations and in the evacuation of the population from  endangered areas. On the other hand, the status of associate  partner does not offer the chance to use the WEU's collective  protection or the right to veto its decisions or vote on its  supreme representatives.    Defense Minister Pavol Kanis drew attention to the fact that  the WEU was the third international institution in the security  sphere in which we participate in one way or another. So far,  we have been most active within the framework of UN peacekeeping  forces, where a Slovak engineering battalion successfully  operates. In this context, Kanis "bemoaned" the Army's budget,  which does not allow us to make sufficient use of all of the  opportunities provided by such cooperation, not to mention the  fact that a further cut in this budget is currently being  contemplated.    An interesting view was expressed by Minister Kukan when he  was asked to explain the fact that last week U.S. political  scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski again "forgot," in one of his  articles, to include Slovakia among candidates for NATO  admission among the Visegrad Four states. According to Kukan,  all politicians who committed this "mistake" assured him in  personal conversations that this would not happen again. He  said that he was unable to explain Brzezinski's repeated  "errors" but could not resist adding that "his views and  political analyses do not carry all that much weight in the  United States today."</p>

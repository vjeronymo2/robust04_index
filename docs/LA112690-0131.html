Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DELON SELLS ART FOR $7 MILLION  </P> <P> Actor Alain Delon, the heartthrob and screen tough guy who has dominated French  film for more than three decades, sold 32 paintings at a Paris auction Sunday  for a total of $7 million.  </P> <P> Delon sold his most valuable painting of the day, a 1910 Modigliani portrait of  a young woman, for $1.2 million, the Drouot auction house said.  </P> <P> The entire sale, including works by other art lovers, fetched $18 million, with  the most expensive painting, Picasso's "The Yellow Belt," going for about $5  million.  </P> <P> Delon has said he is selling part of his collection to pay for his March 25  purchase, with French steel magnate Francis Bouygues, of Modigliani's  record-breaking "The Pretty Shopkeeper," sold for $12 million.  </P> <P> "It was an act of madness. She ("The Pretty Shopkeeper") seduced me, and was  certainly the most expensive woman of my life," Delon said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Necessary Authorizations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to its first eligible auction purchase, a GSCC member must authorize GSCC to receive data on the member's auction purchase from the applicable Federal Reserve Bank. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  If a GSCC netting member does not provide the authorization, GSCC would not allow the participant to remain a netting member. The GSCC member also must provide to the applicable Federal Reserve Bank an authorization to provide to the applicable Federal Reserve Bank an authorization to provide GSCC with the data on the member's auction purchase and an authorization to deliver the auction purchase to GSCC's agent bank. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicable Federal Reserve Bank would be the bank to which the GSCC member intends to submit its bid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, The Bank of New York has been designated as agent bank for Treasury notes; Chemical Bank has been designated as agent bank for all other products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Receipt of Data by GSCC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the afternoon or evening of the day of a U.S. Department of Treasury (``Treasury'') auction, the Federal Reserve Banks will transmit to GSCC information, on a per-CUSIP basis, regarding which netting members received auction awards of eligible securities and the amount and value of those awards at each yield. The auction award data will be deemed to be a compared trade; the contra-party will not submit any data on the trade. GSCC will report the auction trade to the purchasing member as part of the daily comparison output, and the trade will be binding on the member at that time. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures will be established that will provide the Federal Reserve Banks with a unilateral capability to cancel incorrect data and to provide new, correct data, as necessary. A member can generate a cancellation and correction request to the Federal Reserve Banks if it believes an error had been made. The requested adjustment will be made only if it is acted upon by a Federal Reserve Bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> d. Netting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the auction award is reported to the GSCC member, the position will go directly into GSCC's netting system. GSCC will treat the award, for settlement purposes, in the same manner as a compared trade which will be netted with a member's compared secondary market trades in the same CUSIP to establish net settlement positions. GSCC will then report to the member the net position (deliver, receive, or take no action) and net payment obligation. Once netted, GSCC will be obligated to accept from the applicable Federal Reserve Bank delivery of each member's auction purchase and pay for such purchase, through its agent banks. Pending delivery on issue date, GSCC will collect clearing fund margin and forward mark allocation payment <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  amounts based on the net settlement position taking into account auction purchases. In addition, GSCC will collect clearance difference amounts on an intra-day basis for any money differences that arise as a result of the pairing off of auction purchases with fail obligations. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with this filing, GSCC is changing its formula for calculating the forward mark allocation (``FMA'') payment obligation. Except for category 1 inter-dealer broker netting members, who do not have an FMA payment obligation, all netting members will have their FMA payment obligation calculated based on the entire debit mark. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This money difference will arise if the average auction price is higher than the market value, with the result that the settlement value will be set at the average auction price. In such a case, if the net long position for the auction securities is paired off with a fail net short position in the same CUSIP (which would have a settlement value equal to the lower market value), there will be a money difference reflecting an amount owed to GSCC by the member. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> e. Delivery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each Federal Reserve Bank will deliver the auction purchases to the clearing bank designated by GSCC for such purpose. Early in the day on issue date, GSCC will provide its agent banks with instructions for receipt and delivery so that the auction purchases can be received against payment from the Federal Reserve Banks and redelivered to GSCC members against payment automatically and virtually instantaneously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSCC will pay the Federal Reserve Banks for the auction awards at the award price. GSCC will redeliver the auction awards to GSCC members against payment of the settlement value, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  equal to the greater of the system (market) value for the position or the average auction price for such auction purchase. This adjustment is necessary to permit GSCC to net auction awards with when-issued and forward settling trades in the same security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The settlement value, a new concept, is the system (market) value plus a delivery differential adjustment amount. In most instances, the delivery differential adjustment amount will be zero, GSCC will establish a higher delivery differential adjustment amount only under two circumstances. If the system (market) value is less than the average auction price, the delivery differential adjustment amount will be increased so that the settlement value equals the average auction price. In addition, GSCC may adjust the delivery differential adjustment amount if the member is subject to higher than normal surveillance status and if, in the opinion of senior GSCC management, the potential for such member to fail to meet its settlement obligations to GSCC is higher than normal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Jeffrey F. Ingber, General Counsel, GSCC to Jack Drogin, Branch Chief, Commission (February 15, 1994). GSCC agrees that, to the extent practicable, it will consult with the Commission prior to adjusting the delivery differential adjustment amount for a member who is on surveillance status. GSCC will follow up any oral notification with a written notification and will continue to consult with the Commission during the time that GSCC exercises this authority. Memorandum to File from Christine Sibille, Attorney, Commission (April 25, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / EBRD to fund Polish privatisation project THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) yesterday said it would contribute funds to Poland's ambitious mass privatisation project. Mr Jacques Attali, president of the London-based bank, called the privatisation project 'complex and well conceived', and said funding would be approved 'as soon as possible'. He declined to disclose specific amounts or dates. Under the scheme between 200 and 400 state sector companies will this year be handed to western-managed investment funds, shares of which will be sold at a nominal charge to Poles. According to Mr Guy de Selliers, a deputy head of the EBRD, the bank might provide finance for the funds, which are expected to be staffed by western merchant bankers 'at the initial stages when there will be a liquidity problem'. Loans would also be made available to the cash-strapped Polish companies involved in the scheme. During his visit to Warsaw to open an EBRD office Mr Attali also met Mr Jan Olszewski, the prime minister.</p>

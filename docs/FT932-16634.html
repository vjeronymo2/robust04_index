			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / People: Legal &amp; General splits its core business Chris Hatry, 44, has been appointed managing director of sales and marketing of Legal &amp; General's life and pensions business following the group's decision to split its core business in two. David Prosser, 49, who took over as L&amp;G's chief executive 18 months ago, says he wants to emphasise the clear division between the group's sales operation and its 'manufacturing' process. Two separate management structures take effect from July 1. Robin Phipps, 42, currently customer services director, has been appointed managing director of services. Although L&amp;G is stressing the logic of the move, some analysts speculated that the reorganisation was more of an attempt to fill a gap which has existed at the top of L&amp;G since John Elbourne, 48, managing director of L&amp;G's life and pensions business, resigned in June 1991. Elbourne had been with L&amp;G for 30 years and was responsible for the big expansion of L&amp;G's life and pensions business. However, after losing out to David Prosser for the top job at L&amp;G, he joined the TSB where he is now chief operating officer of retail banking and insurance. His departure, which coincided with the retirement of group chief executive Joe Palmer, has left the L&amp;G board short of traditional life insurance industry expertise. Of the three remaining executive directors, two are investment managers and one is an accountant. John Craddock, 59, who took over Elbourne's responsibilities for life and pensions, was not given a seat on the board and retires this year. There has been speculation that he might be replaced by an outsider, or an overseas executive like Trevor Matthews, who heads L&amp;G's successful Australian life insurance business. In the event, the decision to split the job suggests that L&amp;G has still not made up its mind who will fill the place on the board vacated by Elbourne. The promotion of Hatry (right), who has a doctorate in mathematical physics, and Phipps (left), who has also been with the firm for 20 years, gives a clue as to who might eventually plug the gap.</p>

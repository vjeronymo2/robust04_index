			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: GM Firth halves deficit and calls for Pounds 3.6m GM Firth (Holdings), the steel group, halved its losses to Pounds 756,000 pre-tax for the half year to end-September. Some Pounds 349,000 of the deficit related to exceptional provisions and Pounds 48,000 to discontinued activities. The group's future is largely dependent on a sustained return to profit by Spartan Redheugh, its steelmaking subsidiary. However, trading during the period had been difficult with steel markets remaining relatively depressed. Turnover of continuing operations fell from Pounds 9.47m to Pounds 6.48m. Losses per share emerged at 2.29p (4.46p). In order to finance additional working capital and reduce debt the group is calling for Pounds 3.6m via an underwritten rights issue of 33m new shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 12p. Bank borrowings currently stand at Pounds 5.6m and revised banking facilities have been agreed. On receipt of the issue proceeds, Mr Michael Wilkinson, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Howard Wilkinson and Mr Dennis Hill will retire as directors. The terms of their retirement provide for the placing at 12p each of 1m of the 7m ordinary shares currently held by Wilkinson Holdings, the placing of all 7.5m of Wilkinson Holdings' and Mr Howard Wilkinson's rights to new ordinary shares without consideration and the issue of warrants to Wilkinson Holdings and Mr Howard Wilkinson. Following the management changes, Sir Alan Thomas will become executive chairman of Firth and 600,000 of Wilkinson Holdings' rights to new ordinary shares will be placed with Bedworth, a company wholly owned by the Sir Alan Thomas Trust. The trust will also have the option to subscribe for up to 9.45m ordinary shares at 10p per share which, if exercised in full and added together with the 600,000 new shares, would give the trust a 12.69 per cent interest in Firth. Firth shares closed 5 1/2 p higher at 28 1/2p.</p>

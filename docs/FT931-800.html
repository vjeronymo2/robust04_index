			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / How to Spend It: Crafts by post IT IS NO secret that Britain has some of the liveliest, most original, most inventive crafts people in the world. A trawl round a good crafts fair reveals a mass of talent and a horde of infinitely desirable products. The problem is that most of them are produced in small workshops scattered all over the country and tracking them down is no easy matter. Those who would rather buy a one-off hand-made piece than a mass-produced machine-made number might like to know about Handmade in Britain. Although it is primarily a mail-order business aimed at the wedding present market it is also a good source of original presents for any time. It is the brainchild of Stephanie Latham and Rachel Pryor, whose main aim is to encourage present-givers to give some of the many beautiful and original objects that are made by hand instead of the more predictable and mundane products that are found in most shops up and down the country. They currently have some 300 different suppliers on their lists and they can offer anything from a range of luggage to hand-thrown terracotta pots, hand-blown glass, hand-made ceramics and hand-turned wood. Photographed below are James Marston's beautifully turned vegetable or fruit bowls. Made in ash they cost Pounds 28.95 each. The rack is Pounds 12. Because they hope to provide a real service to brides and bridegrooms putting together a wedding present list Latham and Pryor feel obliged to offer a limited selection of some of the more traditional and predictable objects that newly-weds might need (Prestige saucepans, for instance) as well as the sparkier, more original craft-made pieces. Handmade in Britain is run from 14 Conlan Street, London W10 5AR which is not a shop but a showroom where samples of all the products can be seen. Because the company is not paying for an acre of Sloane Street they are able to include wrapping and delivery (within the inner confines of the M25) in the usual retail price. Outside the M25 delivery is charged at cost. A brochure listing the products and the prices is being published this week and is available free on request.</p>

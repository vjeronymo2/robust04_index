			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD MAINTAINS SOLID BOX-OFFICE TAKE  </P> <P> Moviegoers have shelled out more than $3.3 billion so far this year at the  nation's box offices, about 2% less than collected at the turnstiles by this  time last year.  </P> <P> The movie business, which usually begins to lag at this time of year, has kept  up a solid pace in recent weeks, boosted by a quartet of films dealing with  supernatural themes.  </P> <P> Leading the pack is the summer's runaway hit, "Ghost," which has taken in  $111.5 million in seven weeks. Also registering unexpectedly strong showings  are the last three films to open in the No. 1 weekend spot -- "Darkman,"  "Exorcist III" and "Flatliners."  </P> <P> The year-to-date box-office total reached $3.33 billion over the weekend,  compared to $3.38 billion for the same period last year, when the success of  "Batman" made for Hollywood's best summer ever. In 1988, the total had just  passed $3 billion at the same point.  </P></p>

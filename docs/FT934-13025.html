			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Blick pays Pounds 57.6m for Time &amp; Security BLICK, the communications systems and time products company, will almost double in size by buying the business of rival Time &amp; Security for Pounds 57.6m. Blick, which said last week it was close to a substantial acquisition, estimated the deal would more than double income from rental contracts from Pounds 87m to Pounds 167m. 'We are doubling our customer base for 22 per cent of the equity.' said Mr Ian Scott-Gall, Blick's managing director. The acquisition is funded by a Pounds 20m rights issue, a Pounds 40m new credit facility and cash reserves of Pounds 6.6m. The rights is underpinned by the company's estimate that pre-tax profits for the year to September 1993 will rise to Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 8.7m). The company said it had been stalking T&amp;S for a number of years. It had signalled its intention to grow through acquisition by mopping up smaller companies in its sector in recent years. T&amp;S, with about 18,500 contracts, is by far its largest addition. Cable and Wireless acquired what was to become T&amp;S as part of Telephone Rentals, the equipment supplier it bought for Pounds 320m in 1988. The division, which employs 200 people at its Bletchley base, focuses mainly on time recording equipment, on-site paging and broadcast, fire alarm and detection systems, and emergency management systems. At current prices it is expected the business will make annual profits of Pounds 5.5m before tax and financing costs. In the year to March 31 turnover was Pounds 18.8m, of which 90 per cent was from the customer base and the balance from the sales of new equipment. Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's UK telecoms arm, has a significant paging business, but most of T&amp;S's activities were incidental to its telecommunications concerns. C&amp;W saw Telephone Rentals as crucial to developing Mercury's business customer base. Mercury said a large part of T&amp;S' customers were now buying a broad portfolio of its services, and would continue doing so. Blick is buying stocks, work-in-progress and some staff as well as the order book. The business is currently integrated within Mercury, relying on its infrastructure for support services. Blick proposes to replicate this structure. Blick will pay Pounds 40.7m on completion, with a further Pounds 10m due by July 1 next year and Pounds 6.9m payable on April 1 1995 depending on T&amp;S hitting income levels which Mercury has guaranteed at Pounds 80m. The 2-for-9 issue of new ordinary shares at 370p apiece will raise Pounds 20m net of expenses. Analysts said the price reflected the current worth of guaranteed income. Blick's shares closed down 5p at 440p. The issue of 5.54m shares is fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. Kleinwort Benson Securities are brokers. About Pounds 17m of the Pounds 40m new credit facility, arranged by Kleinwort Benson, will guarantee the deferred payments. The deal means Blick will be geared for the first time since flotation in 1986, with the company estimating the level at between 150 per cent and 175 per cent. This is projected to fall to nil by the first quarter of 1996.</p>

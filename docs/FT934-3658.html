			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Tube wary of Eurotunnel saga The first giant piles for the Canary Wharf Underground station on London's Isle of Dogs are due to be sunk today, signalling the start of an enterprise which will take more than four years to complete and provide employment for 22,000 workers. Two days later, British and French contractors will take part in another ceremony - to mark the handover of the Channel tunnel from the construction companies to Eurotunnel, which will operate it when it finally opens next spring. London Underground will be hoping that it will not repeat Eurotunnel's experience. The Channel tunnel is due to open almost a year later than planned and will cost more than double its 1987 estimate of Pounds 4.7bn, after interest payments. The 10-mile Jubilee line extension, with 7 3/4 miles in twin single-track tunnels, is a much smaller project than the 31-mile Channel tunnel. However, it will still involve the disposal of 1.4m cubic metres of clay, sand and gravel compared with more than 6m cu m removed from under the Channel. Contractors are expected to use 22,500 precast concrete tunnel and shaft linings, 8,000 iron linings, 500,000 cu m of concrete, 53,000 tonnes of steel reinforcement, 4,900 tonnes of rail track and 57,000 rail sleepers. Building materials and spoil will have to be moved through one of the world's busiest capitals. Barges will transport much of the goods and up to 60 per cent of the spoil along the Thames. Mr Hugh Doherty, project director on the Jubilee line extension, says lessons have been learnt from other large railway tunnelling jobs including the Channel tunnel and the Hong Kong and Singapore mass transit railways. Most of the contracts for the Underground extension, signalling and rolling stock, have been let to consortia containing companies from Britain, Japan, Germany, France, the US and Canada. London Underground, however, says that 60 per cent of civil engineering and more than 80 per cent of mechanical and electrical contracts have gone to UK companies. The work has been divided into smaller packages, says Mr Doherty, 'partly because different engineering skills were required for different aspects, but also because it made overall management sense'. It was important that contractors should have sufficient financial strength to carry out their task without their balance sheets becoming over-stretched. It was also important that London Underground could not be held to ransom by a powerful single group of contractors. The deep recession in UK and continental European construction markets made it easy for the client to impose tougher conditions and prices. Construction companies have complained bitterly about the imposition of 'on-demand' performance bonds which would allow Jubilee line managers to demand up to 10 per cent of the value of a contract without having to prove that the contractors were in default. Conciliation procedures have been established to resolve any differences should changes to agreed design specifications be needed. The long delays in agreeing finance for the project allowed London Underground time to prepare designs and complete ground-condition studies which should reduce the need for contract vari-ations. The mix of clays, sands and gravels through which the track passes - up to 100 feet below the surface - will demand a variety of tunnelling techniques on different parts of the line. London clay, impervious to water, is very good for tunnelling whereas tunnels passing through Thanet sands can become waterlogged very quickly. Thames Water almost lost a tunnel-boring machine worth several million pounds when it unexpectedly broke through clay into Thanet sand while digging the London ring main in the late 1980s. The surrounding land had to be frozen so that the machine could be dug out. To prevent settlement, engineers will pump a cement grout, often mixed with bentonite, into the ground above and ahead of where the tunnel is being dug. Surveys of more than 3,000 buildings are being undertaken to make sure the right construction techniques are used and that properties will not be damaged. Some Pounds 200m has been spent even before construction starts this week. London Underground will hope its preparations bring peace of mind.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- A working group consisting of  representatives of the president, members of the government and  Russian lawmakers suggested a single concept of adopting laws  aimed at the formation of civic society in Russia.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS presidential aide Georgiy  Satarov pointed out that laws on elections, referendums, parties  and local government "should be adopted in a single package  which would meet comprehensive principles of interaction between  society and the state."    For the realisation of the proposal members of the working  group expressed support to the initiative suggested by the  Russian president, the Federation Council and the State Duma to  set up a joint commission for coordinating legislative  activities of the branches of power.</p>

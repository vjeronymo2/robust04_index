			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Foreign outcry against duties fires defence AMERICAN steel producers yesterday defended the US Commerce Department against furious foreign reaction to the final dumping and countervailing duties imposed on flat-rolled steel. 'These cases are the Gatt-approved method for dealing with market-distorting subsidies and dumping. . . The law. . . is based on sound economics because a free market should determine competitive outcomes, not a market infected with huge public subsidies, dumping or other practices,' they said in a formal statement. 'Before one condemns the US action, consider that it is a reaction to the obscene level of subsidies in Europe, and the cartelisation of steel which has led to massive dumping,' said Mr Alan Wolff, the leading lawyer for the industry. After its preliminary findings in January, the Commerce Department partially rewarded British Steel's privatisation by dropping the initial 19.1 per cent countervailing duty to 9.3 per cent in its final determination announced on Tuesday. This is more significant than the 109 per cent dumping duty on British Steel products, which can be evaded if British Steel raises its export prices or lowers its domestic prices. A countervailing duty to offset domestic subsidies cannot be escaped unless the subsidies are reimbursed. US steel prices will rise by next month, according to Dr Hans Mueller, a private steel consultant. He said he expected the price for hot-rolled to jump from Dollars 350 to Dollars 400-Dollars 410 per short tonne in July; cold-rolled steel will jump from Dollars 390-Dollars 400 a short tonne now to Dollars 480-Dollars 490 next month. If the International Trade Commission finds that the US steel industry has been injured by imports, then foreign imports will be almost totally eliminated from the US market, Dr Mueller said. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, insisted that the findings had been conducted 'in a fair and transparent manner' and that all information used in making the decisions had been verified.</p>

Grachev has come for a three-day visit  to the Bundeswehr to Germany. Immediately after the welcoming  ceremony, the two ministers began an extensive exchange of  views, during which they particularly want to sound out the  possibilities for even closer cooperation between the Bundeswehr  and the Russian Army.    Further topics are the forthcoming withdrawal of the Russian  forces form Germany and NATO's offer of a Partnership for Peace  to the East European states. During Ruehe's visit to Moscow  last April an agreement was signed, which envisages close  military policy relations between the two countries, varied  contacts, and the exchange of officers. In autumn 1993, Russian  generals attended a seminar in Germany.    Relations between the Russian Armed Forces and the  Bundeswehr  have developed well, it was stressed by Defense Ministry circles  on Wednesday. There are no major problems. Ruehe advocates as  intensive as possible an exchange of information. The Russian  military officers must be given the opportunity to gather  experiences in the West. The German minister had been an early  advocat of opening up the Western alliance toward East Europe.    Grachev also wants to brief Ruehe on the state of the  withdrawal of the Western Group of Russian Forces from eastern  Germany. According to experts, the withdrawal is taking place  according to plan. At the end of August, a total of 22 division  with 546,000 Russian military members and 2.6 million tonnes of  material are supposed to have been withdrawn from eastern  Germany. More than 90 percent of the withdrawal have already  been concluded. In the treaty on the withdrawal Bonn provided  8.35 billion German marks to build 36,000 apartments in Russia  for the returning soldiers.    Grachev also wants to visit Bundeswehr units in northern and  eastern Germany. At the conclusion of his stay in Germany, he  and Ruehe will lay wreaths at the Soviet memorial and at the  memorial for 20 July 1944 in the inner yard of the Bendler Block  in Berlin on Friday.</p>

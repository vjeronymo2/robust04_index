			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Simint pins Wall Street hopes on Armani / A look at the latest in a small group of Italian companies to offer shares to US investors Giorgio Armani, Italy's best-known clothes designer, needs little introduction in the US, where fashion-conscious buyers tend to snap up his creations. Whether fund managers act the same way towards Simint, the Italian clothing group in which Mr Armani has a 20 per cent stake, is another matter given the lack of international interest in Italian equities. Simint is the latest in a tiny group of Italian companies which have given US investors the chance to buy their shares via American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Issuing ADRs should make the stock more attractive by saving US buyers the bother of going through the Italian market. In spite of roadshows in Boston and New York last week, it is probably too early to tell whether the operation has been a success. With the Milan bourse hitting new lows, sentiment towards Italian shares is not at its brightest. Simint, run by Mr Luca Ramella and chaired by Mr Francesco Micheli, the Milan financier whose Finarte group owns 20 per cent of its shares, has been reinforcing its link with Mr Armani while pinning its hopes on the US. Last September, Mr Armani announced the creation of a new chain of US shops, called Armani Exchange, or A/X for short. They aimed to concentrate on jeans and casual wear that were sold through his second-line Emporio Armani chain, while developing new lines of lower-priced Armani-badged products. According to Mr Armani, the initiative was not so much a move downmarket as an attempt to make his apparel accessible to a new range of buyers. 'We want to build up a clientele which lasts for the future,' he said. Simint is providing the means. The company produces jeans, knitwear and childrens' clothes for the Armani group, as well as casual and childrens' clothing for Moschino and Versace, two other top Italian designers. The purchase in 1990 of Best Company and Marina Yachting, two Italian clothing brands, substantially increased Simint's turnover, which should rise by about 11 per cent to almost L370bn (Dollars 297.2m) for the year ended April, 1992. Net profits should be in line with the L17.2bn made in 1990-91. But Mr Ramella points out this year's figure includes allowance for the heavy sums ploughed into A/X in the US. The new venture marks the first time Simint has invested directly in retailing, rather than just manufacturing. Although the new stores will be closely identified with the Armani group, which will be responsible for design, layout and promotion, it is Simint which is providing the cash as well as making the garments. The first store opened in New York in December. A second is due to open in Santa Monica shortly, and a further four should be operational by late summer. Meanwhile, 16 A/X 'shop in shops' have opened in big department stores, with a further four to come soon with 10 by late summer. Turnover had been very encouraging in spite of US consumers' reaction against certain branded items, said Mr Ramella. Sales at the New York showcase store exceeded Dollars 2.1m by the end of last month. The target is to sell Dollars 60m of goods in the first year. That should rise in 1993, when there will be additions to the US chain and possibly some European openings too. The first A/X outlet in Europe is scheduled to open next spring. Stimulating the interest of foreign funds is part of Mr Ramella's efforts to have the company's ordinary and prefered shares, which yesterday closed at L4,660 and L2,803 respectively, re-evaluated. 'News of the A/X project didn't particularly help our share price. Italian investors have a very negative view of such US ventures. It's seen as a big risk, as many Italian companies have gone wrong in that market,' he said. The ADRs, which are being issued by Citibank, could be a way of interesting US investors and filling the gap left by Italian institutions.</p>

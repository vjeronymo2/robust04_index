			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder to float Wattie Foods GOODMAN Fielder Wattie (GFW), the Sydney-based food group, has announced a two-pronged deal worth nearly ADollars 700m (USDollars 526.3m) which will see it all but quit New Zealand while strongly expanding its international packaged food brands. Mr Michael Nugent, managing director, said yesterday the company planned to sell its New Zealand-based Wattie Foods division through a public flotation in November, raising about ADollars 350m. GFW is also acquiring Uncle Tobys, the leading Australian breakfast cereals group, for ADollars 330m from ICM Australia, a privately-owned Australian agribusiness group. The price comprises 50m GFW shares at ADollars 1.70 each together with ADollars 245m in cash. Mr Nugent said the value of the Wattie flotation, scheduled for late this year, was based on the company's ungeared assets at June 30. GMF would hold no interest in Wattie once it was listed on the New Zealand stock exchange. GFW shares closed up 4 cents at ADollars 1.61 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday. Analysts view the deals as a continuation of a strategy of concentrating on core businesses. This follows a chequered recent past which involved GFW, among other adventures, in unsuccessful takeover bids for Ranks Hovis McDougall, a UK-based food rival, and Industrial Equity, the former Australian corporate raider. Mr Nugent said the two latest deals would be executed independently and were not conditional on each other. 'Over the past two years, GFW has orchestrated a major planned realignment of its business mix and operational structure. This realignment has involved the divestment of ADollars 350m worth of non-core assets and the acquisition of ADollars 140m worth of core businesses,' he said. 'The company has developed a smaller number of large, complementary businesses which have international growth prospects. 'The divestment of non-core assets has enabled GFW to repay debt and reduce its net gearing ratio from 100 per cent in 1990 to less than 65 per cent today.' Mr Nugent added that on completion of the two projects, GFW's gearing ratio would fall by a further 15 per cent to about 50 per cent. Interest cover would also improve and other key financial ratios remain well within the limits set by the company's borrowing covenants.</p>

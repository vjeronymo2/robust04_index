			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and  opposition parties have agreed to extend the eight-day special  session of the National Assembly by three days to deal with  approval of the prime minister-designate and the parliamentary  probe into the Sangmudae military scandal.    Floor leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)  and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) agreed to extend the  167th special session during an eleventh-hour meeting arranged  by speaker Yi Man-sop late Monday night.    The two floor leaders also decided that the extended session  will handle an opposition proposal calling on the cabinet to  step down en masse.    The ruling and opposition parties will convene the National  Assembly legislation and judiciary committee to discuss  investigation of the Sangmudae scam, in which the opposition  alleges that funds for the construction of Sangmudae -- military  facilities in the Southwestern provincial capital of Kwangju --  were illegally funneled to the ruling party.    The prolonged session will concurrently deal with detailed  plans for the Sangmudae probe and approval of the prime  minister- designate, said speaker Yi after the meeting of floor  leaders.    The speaker also said that the motion calling for the  cabinet's resignation would be handled after the prime  minister-designate issue was settled.    Speaking to reporters on the last-minute agreement to extend  the special session, DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "the ruling  and opposition parties agreed, during the session, that they  will concurrently deal with the three motions on Sangmudae,  approval of the prime minister-designate and the resignation of  the entire cabinet."    The special session is unlikely to go smoothly, however, due  to the designation of Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister for  unification affairs, as new prime minister. The parties also  failed to agree on witnesses for the Sangmudae case and the  tracking of checks to unearth the whereabouts of funds used in  Sangmudae construction, experts say. The parties were able to  agree that the Sangmudae case should be handled before the other  motions.</p>

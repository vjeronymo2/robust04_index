			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> THOMAS IN POSITION TO WREST LINEBACKER CROWN FROM TAYLOR  </P> <P> The Second Coming of Lawrence Taylor is an event that has been anticipated by  NFL talent scouts since he took the league's quarterbacks by storm as a New  York Giants rookie in 1981. Taylor's impact redefined the outside linebacker  position. In subsequent drafts, one player after another has been fitted with  the label of "The Next L. T." and found wanting -- until now.  </P> <P> "The Next L. T." arrived last season in Kansas City where the Chiefs were  simply hoping to end their 15-year search for the next Bobby Bell. The  prodigy's initials are D. T., which stands for Derrick Thomas, and he has some  experience with this heir-to-a-legend business since it was his job at the  University of Alabama to become "The Next Cornelius Bennett." He did a heck of  a job by obliterating all of Bennett's records for sacks, and he quickly  established himself as L. T.'s likely successor with 10 sacks in his first 10  NFL games.  </P> <P> Although Thomas failed to record any more sacks and break the rookie record of  12.5 by the Chargers' Leslie O'Neal, he did surpass the rookie totals of Taylor  (9.5), Bennett (8.5) and Green Bay's Tim Harris (7.5). His presence also helped  transform the Chiefs from 4-11-1 doormats in 1988 into 8-7-1 winners last year  and legitimate contenders for the AFC title this season.  </P> <P> During the second half of last season, Chiefs opponents were forced to devise  ways to control Thomas, just as Giants foes first must try to stop L. T.  </P> <P> "We saw teams create situations where a back never has to block Derrick," Coach  Marty Schottenheimer said recently. "He enabled us to do things where, even  though he didn't get the sacks, he created situations for other people to get  sacks.  </P> <P> "Derrick's No. 1 physical quality is his speed. He needs to improve his run  defense and to work to understand blocking schemes, but there are no physical  limits from greatness."  </P> <P> Towering self-confidence, enthusiasm for the game and a mean streak have been  the trademarks of Taylor's play. Thomas shares those traits. And just as Taylor  has wrestled with drug involvement in his past, Thomas had to overcome a period  of juvenile delinquency in the poor south Miami neighborhood of Perrine before  he could begin to properly channel his athletic talent.  </P> <P> "I was a little wild because of the crowd I chose to hang out with," Thomas  recalled. "I never really got into serious trouble. We fought every day and  stole bikes, things that could go unnoticed or could be emphasized."  </P> <P> Thomas doesn't deny his youthful mistakes, but he doesn't dwell on them either  because he recognized a dead end when he saw it and made a conscious effort to  turn his life around. His father's death in Vietnam two weeks before Thomas'  sixth birthday made life rough from the start. Air Force Capt. Robert Thomas  and his B-52 crew were shot down Dec. 17, 1972, the first day of a massive  bombing assault ironically called Operation Linebacker II. The entire crew  survived except for Capt. Thomas, who was the last to evacuate before the plane  exploded.  </P> <P> The turning point in Thomas' life came when he was 15 and a counselor insisted,  over his objections, on enrolling him in a program for youthful miscreants at  Dade Marine Institute. Thomas said, "I knew I wanted to go to college, but I  wasn't taking the necessary steps. It was hard to straddle both sides of the  fence -- being bad at night and a scholar in the day. . . .  </P> <P> "DMI is a school that gives you self-confidence. You learn how to cope in  society. You meet with a counselor every morning and then go to class. The  amount of people is limited, so you get more help. We did things inner-city  kids never have an opportunity to do, like driving boats and scuba diving. For  the first time, I really wanted to focus on doing good instead of bad."  </P> <P> Thomas' new direction took him to Alabama where his first two seasons were  spent playing in Bennett's shadow. "The biggest thing I learned is the level to  compete at," Thomas said, referring to Bennett, a two-time Pro Bowl player with  the Buffalo Bills. "He does it every play."  </P> <P> Bennett recorded a school-record 10 sacks his senior year and won most every  national honor possible. "After he graduated, people said there never would be  another Cornelius Bennett," Thomas said. "I took that as a personal challenge.  I said I would get 10 sacks by the midpoint of the year. I did that and  finished the year with 18. My senior year, I set a goal to get 18 by the  midpoint of the season."  </P> <P> Thomas finished his senior year with the mind-blowing total of 27 sacks, which  pretty much made him the Babe Ruth of big-time college outside linebackers. "I  worked hard to be the best, and the talk got smaller about Cornelius Bennett,"  said Thomas, who has grown close to Bennett and takes part in the same summer  football camp.  </P> <P> Now that he has reached the highest level of the game, Thomas is focusing on  Taylor's achievements, including 114 sacks in nine seasons. "I think Lawrence  Taylor is the standard by which you measure all outside linebackers," Thomas  said. "He's accomplished everything you can, and Lawrence Taylor has done it in  remarkable fashion. He's missed what? One game in nine years?"  </P> <P> Thomas has watched and listened to the highlight films of Taylor at play, and  he admits to mimicking L. T.'s competitive demeanor. "I have a real attitude,"  said Thomas, whose disposition off the field is notably sunny.  </P> <P> "I accomplished some things last year on pure athletic ability," Thomas said.  "This year I'm becoming more familiar with the system and adding the element of  knowledge. Put those factors together, and this year should be better."  </P></p>

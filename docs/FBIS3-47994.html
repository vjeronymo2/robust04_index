This was decided at an anti-espionage operations meeting led  by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho at the Defense  Ministry on Friday. Attending were representatives of the  Defense and Home Ministries, the Agency for National Security  Planning and related government agencies.    North Korea has designated 1995 the first year of its  unification struggle, and has increased propaganda and agitation  campaigns for its armed forces and people to prepare for war, Yi  told the meeting.    "In the coming year, in particular, North Korea is expected  to continue its nuclear development program for the maintenance  of the socialist system, increase its war preparedness and step  up its effort to create a revolutionary climate in South Korea  under a strategy to unify the Korean peninsula under communism,"  he said.    A loose sense of national security is seen in some quarters  of society where the possibility of North Korea provoking  another war is regarded as an unfounded fear, he said.    He then stressed the need for the people, the government and  the military to strengthen the total defense system and increase  the preparedness for immediate response to provocations by North  Korea.</p>

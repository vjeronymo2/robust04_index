			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Venezuela to re-run polls VENEZUELA'S top electoral body has called a new vote in two states, after the ruling party's refusal to concede defeat in elections last month, Reuter reports from Caracas. Voters in Sucre and Barinas states will vote on March 14 to elect governors. Opposition party victories there on December 6 have been contested by local officials of the ruling Democratic Action party. The supreme electoral council voted late on Tuesday to approve new polls, 'considering the grave political, social and economic situation' in the two states. The party - beset by rumours of new coup attempts brewing, and seeking to regain support before presidential and congressional elections in December - has shown concern at turmoil in the states.</p>

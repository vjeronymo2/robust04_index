			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance clears way to open Beijing office SUN ALLIANCE has obtained approval from the Chinese authorities to establish a representative office in Beijing. This paves the way for it to eventually conduct direct business in one of the world's potentially biggest insurance markets. The move follows the agreement earlier this year of a co-operation agreement with the People's Insurance Company of China and was in line with Sun Alliance's strategy of building a presence in the Far East. The company has recently established links with Lucky Insurance Company in Korea and with Taisho in Japan. In September it consolidated its position in Australia by merging its local operations with those of Royal Insurance and taking a 60 per cent stake in the new company. The office would be used to conduct research into the Chinese market, but would help Sun Alliance underwrite reinsurance for PICC.</p>

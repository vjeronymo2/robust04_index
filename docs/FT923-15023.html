			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / The light fades at the end of the tunnel: Inflation is under control, but hopes of a post-election recovery in the UK are crumbling fast Last Thursday Mr Tim Congdon, a leading City economist, rose at a stockbroker's seminar to speak on the subject 'When will the recovery start?'. His opinion was short and to the point. 'With present policies and interest rates the UK economy will never recover,' he said. Until recently Mr Congdon, a monetarist, might have been regarded as having a maverick view. But not any more. Within the past few weeks hopes of a post-election economic revival have been crumbling fast. Consumer spending has been disappointing, bankruptcies have continued to plague the business sector and house prices, after showing signs of stabilising in the spring, have apparently begun to sink further. This week the Nationwide Building Society reported a 0.5 per cent fall in the average house price in June and a 6 per cent drop over the past year. The London stock market has tumbled by nearly 10 per cent since hitting an all-time peak in May. Investors are being forced to abandon their hopes of a profits revival this year as they face a series of chairmen's warnings, dividend cuts and failed new issues. Economic figures published this week appeared to show that both the personal and business sectors have been under pressure. The personal sector's savings ratio rose to 11.5 per cent of disposable income in the first quarter of the year, the highest level since the last serious recession 10 years ago. People are worried about their jobs and income levels. They are also in many cases burdened by debts. Personal indebtedness is now twice as high in relation to income as it was in 1982. As for companies, the improvement in their financial position visible through 1991 appears to have stalled in 1992. The company sector's financial deficit jumped to nearly Pounds 4bn in the January-March quarter, and there are doubts about the ability of many companies - including some as notable as BP - to continue paying the high dividends which have helped to keep the stock market relatively buoyant through most of the two years of recession so far. Nevertheless the government can claim one significant success for its economic policies, a sharp fall in inflation. When the UK entered the European Community's exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 inflation was more than 10 per cent. Now it is only about 4 per cent. Some economists think it may sink to 2 or 3 per cent next year. But is the recession a price worth paying? Many people may find the squeeze on their incomes intensifying over the next few months. Real personal disposable income was slightly higher in the first quarter, in spite of the continuing contraction of the economy, and the increase in average earnings in nominal terms was surprisingly high at just over 7 per cent year-on-year. There appear, however, to have been some exceptional payments of bonuses to beat possible Labour government tax increases. In any case, wage rises are likely to be very hard to come by in the second half of the year. The public sector will fully share in the agony. Before the election there was a wave of pay handouts as the government sought to win favour. But if the economy fails to produce the 1 per cent growth officially forecast for this year and the 3 per cent assumed for the first half of next year, the already formidable levels of budgeted public borrowing will swell still further. If next year's public sector borrowing requirement looks like climbing towards Pounds 40bn (against Pounds 31.5bn forecast), the axe may hover over public-sector pay and possibly over social security benefits. Tax increases seem inconceivable, but are they? However, there is good news for consumers too. Price inflation for many manufactured goods has all but stopped. The American strategy of devaluing the dollar is making many imports cheaper, whatever the impact upon the competitiveness of British companies. And these are good times for older people free of mortgage worries. Pensions are little affected by the economic downturn. The real squeeze is being suffered by people in younger age-groups trapped in houses in which they have little or no equity, and are losing more value all the time, and by workers in volatile industries such as construction where wage levels have actually been tumbling. People with money to spare are being rewarded. True, the stock market has weakened, but National Savings and government gilt-edged securities are paying attractive rates as the authorities press ahead with financing the deficit. Even those in short-term savings accounts at banks and building societies are earning comfortably more than the inflation rate. The other side of the coin, though, is that borrowers are being hammered. Bank base rates are still 10 per cent, and have fallen only half a point this year. With the Bundesbank still struggling to bring excessive German monetary growth under control, short-term prospects for interest rate cuts are bleak. The small business sector is being crippled. Property is a disaster area. The British reliance upon asset-based borrowing, developed over long years of inflation, is posing serious solvency problems as unprecedented price falls hit both the commercial and residential property sectors. Yet the country seems extraordinarily calm. There are no riots by repossessed homeowners. The army of unemployed is growing but is quiet. The electorate has just returned the Tory government to power for five more years, seemingly in approval of its economic policies. But what if the British economy never recovers?</p>

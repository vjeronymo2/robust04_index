			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MOTHER OF NECESSITY;  </P> <P> THE REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK BY FRANK ZAPPA WITH PETER OCCHIOGROSSO (POSEIDON  PRESS: $19.95; 352 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-671-63870-X)  </P> <P> Is "The Real Frank Zappa Book" really a book? Can an author who starts out by  saying, "I don't want to write a book, but I'm going to do it anyway," who  grudgingly admits that "I think it is good that books still exist, but they  make me sleepy," be counted on to produce anything worth reading? The answer,  as nearly everything else about the protean Mr. Z, is both surprising and  contradictory.  </P> <P> Certainly Frank Zappa, eminence grise of the Mothers of Invention, is the  unlikeliest rock star this country -- or any other one, for that matter -- has  produced. An opinionated autodidact of the first water, a fierce battler both  against censorship of rock lyrics and for teen-age voting, an admirer of  Varese, Webern and Stravinsky who has had his own uncompromisingly modern music  conducted by Zubin Mehta and Pierre Boulez, Zappa loves to mock convention in  the best, most deliberately chaotic Dada style.  </P> <P> Expecting this man to write a decorous, orthodox book is like expecting Manners  the Butler to burp in public. And even in its design, "The Real Frank Zappa  Book" pays very little mind to convention. Its authors (Zappa and writer Peter  Occhiogrosso) don't even seem to like ordinary type very much, bursting into  italics, bold face, even BOLD FACE CAPS whenever the spirit moves them. And  artist and designer Awest has added surprisingly delightful squiggles and  illustrations on almost every page.  </P> <P> The book's literary format is equally unusual. Although, in an unexpected bow  to convention, it is in fact made up of plain old chapters, "The Real Frank  Book's" real building blocks are a series of shorter, several-paragraph-long  apocalyptic bursts in which Zappa, rock's version of cranky raconteur Oscar  Levant, regales us with a series of ad hominem anecdotes about his life and  times, showing how he made the transition from youthful goof-off to mature  guru.  </P> <P> Actually, Zappa was never a goof-off. Coming from a somewhat unusual background  -- his father, a meteorologist and metallurgist who once worked for the  poison-gas-manufacturing Edgewater Arsenal and brought gas masks home for each  member of the family -- Zappa was a somewhat unusual teenager, discovering the  music of Varese, for instance, and being so moved by the sounds that Look  magazine had called "dissonant and terrible; the worst music in the world" that  when his mother offered him anything $5 could buy for his 15th birthday, he  opted for a phone call to the maestro's Greenwich Village apartment.  </P> <P> Bands of his own soon followed, musical aggregation with evocative names such  as Joe Perrino and the Mellotones, the Hollywood Persuaders (remember "Grunion  Run," the flip side of "Tijuana Surf"), the Black-Outs ("the only R&amp;B band  in the entire Mojave Desert") and the Soul Giants. Gradually developing his own  anarchic spirit and individual brand of satiric lyrics, Zappa founded the  Mothers in 1964, changing the name when MGM recording executives "convinced  themselves that no DJ would ever play a record on the air by a group called  'The Mothers.' " So, "the stock line is: 'Out of necessity we became the  Mothers of Invention.' "  </P> <P> Soon carving out a unique, perhaps indescribable niche in the chaotic rock  market, the Mothers surprised everyone, especially those MGM executives, by  becoming a successful band. But success, typically, did not make Zappa very  happy, and much of the sections of his book devoted to the Golden Age of  Motherhood are devoted to Zappa's tales of woe: how this or that record company  cheated him, how a British concertgoer clobbered him, confining him to a  wheelchair for nearly a year, how the British government involved him in a  bogus obscenity trial.  </P> <P> When he's not replaying his tribulations, Zappa spends a good bit of time  providing what he feels his fans want, which is decorous recountings of those  wild and crazy times that bands inevitably have on the road with fun-loving  types like the infamous Plaster-Casters. His heart clearly not in the telling,  Zappa makes these doings sound about as lascivious as a VFW meeting, and  perhaps they were. In fact, the most appealing incident turns out to be the  time when, at the instigation of a young fan's brothers, he drove 20 minutes  outside of Stockholm to sneak into the bedroom of the youngster, whose name was  Hannes, and said: "Hannes! Hannes! Wake up! It's me, Frank Zappa." "As  expected," Zappa dryly reports, "he was very surprised."  </P> <P> If the truth be told, Zappa seems barely able to interest himself in any form  of recollection. Obviously that is a not inconsequential flaw in a book that is  at least nominally autobiographical. And what Zappa is interested in talking  about, what in fact seems to be the reason he agreed to do a book in the first  place, presents problems of its own.  </P> <P> What Zappa apparently likes to do more than anything except write serious music  is fulminate against the fools and foolishness of the world, and "The Real  Frank Zappa Book" consists largely of this hip Andy Rooney's gripes and  grievances. We learn, for instance, that Zappa feels that "Daylight is an ugly  time of day," that stupidity is "the basic building block of the universe,"  that "Parents have more to do with making their children weird than TV or rock  and roll records."  </P> <P> The difficulty is not that Zappa's complaints lack wit (they conspicuously  don't) or that his targets, like the slavishness of the modern music  establishment, aren't eminently worthy of his ire. It's just that so much  wall-to-wall stridency is finally more tiresome than effective. Too good is no  good, my mother used to say, and that goes for this mother as well.  </P></p>

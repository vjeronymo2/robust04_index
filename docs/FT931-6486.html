			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Authorities criticised over Uni raid A NORWEGIAN government-appointed commission has sharply criticised the country's finance ministry and Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission for failing to prevent the disastrous raid by Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, on Skandia, its Swedish rival. The inquiry report examines the events following the bid which culminated in Uni's collapse in August into the hands of public administrators. Although the minority Labour government is expected to survive the repercussions of the commission's findings, the report's criticism casts doubt over the future of Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, Norway's finance minister. So far he has refused to resign over the affair, and over the role of his special adviser, Mr Arne Oeien. The commission, led by Mr Erling Sandane, a former supreme court judge, outlined a series of failings in the finance ministry's handling of Uni's raid on Skandia. The report said the ministry and BISC allowed Uni to build a NKr4.7bn (Dollars 601m) 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia in spite of a law forbidding Norwegian financial institutions from owning more than 10 per cent of foreign financial concerns without a special concession. Uni built the stake before the permit was issued. The commission said the subsequent permit should never have been issued, but it cleared the ministry of allegations that Uni had been given an unofficial go-ahead to pursue Skandia. 'The commission of inquiry points out that Uni Storebrand had a considerable liquidity problem, and the finance ministry ought not to have issued a permit when the question of a capital expansion was unclear.' The report said Uni provided inadequate details of its plans and financial position while the authorities failed to make strong enough demands for the information. Uni borrowed heavily to finance the Skandia acquisition in an abortive attempt to force the Swedish insurer into a Nordic insurance pact. Skandia rejected Uni's advances. This precipitated a sharp fall Uni's shares leading to a liquidity squeeze which forced the company's collapse. In response to the report the finance ministry said it would follow a recommendation to set up a public commission to undertake a further probe into Uni's collapse and the role of its board and top executives.</p>

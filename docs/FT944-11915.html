			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Burton line on offer Shock news that New Look, the fashion retailer, had decided to postpone its flotation, 'in the light of current market conditions for new issues', unsettled the rest of the retailing sector and in particular Burton Group. A poor performance for Burton shares throughout the session was compounded by the pulling of the New Look issue. Dealers said several blocks of Burton stock had come on offer during the session, but what really spooked the market was a story that a block of 10m shares, equivalent to a near 1 per cent of the company's issued capital, was being offered around the market. Burton shares dropped to a session's low of 61 1/4 p before stabilising and closing a net 2 1/2 down at 62 1/2 p. Turnover was 3.1m shares. Burton is scheduled to announce preliminary figures a week from today, with analysts expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 40m to Pounds 42m, compared with 1993's Pounds 38m. Kingfisher was another weak spot in the sector, sliding 7 to 465p after two blocks of 1m apiece were sold into the market at 460p and 461p. Talk of internal strife at Kingfisher was one of the reasons put forward as behind the weakness in the stock, as was talk of a Kleinwort Benson sell note.</p>

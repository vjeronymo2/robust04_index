			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SHAKEN UP, FRAZIER TO 'TAKE IT EASY'  </P> <P> Former heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier was released from the hospital  today, six days after going in for observation after a minor traffic accident.  </P> <P> Frazier will reschedule a series of personal appearances for the next few  months while he recuperates, Manager Burt Watson said.  </P> <P> "They checked him for broken bones, internal injuries and gave him an overall  physical," said Watson. Although Frazier, 45, was found to be in good shape,  his doctors told him to take it easy for the next couple of weeks, Watson said.  </P> <P> "He needs to strengthen himself from being in there," said Watson. "He needs to  build his resistance back."  </P> <P> Watson said Frazier was driving to his gym on Aug. 20 when his limousine was  bumped from behind by a van. He didn't feel any discomfort until a few days  later, when he complained of aches in his legs and stiffness in his back,  Watson said.  </P></p>

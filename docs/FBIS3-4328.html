			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A  summing-up and analytical report recently published by the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce revealed that more than  150,000 cases of involving violations of economic laws and  regulations were investigated and handled last year throughout  the country, and nearly 30,000 were major and serious cases.  The number of such major and serious cases increased by a large  margin as compared with that in 1992. Of these cases, 834 were  transferred to the judicial organs.    According to the analysis, as compared with the situation in  1992, some new changes were found in illicit business activities  handled by industrial and commercial administrations in all  parts of the country.    First, the total number of cases decreased, but the number  of  major and serious cases increased by a margin as large as over  90 percent.    Second, the total amount of fines rebounded after decreasing  for a number of consecutive years. The total of fines and the  value of confiscated goods amounted to over 800 million yuan in  1993 and increased by more than 10 percent over that in 1992.    Third, more state-owned and collective units were involved  in  illicit business activities. In the more than 30,000 major and  serious cases being handled last year, over 11,000 cases  involved state-owned units and over 7,500 cases involved  collective units. Both numbers were larger than those of the  previous year, and they accounted for 63 percent of the total  number of major and serious cases.    Fourth, cases of smuggling and selling smuggled goods and  cases of making and selling counterfeit and inferior goods  accounted for a large proportion in the cases of violations of  economic laws. According to incomplete statistics in 11  provinces, including Shandong and Liaoning, they discovered and  handled more than 23,000 smuggling cases last year. In the  whole country, more than 4,100 major and serious cases of making  and selling counterfeit and inferior goods were investigated and  handled, and the number increased by 18 percent over that of the  previous year.    In addition, some new forms of illicit business activities  continued to appear, including the cases of foreign exchange  speculation in the black market with the lure of "high  investment returns in futures trading." The Industrial and  Commercial Administration of Shenzhen City discovered 72 cases  of such activities last year, and the value of fines and  confiscated goods exceeded 2 million yuan.</p>

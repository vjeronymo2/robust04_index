			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kinali: "No Bargaining Talks"] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel, who remained in Istanbul  during the religious festival, has responded to Workers Party of  Kurdistan [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan's latest call for a  conditional cease-fire agreement by saying that "the PKK is a  criminal organization. The government will not address it as a  party to negotiations." Regarding Ocalan's statement that he is  prepared to discuss all the alternatives, including the  possibility of the establishment of a federation, Demirel said:  "That is a nonsensical statement."    On the occasion of the religious festival Demirel received  citizens in his house in the Etiler quarter of Istanbul at 1500.  He later met with a group of journalists. Stressing that the  PKK is a criminal organization that has killed 1,800 citizens,  including several members of the security forces, he said:  <H5>  They Must Surrender </H5>   PKK members have taken up positions on the heights in Igdir,  Ardahan, and Kars provinces. They have turned the caves into  arms depots. The state will continue to struggle. It must  render that organization ineffective; no other alternative  exists. Ocalan may have said this or that, but the state will  not listen to him. We have called on the PKK members to agree  to surrender, and I wish to reiterate that call. They must  surrender to the state's judicial organs. They must come down  from the mountains. No one must try to test the capabilities of  the republic. I wish to inform everyone both inside and outside  Turkey that the government will safeguard Turkey's unity and  territorial integrity.  <H5>  I Congratulate the Security Forces </H5>   The culprits responsible for the massacre at the railway  station in Tuzla have been arrested. I congratulate the  security forces. Their search uncovered the culprits whose  action cut five young people to pieces. Their arrest makes us  happy during this religious festival.  <H5>  Europe's Squint-Eyed Approach </H5>   The European Parliament's decision [on the lifting of the  immunity of Democracy Party deputies] is biased. It indicates  that the European Parliament looks at the matter with  half-closed eyes; they look at it from the wrong angle. I  believe that it is shameful for them to applaud the developments  in Turkey while they deem it inappropriate to even mention the  word Corsica to France [sentence as published].  <H5>  Foreign Currency Will Not Be in Short Supply </H5>   The question of terrorism is the only problem in Turkey. We  can find everything we need in the markets. Do we have lines of  people waiting for gasoline, pharmaceuticals, and powdered  sugar? No, we do not. Will foreign currency be in short supply  in Turkey? No, it will not. People can go out into the streets  in large cities like Ankara, Istanbul, Erzurum, and Trabzon at  any time of the night, which is not the case in Europe. I am a  standard bearer of democracy. I will be the first to oppose any  action that conflicts with democracy.    Demirel was in a happy mood. You could tell at first glance  that he had had his hair cut on the occasion of the religious  festival. His house was full of people making holiday visits.  The first to arrive was Gokberk Ergenekon, the True Path Party  deputy from Antalya, and Erman Yerdelen, chairman of the Turkish  airline's executive committee. Meanwhile, Aga Ceylan, who is  known for his close relations with former President Turgut Ozal,  sent a bouquet of flowers to Demirel.</p>

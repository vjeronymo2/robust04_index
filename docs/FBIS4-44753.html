			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michel Castaing: "Demonstration Against </F> Superphenix Intended To Rouse Antinuclear Movement"]    [Text] The protest march to be held from 9 April to 8 May  by the "Europeans Against Superphenix" ecologist group, going  from Creys-Malville in the Isere region of France to the prime  minister's residence in Paris, is intended to reawaken the  antinuclear movement in the light of the upcoming national  debate on energy and June's European elections.    After years of tranquillity, the hamlet of Faverges, in the  north of the Isere region, was peacefully invaded on the morning  of Saturday 9 April by the first participants -- some 1,000  people -- in the antinuclear march organized by the Europeans  Against [the] Superphenix [nuclear reactor]. (The coordinating  group of this group consists of six organizations: the Malville  committee (Lyons), the FRAPNA (Rhone-Alpes Federation for the  Protection of Nature), Greenpeace-France, the GSIEN (Group of  Scientists for Information on Nuclear Energy), and the World  Wildlife Fund, from Milan. It also includes some 300  associations or groups, including political parties (the Greens,  Generation Ecology, the Greens in the European Parliament, and  Red and Green Alternative), and several dozen foreign  organizations, predominantly German and Swiss.)    Faverges had doubtless seen nothing like this since that  dramatic Sunday 31 July 1977 when a major antinuclear rally  (over 20,000 demonstrators) degenerated into violent clashes  with the police, leading to the death of a 30-year old pacifist  schoolteacher, Vital Michalon who was killed by a grenade.  Prior to departure [passage omitted] a commemorative plaque was  unveiled to his memory.    This march, which will take the ecologists to the Paris  Science and Technology Park before moving on to the prime  minister's office on 8 May, marks the awakening of an  antinuclear movement which has lost much of its sting in recent  years, in particular in the area around the Superphenix. The  local reasons for this are twofold: first, the fast breeder  reactor has been shut down since 2 July 1990, and concerns have  thus been lulled; secondly, maintenance operations have created  some 2,500 jobs.    Previously openly opposed to Superphenix, the mayor of a  small neighboring town expressed an opinion widely shared in the  region: "We all have relatives working in the power station, so  now is not the time to be picky, even though I am still aware of  the specific risks posed by the reactor."    It was the government's decision, made on 22 February, to  use  Superphenix not as a nuclear power station but as a "reactor  dedicated to research and experimentation," that jarred its  opponents back to life. Europeans Against Superphenix  reiterates that "it was during safety experiments that Soviet  engineers caused the worst accident in nuclear history."  Throughout the journey the caravan of protesters will hammer  out a slogan worthy of [French satirist and comedian] Coluche:  "If you laughed at Chernobyl, you mustn't miss Creys-Malville!"  <H5>  Highly Symbolic Stop-Off Points </H5>   "Pull the plug on Superphenix!" declares the 15-meter long  banner leading the procession out of Faverges, indicating that  the protest is focused firmly on the only industrial-scale fast  breeder reactor in the world and that the ecologists do not  intend getting way-laid by more general issues.    The whole range of arguments against the use, in whatever  form, of the Creys-Malville plant is used, including its high  cost and the risk it poses: "In 20 years, this reactor has  already cost over 50 million French francs [Fr], has only  operated for 176 days and still wastes Fr600 million a year";  and "Superphenix still contains 5 tons of plutonium and 5,000  tons of sodium." (Superphenix cost Fr27.7 billion in today's  money to build, Fr7.65 billion of which in interim interest.  Maintenance costs Fr650 million per year (Fr750-800 million in  1993). To completely abandon it would cost Fr12billion, to  which can be added Fr18 billion in compensation for France's  partners. The station operated for 7,400 hours (slightly more  than 300 days) since being hooked up to the EDF grid in 1986.  Fuels used total 5.5 tons of plutonium, while 3,500 tons of the  5,000 tons of sodium are still contained inside the reactor tank.    Encouraged by a precedent -- three days before the scheduled  restart date of 2 July 1992, the then-Prime Minister Pierre  Beregovoy froze any decision -- and guessing that the Balladur  government will not make any further decisions on restarting the  reactor before the European elections in June, the anti-Phenix  movement intends putting this period to the best use by exerting  as much pressure as possible. All the more so, of course, since  the national energy debate opens at the start of May.    The fliers that are to be distributed from Faverges to Paris  state: "We must put a stop to this costly, dangerous, and  useless experiment... Errare humanum est, perserverare  diabolicum [to err is human but to persevere is diabolical]."  Abandoning the reactor would be considered "a brave and  positive act." The antinuclear lobby has also broken away from  its radical attitudes of the past, at least in appearance.    In this way, Europeans Against Superphenix is thus again out  campaigning for support. Greenpeace-France hoped that "the  march can trigger a chain reaction along its route, mobilizing  sectors of public opinion reaching far beyond traditional  ecologist groups. Everyone understands that, behind Superphenix  there is the need for a greater transparency in the debate on  energy choices in France."    This is why highly symbolic stop-off points have been  chosen,  such as the Lyons headquarters of the NERSA, the Superphenix  operating company; the power stations at Fessenheim (Haut Rhin),  Cattenom (Moselle) and, on 26 April (eight years to the day  since the Chernobyl disaster), the station at Nogent-sur-Seine;  the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and so on. The march  will also pass along some Swiss towns (Geneva, Lausanne, and  Basle), and, the organizers insist, it will also visit a number  of "alternative sites" promoting renewable energy sources. The  caravan will also be running a campaign of postcards addressed  to the prime minister.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTESIA REJECTS CHURCH THAT 'PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT'  </P> <P> Despite best wishes from the Queen of Denmark, $650,000 in pledges and  contributions and a donation of 1.1 acres of land, a Danish congregation from  Los Angeles recently was unable to persuade the Artesia City Council to allow  construction of a church.  </P> <P> "The people didn't want it. The council listens to the people," Councilman Jim  Van Horn said in discussing why the council voted last week to reject a  proposed 3,500-square-foot church and a 4,000-square-foot assembly hall. The  council was being asked to issue a conditional-use permit that would have  allowed the church to be built in a single-family residential zone.  </P> <P> Three council members voted against the proposal. Councilman Ronald Oliver  abstained because his home is next to the site at 11504 E. 178th St. Mayor  Dennis Fellows was on vacation, but indicated this week that he agreed with the  decision.  </P> <P> "It is rather simple in Artesia. If the people don't want it, they don't get  it," Fellows said.  </P> <P> The mostly residential community of 15,000 has little open space remaining in  its 1.6 square miles, and residents generally disapprove of new developments  that they believe will cause overcrowding, Fellows said. Last February, he  said, the council rejected a proposal for a new five-story Holiday Inn after  residents objected.  </P> <P> "I thought the hotel was a pretty good idea, but you can't forget why you are  here. You have got to listen to (residents)," said Fellows, a 15-year member of  the council.  </P> <P> And many residents said the facility that the Danish Lutheran Church of Los  Angeles proposed to build would only create more traffic congestion and noise.  </P> <P> "We are not opposed to a church, but this is a residential area. Traffic would  be tripled," said Willemina Feikema, who lives across the street from the site.  Feikema helped gather 45 signatures of residents on a petition opposing the  project.  </P> <P> "The church would only bring noise and more racket for us," said Celia Bailey,  who signed the petition.  </P> <P> Feikema and Bailey have lived in Artesia more than 30 years. They say enough  traffic is already generated by Burbank Elementary School, across the street  from the site, and the Artesia Christian Church, about a block away.  </P> <P> Members of the Danish Lutheran Church of Los Angeles collected 71 signatures  supporting the church's construction.  </P> <P> But an analysis showed that only 16 signers lived near the site, while the  other 55 lived outside the immediate area or outside the city, according to a  city staff report.  </P> <P> The chairman of the church's relocation committee, Carlo Christensen, said  parishioners probably would start searching for another site within the Los  Angeles Basin. Christensen said the 110-member church wants to move from the  Crenshaw area of Los Angeles, where it has been located since 1937, to escape  rising gang violence and crime.  </P> <P> During the past summer, he said, a television set, office equipment, a couple  of computers, a loudspeaker and a number of cars have been stolen at the  church.  </P> <P> The church received a $500,000 pledge from the Tom and Valley Knudsen  Foundation of Los Angeles, and a fund-raising campaign netted more than  $150,000, which included "a generous donation" from Queen Margrethe II of  Denmark, Christensen said.  </P> <P> Church members June and Andy Andersen were prepared to donate land behind their  Artesia home, where they have lived for more than 25 years.  </P> <P> The Andersens once operated a nursery on the property, which has a gazebo, a  garden and a small building that social clubs and individuals have used for  gatherings such as wedding receptions, June Andersen said.  </P> <P> "One of my neighbors who is complaining (about the project) apparently has  forgotten that her daughter had her wedding reception here," she said.  </P> <P> "We have lots of parties," Andersen added, "but we always stop the music at 10  p.m."  </P> <P> Andersen said that in a few months she may ask the City Council to reconsider.  </P> <P> In July, the city Planning Commission rejected the church's request on grounds  that traffic in the area would increase and that concerts, dinners and wedding  receptions at the church would create too much noise.  </P></p>

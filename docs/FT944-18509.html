			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Markets in US and Europe hit by interest rate fears Financial markets fell again in the US and Europe yesterday amid growing pessimism over the direction of US and UK interest rates. US Treasury bond prices retreated on the release of data suggesting that the economy was still growing in spite of five interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve since February. A rise in the September index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers was accompanied with news that the prices component of the survey had reached a six-year high. The figures reinforced suspicions that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates again to combat inflation. That outweighed the positive effect of the partial accord reached by US and Japanese trade negotiators at the weekend to open Japan to US goods and services. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down half a point by early afternoon trading, with the yield rising to 7.86 per cent. In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 42.8 points to 2,983.5. UK shares were trading lower even before the purchasing managers' index report, in the wake of the profits warning from SG Warburg, the investment bank, and a sharp rise in the annual growth rate of M0, the narrow measure of the money supply. M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.1 per cent in the 12 months to September, well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring range. Given that M0 is one of the government's inflationary indicators, the jump in the annual growth rate, from 6.3 per cent in August, increased fears of a further rise in base rates this year. However, some analysts pointed out that statistical factors had distorted M0's growth. The fall in the London market continued a volatile sequence which has seen the FT-SE 100 index rise or fall by more than 30 points on each of the last four trading days. 'This volatility is going to continue until we have clear visibility on the direction of US rates,' said Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at broker James Capel. Although the German stock market was closed for Unity day, other European markets were also affected by a general mood of gloom yesterday.

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Little wiser after a wealth of data A WEALTH of economic data last week left the US bond market little wiser about the strength of the domestic recovery and the direction of interest rates. For most of the abbreviated four-day week, the bond market gazed anxiously at the impending May jobs figures, due to be released on Friday morning. Along the way, it took just a little heart from the personal income data and the latest purchasing managers' report. Both sets of statistics were unveiled on Tuesday and reinforced the notion that the economy is growing at a sluggish pace. The yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond, which had ended the previous week at 6.98 per cent, slipped to 6.86 per cent by Thursday. This relaxed mood proved to be shortlived. On Friday morning, the US Labor Department announced that non-farm payrolls jumped by 209,000 last month, following a revised 216,000 increase in April. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 6.9 per cent during the month, from 7 per cent previously. Both sets of figures were significantly stronger than analysts had predicted: the consensus had been for a 155,000 increase in May non-farm payrolls and a static unemployment rate. This, moreover, was the first time in 18 months that the latter figure had fallen below the 7 per cent mark. Admittedly, closer inspection of the figures suggested that the picture might not be quite as bright as the overall numbers suggested. For example, the manufacturing sector continued to post a decline in job numbers - a trend which has lasted for three months. A large part of the increase came in the construction sector, and was probably due to the better weather. Health services and local government expanded employment. Still, the bond market was not inclined to view the figures in the most favourable light. Bond prices gave up all the ground they had gained earlier in the week - and then a little more. By the end of trading on Friday, the long bond yield had risen to 6.91 per cent. However, the real testing points for the market will come next Friday, when the May producer price figures are released, and then again on the following Tuesday, when consumer price data for the same month are released. In light of the unexpectedly strong labour market trends, some economists believe that if these numbers show any hint of inflationary pressure, movement on the interest rate front is inevitable. As one pundit commented on Friday: 'The Federal Reserve is just one bad inflation report away from a tightening.' A bad report, runs the market consensus, would be anything that showed any significant rise in the producer price index. Many analysts are predicting that the non-core index (that is, inclusive of food and energy prices) will be unchanged, while the core index might rise by 0.2 per cent. For the consumer price index, expectations centre on a 0.2 per cent advance last month, and possibly a shade higher once the food and energy components are excluded. The more optimistic analysts believe that there are good grounds for expecting the data will meet these targets: they point out that food prices stabilised last month, and energy quotes were generally softer. The inflation figures next Friday will be accompanied by the latest retail sales report. Most of the big retailers - publishing their individual store sales reports - have indicated that May produced better business than the preceding months, although this was partly attributed to the improved weather conditions and the results were scarcely brilliant. So most economists are predicting an uptick in the overall retail sales numbers, anything from a 0.6 per cent - 1.0 per cent increase.</p>

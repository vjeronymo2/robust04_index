			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``Pacific Ocean'' program] </F>   [Text] The dumping of radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet  submarines might be forced by the fact that there is nowhere to  store the waste. Tankers with waste docked near the factory  wharf of Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen are filled to capacity, and can  contain no more dangerous cargo. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was  told this by Vladimir Ignatenko, representative of Russian  president in the Maritime Kray. He said the government should  have allocated funds to build a facility for processing the  waste, but not a single ruble has been allocated for this  purpose so far. Meanwhile, one of the tankers, which contains  794 tonnes of waste, is in a dilapidated condition. Either the  factory has to be stopped so that the already critical mass of  radioactive liquid will not increase, or else it has to be  dumped at sea. However, this may take place only after  coordinating it with the Russian president, said Vladimir  Ignatenko.</p>

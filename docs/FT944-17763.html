			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: US hospital groups in Dollars 3.4bn merger Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the biggest hospitals group in the US, is to acquire HealthTrust, owner of the country's second-largest hospital chain, in an all-stock deal valued yesterday at about Dollars 3.4bn. It will assume Dollars 1.8bn of HealthTrust's debt. This is the third multi-billion dollar hospital takeover by Columbia in 18 months. It transforms Columbia from a small company with only 20 facilities to one with Dollars 15bn in turnover and 311 hospitals. The transaction represents the first big takeover in the US healthcare industry since the failure last month of the Clinton administration's proposed healthcare reform legislation, and points to the consolidation of the industry regardless of political considerations. Both companies said the deal had been prompted by a need to reduce costs and improve services for the managed care organisations who are among the biggest buyers of healthcare in the US. 'This will give us even a greater opportunity to make sure we are affordable,' said Mr Richard Scott, the former financier and Columbia/HCA chief executive who has masterminded the company's recent deals. HealthTrust's board picked Columbia/HCA's offer out of a number that were presented at a board meeting on Tuesday, said Mr Clayton McWhorter, chairman of HealthTrust. Among the offers is believed to have been one from National Medical Enterprises, which had been trying to engineer a three-way merger to create a healthcare group to rival Columbia/HCA. Under the deal announced yesterday, Mr McWhorter will become chairman of Columbia/HCA. Mr Thomas Frist will step down as chairman to become a vice-chairman. Although Columbia/HCA would account for more than a quarter of the hospitals owned by for-profit companies, as opposed to not-for profit organisations, the company claimed the takeover would not harm competition in the hospitals market. For-profit companies accounted for 14 per cent of all hospitals in the US, Mr Scott said. Adding HealthTrust's 116 hospitals to the 195 owned by Columbia/HCA would lead to little overlap, since the smaller company operated facilities mainly in rural areas, the companies said. Its network is intended in part as a feeder system for Columbia/HCA's network in urban areas. The only area where the merger was likely to prompt anti-trust concerns was in Salt Lake City, Mr Scott said. The two companies said the merger would produce annual savings of Dollars 125m. Much of this would come from combining purchasing operations, giving total purchases of Dollars 2.5bn of medical equipment and supplies a year and adding to their ability to negotiate lower prices. Further savings would come from eliminating duplication of functions. The deal is unlikely to mark an end to Columbia/HCA's expansion, although there remain few healthcare companies as big as HealthTrust for it to buy. Fears that yesterday's all-stock deal would dilute the company's earnings per share wiped 5 per cent off Columbia/HCA's shares share price pushing it Dollars 2 1/8 lower to close at Dollars 40 5/8 . Shares in HealthTrust jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4.</p>

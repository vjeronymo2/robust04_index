			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) One or more effective community advisory committees comprised of representatives of local institutions and a balance of racial/ethnic, gender and income mix of residents of the communities (and, where appropriate, colonias) to be served has been or will be formed to participate in identifying local needs to be addressed by the COPC and to form a partnership with the COPC to develop and implement strategies to address those needs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) There is a plan for involving the community advisory committee(s) in the execution of the research and outreach agenda; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The outreach agenda includes training projects for local community leaders, when appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) (5 points) The application is submitted by a consortium composed of a variety of different kinds of post-secondary institutions. Maximum points will be awarded to consortia composed of universities, colleges and junior, technical or community colleges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) (10 points) The overall concept and organization of the application. In rating this factor, HUD will consider:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The interrelatedness of the components of the application, such as the relationship of the research capacity to dissemination and outreach activities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The likelihood that the project can be initiated and completed within the two year grant period, as measured by such elements as sufficient staff, realistic schedules, the quality of supervision and project management, and the likelihood that other related commitments essential to the project will be in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Selection Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for funding under this NOFA will be evaluated competitively and points will be awarded as specified in the Rating Factors section described above. Applications will be reviewed by a combination of external peers and internal reviewers. After assigning points based upon the factors all applications will be listed in rank order. Applications will then be funded in rank order until all available funds have been expended. However, in order to be funded, an applicant must receive a minimum score of 70. HUD reserves the right to fund all or portions of the proposed activities identified in each application, based upon the eligibility of the proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If two or more applications have the same number of points, the application with the most points for rating factor (6) shall be selected. If there is still a tie, the application with the most points for rating factor (7) shall be selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the amount of funds remaining after funding as many of the highest ranking applications as possible is insufficient for the next highest ranking application, HUD shall determine (based upon the proposed activities) if it is feasible to fund part of the application and offer a smaller grant to the applicant. If HUD determines that given the proposed activities a smaller grant amount would make the activities infeasible, or if the applicant turns down the reduced grant amount, HUD shall make the same determination for the next highest ranking application until all applications with scores of at least 70 points or available funds have been exhausted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If HUD receives an insufficient number of applications to exhaust all funds, or if funds remain after HUD approves all approvable applications, HUD may negotiate increased amounts of grant awards up to an additional $250,000. Increased grants will be offered in rank order to applicants with scores of at least 70 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Geographic Distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD reserves the right to make selections out of rank order to provide for a geographic distribution of funded COPCs. The geographic balance that HUD will use, if it decides to implement this option, will be based on a combination of two adjacent standard HUD regions (e.g., Southwest and Southeast Regions, Great Plains and Midwest Regions, etc.). If the rank order does not yield at least one fundable COPC within each two region combination, then HUD may select the highest ranking application from such a combination, as long as the minimum score of 70 is achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is HUD's intent to fund at least one COPC that serves the colonias, as defined by Section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Application Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Obtaining Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To obtain a copy of the application kit, contact: HUD USER, ATTN: COPC, P.O. Box 6091, Rockville, Maryland 20850. Requests for application kits must be in writing, but requests may be faxed to: 301&hyph;251&hyph;5747 (this is not a toll-free number).

Application Deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be considered for funding, the application package must be physically received by the Office of University Partnerships, Office of Policy Development and Research, Department of Housing and Urban Development, in care of the Division of Budget, Contracts, and Program Control, Room 8230, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410 by 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 15, 1995.

In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline.

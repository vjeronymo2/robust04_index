			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (7): New ways of taking the heat - How ABB is working to make gas turbines even more fuel efficient Thermal efficiency is a key factor in power generation equipment, and it has long been a barrier to further development of gas turbines. The conventional way to improve the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine is to increase the heat of the gases coming through the combustion chamber. But the problem with that is that the greater the heat, the more durable the critical components, such as turbine blades, must be. Manufacturers of both aero engine and industrial gas turbines have for a long time been straining against the endurance limits of metals and applying ever more sophisticated techniques to remove heat transmitted from the gas to the blades. Through this approach, net thermal efficiency of gas turbines in combined cycle configurations has risen from the 40 per cent range in the early 1980s to the 55 per cent level today. However, manufacturers know there is not much further progress to be made through this route, not least because, as heat increases, so do nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions. ABB Asea Brown Boveri, one of the three international suppliers of industrial gas turbines that runs some distance behind market leader General Electric of the US, startled its competitors last September by announcing a new range of turbines based on a novel approach to the problem of raising thermal efficiency. The main innovation in the new GT series is the adoption of two combustors, instead of one, installed sequentially along the rotor and separated by a single-stage turbine. The idea is that more power can be generated for each increment in heat. An initial burst of power is generated in the single-stage turbine by the expanding gases coming out of the first combustor and then further power is generated in the normal multi-stage turbine following the second combustor. The concept has long been used in steam turbines. Zurich based ABB said the first versions of its new GT series turbines would achieve gross thermal efficiencies of 58 per cent to 58.5 per cent, roughly two per cent higher than any other machine in the market. This improvement could give a combined cycle user more than 15 years savings with a present value of Dollars 40m, ABB claimed. Ironically, ABB first produced a dual combustor gas turbine in the 1950s, but with silo type combustors over the top of the turbine. They were well suited for dealing with difficult fuel combinations, but not particularly efficient. One problem with them was that the fuel did not spread evenly as it changed direction to move into the turbine, and so left a high volume of emissions. To solve this problem, ABB developed a more efficient, multi-nozzle burner in the late 1980s, which it claimed would reduce NOx emissions from 60 parts per million to 25ppm. At the same time, it was developing an anular combustor system similar to those used in aero-engines. The idea is to wrap the combustor nozzles around the turbine so that the fuel flows evenly - and in-line rather than perpendicularly - into the compressed air stream, contributing to better performance as well as fewer emissions. ABB installed its first anular combustor in a peaking power turbine built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan under licence for Tokyo Electric Power last year. It is a 164MW 50-cycle (hz) installation, and the design was approved for general use in Japan by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) at the beginning of this year. From there, it was a relatively small step to think of putting anular combustors into a sequential combustion configuration. One potential complication was that the whole machine would have to be lengthened to accommodate the extra turbine and combustor, possibly creating a need for a third bearing and perhaps a second rotor. But ABB found that its rotor, made of welded discs, was strong enough to support the additional load suspended between two bearings at each end. The company is offering two GT models. The GT24 for 60 cycle power systems is to produce 165 MW of power and achieve gross efficiency of 58 per cent in combined cycle applications. The GT26 for 50 cycle applications, will produce 240MW of power and achieve 58.5 per cent efficiency. The claimed Dollars 40m cost saving from these systems was based on a 15 year period, with 20 per cent equity financing, an average nine per cent interest rate and a fuel cost of Dollars 5 per million Btu. 'The saving would be greater if the fuel price goes higher,' says Fritz Gautschi, senior vice-president and general manager of ABB's turbine division. ABB announced an initial Dollars 50m order for the GT24 from Jersey Central Power and Light in New Jersey, USA, which will initially be a single cycle peaking power application. It is to be delivered at the end of this year and upgraded to combined cycle by September, 1996. The group has been very pleased with the reaction to its new approach. 'There has been enormous interest from customers and from engineering consultants, and a total absence of mudslinging from our competitors,' Mr Gautschi says. That is not to say that competitors are uncritical. Mr Rodger Bricknell, vice-president, marketing and product management of GE industrial and power systems, suspects the claimed efficiency gains will be less than advertised once the gross figures are boiled down to net figures. ABB concedes that GE's best performing F series turbine at Seoinchon in Korea achieves net efficiency of 55.3 per cent, only 1.4 points less than the planned level of the GT24. But the average of the eight turbines installed at Seoinchon is over two points lower, ABB believes. Bricknell also wonders if the GT24 is going to operate at a significantly lower temperature than the 2,350F of the F series. ABB said it would be 'slightly below'. Bricknell says GE believes there were ways other than sequential combustion of achieving significant thermal efficiency gains, 'but we are not in the habit of giving the competition something to shoot at'.</p>

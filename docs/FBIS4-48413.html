			<p>BFN     [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, worried that  continued world attention on South Africa may marginalize  neighboring Zimbabwe, will try to persuade British investors in  London on Thursday to bolster his country's economy.    Zimbabwean leaders have been touring the world in the past  few months on an investment campaign aimed at boosting an  economy burdened by rising unemployment. The Zimbabwean  president will concentrate in London on his country's track  record of peace in contrast to continued violence in South  Africa. Announcements on tax relief and amendments to the  controversial program are also expected.</p>

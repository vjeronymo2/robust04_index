			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng and visiting Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar agreed  here today that the bilateral relations between China and  Slovakia have developed smoothly in various fields over the past  year and new avenues should be opened up for expanding the  cooperation.    Prime Minister Meciar is the first Slovak leader to visit  China since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two  countries a year ago.    Such high-level contacts and direct dialogue are of great  importance in deepening mutual understanding and trust and in  promoting cooperation, Li said.    Meciar thanked China for taking the lead in recognizing  Slovakia.    He said that China is an important country and Slovakia is a  reliable partner of cooperation and there is no problems in  their cooperation.    Li Peng said the Sino-Slovak agreement on economic  cooperation and trade signed earlier today will provide a firm  basis for expanding economic cooperation and trade.    He urged economic and trade departments of the two countries  to explore more practical ways of boosting bilateral economic  ties.    Meciar briefed Li on the political and economic situation in  Slovakia after it gained independence.    He showed his admiration for China's achievements in the  reform and opening up and hoped to know more about China during  his current visit.    Li told the visitor that China's economic reform has been  going on hand in hand with political reform, and China has been  very careful in handling the relations between reform,  development and stability.    In the course of fast economic growth, he continued, China  has scored remarkable successes in resolving new contradictions  and problems by strengthening and improving macroeconomic  control and regulation.    He told the visitor that China's reform policies have been  formulated in the light of China's own conditions.    "It is impossible for all countries to follow the same  economic model or take the same development road," Li said. "One  country's practice and experience can serve only as reference  for others."    Reiterating Slovakia's "one China" policy, Meciar said that  the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only  legitimate government of China and Slovakia will have no  official relations with Taiwan.    Li praised Slovakia for taking such a position.    Before the talk, Premier Li hosted a ceremony to welcome  Meciar.    Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Kozlik, Deputy Prime  Minister and Finance Minister Julius Toth as well as other  senior officials, together with Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  and other senior officials, were present at the ceremony.    Prime Minister Meciar arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon  to pay a five-day visit to China.    This evening, Li hosted a banquet in honor of Slovak Prime  Minister Meciar and his party at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.    In the afternoon, Li Tieying, Chinese State Councillor and  minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economy, exchanged views with Slovak Deputy Prime Minister  Sergei Kozlik.</p>

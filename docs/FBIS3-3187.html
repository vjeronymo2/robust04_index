			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Let's Hope That Qian's For Real"] </F>   [Text] Are we clutching at straws or has China's foreign  minister, Qian Qichen, given reason for hope? The question  arises following his remarks yesterday when he seemed to be  saying that the breakdown of Sino-British talks on political  reform did not mean a termination of discussion on economic  matters. We would be churlish not to acknowledge the minister's  statement because, when the talks finally collapsed, EASTERN  EXPRESS was of the view that China had a historic opportunity to  seize victory from the jaws of defeat by publicly stating that a  lack of progress on the political front did not have to mean the  end of cooperation on economic matters.    The only reason we are guarded in offering a welcome to  Qian's statement is that Chinese officials are forever issuing  contradictory statements. One minute there are dire warnings of  the impact on economic matters should Britain and China fail to  resolve political matters. Then, but less often, come  statements, like that issued yesterday, which present a very  different view.    If we were totally cynical, we would say that the hard and  soft approach is a matter of deliberate policy, designed to keep  Britain and Hong Kong people guessing about China's real  intentions. We suspect that this is not the case. It is far  more likely that the discrepancies in these statements reflect  the lack of coordination among China's Hong Kong policy makers.    Indeed, all current policymaking in China is rather  confused,  as the vultures gather in anticipation of the demise of  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. No one wants to stick their  neck out too far, no one is confident enough to take the  initiative for a new policy, and no one wants to be seen taking  a line which contradicts, or even appears to contradict, the  Gospel according to Deng.    All this notwithstanding it is easy to see how China's best  interests are served by furthering economic cooperation.  Britain will be long gone by the time the benefits of major  projects such as the airport are realised. Yet we should never  underestimate the extent to which political considerations can  override logical thinking, especially when it comes to China's  policy towards Hong Kong. The baggage of history weighs heavy.    The humiliation of losing a part of the motherland and,  worse  still, failing to recover it, festers. Any suggestion that  China should have something less than full sovereignty over its  restored domain is met with an aggrieved response.    In reality China's sovereign rights are not in question. Nor  is anyone seriously arguing that the Chinese Government does not  have the right to bring Hong Kong back to the fold. It is the  process by which the return to Chinese rule is achieved which is  causing the problems.    Whatever the disagreements between China and Britain, and  the  perhaps more profound differences between many Hong Kong people  and the Chinese Government, there is no reason to leave the  future of the territory in a state of suspension. It is  downright irresponsible to play cat and mouse with issues of  economic confidence.    China says it is forced into this posture by Britain. Maybe  so, but even if this is the case, why do China's leaders feel  obliged to behave in precisely the manner in which Britain is  accused of behaving? If Qian Qichen's remarks represent a move  towards a more consistent and constructive policy towards Hong  Kong's economic affairs, they are to be welcomed with open arms.  He is, after all, supposed to be supervising the work of the  Preparatory Working Committee and his ministry has prime  responsibility for dealing with Britain in negotiations over  Hong Kong.    Let us hope this moment of optimism is not a prelude to what  that old Russian Communist V. I. Lenin used to describe as  another round of two steps backwards and one step forwards.</p>

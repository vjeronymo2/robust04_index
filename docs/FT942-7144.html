			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (2): Change will be slow - Whoever wins the elections in October will inherit one of the most complicated political systems in Latin America Thanks to a succession of mishaps and 21 years of military government, Brazil has been ruled by an elected president for only 30 months in the past 30 years. Former President Fernando Collor, who resigned amid corruption allegations in September 1992, was the latest elected president to fail to serve his full term. Mr Itamar Franco, Mr Collor's successor, has lacked a popular mandate or support in Congress and his government has often been only capable of crisis management rather than implementing policy. Brazil's fragile democracy should therefore emerge considerably strengthened from this year's presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections, due in October. Whichever of the two front runners wins the presidential race, they will have at least a chance to build a popular alliance in congress and tackle some of the country's problems. However, structural weaknesses in Brazil's political system, and a recent cut in the presidential mandate from five to four years, means change will be slow and often erratic. Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-of-centre Workers Party (PT) candidate, is front runner in the polls with a steady 30-35 per cent of the vote. Mr da Silva, a former metalworker and union leader, combines populist appeal with good oratory. As loser in the 1989 elections, he also draws support from Brazilians who feel betrayed by Mr Collor. The PT's roots lie in radical protest politics, but it has become increasingly moderate in the past few years. The far left of the party, known as the Shia wing, remains visible and vocal but the advisers close to Mr da Silva are moderates who have spent the years since the last election preparing for government. According to Mr Aloizio Mercadente, one of the key advisers, a PT government would concentrate on the fight against hunger and unemployment and on education and rural reform. 'Four years is not a lot of time, but it's enough to start making irreversible changes,' he says. The PT's biggest drawback, apart from a largely hostile media, is its lack of experience in national government. The party has been making progress in local government, but remains poorly represented in Congress. According to polls, many Brazilians are personally drawn to Mr da Silva, but worry about his lack of a track record. 'There is still a perception that the PT is great for opposition, but not good to govern,' according to Mr Mario Mamede, a PT state deputy. This perception will be exploited by Mr da Silva's likely main competitor, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who resigned as finance minister in March to run for the presidency. A former academic with left-of-centre views which often found him on the same stage as Mr da Silva under the military, Mr Cardoso has also mellowed. His views are today centrist, with emphasis on social issues. He is also more economically liberal than Mr da Silva, and is likely to favour an accelerated privatisation programme and market reforms. Mr Cardoso's problem is that, during his period as finance minister, monthly inflation rose from under 30 per cent to more than 40 per cent. The government's anti-inflation plan, which Mr Cardoso negotiated through Congress, is therefore extremely important to his campaign. If inflation falls following introduction of the new currency in July, Mr Cardoso hopes his poll ratings will increase from the present 15-20 per cent. He will also be helped by an election alliance between his party, the Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB), and the right-of-centre Liberal Front (PFL), which is strong and well organised in the north-east of Brazil, exactly where Mr Cardoso is weakest. With four months left to the elections, it is still very difficult to assess the likely outcome. Under Brazilian law, the two candidates with most votes go through to a second round in November. If inflation falls, Mr Cardoso and Mr da Silva could be neck and neck in the second round. If it does not, or only falls briefly, Mr Cardoso could be beaten in the first round by an outsider, such as former Sao Paulo state governor Orestes Quercia. Whoever wins will inherit one of the most complicated, and some say most difficult to reform, political systems in Latin America. With 20 political parties in Congress, often bound by individual loyalties rather than ideology, governments are forced to build alliances of strange bed-fellows. Congressmen often pursue regional rather than national interests, and corruption remains a serious problem. But, since Congress is the guardian of the constitution and reform would deprive Congressmen of power and privilege, adequate political change will take a long time. PROFILES OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CANDIDATES Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, candidate for the Workers Party (PT): Mr da Silva, 46, is campaigning to become Brazil's first socialist president. Born in the poor north-eastern state of Pernambuco, he rose to prominence in the late 1970s as the union leader of metalworkers opposed to the military government. He co-founded the PT and gained 31m votes in the second round of the 1989 elections, but lost by 44 per cent to 50 per cent to Fernando Collor. Has spent much of the time since on 'caravans' around the country, building support in rural areas. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, candidate for the Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB) and Liberal Front (PFL) alliance: A respected sociologist and opponent of the military regime, Mr Cardoso (63) entered politics in 1984, was defeated in elections for mayor of Sao Paulo, but won a seat in the Senate two years later. He co-founded the PSDB after growing disillusioned with the main opposition party, the PMDB. In the present government, Mr Cardoso served as foreign minister before becoming finance minister last year and launching a widely praised but still unproven anti-inflation plan. Roberto Marinho, boss of TV Globo and O Globo newspaper: Most Brazilians rely on television for their news coverage and TV Globo has a virtual monopoly, attracting more than 60 per cent of viewers for its nightly news programme. Globo was widely seen as critical to the election campaign of Mr Collor, who was Mr Marinho's favoured candidate. This time, Mr Marinho, 89, is expected to back Mr Cardoso, but bias against Mr da Silva will probably be less visible. Nevertheless, with the PT intent on attacking Globo's power-base if it wins the elections, Mr Marinho's views will be very important. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, former governor of Bahia state: One of the most powerful men in Brazil because of political and family ties, Mr Magalhaes was largely responsible for persuading his party, the PFL, to back Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Fearing that the party did not have a viable candidate of its own, and determined to block Mr da Silva, Mr Magalhaes will now be one of the most important figures in the campaign, especially in the north of the country. However, his right-wing views and liking of traditional-style politics makes him unappealing to many in Mr Cardoso's party. President Itamar Franco: a possible king maker. Although he is dismissed as an ineffectual leader by many politicians, President Franco can significantly affect the outcome of the elections. The office of the presidency wields extensive executive power and can also confer status on its preferred candidate. President Franco is backing his former finance minister, Mr Cardoso. However, the president's unpredictable and populist character could lead to surprises, especially if the anti-inflation plan does not succeed. As its chosen candidate, Mr Cardoso will also be unable to attack an otherwise unpopular government.</p>

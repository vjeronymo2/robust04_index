			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Douglas Yearley, Phelps Dodge MR DOUGLAS Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge, was misreported in the article 'Copper mining projects attract big spenders' on October 28. His comments were made at a private meeting for analysts to which the press was not invited. He did not say at that meeting that the price paid for the Zaldivar copper project in Chile could be justified only if the copper price stayed at Dollars 1.15 a lb for the long term. He did not say that the Collahausi project, also in Chile, was 'on the wrong side of the Andes mountains' and accordingly could not use a slurry pipeline to transport ore. Mr Yearley points out that the Lisheen deposit in Ireland is a zinc, not a copper deposit. He also says that, while he used the word 'amateurs' when questioned about some international gold mining companies which were moving into base metals, the word was used in a joking manner. Furthermore, he described his own company as an 'amateur' in the gold business when compared with other, more substantial, gold producers. Mr Yearly says: 'I certainly would not deprecate any of the mineral properties mentioned in the article. They are all excellent deposits and our company would be delighted to own an interest in any of them. I was simply making the point that Phelps Dodge believes it will get a better return for its money if it invests in exploration rather than purchasing interests in known deposits, given the prices or recent, publicly announced, transactions'.</p>

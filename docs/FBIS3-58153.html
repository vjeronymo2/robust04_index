But he made clear the Government was not yet ready to back  demands for air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces shelling  Sarajevo. Britain would, however, be prepared for strikes to  protect UN forces. Last week the UN commander in former  Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot of France, complained UN soldiers  were being humiliated and inhibited from taking the action  necessary to fulfill their duties. He said the UN must consider  "offensive intervention."    Mr Major, interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television  yesterday before leaving for Brussels last night, rejected  suggestions the shelling of Sarajevo during the Christmas  ceasefire and other Serb actions meant the time was right for  air strikes.    While acknowledging the last few days had been "unhappy and  frustrating," he underlined the Government's opposition to being  dragged into a conflict in Bosnia, saying the conditions for air  strikes against ground targets had not been "entirely satisfied."    Mr Major added: "All three parties in the dispute have been  saying one thing in Geneva about wishing to have peace, but  their actions on the ground of their guerrilla groups say  precisely the opposite. Everyone is getting very frustrated  about that.    "The humanitarian position is very serious. It has got worse  and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the forces to  carry out their role."    The conflict in former Yugoslavia is expected to be  discussed  at today's NATO summit in Brussels despite President Clinton's  desire that a meeting called to shape the future of the Alliance  should not become bogged down in a dispute over Bosnia.    Leaders of the 16-nation NATO alliance will also be  discussing the extent to which NATO should scale down and  concentrate more on peacekeeping as a rationale for its  existence.    Mr Major said the alliance was at a pivotal stage. "NATO's  role needs to be revised and extended."    But there were still a range of trouble spots.... "We need  to make sure we don't let our military guard down despite the  capacity there is for reductions in military expenditure.  Nobody is going to take those too far," he said.    He gave his backing to the "Partnership for Peace" plan  proposed by Mr Clinton. It offers increased co-operation with  East Europe, holding out the prospect of eventual NATO  membership.    Mr Major sought to play down criticism that the plan had  been  watered down in the face of Russian protests and would not meet  the concerns of East European nations.    He said reform in Russia, rather than security guarantees,  held the best hope of long-term freedom for the former communist  countries.    Despite the success of the ultranationalists in last month's  Russian elections the reformers still got a majority of the  votes.</p>

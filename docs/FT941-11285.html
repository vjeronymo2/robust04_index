			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 backtracks after hitting all-time high - Market Report The London market's recent upsurge, which has been fuelled largely by hopes of a series of Europe-wide interest rate cuts, shuddered to a halt yesterday as Germany's Bundesbank Council left its key rates unchanged. The council's refusal to shift policy disappointed bulls in the London market, who had hoped that it might prompt a UK cut. Matters were made worse by a disappointing opening on Wall Street and a weak performance by US bonds amid stories that the Federal Reserve was about to embark on a significant tightening of monetary policy. Talk of a  1/2 percentage point rise in the Federal Funds rate, a story circulating around the big US investment banks in London late yesterday, upset sentiment throughout world markets. London dealers refused to rule out an increase in US rates but said a rise of a  1/4 point was more likely. The interest rate story proved the decisive factor in the UK equity market, where the FT-SE 100 Index continued its recent erratic performance and moved in a 50-point arc before finishing sharply lower, while the less liquid FT-SE Mid 250 Index extended its recent strong performance, ending a busy session at another all-time closing peak, albeit well below the day's high. Adding to the market's unease yesterday was a sizeable placing of stock in Prudential, one of the UK's top insurance groups, which was viewed by some observers as another signal that the equity market might well be reaching the top of the current upswing. 'Big lines of top-quality stock have been hard to buy in recent months, but yesterday there was plenty on offer and it was not clear whether it all got away,' said a senior marketmaker. Smith New Court, regarded as one of the London market's most aggressive trading houses, carried out a bought deal involving a near 2.5 per cent stake in Prudential, although it was unclear whether all the 46m shares involved in the transaction had been placed. The session began with share prices being chased higher, after Wall Street's overnight rise and news of the big boost to the Japanese economy via Pounds 107bn worth of tax cuts. Prices began to falter in midsession, however, when dealers sensed there would be no German rate cuts. Showing a near 19-point rise at an all-time intraday record of 3,539.2, the FT-SE 100 thereafter ran into flurries of selling pressure and dropped as low as 3,490.8 in the afternoon, before stabilising and ending a net 28.8 off at 3,491.5. Second-line stocks, on the other hand, continued to attract sustained and strong buying interest, said to have been associated with the debut this morning of the new OMLX futures and options contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. Although finishing below its best level, the Mid 250 still posted a 1.9 gain at a closing high of 4,152.8. Turnover reached a heavy 1.1bn shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for almost 700m shares. Customer business on Wednesday was worth Pounds 2.095bn. Some dealers said the appearance of large lines of stock seemed to indicate that the market had over-reached itself and was due for a sharp correction, but others maintained that a tightening of monetary policy in the US had already been factored into the market. 'Talk that the Americans are repatriating funds has been around for months and has not stopped the market from going up,' commented one senior dealer.</p>

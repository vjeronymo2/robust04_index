			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Sweet musical bon-bons - Richard Fairman reviews the Chabrier operas at Edinburgh When Emmanuel Chabrier died 100 years ago this month, he left a remarkable early collection of French impressionists: eight Manets, eight Monets, six Renoirs, two Sisleys and a Cezanne. This was a man who recognised an enduring work of art when he saw it. It is just a shame that his own music never lived to enjoy such fame. As an antidote to Beethoven, this year's other featured composer, Edinburgh could hardly have chosen a more fizzing tonic than Chabrier. The survey did not go much beyond his operas, but even that is welcome. Sadly we did not get anything of Gwendoline - a real hoot the only time when I have seen it. But the festival did push out the boat with a concert performance of his unfinished Briseis, which sails off full of ambition across an ocean of Wagnerian ecstasy, only to lose all sense of direction. The two stage productions were saved as the highlight of the festival's final week. A couple of years ago Opera North scored a success with L'Etoile, a spiffing piece of theatrical nonsense which has proved to be Chabrier's nearest thing to a lasting success in the opera-house. Emboldened by this venture, the company decided to follow up with the intractable Le Roi malgre lui and bring them both to Edinburgh. The King's Theatre is just the right size for serving these sweet French musical bon-bons. After all the praise that has been heaped on the show, it pains me to say that the company's idea of L'Etoile was wrong-headed. My teeth grated at its cartoon-style stage designs. My stomach sank at its heavy-handed humour. Following on from Offenbach, Chabrier came up with a new line in French operetta, exquisitely light-headed, a little zany, more than a little erotic, its sparkling comic score leaving little doubt how it was meant to go. Opera North played the music in the right spirit, but turned the stage action into English pantomime: false and two-dimensional. Le Roi malgre lui followed on Thursday. This was a new production and the first time that the opera has been staged in Britain. The problem has always been its plot. Declaring that the original story is unworkable in the theatre (a point we have to take on trust, although those who have seen it overseas remember little that made sense), Opera North commissioned Jeremy Sams and Michael Wilcox to weave a new libretto around the music - as Sams remarked, like a crossword which ends with guessing the clues. The result is inane, but in the most delightful way. As though learning the lesson of the night before, they have let the music be their guide. When solo cellos set a tone of heartfelt F minor compassion, the would-be king sings of his ruined fatherland and starving people. A soprano aria with yearning strings is matched to a text about a flower that will bloom: 'its name is change and revolution'. Yes - the opera has acquired a social conscience it never had before. Sams and Wilcox have set it in 'semi-imaginary' Moldavia (though no imagination was needed to identify the city on the backdrop as Prague). Henri is the true successor to the throne, believed lost or dead, who now leads a band of revolutionaries. He is opposed to a monarchy, but that does not stop him keeping his orb and sceptre under the floorboards. When he finally reaches his coronation, there is some indecision whether he should be crowned with those, or a hammer and sickle. The authors' dry sense of humour is the saving grace through all this nonsense. Among some fine music is a heavenly Venetian barcarolle for Russell Smythe's straight-faced Henri and Juliet Booth's Alexina, which is as sensuous as anything Chabrier wrote. The duets seem to have inspired the composer to give his best, as another between Booth and Rosa Mannion's stylish Minka is a winner for two sopranos, soaring away limpidly like Micaela's identical twins. Somehow the plot manages to push Minka and half-a-dozen 'nymphs' into suspenders and frilly, black-lace bodices for a cabaret number swinging from a silver moon. There is also a gay Italian revolutionary, who divides his time between chasing hairy Hungarians and perfecting the exploding pineapple, a part taken with flair by Geoffrey Dolton. Justin Lavender sounded pinched in the tenor role. Nicholas Folwell made his mark as Laski. Jeremy Sams doubles as a producer always ready to come to the rescue with a dead-pan sense of humour. Add in Paul Daniel's lively conducting and the opera seems to have more wit than L'Etoile, even though that is easily the more original work. The Opera-Comique burnt down after only two performances of 'Le Roi malgre lui. Opera North is risking two in Edinburgh and promises to take it to Leeds and on tour afterwards.

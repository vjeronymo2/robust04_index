			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Banker to head Caracas privatisation programme President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, after less than four months in office, reorganised his cabinet at the weekend, appointing Mr Carlos Bernardez to head the country's stalled privatisation programme. Mr Bernardez worked for many years as president of Banco de Venezuela, one of the country's largest and strongest banks. By naming a respected private-sector figure to head the privatisation programme, Mr Caldera hopes to convince private investors that it is serious about selling off state-owned assets. The government suffered a serious setback on May 20 when it failed to obtain any tenders for the sale of a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, which was its highly publicised first effort at privatisation. Mr Bernardez replaces Mr Abdon Vivas Teran, a long-time congressmen and close supporter of President Caldera, who headed the privatisation programme until now. Aside from Aeropostal, the government has a long list of companies scheduled for privatisation, including three electric power companies, a group of hotels and joint ventures in heavy industry. Of the seven cabinet changes, the only other new face is Mr Alfredo Gruber, who takes over as state minister in charge of the CVG (Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana), the government-controlled group that includes steel and aluminium producers, mining companies and the country's largest hydroelectric power concern. Mr Gruber, a veteran executive in Venezuela's oil industry, was previously president of Palmaven, a subsidiary of PDVSA, the national oil company. The government changes come at a time of increasing economic problems and reflect the president's desire to eliminate public squabbling that has occurred among cabinet ministers in the past.</p>

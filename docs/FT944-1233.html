			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SCI bid for Plantsbrook referred to MMC The Department of Trade and Industry has referred the acquisition of Plantsbrook, the funerals group, by Service Corporation International to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The MMC has been asked to examine the supply of funeral services, particularly in south and central London, because of SCI's high market share. SCI made the initial recommended bid on September 2, valuing Plantsbrook at Pounds 193m. The acquisition, which was not conditional on clearance by the competition authorities, was completed on October 20. The DTI received advice on the takeover from the Director General of Fair Trading on November 24. In August SCI, the largest funerals company in the US, won a takeover battle for Great Southern Group, another leading UK funeral company. If the MMC advises the DTI that the Plantsbrook acquisition is against the public interest, in theory the DTI could require the acquisition to be unwound. It could alternatively require that parts of the company be sold or impose restrictions on its operations. Mr Jerald Pullins, chief executive officer of SCI UK, said: 'Because of the limited (geographical) scope of the investigation, we do not believe that it will affect the overall transaction.' At the time of the Plantsbrook bid, it was thought that the pre-paid funeral market would be likely to prompt a referral to the MMC. SCI has a 15 per cent share of the UK funeral market, but an estimated 80 per cent of the pre-paid market, through Plantsbrook's Dignity in Destiny scheme and Great Southern's Chosen Heritage plan. The Office of Fair Trading is separately conducting an investigation into regulations in the pre-paid funeral market. A report is expected in February. The MMC is required to report back to the DTI by March 24.</p>

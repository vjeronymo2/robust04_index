			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Japan may act over monopolies THE Japanese government will promise to be more vigilant in policing anti-monopoly laws and to reform the convoluted distribution system. The promise is contained in a review of the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement, expected to be released by Japan and the US today. However, the two countries held further negotiations last night on what should be done about the keiretsu, the Japanese corporate groups which, the US argues, tend to exclude outside suppliers. Japan argues that the groups are not exclusive, but are conducive to stable business contacts and long-term profitability. The US was also not satisfied with progress in reforming Japanese land use laws or the balance between savings and investment. As these arguments suggest, the SII is intended to deal with 'structural' issues that Washington believes are behind Japan's persistently large current account surplus. A senior US Administration official said yesterday consumer demand had to be encouraged in Japan, in the long and short term. During the two-day talks Washington maintained that slowing domestic economic growth had increased the country's trade surplus and urged Tokyo to adopt policies to stimulate the economy as quickly as possible. Japanese officials berated the US for having kept virtually none of the promises it made two years ago, when the two countries finalised the SII agreement. They complained about the burdensome US budget deficit and US corporate culture, which they said was too focused on the next quarter and lacked long-term planning. Fortress under siege, page 16</p>

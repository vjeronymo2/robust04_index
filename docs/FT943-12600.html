			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: A popular and a classic treat - Harper and Cook A tremendous week in London for lovers of singing. At the Proms on Tuesday, Heather Harper, the greatest British singer since Kathleen Ferrier, returned from retirement and after serious illness to sing Berg's 'Altendorf Lieder' with the calm vehemence and commanding phrasing that have been her hallmarks. And at Sadler's Wells Barbara Cook, the greatest singer in popular music today, also returning after illness, made a long-awaited return to Britain. The differences between the two are obvious. Harper is collected, high-art, and her 20th-century specialties include Strauss, Britten, Tippett. Cook is bubbly, populist, and her repertory goes from Kern and Gershwin to Sondheim and Amanda McBroom. It is as absurd to imagine Cook in Tippett's 'The Ice Break' as to imagine Harper recording 'The Disney Album'. Now, however, I hear some resemblances between them. These resemblances are not fortuitous, for they simply show that both Harper and Cook were trained along truest classical lines. In both cases, it is less voice than musicality that makes them so remarkable; in both cases, the voice has been nourished by bringing together the pearly upper register with the biting chest notes into one equalised range. In both one hears a vocal style that is based, on the one hand, on clean entry into notes and, on the other, sculptural portamento connections between notes. And, while both offer the clear and natural diction, they attend first and foremost to musical phrasing. There is no exaggerated emphasis on special words. The words seem simply - inevitably, it sounds to us - to find their inevitable place amid the shape designed for them by the music. Like all great artists, Cook is made up of contrasts. She has vulnerability within power, grandeur within intimacy, brio within calm. She often reaches phrases of burning intensity, but presents herself with no-nonsense happiness. She comes from an old and conventional showbiz tradition, but she takes pains to emphasise the work of women composers (Amanda McBroom) and women lyricists (Dorothy Fields). She is proud to deliver new or recent songs, but is equally proud of creating roles in such classic musicals as Bernstein's Candide and She Loves Me. Cook is the only popular singer active today who should be taken seriously by lovers of classical music. She is not a crossover artist - though she tells of singing Madam Butterfly's entrance music (with the high D flat option) as an audition piece for Leonard Bernstein - and yet most of today's opera singers could learn plenty from her. Every phrase is packed with interest, and every song is shaped from first to last. Has any singer since Callas matched Cook's sense of musical architecture? I doubt it. It begins with the simple eloquence with which she phrases a line of recitative; you hear her plant lines such as 'There goes my young intended. The thing is ended. Regrets are vain' with such simplicity, but with such underlying grasp of rhythm that they brand themselves into your mind. Then, when it comes to the song itself, she shows the point of each note to the phrase and of each phrase to the whole. The endless variety with which she combines legato and staccato, or distinguishes between staccato and marcato, is exceptionally rare. Anyone who knows her singing will know how thrillingly she can build even some innocent little songs to powerful climaxes, but I was amazed this time to hear her, amid a hauntingly plangent account of Irving Berlin's 'Change Partners and Dance With Me', start rising towards one such climax - only to pause, and then to taper the song away into the tenderest diminuendo close. As for 'Losing my Mind', she places its numerous little four-note phrases into a structure so firm that she might be singing Faure, not Sondheim. This is a highbrow way to talk about someone whose repertory includes 'Sweet Georgia Brown' and John Williams's 'Can You Read My Mind?' Cook herself is very simple. 'They tell me I belong to the golden age of musical comedy,' she remarked on opening night. 'I wish they'd told me that then - I'd have had more fun.' And very sunny. She can take old chestnuts such as 'You've Got to Accentuate the Positive' and make them live again, as if from some core of true faith. Several of her songs - such as 'Better with a Band' and 'Sing a Song with Me' - are about singing itself; and others are about dancing. Cook is a stout woman, and yet she is easy with her own body. She half-dances through some numbers, and there are moments when her jazz sense is such that she slaps all her weight, with the beat, on to one foot, and your kinesthetic sense half-expects her to burst into a tap routine. But she sings a quiet song like 'Why Did I Choose You?' from complete inner stillness, only raising her arms slowly as she reaches the conclusion, in a gesture so powerful that it embraces the theatre. She sings 'Why Did I Choose You?' - as she always sings her first encore - without any amplification. You realise all the more clearly then just how steady her breathing, how expansive her phrasing. Earlier on, there were times when the 16-piece band sometimes is too loud for her (though the way she can then cleave through an orchestral tutti with one of her own is always a major thrill). I think she has lost a little of her upper register, but am more struck than ever by the way that both chest and facial resonances are combined in her vocal tone. At Sadler's Wells until July 31.</p>

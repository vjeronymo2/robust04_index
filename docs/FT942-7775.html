			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Leading Article: On the brink over Crimea With its vote for de facto independence on Friday, the Crimean government raised the stakes in Europe's most dangerous political game. The alarming possibility is that the local power struggle in Crimea could drag Ukraine and Russia into all-out war. Kiev has consistently valued an increasingly threadbare sovereignty over the more painstaking process of economic transformation. For the Ukrainian government, Crimea is more a symbol than a piece of territory to which it has any strong attachment for its own sake, but that is precisely why Crimea's declaration of sovereignty last week provoked such a hostile reaction in Kiev. Ukraine has been tolerant of the pro-Russian Crimean government's demand for local self-rule over the past few months, but has drawn a line at outright secession. Kiev's disastrously ineffective leaders believe, probably correctly, that Ukraine might collapse altogether, if Crimea were to be allowed to secede. For Moscow, the escalating tensions on the Black Sea peninsula pose different problems. Ukrainian leaders complain that Russians have never fully accepted their nation's independent existence. That is quite true, but the Kremlin's current leadership does at least appear content to wait for Ukraine's disintegration. Even though President Boris Yeltsin has acted with commendable restraint over Crimea, he faces a powerful hard-line lobby, inside and outside his own government. Russian role If Crimea's war of words were to degenerate into a fight, it would be politically difficult for Russia to remain on the side-lines. Worse still, perceived success in Crimea could embolden Russian nationalists to gather lands from other republics, such as Kazakhstan and the Baltics. But the real gunpowder, both literally and figuratively, is on the contested peninsula itself. Both Ukraine, with its security forces and national guard, and Russia, which effectively controls the Black Sea Fleet, have a military presence in Crimea. The man who has recently appeared determined to ignite the explosion is Mr Yuri Meshkov, the maverick president of Crimea. Mr Meshkov, elected in January, appeared initially placated by a deal with Kiev that gave Crimea independence in everything but name. Over the past week, however, Mr Meshkov has been pushing further. The danger is that Kiev's adamant insistence on sovereignty and territorial integrity will be forced into a collision with the pressure on the government in Moscow to champion ethnic Russians beyond its borders. West's response How should the west respond? The first step, which is to recognise that Crimea is not a minor local irritant, has been taken. Beyond that, the best the west, and most of all the US, can do is serve as honest broker. With the help of western mediation, Kiev and Moscow might be able to negotiate a joint sovereignty arrangement, which would allow Ukrainians to feel they have not surrendered their territory, while giving Crimeans the connection with Russia that they apparently want. Simply lecturing Russia on the inviolability of Ukraine's borders - a particularly touchy issue, because Ukraine's renunciation of its nuclear weapons was made in return for a Russian pledge to respect Ukrainian territory - will not be enough. Russia exerts considerable influence on the Crimean government. Moscow should be asked to urge caution on its kinsmen and be warned that a war between Ukraine and Russia would make western assistance to either country, including membership of the Partnership for Peace, impossible. The Ukrainian government is seriously at fault, not so much in its handling of the Crimean issue as in its egregious mishandling of the economy. Kiev can have little hope of holding on to reluctant territories, so long as the economy continues its collapse. Terrified as it is of a Bosnia writ large, the west is ready to help Ukraine in substantial ways. But first, the Ukrainians must show that they want not only to keep their flag and their borders, but to begin the reforms that just might make Crimeans tolerate remaining Ukrainian citizens.</p>

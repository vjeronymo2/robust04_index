To ensure that all significant issues related to the proposed action are identified, scoping comments are requested. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES AND ADDRESSES FOR COMMENTS:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> To facilitate the receipt of written comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted.

Under current demand levels, the Airport experiences reduced operating capability and delay during bad weather conditions due to the close-spacing of the existing parallel runways. During busy hours, arrival demand exceeds the bad weather arrival capacity and aircraft and passenger delays result. In addition to increasing the severity of delays caused by bad weather, continued growth in aircraft operational demand is projected to exceed Sea-Tac's annual airfield capacity within the next ten years. The objective of the Master Plan Update, and accompanying EIS, is to address the bad weather capacity problem and to meet long-term regional air travel needs spurred by a growing regional economy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared for the Master Plan Update, which is expected to include numerous projects including, but not be limited to: A new parallel runway and improvements to the passenger terminal, ground access system, and other support facilities. The range of new parallel runway options that may be considered in the EIS are anticipated to be in the immediate vicinity of the existing airfield at Sea-Tac Airport. Based on the Master Plan Update, other airport developments that may be considered in the EIS would be located on or in the immediate vicinity of the existing Sea-Tac Airport property. Mitigation measures will be proposed, as necessary, for the significant adverse impacts created by development. Major actions or concepts to be discussed in the draft EIS include the no action alternative and other reasonable alternatives meeting the purpose and need. Such alternatives are expected to include several options related to runway lengths, separations and threshold stagger. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA and Port of Seattle have determined that the new parallel runway is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c) and will be prepared. The FAA and Port of Seattle have identified the following key areas for discussion in the EIS including, but not limited to: Alternatives, noise and land use, social and socio-economic impacts, human health, water resources, biotic communities, construction, earth, transportation and air quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scoping is the initial step in the preparation of the EIS. The scoping process is ``an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to the proposed action.'' Agencies, affected tribes, and members of the public are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. You may comment on alternatives, mitigation measures, probable significant adverse impacts, and licenses or other approvals that may be required. Comments and suggestions are invited from Federal, State and local agencies, and other interested parties and individuals to ensure that the full range of issues related to a Master Plan Update EIS are addressed and all significant issues identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate the receipt of comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted. A public workshop will be conducted to receive written comments on February 9, 1994 from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. at Tyee Senior High School, 4424 South 188th Street, City of SeaTac. The second meeting will be held on February 10, 1994 between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. for Federal, state and local agencies in the Sea-Tac Auditorium, Mezzanine Level Main Terminal Building, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Renton, Washington on December 20, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Edward G.

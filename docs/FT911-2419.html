			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Japan sees new SDRs easing liquidity JAPAN yesterday provided the first details of its proposal to enhance global financial resources through an issue of Special Drawing Rights, the reserve asset created and managed by the International Monetary Fund. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japanese finance minister, told the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee that he would like to see a selective SDR allocation to help countries in the Third World, and central and eastern Europe, suffering from temporary liquidity problems. He said any new SDRs should be given to countries implementing economic reform programmes, and be linked to the acceptance of strict economic conditions in those recipient countries. In this way, the Japanese minister went some way towards deflecting criticism of his proposals from countries such as the US and Germany, which have always considered that a new allocation of SRDs would be unnecessary and potentially inflationary. Mr Hashimoto's proposal won some support from Mr Pierre Be're'govoy, French finance minister, yesterday. He said that an issue of 30bn SDRs (Dollars 40bn), on top of the existing 21.4bn SDRs held by IMF member countries, would increase world reserve assets by only about 5 per cent and therefore would not be inflationary. Earlier, however, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the German Bundesbank, said he was thoroughly opposed to any new SDR allocation. He said that such a move would amount to a falsification of the character of the SDR, which had been created originally to offset a shortage of liquidity. At present, there was no shortage of liquidity in the world, Mr Pohl added.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Portals tumbles News that De La Rue and Portals had called off merger talks sent shares in the two groups moving in opposite directions. Bank note printer De La Rue, which had initiated the discussions, jumped 14 to 843p, while paper supplier Portals slumped 112 to 653p. The dramatic share price movements followed De La Rue's announcement that it did not intend to bid without the backing of the Portals board. De La Rue's final results on Tuesday are expected to disclose an increase in profits from Pounds 104.7m to a market range of Pounds 115m to Pounds 130m. The sale by Thorn EMI of a large part of its security business encouraged hopes in the market that the group had taken a further step towards its eventual demerger. The shares held steady in the face of the faltering market to close just a penny off at 1025p. Speculation that Thorn may split its two core businesses - music and rental - into two separately quoted companies, long-rumoured in the market, were given extra credence this week by remarks from the group's management at the results meeting. Strauss Turnbull downgraded profit expectations and turned seller of Dalgety, citing increased competition in the pet food market, and price increases in the potato market which are likely to impact on the company's crisp snack business. The shares fell 10 to 423p. The well-flagged sale of Bakers Oven by Associated British Foods caused some disconcertion over the price - Pounds 18.9m against best market expectations of Pounds 30m - and the shares fell 12 to 543p. Purchaser Greggs rose 12 to 805p on the deal and an upbeat trading statement. Discount supermarket group Shoprite endured another torrid session as turnover hit 1m and the shares weakened 10 to 80p. A profits warning on Thursday sent the shares crashing from 144p. There was some disappointment over the price struck by Boots for its Farleys baby food business. The shares slid 15 to 509p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo, which initially gained 10 in early trading, finished 5 down at 534p as the downward pressure on the market took its toll. Comments from the chief executive which came after the the market close denied the group was in acquisition talks, following strong speculation that Glaxo was seeking to buy or form an alliance with the US drug company McKesson. Shares in chemicals group Courtaulds bucked the poor market trend to close 3 ahead at 514p, after trade of 1.4m, on further reflection of the board's report of a positive trading outlook. The group reported lacklustre figures on Wednesday but it was the bullish statement and positive analysts meeting that led several brokers to upgrade profit expectations. Hoare Govett, which had the stock on its hold list, turned an aggressive buyer of the shares. However, Kleinwort Benson remain negative on the stock and said ' . . . we continue to recommend a reduction in weightings'. Legal &amp; General tumbled 23 to 408p, as dealers reflected on the balance sheet effect on insurers of the falls in both the bond and equity markets. Volume at the close was 1.9m. Prudential Corporation continued the heavy selling of recent sessions and fell 10 to 277p, in trade of 4.2m. Bargain hunters were evident around Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel which this week launched a much-anticipated Pounds 816m rights issue, one of the largest in UK corporate history. The shares gained 11 to 359p in modest turnover. Shares in engineering group William Cook fell 23 to 262p after it reported disappointing second half figures. Pressure on margins was blamed for the setback. British Steel gave up 2 to 136 1/2 p with NatWest Securities issuing a detailed negative note on the stock.</p>

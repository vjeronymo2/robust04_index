The Israeli forces retaliated with  intensive artillery bombardment of several villages in Iqlim  al-Tuffah. The clashes later developed into artillery duels  between Tallat Sujud and the resistance positions in Iqlim  al-Tuffah in which 155-mm and 120-mm artillery was used.  Israeli aircraft flew intensive sorties over the central and  western sectors and over Tyre, breaking the sound barrier more  than once.    According to our correspondent in al-Biqa', a South Lebanese  Army [SLA] foot patrol of 12, backed by a tank, crossed the  contact line in the Zhaghlah-Hasbayya sector at 1000 today,  advanced 2 km north of the security zone toward Mimis valley,  and stopped 1 km from the Lebanese Army positions. The Army  personnel in the area were placed on alert and took up combat  positions. The SLA patrol returned to its position at 1200.  Our correspondent said that Israeli Merkava tanks were spotted  moving along the Kawkaba axis and fired five artillery shells at  the al-Dallafi-Jabal al-Dahr axis.</p>

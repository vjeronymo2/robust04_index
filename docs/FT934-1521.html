			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Savings rates are reduced by Woolwich Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third-largest, yesterday became the latest society to reduce its savings rates. From tomorrow most of the 4m people who save with the Woolwich will find that the interest rate they receive is cut by 0.41 of a percentage point. With few exceptions the largest lenders have now set out their stalls for both mortgage and savings rates in the wake of the pre-Budget cut in base interest rates of 0.5 of a percentage point. It has given them the opportunity - taken by almost all - to widen their margins by passing on to borrowers a lower rate cut than the reduction in savings rates. All will also gain a short-term benefit from the time lag - usually two to four weeks - between the new, lower rates applying to investors and those applying to existing borrowers. Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, cut its base mortgage rate by 0.35 of a percentage point for existing borrowers from the turn of the year, and its saving rate by 0.5 of a percentage point for most savers from last Wednesday. That gap of about 0.15 of a percentage point is reflected in the changes made by other societies, although Nationwide, the second largest, had a wider spread, cutting its mortgage rate by 0.25 of a percentage point and its rates for most savers by 0.5 of a percentage points. This chance to widen margins is far smaller than the opportunity presented by the sharper cuts in interest rates last autumn, after sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. But the building societies are still likely to face accusations that they are not treating their members fairly. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said that building societies needed to widen their margins to make up for the fact that the returns they were achieving on their free reserves were also declining as interest rates fell. He said: 'They're running as hard as they can to stand still.' The pressure to reduce margins over next year will come not from MPs or ministers but from competition. Societies have been squeezed both on lending and borrowing. They have lost the market share of mortgages to banks, and face an intensifying struggle to retain their personal savers. Although sounding reasonably relaxed about the cuts in National Savings rates announced on Thursday, the sector is keenly awaiting the details of the new guaranteed income bond for pensioners, which was announced in the Budget. Some in the sector already foresee a more general threat to societies' retail deposit base in the prospect that, if interest rates remain low, large numbers of savers might decide that they are prepared to face some risk for a higher reward than savings accounts can offer.</p>

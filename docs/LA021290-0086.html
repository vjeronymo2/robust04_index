			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACHELORS GO HOLLYWOOD IN ANNUAL BASH  </P> <P> Once upon a time -- in 1905, to be exact -- a group of single gentlemen formed  The Bachelors to host an annual gala to repay social obligations. Tradition  continued Friday in what must be the ultimate fancy dress ball in the nation.  </P> <P> Chairman Sean Conway McCarthy (escorting Mary Louise Frawley) went Hollywood  with film reels on tables, Cocoanut Grove-like Mylar palms shining in the  Beverly Hilton ballroom, blowups of Lana Turner and Jean Harlow. Lester  Lannin's Orchestra rocked until 4 a.m. for nearly 850, with a multicourse  dinner and onion soup at 2 a.m. interspersed.  </P> <P> President Walter Wilson, secretary Hugh Bateman and treasurer William Bessolo  received with patronesses Mrs. Felix (Barbara) McGinnis, Mrs. William French  (Jean) Smith and Mrs. Donald (Anne) Moulton. Among prominent Bachelors: Scott  Brittingham, William Ahmanson, Scott Adair, Hugh Evans III, Peter Adams, Palmer  Casey, Chauncey Medberry, Whitley Collins, Robert Fuelling, B.D. and Briant  Howes, Richard Mogan, John Welborne, Grafton Tanquary and William Williams.  </P></p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Scotland reports steady improvement The tables of examination results for Scottish schools show a small but steady improvement over the past three years in the performance of pupils in Standard grade, the exam taken by those aged 14 and 15. There was also a modest improvement in highers, the main examination for school leavers entering further and higher education. The tables, covering 1992-93, also show that schools in Orkney, followed by Shetland, have the best performance in standard grade and in highers, followed by the Western Isles and Borders region. Strathclyde region has the worst performance, with the average of seven areas in the region dragged down by one of them, Glasgow. The Scottish Office does not provide a league table of schools, nor does it give the truancy rate. This is because Scottish Office ministers concluded that to present results as a league table would be misleading because it would not take account of individual schools' intake and the economic and social background of their catchment area. The Scottish Office believed truancy figures were likely to be misleading. The tables, produced by the audit unit of HM Inspectors of Schools, contains 11 measures of performance for each secondary school, covering the numbers of presentations and the grades achieved in standard grades, highers, certificate of sixth-form studies and vocational certificate modules. The tables also list the performance of private schools in Scottish examinations. This does not usually present a full picture of those schools, because they normally enter pupils for English GCSEs and A-levels, as do a small number of state schools. A leading figure in Scottish education said: 'The best way for parents to use these tables is to study the performance of the school their child is attending, or will be attending. Unless they know the background against which other schools operate comparisons are virtually meaningless.' The tables show that over the three years a slightly higher percentage of pupils achieved better levels in standard grade, and there was a modest increase in the percentage of pupils gaining one or more higher in bands A to C, the top three bands. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton MP, the Scottish Office education minister, said the government would be studying a way of measuring the value added to pupils by each school.</p>

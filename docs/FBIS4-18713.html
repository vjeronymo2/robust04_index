			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister today bluntly rejected the demand  by Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams for a "direct dialogue" to  clarify the Downing Street Declaration, and told him that  violence must stop now -- and for good.    His uncompromising message came in a letter from Downing  Street as Mr Adams warned the people of Ulster that the current  IRA three-day ceasefire was unlikely to continue.    "We are well into the peace process and we are going to keep  moving it forward," Mr Adams said.    But he added: "It seems to me unlikely, even logistically,  for the IRA to extend its suspension."    It appears that these chilling words "crossed in the post"  with the Downing Street letter, which was on its way to him when  they were uttered. The letter is written by the Prime  Minister's private secretary, Roderic Lyne.    They demonstrated that neither side had budged an inch. The  British Government demands -- as does the Irish Government -- a  permanent cessation of violence before Sinn Fein can even be  considered as a constitutional political party to join the  others in thrashing out Ulster's future.    And, it would seem, Sinn Fein, which accused Downing Street  of "hard-line posturing" remains adamant that the declaration  must be clarified to end the deadlock.    The Downing Street letter, which was in response to two  letters written to the Prime Minister by Mr Adams over the past  10 days, offered no concessions.    It said: "The joint declaration offers the way forward. Sinn  Fein can take it. Or reject it. But if violence continues, it  will only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the opportunity to  enter the democratic process."    Mr Adams was told that he saw direct dialogue as a means of  demonstrating recognition of Sinn Fein's position as a political  party with a valid electoral mandate.    "You are wrong to say the Government has caused a stalemate.  Any pause in the movement towards peace is because of the  continuing violence, and Sinn Fein's failure unequivocally to  renounce violence as a means of achieving political ends.    ``It is Sinn Fein that excludes itself from playing a full  part in the political process.''    The letter recalled that Mr Major said last December that if  there were a permanent end to violence, and if Sinn Fein  committed itself to the democratic process, then the Government  would be ready to enter into preliminary exploratory dialogue  with it within three months.    "We await a positive response. The people of the island of  Ireland, north and south, and from both traditions, want  violence to stop now, not temporarily, but for good. So do  their governments.    ``The joint declaration offers the way forward. Sinn Fein  can take it. Or reject it. But if violence continues, it will  only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the opportunity to enter  the democratic process.''    Meanwhile, Mr Adams was saying he felt "optimistic" about  the  future.    He told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback: "The sort of hard-line  posturing from Downing Street cannot disguise the fact that the  very positive message from the IRA will have been taken on  board, I believe, by the policy-makers.    ``Even if, because of John Major's leadership difficulties,  they cannot respond at this time, I am sure that the  significance and potential of the suspension will outlast its  duration. So I am quite optimistic.''    Mr Adams has written to US President Bill Clinton explaining  the background to the ceasefire, according to a newspaper report  today.    The IRISH TiMES said the letter was known to have been  delivered to a senior White House aide outlining the  circumstances behind the suspension of violence and setting out  in detail Sinn Fein's position.    The ceasefire has been holding, with police confirming today  there had been no terrorist attacks involving the Provisionals  since the truce started on Tuesday night [5 April].    Elsewhere, Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic  Unionists, said: "What Adams describes as a peace process is a  surrender process that the Government is engaged in.    ``I hope the Government will learn the lesson that you  cannot  placate the IRA. They will continue to ask for more and give  nothing in return. The stay of execution is simply a tactical  ploy to rest their so-called volunteers to plan more operations  to kill more people.''    Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds joined in the calls for  the ceasefire to be extended.    Speaking on holiday in Cyprus, Mr Reynolds said: "I  recognise  the very strong momentum among ordinary people on both sides for  peace and in that context I regard an extension of the ceasefire  as essential."    Foreign Minister Dick Spring said the ceasefire was "a  pathetically brief respite for those who have suffered so much  from violence."    He told a conference in Tralee, Co Kerry, attended by U.S.  Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith and SDLP leader John Hume, that  the Dublin Government wanted a permanent end to IRA violence.    "If it (the ceasefire) is to have any potential, that can be  realised only by extending it and making it permanent."    Tory MP Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland Minister,  told the PA today: "Gerry Adams has known for 19 years that it  is violence that excludes him from ordinary politics.    ``If he ends violence, after a time his group can become a  political party. So the door is open.''    Later, Mr Adams described the Downing Street reply as  "evasive and wholly inadequate."    He said: "This letter is a transparent attempt to evade the  issues which I raised in my correspondence and it is a wholly  inadequate response to the very real opportunity to move the  peace process forward that currently exists.    ``The IRA's three-day suspension of its activities was  unilateral and without condition. Sinn Fein welcomed this and  identified it as an opportunity to end the present stalemate  around the issue of clarification. Unfortunately Mr Major does  not share our concern to move forward.''    Mr Adams also published for the first time the letter he  wrote to Mr Major accusing ministers of a "negative and  dismissive" response to the IRA's "significant initiative."    He urged the Prime Minister "to reflect on the seriousness  of  the present situation and on the opportunity to move out of the  present impasse, provided by the IRA.    ``I would again urge you to grasp this opportunity to move  the peace process forward. You can best do so by authorising a  meeting with representatives of Sinn Fein so that we can receive  clarification of the Downing Street declaration in the same  manner it was provided to other particular parties.    ``Your refusal to do so up to now has created the present  stalemate situation. It is crucial to the peace process that  this stalemate be ended.''    He went on: "Clarification is required so that Sinn Fein and  everyone else, can properly and fully explore how the peace  process can be moved forward at this time, and specifically how  the Downing Street declaration fits into this.    ``Direct dialogue is the most obvious and most effective  method of providing the necessary clarification.''    Mr Adams added: "We cannot accept a situation in which those  who vote for our party are discriminated against and excluded  from involvement in the political process.    ``I understand that you face many difficulties but I am  convinced that the initiative taken by the IRA creates the  opportunity for you to respond in a way which moves this peace  process out of the present impasse.''</p>

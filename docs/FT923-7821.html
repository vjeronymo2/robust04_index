			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Paralysis of policy-makers OPTIMISM IS an increasingly rare commodity in the British economy. Yet the pall of gloom, which seems to thicken by the week, is making matters worse. There are some more hopeful signs, for those who are willing to look. But they remain few and far between; and the government's claims that all will soon be well have proved to be counter-productive. The economic news this week was certainly better than expected. Industrial output in June was flat, but manufacturing output has now risen for two consecutive months. And yesterday's fall in retail price inflation to an annual 3.7 per cent capped a good week for the government's anti-inflationary policy. Producer prices are rising at their slowest rate for 25 years, the fall in pay settlements in the service sector is catching up with that in manufacturing, and both wage and underlying price inflation are falling faster. The rise in unemployment in July was painful, but the rate of increase has moderated in recent months. Yet to claim, on the basis of these figures, that the recession is over, or that the battle against inflation is won, is misleading. Changes in unemployment are lagging indicators of current economic conditions, but so are official output figures as the chancellor repeatedly argued last year. Survey evidence, he said, is a better guide to the future. But the recent industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry suggested falling confidence, output and orders over the next three months. Raising spirits Raising business spirits prematurely can deepen the gloom if spending fails to respond. The slight pick-up in manufacturing output probably reflects decisions made in March and April in anticipation of a post-election recovery once the threat of Labour's tax increases had receded. The more recent gloom arises from the failure of that recovery to materialise. Next Monday's CBI retail survey is expected to show that sales are still falling. The extra manufacturing output is probably sitting in factory stores rather than consumers' kitchens. The markets certainly seem to have become more cynical following the disappointments of the the last few months. The FT-A All-Share Index rose by 13 per cent from April 9 to its post-election peak but has since lost all of that ground and more. The index ended the week unchanged on last Friday's close, despite the ups and downs of the week, while sterling remains at the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism. International events are unlikely to come to the rescue. Growth remains sluggish to non-existent throughout the developed world, and Britain's stock market weakness is more than matched by falls elsewhere. Shares on Wall Street fell slightly over the week while German share prices ended yesterday 3.8 per cent down on the previous Friday's close. Japan beat all-comers, with the Nikkei falling 4.5 per cent over the same period down through its 15,000 floor. The fall in German share prices could herald some good news for the rest of Europe. The growing sense among west German companies, backed by falling orders, that slow growth is about to turn to no growth might once upon a time have tempted the Bundesbank to ease interest rates. But the Bundesbank's sights these days are fixed firmly on rapid broad money growth which is well outside its target range, despite falling consumer inflation and absolute falls in wholesale prices. No panacea Lower interest rates are no panacea, even if they were on offer. Easier monetary policy in the US and Japan is having no more than a marginal effect on consumer spending and business investment. The Republican election campaign is therefore stuck: the deficit precludes any meaningful fiscal boost. The Japanese government is also stuck, but its problem is Ministry of Finance officials who retain the power to block its desire for a sizeable fiscal boost. All the factors which have depressed UK consumer confidence and spending over the last two years remain in place. House prices are still falling, interest rates are in double figures and consumers and banks are burdened by heavy debts. None is likely to lift any time soon. Interest rates, in particular, look stuck at least until the end of the year. The prospect of many more months of slow growth in Britain means that wage inflation should eventually fall to sustainable levels within the ERM. But while falling inflation may be good news in the long run, for now it merely compounds the pain by raising the level of real interest rates that debtors face. The most likely outturn is that the UK economy will follow the US example and enjoy a temporary quarter of barely positive growth before slipping back into moderate recession again. Cheerleading based on wishful thinking, rather than solid evidence, may lift spirits in the short term. Prospects of anything other than an unrecognisably sluggish recovery remain bleak. The government should tell it as it is.</p>

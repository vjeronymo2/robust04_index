			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE: IT'S HOMECOMING TIME FOR 2 RISING STARS;  </P> <P> BALLET: SAN FRANCISCO BALLET'S APPEARANCE IN COSTA MESA THIS WEEK SERVES TO  BRING TWO ORANGE COUNTY DANCERS BACK TO THEIR ROOTS.  </P> <P> Among the dancers appearing with San Francisco Ballet this week at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center are two who are making homecomings.  </P> <P> SFB principal dancer Evelyn Cisneros grew up in Huntington Beach and guest  danseur Gregory Osborne moved to Corona del Mar when he was a sophomore in high  school.  </P> <P> Though both are considered young, rising stars in their profession, neither  began studying ballet out of their own desire.  </P> <P> Cisneros was pushed into ballet lessons by her mother because she "was very  shy."  </P> <P> "My mother felt that ballet would bring me out of that shyness, and it really  helped," she said in a phone interview from San Francisco.  </P> <P> Osborne, speaking from Copenhagen where he was guesting with the Royal Danish  Ballet, said other people "made the decisions" when he was a kid. It wasn't  until an injury forced him to stop dancing while he was in high school that he  "learned that ballet was what I wanted to do, not what everyone else wanted me  to do, which was important."  </P> <P> Cisneros, who is dancing the principal role in all performances this week of  Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," will be partnered by Osborne in that work  Thursday.  </P> <P> Hedging on revealing her age ("I can't tell you that"), Cisneros said she was  born in Long Beach "sometime between 1958 and 1962." The family moved to  Huntington Beach when she was 3, and she began studying ballet at 8. But it  wasn't until junior high school that she decided to forgo softball, volleyball  and track teams in order "to spend that time on my ballet," she said.  </P> <P> Her life then became one of dedication and sacrifice.  </P> <P> "I would start school at 7:30 in the morning, have six (classes), no lunch,"  she said. "From there, I'd go to the studio and teach two or three classes . .  . then take my class, which went to 6:30, have dinner.  </P> <P> "Then we'd drive to Los Angeles and rehearse there for about two hours, (until)  10 or 11 p.m. Then we'd drive home. I'd do my homework in the car.  </P> <P> "I did that five days a week, and on the weekend there were also four or five  hours of rehearsal. It was hard. Most of my friendships went by the wayside.  All my spare time was put into my art. Looking back on it, I don't know how I  managed."  </P> <P> One big factor was the support from her family.  </P> <P> "My father worked two jobs," Cisneros said. "My mother would work at the ballet  school, at the desk, to raise money to provide shoes and leotards. I would help  teach at the school. I would student-teach three classes (to pay) for one of my  own. It was a sacrifice all the way around. . . .  </P> <P> "Fortunately, I have an extended, very close family, who helped diversify my  life. We're very Mexican and traditional. We would always know how important it  was for everyone to eat as a family unit. We would wait until after class to  eat together."  </P> <P> The payoffs began in 1973 when she was awarded a scholarship for summer study  at the San Francisco Ballet. A year later, she received another scholarship  from SFB and one from the School of American Ballet, the school affiliated with  the New York City Ballet.  </P> <P> She decided to try New York because "we all felt that it would be a different  learning experience for me," she said.  </P> <P> It was different. It was a disaster.  </P> <P> "I felt I was held back," she said. "They put me in a low-level (section). I  was not allowed to do the things I could do well. I was supposed to concentrate  on things I was not very good at. That might have been good for me, but I felt  very discouraged."  </P> <P> So she called San Francisco Ballet ("for me not to be totally discouraged and  give up"), which accepted her for the remainder of the summer.  </P> <P> "(That) was wonderful. It gave me back my self-confidence. After that summer,  they asked me to stay as an apprentice."  </P> <P> When she joined the company in 1977, she remembers encountering some prejudice  at SFB because of her Mexican heritage.  </P> <P> "A certain ballet master here wasn't very gracious that I was darker than other  people and looked different," she said. "Having grown up in Huntington Beach,  which at that time was almost purely white, I had feelings of that already when  I was a young girl. I already had to deal with that on a small level."  </P> <P> But then-co-artistic director Michael Smuin "would take that ethnic background  and be inspired by it," she said.  </P> <P> Smuin first put her into "A Song for Dead Warriors" (a ballet he created in  1977 about an American Indian), and later created dramatic roles for her in  ballets such as "The Tempest," "Brahms-Haydn Variations" and "Hearts."  </P> <P> "I like story ballets because they give you opportunity to express your inner  feelings, to develop a characterization and carry it through its full spectrum  of development," she said.  </P> <P> Now living in Diamond Heights in San Francisco with Robert Sund, her husband of  three years, Cisneros maintains ties to her ethnic roots. Frequently, she  speaks to Mexican and Hispanic youth conferences and community groups.  </P> <P> "I just feel that the Hispanic community doesn't have a lot of role models,"  she said. "I can approach them and say, 'Look, I was born up in a small town,  grew up in a middle-class family, they weren't wealthy. But if you have the  talent and desire, you can make anything happen.' "  </P> <P> Gregory Osborne will be featured in the Saturday evening performance of  Tomasson's new "Handel -- A Celebration."  </P> <P> A guest with San Francisco Ballet, Osborne, like Cisneros, didn't start  studying ballet on his own. "Basically, everyone around me sort of made a  decision for me," Osborne said.  </P> <P> "There were seemingly more possibilities for a boy in classical ballet because  not many boys at that time were interested in it. "  </P> <P> Born in Louisville, Ky., Osborne moved to Orange County with his family in 1968  and began studying with Lila Zali, founder of Ballet Pacifica, when he was a  sophomore at Corona del Mar High School.  </P> <P> "She was the best in the area and also had a little company," he said. "The  amazing thing is that Lila had a very small studio and yet . . . she taught me  to use space and how to move in a large way."  </P> <P> Osborne, who also declined to give his age, attended Texas Christian University  ("mainly because my parents wanted me to have a degree"), rushing through to  complete his B.A. degree in fine arts in three years. He was anxious to take on  the great dance world in New York, where he arrived at age 19.  </P> <P> But when he auditioned for American Ballet Theatre, he was steered into the  second, junior company. "I thought I had failed, I was second-rate, I had  failed my goal," he said. "I was quite depressed. I didn't realize that . . .  no contracts were available. I was very green. Actually, I was moving very  quickly and didn't know it."  </P> <P> Within a matter of months in 1975, however, he and Victor Barbee, a roommate at  North Carolina School of the Arts, were asked to joined ABT. But as he started  working his way up the ranks, he found the company's emphasis shifting after  Mikhail Baryshnikov entered as artistic director in 1980. (He resigned this  summer.)  </P> <P> "Basically, Misha was more interested in contemporary, modern repertoire than  in classical," Osborne said. "Right at the time he came in, I was starting to  be geared for roles as a prince. I would have done an Albrecht (in "Giselle")  or Siegfried (in "Swan Lake") down the line. But classical repertoire was  diminished and the principal dancers started hoarding their rep. Young dancers  didn't have the opportunity to do those roles."  </P> <P> Actually, Osborne was getting opportunities, but only "when someone would get  injured and I would take over the part. . . . At the last minute, I would go  on, more or less unprepared."  </P> <P> That state of things began to drive him crazy.  </P> <P> "I needed more information and more time for those roles," he said. "They were  too important to me to just throw them on stage. . . . I had a good (audience)  following, a good critical following, and I could blow it all in one work."  </P> <P> So he took a guest stint with the London Festival Ballet, which gave him his  first opportunity to dance Siegfried in "Swan Lake" in 1982. Strengthened by  this exposure in the classical repertory, he returned to ABT, only to feel that  his progress was thwarted.  </P> <P> "I felt that, at ABT, I was twiddling my thumbs. I didn't have the roles to  challenge me," he said. " 'This is ridiculous,' I thought. 'I don't have this  time to waste.' "  </P> <P> After Erik Bruhn cast Osborne as Gurn and then James in a new production of  Bournonville's "La Sylphide" for ABT in 1983, he followed Bruhn when he became  artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada later that year.  </P> <P> "I decided to work with him for a year or two, then go back to ABT," Osborne  said. "But I never went back. Things were going too well working with Erik. The  world was opening up to me. It didn't seem right to go back and I didn't see  the rep I wanted to do."  </P> <P> When Bruhn died in 1986, Osborne felt "I lost one of my greatest mentors and  probably one of my greatest friends . . . it was like falling down a well --  because I fell very long, until finally I felt that I touched base, very solid.  It was my own foundation which I had built, unbeknownst to me. . . .  </P> <P> "He guided me, he made me do my homework, so to speak. He also gave me the  (princely) roles and performances. He said if I didn't start doing those roles  soon, it would be too late, I would have missed the opportunities. He gave me  every opportunity. Fortunately, it seems to have paid off."  </P> <P> Osborne was a member of the National Ballet of Canada for five years. He was  seen locally as Lensky in John Cranko's "Onegin" and in Balanchine's "The Four  Temperaments" when National Ballet of Canada appeared at the Performing Arts  Center in 1988.  </P> <P> Then, like many native Canadians, Osborne eventually decided that it was time  to test himself in a larger arena.  </P> <P> "That's why I'm doing what I'm doing today -- guesting -- having flown the nest  from Canada," he said. "It's all very fine and well to be (appreciated) in  Toronto. . . . But I also wanted to test what I had learned with other  audiences, people that knew me from before, people who had a longer history  with the ballets, i.e., Europe and London.  </P> <P> "It was time to throw myself to the wolves, to see if I could hold my own amid  those dancers who had done all those ballets and my peers. So that's why I'm  guesting.  </P> <P> "Basically, when you throw yourself into the abyss, you jump off the cliff and  hope you're going to fly. But every time I do that, I find out how far I've  come and how much further I need to go.  </P> <P> "I have a lot further to go. I don't think it ever ends. As soon as you stop  learning, that's when you die as an artist or a dancer. . . . The more you  learn, all it teaches you is how (far) you've come and how much you don't  know."  </P> <P>  The San Francisco Ballet performs through Sunday at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Today's program  includes George Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," David Bintley's "The Sons  of Horus," William Forsythe's "New Sleep" and the pas de deux from "Le  Corsaire."

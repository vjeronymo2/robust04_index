			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Private prisons - rewards and reflections (1) Sir, Your editorial, 'Private prisons' (September 2), discussed the wisdom of privately run prisons. There has been considerable debate in recent months regarding the treatment of criminals, with attitudes hardening in the direction of longer prison sentences, the argument being that those convicted cannot reoffend when locked up. However, any system which neglects the problem of reoffending must be barren in nature. Therefore, if prisons are to be run privately under contract, then one element of the contract should be rewards/penalties - for the contractor - for those prisoners, who once released, do not/do reoffend. It would then be up to the contractors to decide how the prison environment might be managed to achieve this objective and maximise contractors' rewards.

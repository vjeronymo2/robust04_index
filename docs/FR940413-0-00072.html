			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. 34 CFR 682.607&blank;Payment of a Refund to a Lender  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary modifies the deadlines by which an affected institution shall pay a refund that is due to a lender, within 60 days after the student's withdrawal as determined under 34 CFR 682.605(b)(1)&hyph;(3) or within 30 days in the case of a student who does not return to the institution at the expiration of an approved leave of absence under 34 CFR 682.605(c). Instead, the Secretary will require the institution to pay a refund to the lender within 120 days (instead of 60) after the student's withdrawal or within 60 days (instead of 30) after the last day of the leave of absence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. 34 CFR 682.610&blank;Records, Reports, and Inspection Requirements for Participating Schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary modifies the deadline in 34 CFR 682.610(c) that an institution complete and submit required Student Status Confirmation Reports (SSCRs) to the Secretary or guaranty agency within 30 days of the institution's receipt of the report but will instead require completion and submission of these reports within 90 days. Reports of changes of borrower status if the institution does not expect to submit its next SSCR within the next 60 days may also be submitted within 90 days (instead of 30 days).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A), and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the severe impact of the earthquake in California has caused a national emergency that has been recognized by the Congress. The Secretary, recognizing the severe devastation of the California earthquake victims, finds that soliciting further public comment with respect to this notice of relief from regulatory requirements is impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with this notice are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined necessary for providing emergency relief during a natural disaster. This notice provides relief from administrative burden associated with information collection requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary certifies that this notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities affected by this notice are small institutions of postsecondary education. This notice provides temporary regulatory relief and will not increase institutions' workload or costs associated with administering the Title IV, HEA programs. It will therefore not have a significant economic impact on the entities affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assessment of Educational Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has determined that this document does not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers: 84.032 Federal Family Education Loan Program; 84.038 Federal Perkins Loan Program; 84.007 Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program; 84.033 Federal Work-Study Program; 84.063 Federal Pell Grant Program; 84.268 Federal Direct Student Loan Program) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard W.

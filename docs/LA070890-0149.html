			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIGNATION OF BULGARIA CHIEF IS CELEBRATED  </P> <P> More than 20,000 jubilant Bulgarians staged a rally in central Sofia on  Saturday to celebrate the resignation of President Petar Mladenov, forced out  by a series of "people power" protests.  </P> <P> Mladenov, 53, who ousted hard-line Communist leader Todor Zhivkov last  November, resigned after growing public pressure to quit over charges that he  called for tanks to crush an anti-government protest last December.  </P> <P> The resignation late Friday was unprecedented in Bulgaria's modern history and  sparked confusion in a country still struggling to make the transition from  monolithic Communist state to multi-party democracy.  </P> <P> As the demonstration gathered steam outside government buildings, political  leaders scrambled to find a replacement for Mladenov amid predictions the next  head of state would come from outside the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party,  once the Communist Party.  </P> <P> More than 5,000 students marched through downtown Sofia to hail Mladenov's  decision to quit. Earlier, student leaders announced the end of a 27-day sit-in  protest, saying that their main demand had been met.  </P> <P> Although Mladenov's party won a sweeping victory in free elections last month,  many Bulgarians are skeptical of its commitment to reform, and many university  graduates have emigrated.  </P> <P> "The students' strike was not against one person but against a demoralized  system," poet Blaga Dimitrova told the crowd from the steps of the National  bank.  </P></p>

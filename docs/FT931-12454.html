			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Solvay falls 14% as slowdown takes toll SOLVAY, Belgium's largest chemicals group, yesterday reported a 14 per cent drop in profits in fiscal 1992, excluding extraordinary items. The fall in earnings - which excludes minority interests - was blamed on a slowdown in the European economy which reduced demand for plastics and alkalines. The weak performance saw shares in Solvay drop by 0.2 per cent to BFr12,750 in one of the most actively-traded shares on the Belgian stock market yesterday. Solvay, one of the world's top 20 chemical groups, said capital spending would be 18 per cent lower in 1993 than in 1992, although research and development would be maintained at BFr13bn. Turnover in 1992 fell 1 per cent to BFr252bn. Solvay will publish formal results in April, but yesterday's preliminary statement indicated they would show full-year earnings before extraordinary items falling to BFr8.4bn against BFr9.8bn in 1991. Including minority interests, the figures would show a sharper drop of 18 per cent in net profits in 1992. These third-party interests - primarily the former joint venture in peroxides with Laporte, the UK company, have virtually disappeared following a group reorganisation.</p>

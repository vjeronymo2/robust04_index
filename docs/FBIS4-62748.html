			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 22 TASS -- Speaker of the Federation  Council Vladimir Shumeyko believes the resignation of Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin "is extremely undesirable in the  current situation".    He told reporters on Wednesday that "Russia was lucky that  Chernomyrdin became the head of government".    On Tuesday leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  Sergey Shakhray predicted that Chernomyrdin may resign in August  if urgent measures are not taken to improve the economic  situation.    But Shumeyko doubts that Chernomyrdin would resign. He  characterised him as "a fighter".    Despite his serious contradictions with Economics Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin, Shumeyko believes that the latter should  remain in the government. "Such a highly-skilled professional as  Aleksandr Shokhin should work in the government", he said.    The speaker also welcomed the appointment to the government  of Nikolay Travkin who used to work as a head of a district in  the Moscow region. "It is necessary to gather the experience of  every Russian region", he commented.    Shumeyko believes that the dismissal of Shakhray as the  nationalities minister would hardly trigger new conflicts in  Russia. "The number of interethnic conflicts will not change  after Sergey Shakhray left the government", he said.    The speaker also played down fears caused by Shakhray's  predictions that a new stand-off of authorities, worse than the  one which took place last October, is in store for Russia in  August. He said such forecasts have been made each spring and  autumn. "A normal way out can be found from even the most  difficult situation", he stressed.    Shumeyko does not believe it necessary to introduce a state  of economoic emergency in the country, but called to pay more  attention to the military-industrial and the agricultural  complexes which suffer a lot in the course of reforms.    Speaking on his relations with the president, Shumeyko  stressed that he "supported and would support Boris Yeltsin as a  reformer".</p>

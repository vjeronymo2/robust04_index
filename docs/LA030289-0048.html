			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COURT DOCKET  </P> <P> Actress Lynn Redgrave's daughter Annabel is 8 now, but her mother and father,  John Clark, are still claiming that Redgrave had the right to breast-feed her  while on the job. The Clark-Redgrave crew was at the posh St. James' Club in  West Hollywood on Wednesday to update the media on the progess of their dispute  with MCA/Universal over Redgrave's 1981 firing from the "House Calls" TV  series. (The dispute, which has been in and out of courts ever since, revolves  around counterclaims that Redgrave was forced to leave the show because she  insisted on breast-feeding infant Annabel on the set.) One court has ruled that  the dispute has been settled, but the state Supreme Court is now weighing the  case. She's asking for about $500,000 in attorneys fees and a written apology  published in the Hollywood trade papers. "This is our last chance," Redgrave  said. "We want to prove this is a matter of public interest . . . . more a  matter of principle than money." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The derivatives sector remained in the doldrums as traders continued to reflect on the poor prospects for a reduction in UK interest rates in the near term, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening level of the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,394 was again disappointing and put paid to initial hopes of attracting buyers. Following a mid-morning slide to the day's low of 3,359, dealing in the contract steadied to trade in a narrow range of 3,360 and 3,375, although the buyers remained few and far between. However, the decline in the US bond market following the release of US consumer and retail prices data put paid to traders' hopes of a modest recovery in the afternoon. That decline and the subsequent poor performance on Wall Street hit the UK fixed income markets once again, bringing a big sell-off in the futures which also helped drag the underlying cash market lower. At the close, March stood at 3,370, more or less in line with its fair value premium to cash of around 13 points. Volume was 17,235 at the official close and another 2,000 lots were traded in after-hours' trading. Turnover in the traded options remained healthy at 43,688 contracts, although down from Wednesday's impressive 49,335 lots. In the index options, some 14,207 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,958 trades carried out in the Euro FT-SE option. Lasmo was the most heavily traded stock option at 2,434 lots and was closely followed by Abbey National at 2,247 contracts. TSB, Land Securities and Tesco were the other stock options to be actively traded.</p>

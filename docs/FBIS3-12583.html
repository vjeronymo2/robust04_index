			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, today denounced  attempts to raise human rights issue in Kashmir by Pakistan and  the United States. He declared in the Lok Sabha today that no  country in the world has a better record in this regard than  India. He said Pakistan teaching us about human rights is  ridiculous. Mr. Chavan was replying to the day-long discussion  on a statutory resolution seeking to extend president's rule in  Jammu and Kahsmir for a further period of six months from  tomorrow, which the House adopted by a voice vote later. The  Rajya Sabha has already approved it.    In his 40-minute speech, Mr. Chavan questioned the intention  of the U.S. Administration in raising the issue and asked what  locus standi Washington has in recognizing or not recognizing  the instrument of Kashmir's accession to India. He said neither  they appear to help Pakistan, nor India, but themselves.  [sentence as heard]    Referring to his meetings with British leaders, Mr. Chavan  said he was sure that Britain, too, is not happy with the U.S.  stand on Kashmir.    Appealing to all parties to consider the issue above party  considerations, Mr. Chavan said any internal bickering will only  weaken India in the international forums. He also strongly  defended the role of the armed forces in the state and said all  have to understand the difficult conditions in which they are  functioning there. He said there is a qualitative change in the  whole scenario, as the terrorists do not have the support of the  local population anymore.    Earlier, initiating the discussion, Major B.C. Khanduri, BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party], urged the government to have a  clear-cut policy on Jammu and Kashmir. Participating in the  discussion, members from all sides of the house supported the  resolution, but stressed the need for taking political  initiatives to win the confidence of the Kashmiri people.</p>

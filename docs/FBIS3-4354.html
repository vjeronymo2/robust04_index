			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, March 28 (XINHUA) -- King Husayn today  summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent member countries  of the U.N. Security Council on the huge loss Jordan has  suffered as a result of the international sanctions against Iraq.    The king briefed the ambassadors from the United States,  Britain, France, Russia and China, the five permanent members of  the U.N. Security Council, on the severe economic loss on the  kingdom brought about by the enforcers imposing sanctions  against Iraq.    The U.S.-led enforcers were earlier reported to have stepped  up efforts to inspect Aqaba-bound ships recently, triggering an  outcry in the kingdom.    The parliament last week called on the government to link  Jordan's return to the Arab-Israeli negotiation table with the  lifting of the blockade of Aqaba, and the kingdom subsequently  lodged a protest with the United States against the siege.    Information Minister Jawad al'Anani said Saturday [26 March]  that the U.S.-led task force monitoring the trade embargo  against Iraq has inspected a total of 1,700 vessels since 1991  but has not detected any contraband materials in breach of the  embargo. Only food and medical supplies are exempt from the  sanctions.    In recent months, Jordanian officials have lodged complaints  for many times with visiting foreign dignitaries including U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.    On Saturday, a cargo ship carrying freight for Jordan coming  through the Red Sea will be inspected on shore instead of high  seas in what was viewed as a precedent-setting event, the first  since the imposition of international sanctions against Iraq.    The ship, a 13,000-tonne German vessel carrying 3,000 tonnes  of general cargo for Jordan, was prevented from proceeding  toward Aqaba on March 18 by the U.S.-led enforcers. After four  inspections, the enforcers ruled on Wednesday that the ship,  Skyman, could not be allowed to proceed to Aqaba since they did  not have "accessibility" to inspect some of the cargo.    The vessel proceeded to a gulf port to unload cargo destined  there before returning to the Red Sea for a new inspection with  better cargo accessibility.    One source said that "it was half way to a gulf port from  the  Red Sea when an agreement was reached after the Jordanian  Government intervention that the vessel could be inspected at  Aqaba port rather than the Tiran Straits," where the inspections  usually take place.    "Subsequently, it was recalled to Aqaba," he said.    It was not immediately known what response the ambassadors  had made in the meeting with the king, but observers here said  that the summon of the ambassadors was a continued effort by the  kingdom to lift the siege of Aqaba.</p>

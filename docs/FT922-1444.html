			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japanese steel venture in Italy ILVA, Italy's state steel company, yesterday signed an accord with Nisshin Steel of Japan to co-operate on products for car exhausts in what is believed to be the first direct investment by a Japanese steelmaker in Italy. The deal, although relatively modest, comes at a crucial time for Ilva. The European Commission has taken an interest in recent capital increases and the possible cancellation plans for a stock market quotation by the company. Nisshin Steel, Japan's sixth biggest steelmaker, is buying 10 per cent of Tubificio di Terni, which operates at Ilva's Terni steelworks in central Italy. Ilva owns 75 per cent of the company, with the remainder held by Sitai, a privately owned Italian steelmaker. No value has been placed on the deal, as the precise figure is still being studied, Ilva says. Following the transaction, in the form of a rights issue reserved for Nisshin Steel, the stakes of Ilva and Sitai will fall to 67.5 per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively. Tubificio di Terni was created three years ago in a restructuring at Terni and makes stainless steel pipes for car exhausts. Demand for such products is expected to rise with the growing popularity of catalytic converters on new motor vehicles. Nisshin Steel, Japan's leading producer of stainless steel pipes for exhaust systems, will provide technical assistance for the next five years for the Terni facility, where a new high-frequency production line is to be installed next year. Ilva has been looking for outside partners for a number of its operations, to ease its financial problems and meet commitments to the European Commission. The group may also try to bring in a European steelmaker as partner in the Terni tubes venture.</p>

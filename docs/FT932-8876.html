			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Tories poised to end secrecy on finances THE CONSERVATIVE party, which has a Pounds 19m deficit, may publish a balance sheet this summer for the first time. The move follows pressure from both Labour and the 'Charter' group of Tory activists for removal of the secrecy surrounding the party's finances. It comes as Mr Asil Nadir's flight to Cyprus and allegations - since categorically denied - of the existence of offshore 'slush funds' have revived criticism of the party's fundraising. A meeting today of the party's newly constituted board of management is likely to approve publication of a balance-sheet to bring greater openness to its accounting. The current proposals stop short of advocating a breakdown of individual donations to the party, but should result in the 1992-93 accounts being the most complete ever. 'The report will try to give as clear a view of the party's finance as possible,' according to Mr Paul Judge, the party's recently installed director-general. The proposals reflect a comprehensive overhaul of the party's internal accounting. In the past, the party has published a limited set of annual accounts showing income and expenditure but not full figures on assets and liabilities. On fundraising, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, is keen to guard against future embarrassment by ensuring it is stressed to donors that there can be no direct link between policy-making and their interests. Central Office coffers have been hit by the party's falling-out with prominent landowner donors over leasehold reform, and the recession's effect on many companies. Officers also acknowledge that much of the cash going to campaigners for a Maastricht referendum might otherwise have come to the party. Nonetheless, Mr Judge said the party was on course to meet its financial targets, which call for its accumulated deficit to be wiped out by 1996. It will soon announce that this deficit rose to Pounds 19m at the end of March 1993. Mr Judge laughed off 'slush fund' allegations as 'completely untrue', saying the party has 'offered a 10 per cent finder's fee to anyone who can come up with the Pounds 200m'. The Charter group will this week publish its own version of the 1992-93 accounts which it says gives a more accurate picture of the party's finances.</p>

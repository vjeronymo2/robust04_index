			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (38): Sceptics persuaded by careful training - Case Study / Northern Electric was faced with complex training problems when it equipped its sales force with laptop computers. But a carefully designed training programme brought success and helped it to keep its experienced sales staff NORTHERN ELECTRIC, the northern UK power utility, decided to use IT to support its sales and marketing operations following privatisation. It wanted systems which could back up its sales force with up-to-date customer information and capture data for market research purposes. Training the sales force to use the technology effectively was crucial to the project's success - especially given the nature of the established sales force and the change in Northern Electric's business. The hub of the sales and marketing system is a large ICL mainframe which administers a database of Northern Electric's customers - covering domestic, commercial and industrial. The mainframe uses an Ingres database management package to handle the data and act as a 'server' to smaller computers at the various regional offices. 'The system contains a complete model of the sales and mark eting life-cycle,' explains Tim Crick, the project manager at Northern Electric. 'We can use it to find market opportunities - for things like direct mail shots or for placing advertising.' The front-end of the system relies on the sales force equipped with laptop computers. Each night the laptops are connected to the electricity supply and the telephone system and 're-charged.' The mains re-charges the batteries and the telephone line transmits customer data for future sales visits from the regional offices. The laptops also contain software to work out sales quotations for central heating systems and other products - as well as taking orders from customers. The orders are transmitted back to the regional office during the overnight 're-charge.' Northern Electric was faced with a complex problem when it came to training the sales force. The wide range of age and experience - from bright 20-year-old novices to 60-year-old veterans - and the different levels of computer awareness, led Northern Electric to use a multi-level approach. 'Our industry is going through great change after a long period of stability. Some of our sales staff have worked the same way for many years and we knew we had to change this - and the culture around it,' says Mr Crick. 'We asked Kernel Training to help us design a programme which was selective and could help everyone - and bring them all up to the same level of competence.' Kernel Training (now FI Training) specialises in training programmes for custom-built applications software and had been used to help with previous training projects at Northern Electric. Tim Crick says that it was important to get users involved early in the project: 'We began with a public relations exercise when we were actually developing the system with a review group and a clear role for people from the sales force right from the beginning.' The next stage was to instruct the sales force in how to use the laptop computers: 'We ran computer familiarisation courses for those with no previous experience - how to turn the machine on, how to re-charge it, things like that. And we gave them a machine to take home with packages that they could explore for themselves.' Tim Crick adds that 'a couple of games' were included in the package to break novice users in gently. The basic familiarisation phase was followed by workshop sessions on the applications software and a role-playing 'dress-rehearsal.' 'We took the sales people to a show-house and went through a role-playing exercise to let them see how it worked in a real sales situation,' he says. By this stage, some of the sales force were ready to 'fly solo' - while others needed more instruction and confidence building, says Mr Crick. 'It was more often a lack of confidence and seeing the laptop as an aid which some staff found hard.' The important lesson learned by Northern Electric is that the multi-level approach has paid dividends. Not only is its sales force better equipped and collecting important management information, it has built on its experience. 'We have managed to take everyone across so far and we are now in the final stages. Even the hardened sceptics who said 'we will never use computers' have been won over and see it as part of their sales pitch now,' adds Mr Crick.</p>

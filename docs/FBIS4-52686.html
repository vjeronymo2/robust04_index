			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Takatoshi Ito, Hitotsubashi University] </F>   [Text] 1. It is important to have economists reaffirm their  opposition to numerical targets. Even though some observers  claim the United States will not use them as the basis for  punitive sanctions, we cannot be sure that will be true.    2. There is no good reason why Japan should be in a hurry to  reopen comprehensive trade talks. The U.S. trade strategy is  under attack at home. An easy compromise was rendered moot by  the failure of U.S.-Japan summit talks in February. Japan must  deal constructively with U.S. complaints based on the principle  of "equal opportunity." Some U.S. complaints, however, should be  rejected without compromise. In this era of distrust, a debate  over setting "targets" would be pointless.    3. Japan should urgently embark upon a program of  much-needed  deregulation, fend off external criticisms by announcing  substantial market-opening measures, and enter into bilateral  negotiations such as the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII)  with the United States. Japan must also make a positive  contribution to the establishment of the World Trade  Organization (WTO).  <H5>  EU Also Opposes Numerical Targets </H5>   Immediately before the U.S.-Japan summit meeting on 12  February, 154 Japanese economists made a public appeal to the  United States to withdraw its demand for numerical targets, and  to Japan to firmly resist numerical targets (see NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN 28 January 1994). This appeal was made directly to both  leaders as well.    Last fall, U.S. economists, including several Nobel prize  winners, published an open letter addressed to both leaders  which said very much the same thing. I believe that it is safe  to say that nearly all Japanese and American economists are  strongly opposed to U.S. Government demands for numerical  targets. Not only do numerical targets place the burden of proof  on Japan while placing the United States in the judgment seat,  they also distort trade between the world's first and second  largest economies. Economists have appealed to both sides to  conduct bilateral trade negotiations according to economic  principles.    I am not sure whether our appeal influenced the result of  the  summit meeting, but Japan was able to avoid becoming an  accomplice in managed trade by rejecting numerical targets.  Moreover, the failure of the U.S.-Japan summit bolstered the  opinion in Europe and the United States that Japan had "rejected  managed trade and upheld the principles of free competition."  Strangely enough, the Japanese decision actually helped to shape  public opinion. Japan is widely believed to have won a tactical  victory by taking the high road and appealing to concise  principles. This is but one example of the importance of  tackling international trade disputes with easy-to-understand  principles.    After the failure of the summit, however, share prices fell  on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the yen rose sharply against the  dollar on international financial markets. These occurances were  fueled by a sense of uncertainty. The U.S. Government, moreover,  immediately resurrected Super 301 (the authority to name and  sanction unfair trading nations) in order to increase the  pressure on Japan. Many in Japan began to call for a compromise  with the United States. But did the failure of the summit  disadvantage Japan? Was our advice concerning numerical trade  targets wrong?    I do not believe so. The United States and Japan are  currently going through a necessary period of adjustment as they  move toward a more constructive, long-term economic  relationship. There is not much that we can do about the  intermediate tensions that are part of this process. Over the  long run the extremely high yen will reduce our current account  surplus, but in the short term it will cause our trade surplus  to expand. This phenomenon is known as the "J-Curve." Japan-U.S.  relations are experiencing a political J-Curve at the present  time. It is important to be patient.    In order to restart comprehensive trade talks, some Japanese  analysts appear to be advocating a "policy of compromise." One  such group has proposed "voluntary goals" to get individual  corporations to purchase more U.S. manufactured goods. Another  group recommends "macroeconomic targets" aimed at reducing the  overall current account surplus. These analysts would like to  see U.S. demands satisfied by July. Various ideas have been  proposed in Japan, and U.S. Government officials in Washington  have expressed keen interest in this "policy of compromise."  <H5>  Macroeconomic Targets, Procedures Unclear </H5>   However, there are two major strategic errors in the  arguments of the "compromise faction." First, the United States  will view "voluntary goals" as "numerical targets" no matter how  it is presented and will use them as the basis for sanctions. At  the very least, these "voluntary goals" can be used as a pretext  for Super 301 if they are not met, or if anti-Japanese sentiment  intensifies. "Voluntary goals" were incorporated into the  semiconductor agreement and were again promised for automobile  and automotive parts imports during President George Bush's  January 1992 state visit to Japan. In both cases, the United  States used them as the basis for sanctions to coerce Japan into  meeting the goals. This despite the fact that Japan considered  them "voluntary goals."    In the revised semiconductor agreement of 1991, a foreign  semiconductor target of 20 percent of the domestic market was  explicitly stated in the text. However, the text of the  agreement also stated that this goal "would not be used as the  object of sanctions should it fail to be reached." In spite of  this provision and significant progress under the agreement,  sanctions were threatened when foreign semiconductors failed to  reach the 20 percent mark by the 31 December 1992 deadline.    The United States will not care if they are only "voluntary  goals." Today's compromise will undoubtedly become a source of  conflict tomorrow.    The second problem with the "policy of compromise" is that  it  encourages the mistaken opinion among some in the United States  that Japan will always compromise if enough pressure is brought  to bear. At meetings within the U.S. administration, the  hardline faction advocates use of the threat of sanctions to  force Japan to accept a comprehensive agreement by the time of  the G-7 summit in July (the second deadline). They remain  steadfastly opposed to the more conciliatory faction which  considers U.S. demands to be unreasonable. News that unease is  growing in Japan and that a compromise is being considered would  only embolden the hardliners. Despite the fact that these goals  were "voluntary," they would end up serving as a U.S. strategic  weapon. The policy of compromise would only complicate matters  by encouraging the hardliners. If this were to happen, it would  become impossible to say "no" at the upcoming summit.    As for macroeconomic targets, those who propose them must  clarify their goals and procedures. More important than the  result (a reduction in the current account surplus) are the  political steps for bringing it about. For example, if the goal  were to bring the current account surplus down under 2 percent  of GNP within three years, proponents would have to indicate who  would be responsible. This would be especially difficult to  assign considering the volatility of the yen on exchange markets  and the demand created for several trillion yen by the addition  of public corporations. Didn't advocates of reducing the current  account surplus below 2 percent of GNP welcome the appreciation  of the yen after negotiations failed?    Some advocates of macroeconomic numerical targets believe  they would obviate the need for microeconomic numerical targets  or at least reduce pressure on the microeconomic level. I  believe they are wildly optimistic. While Japan did not accept  numerical targets in the agreement reached at the opening of  comprehensive talks last July, it did agree to reduce its  current account surplus "substantially." The Japanese Government  used macroeconomic targets as a jumping-off-point, but did not  have the power to change microeconomic behavior.    In addition, the U.S. purchasing targets for automobiles and  automotive parts are not realistic. The quality of Japanese  automobiles and the lack of effort on the part of U.S.  automobile manufacturers are beyond dispute. Privately, even  U.S. trade negotiators concede that the automobile issue has no  basis in economic reality. If Japan were to agree now to  numerical targets or voluntary goals, it would only leave the  United States with the impression that it can demand whatever it  wants and Japan will comply. It would be best for all concerned  if Japanese automobile companies were to make an unpublicized  "voluntary" effort to increase purchases of U.S. automotive  parts.  <H5>  Reaffirm Market Opening Intentions </H5>   What then should Japan do? What should be our strategy?    First, Japan must impress domestic and foreign observers  with  its commitment to market liberalization and free market  economics by swiftly deregulating the domestic economy. This is  something Japan should do for its own sake, but it must so all  the more quickly because of the current impasse in comprehensive  trade negotiations.    The ironclad logic of resisting numerical targets while  unilaterally deregulating and liberalizing the market would have  the effect of countering Japan bashers, who claim that Japan is  somehow different, and supporting the pro-Japanese forces in the  United States. For example, there have been proposals to amend  broadcasting standards to allow 20 or more FM stations in the  regional metropolitan areas to specialize in certain types of  programming. Others are advocating the complete liberalization  of airline fares outside of the Haneda corridor. There is no  need to link these initiative to imports from the United States.    In addition, negotiations must become truly "bilateral." The  current trade negotiations have fallen into the same old pattern  of the United States making demands and the Japanese responding  passively. This approach has left both sides frustrated.    All exchanges between adults must be reciprocal. There is  tremendous resentment in Japan against the United States because  it has broken promises by refusing to reform its patent system  and lower tariffs on electronic equipment. What is needed is an  aggressive Japanese campaign to make demands of the United  States. We need to understand that U.S. public opinion  concerning international affairs is diverse.    Furthermore, Japan must come up with a long-term vision  concerning the global trading system. What is Japan's  relationship with the global economy, including and excluding  the United States? We should play a constructive role in GATT  and in the establishment of the new World Trade Organization  (WTO). We should view this as an opportunity to harmonize patent  systems, define dumping, and determine when subsidies are  permissible--problems that have exacerbated international trade  disputes in the past.</p>

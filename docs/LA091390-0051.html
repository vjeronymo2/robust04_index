			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> BEST PAL STAMPS HIMSELF CALIFORNIA'S BEST WITH EASY VICTORY IN FUTURITY  </P> <P> With his decisive victory in Wednesday's $344,100 Del Mar Futurity, Best Pal  has stamped himself California's best 2-year-old.  </P> <P> Whether or not the gelded son of Habitony will take on the cream of the East in  the $1-million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Oct. 27 at Belmont Park remains to be  seen.  </P> <P> Best Pal, who defeated 17-1 shot Pillaring by 3 1/2 lengths in 1:35 2/5, then  survived foul claims by jockeys Eddie Delahoussaye and Rafael Meza, isn't  eligible to the Breeders' Cup. He would have to be supplemented for $120,000,  and owner John Mabee isn't ready to commit.  </P> <P> "It's too early," said the man behind Golden Eagle Farm after the 11-10  favorite won his third stakes of the season on closing day. "I'll have to sit  down and talk with (trainer) Ian (Jory), see how he comes out of the race, then  sort the whole thing out."  </P> <P> Although the California Cup Juvenile Nov. 3 at Santa Anita would be Best Pal's  for the taking, the purse is only $100,000. Deposit Ticket, who won the  Hollywood Juvenile, has flourished in the East, but there are no other  2-year-olds who have really asserted themselves.  </P> <P> "I think we can beat Deposit Ticket," Mabee said. "I'm not worried about him.  He does have an advantage because he has been back East, but I think this horse  can handle anything."  </P> <P> Jory is in agreement and he left little doubt he'd like to go to the Breeders'  Cup. The trainer hasn't been shy when talking about Best Pal -- he predicted a  Futurity victory at the beginning of the meeting -- and nothing changed after  the horse won for the fourth time in five tries.  </P> <P> "I think he's the best 2-year-old in the country," he said. "I don't think  anybody can touch him. I'd think the Breeders' Cup is something we have in  mind. We might possibly run him in the Norfolk (Oct. 7 at Oak Tree), but we'll  have to sit down with Mr. Mabee and talk it over.  </P> <P> "I'd like to train him up to the Breeders' Cup, but we'll see. He's done a fair  share of racing for a 2-year-old, and we've got some plans for him next year.  We don't want to burn him out."  </P> <P> Still, there were more than a few spectators who thought the winner should have  been disqualified. Regional, the longest shot in the race at 63-1, nearly went  down going into the first turn and Pillaring also was bothered. It appeared Pat  Valenzuela and Best Pal may have crossed over the field without being clear.  </P> <P> However, after conferring for several minutes, the stewards ruled there would  be no change. This led to smiles from Jory and Mabee, the former president of  Del Mar and still a member of the board of directors.  </P> <P> "(Best Pal) came over and I almost got dropped going into the first turn," said  Delahoussaye, Pillaring's rider. "I had to jump heels. I don't know if I was  going to beat the winner, but it had to cost me a couple of lengths. My horse  ran real well."  </P> <P> Meza was just glad to make it back in tandem with Regional. He thought they  were sure to be separated.  </P> <P> "Patrick came right over and was never clear," he said. "I was close to going  off."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, who has been silent around the media in recent weeks, told Mabee  and Jory they had nothing to fear regarding the inquiry when he arrived in the  winner's circle. Del Mar's leading rider did talk with Steve Schulein, a member  of the track's publicity department, about the Futurity, probably because there  were no reporters present.  </P> <P> "He ran a super race," Valenzuela said to Schulein. "He's probably as good as  any 2-year-old I've ever ridden. I think he'll get better with age. He's a nice  horse."  </P> <P> Got To Fly, in his first race with blinkers, was third, a head behind  Pillaring. Formal Dinner, the 5-2 second choice while coupled with Running  Total, was another six lengths back in fourth after setting the pace for about  five furlongs.  </P> <P> "I had a lot of horse going into the turn, but the winner just came by and  jerked the heart out of mine," said Gary Stevens of Formal Dinner, who had won  the Sanford at Saratoga by four lengths in his previous outing. "But, he kept  running."  </P> <P> Bucking Bird was fifth, then came Magnificent Red, who was coupled with Best  Pal, Arctic Deputy, Running Total, Regional, Sunshine Machine and Terrific  Trip.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Fair will begin its 19-day meeting today with a 13-race  card. First post is 12:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The $50,000-added Foothill Stakes at 6 1/2 furlongs is one of two feature  attractions. A full field of 10 3-year-olds was entered, topped by Due To The  King, Gundaghia, Candyman Bee and Cove Way.  </P> <P> Due To The King is the 122-pound highweight and he will be ridden by Julio  Garcia. Martin Pedroza, who finished in a three-way tie for the lead in the  jockey standings at Fairplex last year, will be aboard Candyman Bee. David  Flores and Corey Black, the two riders he tied with, will ride Pass The Blame  and Cove Way, respectively.  </P> <P> Two races earlier, 2-year-old fillies will go 6 1/2 furlongs in the $40,000  added Bustles and Bows Stakes. Ifyoucouldseemenow, an impressive maiden winner  at Del Mar, Island Choice and Brazen top that lineup.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Del Mar showed an overall increase of 2.6% in combined mutuel handle. The daily  average was a record $7,510,866. Off-track handle was up 4.9% while there was a  slight decrease -- less than 1% -- on track. On-track attendance was up 1.2%  from last year (the daily average was 16,506, compared to 16,310 in 1989) and  off-track increased 6.3% (a record 19,522 opposed to 18,370 last year).  </P> <P> John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm led the owner standings with a Del Mar record  $644,034 in earnings. . . . Richard Mandella won with his last five starters at  the meeting to tie Bill Spawr and Wayne Lukas in the trainer standings. They  all ended up with 14 victories. Mandella won Wednesday with Song Stylist, Polar  Boy and Indian Wind after scoring with Bel's Starlet and Corwyn Bay on Monday.  </P> <P> Best Pal, who also won the I'm Smokin and Balboa, was named Horse of the Meet  by members of the media. Other winners in the balloting were: Sensational Star  (sprinter), Quiet American (older horse), Live The Dream (grass horse), Bayakoa  (older filly or mare), Tight Spot (3-year-old), Slew Of Pearls (3-year-old  filly), Best Pal (2-year-old) and Beyond Perfection (2-year-old filly). . . .  After riding King Of Will in the third race, Alex Solis took off the remainder  of his mounts complaining of stomach cramps. Russell Baze missed the fifth and  sixth races due to illness, but he came back to ride his final two mounts --  Shirkee and Terrific Trip.  </P></p>

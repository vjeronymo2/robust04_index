			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / OECD urges Spanish reform Spain should move faster on privatisation and deregulation of state monopolies to increase competition in services and utilities, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a report released yesterday. It also called for tighter control over regional government spending, state company management, social security abuse and and tax evasion. It said the government could reform some welfare schemes 'to concentrate benefits on the really needy'. The encouragement given by the OECD to the government to press ahead with structural reforms and a tight budget stance coincides with pressure from hardline factions in the ruling Spanish Socialist party for a shift towards more left-wing policies following the Socialists' European election defeat. The OECD said legislation to increase labour market flexibility, which came into force this month, was 'a landmark for Spain' which would help lay the ground for sustainable growth. However, the OECD it complained of 'hesitancy' in other areas where deregulation was urgently needed, such as telecommunications. In spite of a restrictive 1994 budget, the OECD said greater efforts were needed to meet EU public deficit targets set out in the Maastricht treaty. It forecast that Spain's general government deficit this year would remain at slightly above 7 per cent of gross domestic product. However, the Economy Ministry said it still hoped to bring the deficit down below this level. The greatest contrast between the OECD and Spanish government views was over the outlook for employment. Predicting economic growth of 1.2 per cent for the year, following last year's negative rate of 1 per cent, the OECD warned that Spain would probably have to wait until next year to see a fall in unemployment and that the rate, currently close to 25 per cent, was 'unlikely to decline significantly before 1996'. It predicted a further 1.2 per cent shrinkage in employment this year - about 140,000 jobs - although new apprenticeship contracts would help stem the fall. The Economy Ministry described this forecast as 'excessive', predicing a reduction closer to 0.7 per cent and 'a slight improvement' in the jobless rate by the end of the year. For 1995, the OECD expected Spanish growth to be 2.7 per cent. However, it warned that even with 3 per cent annual growth rates in the late 1990s, new jobs would be created only slightly faster than the expansion of the labour force. 'The fall in unemployment may be small,' it said. The OECD's expectations for inflation were broadly in line with the government's at 3.5-4 per cent from December to December, against 4.9 per cent last year. However, a report by Spain's Institute of Economic Studies said 4.5 per cent was more likely.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Franz Resperger: "Warning: `PKK Attack on </F> Vienna Regional Court'"]    [Text] Are Kurdish separatists planning a violent  liberation of one of their fellow fighters who is in prison in  Vienna? The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in  Wiesbaden has warned the Austrian authorities of such an attack.  The Vienna State Police are taking the appropriate precautions.  The reason: On 7 June, Kurd Huseyin Karabulut, 28, will be on  trial for attempted murder.    The BKA in Wiesbaden is not commenting on the matter. It has  been informed about the sensitive trial of the Kurd in Vienna,  but it cannot say anything about the planned liberation attempt.    Nevertheless, the police expect an attack because a German  PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] reportedly revealed that the  Kurd is supposed to be freed.    The background of the matter in brief: On 5 August 1990, a  26-year-old Turk, Mahmut Yerli was shot down in Vienna's Seventh  District. He was said to have been a member of the Turkish  right-wing extremist organization Gray Wolves and its boss in  Austria. Yerli survived the attack, even though he was shot  twice in the stomach.    The next day, two suspects were discovered by the State  Police: alleged PKK activist Huseyin Karbulut, 28, and his  29-year-old brother Metin. Huseyin was arrested, and Metin  managed to escape. He was later arrested in Wiesbaden.    Rudolf Mayer, the lawyer of the Kurd imprisoned in Vienna,  is  shocked by the rumors: "This is just intended to influence the  jury. The massive attendance of the police at the trial is to  give the impression that the defendant is a dangerous man."    In addition, Dr. Mayer believes that he will be able to  prove  that his client, who will be on trial for attempted murder on 7  June, is innocent: "Huseyin did not shoot at all. The shot was  fired behind him."</p>

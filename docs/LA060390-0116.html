			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NAKED INTRUDER SHOT DEAD AFTER BURSTING INTO RESEDA HOUSE  </P> <P> A naked man who broke into four Reseda homes and terrorized residents Friday  night was shot and killed by a homeowner whose wife he threatened, police said  Saturday.  </P> <P> Gene Brian Holloway, 23, smashed his head and hands through several windows  during the 11 p.m. rampage, police said. Holloway, who lived about a mile away  from the neighborhood, had been unemployed for the last year after a five-year  stint in the Army. None of the people he terrorized knew him, police said.  </P> <P> An autopsy will be performed to determine whether Holloway was under the  influence of drugs.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officers were investigating several reports of an intruder  in the 6800 block of Lasaine Avenue when they responded to a "shots fired" call  at a home on the street. Officers found the owner, James E. Bruner, 38,  standing outside the home. He took them to the living room, where police found  Holloway's body.  </P> <P> Bruner told police he was home with his wife, Elizabeth, 38, and their  17-year-old daughter when he heard a noise in the back yard. He went to  investigate and was confronted by a naked man covered with blood. The two men  fought briefly before Bruner broke away and ran back into his house, locking a  sliding glass door behind him.  </P> <P> Bruner "directed his family to call police while he armed himself" with a  shotgun, Officer Tom Zwinger said.  </P> <P> Holloway then threw himself through the glass door and "charged" Elizabeth  Bruner, Zwinger said. Bruner fired twice at Holloway, killing him, Zwinger  said.  </P> <P> Bruner, who suffered cuts and bruises during his fight with Holloway, was  questioned and released.  </P> <P> Police said the Bruner house was Holloway's last stop on a rampage through the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Residents at one house told police that an intruder shoved his head through a  closed bathroom window and began yelling. At a second house, a man smashed his  hand through a window in a front door, unlocked the door and confronted a woman  before throwing himself through a front window.  </P> <P> A bedroom window at a third house was smashed, but Holloway did not enter. He  instead went to the back yard and took off his clothes before going to the  Bruner house.  </P></p>

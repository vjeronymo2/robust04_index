Lu  Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said  that this was too bad. He reaffirmed that the Chinese Government  sincerely wishes the British Hong Kong Government to cooperate  with the Chinese side. He said: It shows that the Hong Kong  Government is not willing to cooperate with us if it does not  send officials to Beijing.    When asked whether or not this action was too politicized,  Lu  Ping stressed that it was certainly not politicized, because  these regulations were not comprehensible to everyone and it was  absolutely necessary to invite Hong Kong Government officials to  explain them so that they could answer questions directly raised  by members of the Preparatory Work Committee [PWC].    Lu Ping did not agree that this practice bypassed the Sino-  British Airport Committee. He explained: China and Britain  consult and negotiate with each other on the airport issue  mainly through the Airport Committee, but before the talks are  held, the Chinese side has to listen to all kinds of opinions;  hence, we are asking the PWC to discuss it first, hoping that we  can listen to all kinds of opinions through the PWC. However,  questions raised by PWC members cannot even be answered by the  Chinese side, therefore, we want the British Hong Kong  authorities would send officials to Beijing to give  explanations. Regarding the regulations on the airport  administrative organ, it has been very clearly stated in the  Memorandum that both sides should consult each other on these  questions and that the views of the Chinese side should be  listened to. Hence, in the future, we must still consult with  the British side through the Airport Committee.    Yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office, said when attending a forum: As far  as the consultations on the "draft regulations on the Airport  Corporation" is concerned, we hope that it is real consultation  rather than "doing it perfunctorily." As this question, which  straddles 1997, can be discussed in Hong Kong, why can it not be  discussed in Beijing?    Zhang Junsheng said: Problems straddling 1997 must be  discussed by the Chinese and the British sides and every  question related to the new airport should be handled according  to the Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport. The  issue of the airport corporation has been raised by the British  side, which must be submitted to China and Britain for  discussion. In addition, the Chinese side can also publicize  its suggestions to seek advice from the Hong Kong people.    Zhang Junsheng said: Now that the British Hong Kong  Government has published the "draft regulations on the Airport  Corporation," I hope that this will be real consultation and  that they will listen to others' opinions and take these  opinions into consideration rather than what we describe in the  mainland as "going through the motions."    Responding the issue of the PWC having to study the draft  and  invite Hong Kong Government officials to Beijing to brief them  on the situation, Zhang Junsheng said: These are issues related  to Hong Kong's transition and issues to be studied by the PWC.  Under this situation, why can they not invite British Hong Kong  Government officials to Beijing to explain these regulations?    Zhang Junsheng said: Not only the Airport Committee has to  study the issue, but so does the PWC. It is all for the smooth  transition of Hong Kong, why can they not do so? I do not know  what the British Hong Kong Government intends to do regarding  the smooth transition of Hong Kong? Why cannot we invite them  to Beijing to have discussions? Why can the issue be discussed  in Hong Kong but not in Beijing? Why discussions are acceptable  in Hong Kong but not in Beijing? This is unreasonable.    When asked by this reporter why the Chinese side did not  discuss with the British side the issue of the transition of  senior Hong Kong civil servants, Zhang Junsheng replied: The  issue of the transition of senior civil servants has been  clearly stipulated in the Basic Law, this is China's own  business as well as the future business of the special  administrative region government. British will end on 30 June  1997. This is completely different from the issue of the  airport corporation which we are now talking about.</p>

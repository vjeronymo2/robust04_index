			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> LOW-KEY CAMPAIGN WOOS SCHOOL BOND VOTES  </P> <P> Vista Unified School District, the second-fastest-growing school district in  the state, can expect 2,000 new students every year for at least the next six  years.  </P> <P> So district leaders have hired some professionals -- Price Research Consultants  -- to do what the locals could not manage to do a year ago: pass a bond issue  that will enable the district to build new schools and repair old ones.  </P> <P> And the experts have embarked on a decidedly understated campaign.  </P> <P> No Day-Glo signs urging YES for KIDS. No full-page ads in the local newspaper  carrying the endorsements of the city's elite for Proposition C. The game plan  is to alert the affirmative voters without arousing the negative crowd.  </P> <P> Last November, a presidential election year, about 75% of Vista's registered  voters voted. Among other things, they turned down a $63-million school bond  issue after a hard-sell campaign.  </P> <P> So this year school officials have taken a less direct path to their goal by  recruiting schoolchildren in a voter registration drive of their parents in  hopes of coaxing the "yes" votes past the 66.6% margin necessary for victory.  </P> <P> In coming days, local volunteers will begin telephone marathons aimed at both  reminding known supporters and at rounding up the strays. Selective mailings to  parents and other potential school bond supporters are scheduled as the days  dwindle down to the Nov. 7 election.  </P> <P> "We are within striking distance of victory," Kent Price, head of the  consultant firm, asserted Monday.  </P> <P> Price based his prediction on the quiet strengthening of pro-school voter rolls  and a recent telephone survey taken by the firm that showed only a percentage  point or two separating the district from its needed two-thirds majority.  </P> <P> In the next two weeks, Price said, telephone, mail and door-to-door persuasion  will be used in an attempt to swing the vote to the win column.  </P> <P> There are no vocal opponents to the bond issue, but there are many who question  why residents who have paid school taxes over the years must subsidize the  newcomers' schools.  </P> <P> Vista Mayor Gloria McClellan can answer that question without pausing for  thought.  </P> <P> "Vista's schools, like its streets and roads, are old and inadequate" she  explained. "Despite what many people think, we can't charge developers anything  we want in school fees. There is a limit, and that limit just about pays for  providing portables for the new students."  </P> <P> With the average Vista school more than 30 years old, and, until recent months,  no new schools built in 15 years, the district faces the major cost of bringing  the old buildings up to standard and building new ones, she said.  </P> <P> The bond issue will cost the owner of a home assessed at $100,000 an average of  $45.83 in yearly property taxes over the 20-year life of the bond issue, Manual  Robles, communications coordinator for the school district, said.  </P> <P> The first year's taxes on that $100,000 home would amount to about $110 for the  bonds, but would go down each year to a low of $12.72 on the 20th year of the  issue, Robles explained. School officials say they will use $27.6 million of  the bond issue to build six schools, probably elementary schools, to  accommodate the expected flood of youngsters from the new subdivisions in  eastern Oceanside, which lie within the Vista Unified School District  boundaries.  </P> <P> Another $9.5 million is earmarked for renovation of existing schools, including  the 51-year-old Lincoln Middle School, which is limping along with an ancient  boiler, flaking walls and leaky roof. A $1.5 million portion is set aside for  classroom safety improvements, including rewiring, and $280,000 for library  upgrading.  </P> <P> The funds won't last as long as the bond payments, Robles acknowledges. With  luck, he said, they will meet the district's most pressing needs for five to  eight years.  </P></p>

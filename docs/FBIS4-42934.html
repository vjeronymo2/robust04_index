			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said a  short while ago that yesterday's remarks by Turkish Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin were carefully expressed and more  moderate. The Greek Government, Venizelos stressed, considers  the Turkish foreign minister's remarks as an attitude of  decreased tension, within the more general climate of  cultivating artificial tension with the neighboring country.    The government spokesman also referred to the meeting  between  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Cetin later today in  Istanbul, and said that the issues that will be raised by the  Greek side include provocations against the Ecumenical  Patriarchate and also the ridiculous and unfounded claims by  Turkey regarding a relationship between Greece and the illegal  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK].</p>

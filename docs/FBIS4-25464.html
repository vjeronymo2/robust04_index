			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The other  day, when talking about reform of the commercial circulation  system, China's Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo said:  It is imperative to draw on the experience and practice of the  world business community and energetically develop chain-store  businesses in China. In particular, an important step will be  taken to introduce foreign funded and operated chain stores this  year.    Zhang Haoruo said: China will pursue a macropolicy of  walking on two legs in running its chain-store businesses. One  of the legs is to bring in foreign capital and make vigorous  efforts to run chain stores, which means policies governing  Chinese-foreign joint retail operations will be relaxed further.  He was certain that this measure would promote the renewal of  China's traditional mode of commercial operations to a great  extent and would speed up the reorganization and reconstruction  of China's commercial system.    The second leg is to use large and medium-sized cities as  the  basis, choose some solid commercial enterprises as the core, and  reorganize and develop chain-store business and chain-store  groups with Chinese characteristics.    This senior official in charge of internal trade revealed  that China is, taking sight of reality, actively communicating  with major chain-store operators abroad. It will draw  inspiration from the free and franchise chain-store practices of  Japan and Southeast Asian countries. As long as conditions are  adequate, restaurants, supermarkets, fast food shops, garment  shops, optical shops, Chinese and Western medical pharmacies,  bookstores, photo processing companies, and jewelry shops may  all consider operating chain stores.</p>

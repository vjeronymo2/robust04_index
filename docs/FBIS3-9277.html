			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Weglarek: "RP (Polish Republic) Stands </F> For Risky Proposition"]    [Text] Although, according to Western experts' generally  consistent opinion, Poland is the first country in Central  Europe that has managed to halt the progress of deepening  recession and begin a process of emerging from the crisis, it is  still seen as posing a particularly high investment risk. This  view is borne out by, among other things, an opinion survey  commissioned by the Polish Development Bank [Polski Bank Rozwoju  SA] and carried out by the Market Economy Research Institute.  The former GDR, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary were  chosen for comparison purposes. The Institute's respondents,  selected from a number of Western firms conducting business with  the former CEMA as well as international consultancy  institutions, were asked to draw a ranking list arranging the  above-mentioned countries according to, first, their importance  in business relations (the market attractiveness factor) and,  second, the degree of risk involved in placing investment in  them.    Our place on the list is very high as regards the  attractiveness of our market to foreign business. Using a  five-point scale, the consultancy firms awarded 4.5 points to  Poland (and, respectively, 4 points to Hungary, 3.5 points to  the Czech Republic, 3 points to the former GDR, and 1.8 points  to Slovakia). Business firms gave us a slightly lower rating  (3.3 points), but, even so, we came before all of the other  contestants. The next country on the list, Hungary, was  allocated 2.5 points, the Czech Republic 2.4 points, the former  GDR 2.2 points, and Slovakia 1.9 points.    A different picture emerged when it came to evaluating the  risk factor involved in investing in our group of countries.  The businessmen believe that Poland and Slovakia were leaders  in the "high-risk" stakes. The international consultancy firms  drew up a list with a slightly different order. They have the  least confidence in Slovakia. However, Poland comes a close  second to Slovakia.    Analyses carried out by the Market Economy Research  Institute  attempted to uncover the reasons for this particular ranking  order, which is so unfavorable to us. Among other things,  techniques developed in the West and adapted for use in our  country were used to draw up a "sector map" designed to present  a picture of the current levels of our enterprises' competition  potential. The map comprises five sections. The first section  lists industry sectors for which, in the present state of our  economy, the risk of bringing in outside capital is considered  to be "small"--in other words, those that promise relatively  high profits, with an advantageous correlation of outlays to  results. The second section of the map comprises "medium-risk"  industry sectors; the third, "increased-risk"; the fourth,  "high-risk"; and the fifth, "particularly-high-risk."    Startling as it may seem, from the economic viewpoint, the  sectors listed as involving small and medium investment risk  represent more than 50 percent of current industrial production!  Another group of sectors, representing approximately 14.4  percent of output, are relatively close to the potentially  profitable zone, although they require appropriate  efficiency-enhancement measures (the "increased-risk zone").  Sectors that have been described as representing high risk for  potential investment and that thus promise many difficulties for  firms that might decide to invest in them turn out approximately  7.8 percent of our industrial production. Finally, sectors that  constitute particularly high risk for potential investors and  that, consequently, are at present the least attractive--or, to  be more precise, that lag furthest behind others and thus  threaten the hypothetical investors with many unpleasant  surprises--represent slightly more than 27 percent of industrial  production.    Among the sectors that already offer only small risk to  investors are the herb industry, the match-manufacturing  industry, the sugar industry, and the pharmaceutical industry,  although the last requires a very high degree of specialist  knowledge and experience. At the other end of the scale, very  high risk is involved in investing in such sectors as the  high-technology optical, aircraft, and computer industries, but  also, among others, the potato-growing industry, the spirits and  yeast-manufacturing industries, and the footwear industry, none  of which, or so it would seem, present particular technological  difficulties hard to master for any country with a relatively  high level of technological and industrial advancement and  expertise, and whose work force has at least moderate  professional and technical qualifications.    Through an additional survey conducted among foreign  businessmen and business consultants, the Market Economy  Research Institute set out to ascertain the most prominent  reason for anxiety concerning the potential involvement of  foreign investment in the five countries listed above. In the  case of the former GDR, for example, social tension gave the  greatest cause for concern; in the Czech Republic, legislative  and economic difficulties were listed as most worrying; in  Slovakia, there was concern over economic problems; and, in  Hungary, economic and social factors alike were found to give  reason for anxiety.    In Poland, the chief risk factors are political instability  and imperfect legislation. No other country of our group of  five received even a comparably poor political rating from the  potential investors consulted in the survey.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark gains on M3 figures THE announcement of German money supply figures for March, which one market analyst described as 'horrendous', dashed any thoughts yesterday on the foreign exchanges of German interest rate cuts, writes James Blitz. The 9.7 per cent jump in Germany's annual March M3 growth dwarfed forecasts of an 8.0 per cent increase, and encouraged investors back into buying D-Marks yesterday. Many wondered if the next move in German rates might be upward. 'This is an astounding jump in lending,' was the comment of one analyst on the figures. 'It delays a cut in interest rates there, because money supply is a key concern of the Bundesbank.' As a result, most of the action in the markets yesterday focused on dollar/D-Mark trading after Wednesday's heavy buying of sterling. The German currency ended the day a touch higher against the dollar in European trading at DM1.6605, after a previous DM1.6635. It finished in New York last night at DM1.6585. In this situation, a favourable set of US weekly jobless and durable goods data offered little comfort to dollar holders. Although these figures looked agreeable to the market, and pushed the dollar up a little at the close, they were not enough to boost the US currency significantly. According to one market analyst, investors are waiting for a batch of important economic figures from the US before revising their view on the dollar. The US statistics, due next week, include real GDP for the first quarter of this year and home sales. The only comfort for dollar holders was in trading against the yen, with the US unit ending in London at Y134.45 after a previous close of Y134.15. However, traders said the improvement was mostly a by-product of yen selling for D-Marks. The dollar rose to Y134.62 in New York. The D-Mark also gained against other European currencies, recovering a small part of recent losses against the French franc and sterling. It ended at FFr3.3787, up from the previous night's FFr3.3773. The Italian lira, beset by doubt over who will form Italy's new government, gave up more ground. It closed at L752.55 against the D-Mark, from L750.90 previously. By contrast with its popularity on Wednesday, sterling mostly consolidated its position yesterday. The pound again ended third from the bottom of the ERM, while finishing against the dollar at Dollars 1.7669 from Dollars 1.7648. It was finally Dollars 1.7678 in New York. Against the D-Mark, the pound closed around half a pfennig lower at DM2.9277. A bank dealer commented: 'The pound is still the most wanted currency, though the authorities need to wait for more strength before thinking about a cut in UK base rates.'</p>

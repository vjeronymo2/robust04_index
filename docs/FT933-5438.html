			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Labour challenges Patten to oppose VAT 'on learning' LABOUR yesterday stepped up its efforts to exploit the government's budgetary difficulties by challenging Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to speak out against the extension of value added tax to books and children's clothes. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the extension of VAT to books and journals would cost English universities more than Pounds 11m a year and reduce sales of children's books. 'VAT on books and journals would be a wicked tax on learning, a punitive measure, at the very time that we need to be making it easier for people to obtain reading matter,' she said. 'Earlier this year John Patten told parents to read to their children each day. I challenge him to follow that up now by stating clearly his opposition to an increase in the price of books.' Mrs Taylor said ministers were preparing to widen the VAT net in the November Budget as part of the government's drive to reduce its Pounds 50bn budget deficit. Labour's campaign is intended to embarrass the government by drawing attention to its manifesto promise not to extend VAT. This was broken in the last Budget when VAT was imposed on heating fuel. The opposition also hopes to encourage Conservative councillors to oppose further extensions of VAT. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will not decide whether to increase indirect taxes until nearer the Budget. However, books and children's clothing are regarded as unlikely targets. Labour's attack on VAT is part of a wider campaign to force the government to focus revenue-raising efforts on eliminating tax breaks such as UK residence trusts and private health insurance.

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cask ale boost as Eldridge Pope makes Pounds 71,000 ELDRIDGE POPE, the Dorset-based brewer and wine shipper, yesterday took another step towards full recovery with a return to the black at the interim stage. This USM-traded group, which incurred substantial losses on its hotel and computing activities in 1990, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 71,000 for the half-year to March 31, against losses last time of Pounds 118,000 which took in a Pounds 320,000 interest provision against the Realstream computing business. The outcome was struck after an exceptional Pounds 77,000 (Pounds 130,000), being its half share of losses on the Highcliff Hotel, Bournemouth, which were partly offset by property sales surplus, and after an 18 per cent reduction in interest charges. Turnover rose to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 18.2m) leading to a 20 per cent advance to Pounds 1.24m in operating profits. Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said that the group's brands had performed well with cask ales well to the fore with a 14 per cent sales upturn, mainly from Hardy Country Bitter, reflecting wider free trade and wholesale distribution. Wine sales advanced by 6 per cent in a difficult market, he said. After a nil tax charge, reflecting reliefs and allowances for the period under review and previous years, earnings per 50p share emerged at 0.34p (losses of 0.56p). The interim dividend is raised 50 per cent to 1.31p (0.875p). Mr Pope said the board intended to pay a gradually increasing proportion of the total distribution at the final stage to reflect the seasonal flow of profits and cash.</p>

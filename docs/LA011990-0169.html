			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EX-CHILD ACTOR HAMER A SUICIDE  </P> <P> Rusty Hamer, the child actor in the television series "Make Room for Daddy" in  the 1950s and '60s, shot himself to death at age 42, his brother said.  </P> <P> Hamer was found dead in his home Thursday.  </P> <P> "He was a very unhappy, very confused young man," John Hamer said. "No one does  something like that if they aren't confused. I've heard of a lot of child  actors who have become unhappy with their lives after they've left the  industry."  </P> <P> On the TV series, Rusty Hamer played the part of Rusty, and Danny Thomas played  his father, a nightclub singer and comedian.  </P> <P> Hamer had his first movie role at the age of 5, and appeared in several Abbott  and Costello films.  </P> <P> The Danny Thomas show was one of television's most durable and popular  situation comedies. Most of the cast, including Hamer, returned in 1970-71 with  a sequel, "Make Room for Granddaddy," in which Rusty was a married medical  student.  </P> <P> Hamer returned to southwest Louisiana in 1976. He had held several different  jobs since.  </P></p>

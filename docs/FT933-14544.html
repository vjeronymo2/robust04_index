			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Birmingham told to retender contract BIRMINGHAM City Council, England's largest metropolitan authority, has been ordered by the government to retender its Pounds 250m housing maintenance contract because of uncompetitive practices. Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, said Birmingham had awarded work worth Pounds 250m over five years on 12 large contracts to its own direct labour organisation because it had offered a significant discount on its submitted prices provided it was given all the work. He said this was anti-competitive. The local authority said the bid from its direct labour force was the cheapest of nine bids by Pounds 1.35m.</p>

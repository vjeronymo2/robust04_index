			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Nicholson gets its Butler - Legal Briefs Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, a medium-sized City law firm has appointed Mr Jim Butler, former senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, as a non-executive member of its partnership board. Mr Butler is chairman of European Passenger Services and a non-executive director of British Rail, Tomkins, the conglomerate, and Camelot, the consortium put together to run the UK National Lottery. His role at Nicholson will be to advise on management issues and act in an ambassadorial capacity. Mr Michael Johns, Nicholson's managing partner said the firm was looking for a non-executive with a professional services background to take an objective look at the partnership. By appointing Mr Butler the firm was 'trying to say we're ambitious, that we want to be seen to be different and that we are flexible', he said. Nicholson is not the first firm to take on outsiders in a non-executive capacity. Freshfields has two non-executive members of its partnership board. Mischon de Reya also has a non-executive chairman. But Nicholson is the first medium-sized City firm to take-on a non-executive and Mr Johns believes Mr Butler's appointment could spark a trend. Management is an issue for all law firms at the moment, he says.</p>

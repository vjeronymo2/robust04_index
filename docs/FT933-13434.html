			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: EMC plans to double capacity of Irish plant EMC, a fast-growing US manufacturer of computer data storage and retrieval systems, has announced that it plans to double the capacity of its manufacturing facility in Cork, in the Irish Republic. The expansion, which is scheduled for completion by the end of the year, will create about 120 new jobs in a region that has been hard hit by cuts at other computer companies, including Digital Equipment. EMC's products include data storage systems for use with IBM mainframe and mid-range computers, as well as Unisys mainframes. Most of the company's revenues derive from its Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) product line, which competes with similar products offered by IBM. The company is also an early leader in the emerging disk array market, for data storage systems based upon a collection of small disk drives, such as those used in personal computers. Disk arrays provide faster data retrieval as well as offering higher storage capacity than conventional data storage systems. On Friday, the company reported record results for the second quarter of 1993, with a 115 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 170.9m and net earnings of Dollars 27m, compared with Dollars 6.1m for the second quarter of last year. Revenue from a recent agreement to supply Groupe Bull, the French computer company, with disk array products is running ahead of plan, said Mr John Egan, EMC executive vice-president. The company said that it has received assistance from Irish development authorities for the Dollars 20m manufacturing expansion, which will help EMC serve the European and Asian markets. In the US, EMC last week officially opened a new 62,000 square foot manufacturing facility at its headquarters in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.</p>

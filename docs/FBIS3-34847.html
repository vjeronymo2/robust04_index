The figures, calculated on the assumption that autonomy will  be launched in March, allow for a 158 million dollar deficit.    Some 280 million dollars should be raised from direct  taxation, said 'Abdallah, a member of the Palestinian Economic  Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), set up by  PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat to oversee the two billion dollars  aid promised by donor countries for the five years of autonomy.    He noted that most of the deficit should be covered by 120  million promised by donors for administrative affairs.    "This budget does not cover infrastructure or any  development  projects. This will be dealt with elsewhere," he noted.    PECDAR advertized in Tuesday's [15 February] Palestinian  press 16 management jobs for the tax and finance departments in  the future authority which is to run daily life in the Gaza  Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.    Israel and the PLO resumed negotiations in Egypt this week  in  a bid to seal an overall agreement to launch autonomy.</p>

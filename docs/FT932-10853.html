			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): Few signs of a return to favour - Property / institutions are still fighting shy THE UK commercial property market may be approaching the bottom of its cycle, but pension funds are not enthusiastic about returning to it. Although lower interest rates and the devaluation of sterling last September prompted a flicker of interest in commercial property from overseas investors and private buyers, the institutions have largely stayed on the sidelines. According to the Central Statistical Office, institutional investment in UK commercial property totalled Pounds 937m last year, less than half the previous year's Pounds 1.95bn. In the last quarter of the year insurance companies and pension funds made net sales of Pounds 77m of property. Within the institutional sector, pension funds are markedly less enthusiastic than insurance companies about property investment, according to a Gallup poll for CSW, a property magazine, at the start of this year. Some 31 per cent of pension funds expected to disinvest from commercial property, compared to 23 per cent of pension funds which expected to invest. The comparable figures for insurance companies were 53 per cent and 12 per cent. The pension funds' low level of interest in property investment cannot simply be ascribed to a belief that property will continue to fall in value. More than half the pension funds polled by Gallup thought that a meaningful recovery in UK property would take place in the first half of 1994; 38 per cent thought the second half of 1994. Indeed, even bearish commentators concede that the case for buying property has improved. Property yields, which average around 10 per cent, are higher than gilt yields for the first time since the 1960s. The banks' reluctance to make new property loans has severely limited the prospects for new property development. That means that when demand from tenants eventually returns to the market, rents can be expected to rise. The result has been reasonably strong demand for high yielding property with financially secure tenants, the income of which more than covers their financing costs. Retail warehouses, distribution warehouses and industrial sheds are most in demand from institutions, according to a survey by the Corporate Intelligence Group. However, the general lack of enthusiasm by pension funds for most of the commercial property sector is unlikely to be rapidly reversed. For one thing, several of the traditional selling-points of property have been undermined in recent years. The standard institutional lease, with its 25-year duration and upward-only rent reviews, has come under pressure from tenants demanding concessions and incentives. For another, the belief that property added counter-cyclicality and stability to an investment portfolio has been found wanting in the present downturn. Another traditional attraction of property, its role in hedging against inflation, has diminished in its perceived importance as prices have come under control, although a resurgence in inflation over the next few years might renew its appeal. Another explanation of why property is out of favour is that its performance over the past decade has been extremely poor. The annual rate of return for direct property over 10 years, five years and one year was 7.7 per cent, 6.2 per cent and -0.1 per cent, respectively, compared with 18.8 per cent, 14.7 per cent and 20 per cent for the FTA All Share index or 11.6 per cent, 10.6 per cent and 15.4 per cent for gilts. Furthermore, pension funds' cash flow is being squeezed which is limiting their ability to invest. In bidding for investment funds, property is having to compete with other asset classes. The government's burgeoning borrowing requirement will make institutions heavy buyers of gilts, limiting their appetite for non-gilt assets. That said, tax changes reduced pension fund's dividend income from equities by 6.2 per cent, which may lead them to switch some of their holdings into higher yielding assets such as gilts and direct property. Another factor militating against property investment is that the proportion of property in some portfolios has shrunk to a point where it may be more trouble than it is worth. Property's underperformance during the 1980s, together with the funds' ability to spread their investments into overseas equities after exchange controls were lifted in 1979, limited the role of property to institutions. The average weighting of property in pension funds valued between Pounds 100m and Pounds 1bn fell from more than 13 per cent in 1980 to 4 per cent in 1991, according to the WM company. Property's role is particularly inconspicuous in smaller funds. Pension funds with under Pounds 100m in management have less than 2 per cent of their assets in property, while funds of more than Pounds 1bn have a weighting of more than 10 per cent. But even though small funds are put off by property's illiquidity, management costs and the relatively large number of properties needed to obtain sufficient diversification, their property funds have outperformed their larger rivals, according to recent research by Gerald Eve, chartered surveyor, and Investment Property Databank. The annualised mean total return of small funds, with less than Pounds 65m of property, was 11.88 per cent and 10.4 per cent over five and 10 years respectively. For large funds, the return was 10.59 per cent and 9.53 per cent respectively. The most likely reason for this is that large funds had a greater exposure to property development and avoided City offices because of their large lot sizes. They also benefited because their retail investments were mainly in standard shops rather than shopping centres. 'Any economies of scale which large funds possess appear to be more than offset by the small funds' greater agility,' said Mr Eve. The large variations in the performance of different funds underline the scope for bucking the trend by making shrewd purchases. The minority of funds that are buying commercial property may do well from investing at a time of low expectations and little competition. For the present, however, commercial property shows few signs of returning to favour.</p>

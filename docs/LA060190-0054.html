			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND SOVIET RELIEF WORKERS TO JOIN FORCES  </P> <P> With the superpower summit as a backdrop, relief officials from the United  States and Soviet Union on Thursday announced creation of a private volunteer  organization to provide medical, environmental and agricultural assistance to  developing nations.  </P> <P> Called Operation USA/USSR, the Peace Corps-like project will begin by sending  teams of doctors to Mexico, its organizers said at a news conference coinciding  with the first day of discussions between President Bush and Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The privately financed project is sponsored by three organizations: Operation  USA, an 11-year-old, Los Angeles-based relief group; the Soviet Academy of  Sciences, a quasi-governmental agency, and the Soviet Peace Committee, a  private organization.  </P> <P> The joint venture was unveiled by Richard Walden, director of Operation USA,  and Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman.  </P> <P> In the United States, Walden said he will seek funds from corporations doing  business in the Soviet Union and in Mexico.  </P> <P> A six-member team of American, Soviet and Mexican doctors, all volunteering a  year's service, will be sent to Mexico City to work at a suburban clinic  originally set up by Operation USA after the 1985 earthquake. The U.S.  physicians will be recruited from UCLA Medical Center, the sponsors said.  </P></p>

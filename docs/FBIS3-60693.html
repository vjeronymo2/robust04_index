			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Dec (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM  comments in an editorial today on the UN General Assembly's  recent resolution urging all Middle Eastern countries to join  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and stop developing or  producing nuclear bombs.    The paper notes that Egypt was among the first countries to  join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the 1960's, while  Israel refused and continues to refuse to sign the treaty or  commit itself to the nonpossession of nuclear arms.    Referring to the UN inspection committees that have  monitored  Iraq's airspace and territory since it invaded Kuwait to ensure  that it does not possess the capability to manufacture weapons  of mass destruction, AL-AHRAM says a similar measure has not  been applied to Israel even though it does not allow its nuclear  installations to be inspected.    The paper urges Israel to comply with the UN General  Assembly  resolution, as the other countries in the region have, in line  with the current effort toward establishing peace and  good-neighborliness among them.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GATE': A ROUNDELAY IN VERSE  </P> <P> It's not often that we run into verse plays written much beyond the 18th  Century. So a play in verse based on a modern novel in verse that deals with  the lives of five people and a cat in contemporary San Francisco is a genuine  oddity.  </P> <P> Vikram Seth's 1986 novel, "The Golden Gate," is even more remarkable an exploit  for having been composed in strict sonnet form, with its 14-line schematic  rhyme. This is complex enough without the further problems of condensing it  into a play. But director-adapter Stephen Sachs has created a piece of high  melodrama out of "The Golden Gate" at the Fountain Theatre that dances all over  the original manuscript and, in its sleek final form, remains faithful to it in  style and content.  </P> <P> This is good and bad news, because form here supersedes content, which has the  soapy ordinariness of a latter-day "Aspects of Love," David Garnett's 1955  novel which served as the basis for the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.  Relationships among friends and lovers break apart and come together like DNA  molecules engaged in a wistful gavotte.  </P> <P> To read Seth's novel is to roam through a talented curiosity. But giving it  flesh in a theater weighs it down with opacity, which may explain why  Charlemagne, the cat, imagined but not seen, is the most vivid of the  characters.  </P> <P> This is no reflection on the actors, the adaptation or Sachs' fluid direction,  which goes for a swirling sense of time and place minimally anchored by Ken  Booth's mostly golden lighting and Sachs' inventive design: assorted blocks on  a ramp (bridge?) representing the San Francisco skyline or used as furniture  and set against an incandescent back wall.  </P> <P> Handsome young executive John (Larry Poindexter), in search of love and  fulfillment, is helped out by his friend Janet (Emily Kuroda), a sculptor who  nurses a secret love for him and places an ad for him in the personals column.  </P> <P> This introduces John to Liz (Jacqueline Schultz), a willowy attorney, owner of  the ferocious Charlemagne. Liz and John fall in love; Charlemagne and John  despise each other on sight.  </P> <P> The rancor breaks up the affair. Liz gravitates toward Phil (Dan Sturdivant), a  radical friend of John's, abandoned by his wife, whose sexual orientations are  sufficiently ambidextrous to have also swept up Liz's sexually uncertain  brother Ed (Tom Sullivan).  </P> <P> This "As the Verse Turns" is crowned by a tragic ending. Much of it works, some  of it doesn't. The rhymed speech is awkward, despite actors who know how to  handle it. Poindexter's John exudes yuppie charm and Kuroda has real backbone  as in-the-wings Janet.  </P> <P> Sturdivant is more problematic. His Phil has an abrasive edge that makes it  hard to see why he would hold brother and sister in thrall. Sullivan's Ed may  be weak and confused enough by religious upbringing, but why would Liz, who  resisted temperament in John, accept it so complacently in Phil?  </P> <P> How much one embraces "The Golden Gate" in the end will depend on one's  appetite for its peculiarities. The play, like the novel, is an intriguing  aberration.  </P> <P>  At 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with  Sunday matinees at 3. Ends Nov. 25. $15; (213) 663-1525.  </P> <P> </P></p>

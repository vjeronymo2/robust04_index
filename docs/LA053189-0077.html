			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW MONITORS OKD FOR CHILD SUPPORT  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday approved creation of an 11-member  board to recommend ways to improve collection of child-support payments.  </P> <P> The Family Support Advisory Board is the outgrowth of a recent report showing  that the district attorney's office, with almost 300,000 active child-support  cases, has one of the worst collection rates in the state.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay told supervisors that his office is  installing a new computer system to help track parents who fail to make their  payments.  </P> <P> The board accepted the recommendation of Susan Speir, founder of Single Parent  United 'n' Kids, that the panel of seven private citizens and four county  officials report to supervisors instead of just the district attorney. "The  district attorney is the problem," she said.  </P> <P> A report released by a coalition of women's groups in February said that three  out of four women who ask the district attorney's office to obtain orders  forcing fathers to pay child support never get one.  </P></p>

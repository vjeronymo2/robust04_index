			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Bee-keepers seek Brussels sweetener as imports sting No cliche was spared as 2,000 European bee-keepers protested outside a meeting of EU agriculture ministers yesterday. The angry swarm demanded subsidies to help combat cheap imports of honey from Mexico and China. 'Don't let bee-keeping die out]' the apiculturists' banners appealed on behalf of a proclaimed 480,000 bee-keepers across Europe, as officials and journalists reeled off the puns. "They're saying it's a 'to bee or not to bee' situation,' smirked one official. Another opined: 'We'll have to keep them sweet.' Amid the merriment, the demonstrators, more gentle in demeanour than the normal run of irate farmer descending on Brussels, handed out free honey, emphasising the environmental contribution bees make through pollenating plants. The European Commission, at any rate, was unstung by the criticism, insisting that there were only 14,000 real EU bee-keepers (with 150 hives or more each); that they get national subsidies per hive in the main producing countries of Spain, Germany and France; and that those producers were the ones blocking Brussels' plans for safeguard clauses against cheap imports. Mr John Home, a British bee-keepers' leader who, dressed as a bee, was received by Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, complained that EU apiculturists had to pay three times as much as their competitors for the sugar they feed bees in winter. Ah yes, one quick-witted EU diplomat said, but that is because we are foolish enough to subsidise sugar, creating a surplus at inflated prices. Perhaps a genius of the stature of Einstein would have suggested offloading some of the surplus sugar on to the bee-keepers, sweetening a sticky situation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Baghdad, 6 Feb (INA)--An international symposium  on war crimes and the blockade's violation of human rights in  Iraq continues its work in Iraq for the second day running.    Several Arab, foreign, and Iraqi figures, representing  humanitarian groups and organizations throughout the world,  spoke during today's session, which was chaired by Amin Shuqayr  from Jordan. [passage omitted]    Hugh Stevens from the United Kingdom said that the Muslim  communities in Britain suffered from a wave of racism as a  result of the policy of the British Government, which decided to  declare war against Iraq and deliberately created a racist and  tense atmosphere to prepare British public opinion for war. It  also exerted efforts to cooperate with the United States to  hamper any peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis.    He added that creating war deliberately is a crime against  peace, in accordance with the Nuremberg principles. Therefore,  in light of our experience, we can assert that the British  rulers committed crimes against peace, as well as war crimes  unprecedented in the history of war.    He said: I accuse former British Prime Minister Thatcher of  committing war crimes, as well as crimes against peace. He also  accused British Prime Minister Major and Foreign Secretary Hurd  of war crimes and of committing the crime of deliberately  creating poverty in one of the most important areas of the world  by imposing an unjust and illegal economic blockade, whose  consequences have become clear in Iraq's cities and hospitals.  He pointed out that, through its alliance with the United  States, Britain committed the ugliest crime of modern times. He  described the alliance as most hostile to Iraq. He called for  breaking that hostility through joint struggle by the free  people of the world, who yearn for freedom and to live in peace.    He added: We should continue, through public opinion, to  accuse the imperialists of crimes against peace, as well as war  crimes, in order to strengthen opposition against the blockade  imposed on Iraq.

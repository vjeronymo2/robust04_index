			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees were 'high bidders' Mr CLIVE LEACH, group chief executive of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, admitted yesterday that the group had been 'high bidders' for its ITV franchise. 'I put my hands up,' he said. 'We have got to do something about it,' he said after the group announced pre-tax profits up 23 per cent to Pounds 16.12m (Pounds 13.09m) for the year to September. But interest yesterday was less in the 1991-92 results, than in what happens now that the merged company must pay Pounds 52.76m a year to the Treasury. This is the sum it bid to secure the new franchise plus 5.5 per cent of net advertising revenue - a low percentage for a company of its size. The Exchequer levy was low in its final year. A total of Pounds 6.37m was paid to the government by Yorkshire, including a proportion of Tyne-Tees' dues. 'It's going to be tough,' conceded Mr Leach. But 'like Mark Twain, rumours of our death have been much exaggerated.' Yorkshire-Tyne Tees would be in profit from year one, albeit it at a lower level. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, believes the company will make Pounds 10.5m pre-tax this year, but that the figure will drop again to Pounds 7m in 1993-94 when Yorkshire will have its first 12-month financial year under the new franchise regime. Yorkshire has been putting considerable emphasis on cost-cutting - reductions are already running at Pounds 11m in a full year - and on savings resulting from the merger, such as shared transmission and advertising sales effort. Permanent staff would have come down from 1,257 in 1992 to 935 in March this year. 'As we progress throughout the year there will be opportunities to improve our working practices which means looking at the numbers we employ,' Mr Leach said. Although Pounds 1.1m was paid as a staff bonus in September there would be a general salary freeze this year. Yorkshire, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake of just under 20 per cent, is forecasting that it will increase its share of ITV revenue from about 11.8 per cent to 12.2 per cent. Net cash balances increased from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 23.1m. 'We are very comfortable,' Mr Leach insisted. Earnings per share increased to 27.1p (22.9p). The final dividend was held at 8.7p, making a same-again total of 12p. The share price gained 8p to close at 144p.</p>

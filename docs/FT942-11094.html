			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Building workers 'were cheated in Germany' Hundreds of British construction workers lured to German building sites by promises of high wages have been left destitute after being cheated by unscrupulous labour agencies and employers, the UK Building Employers Confederation said yesterday. In a single month this year, British consulates in Germany made arrangements to ship home 150 construction workers in distress, the Foreign Office said. The confederation claims many more workers are still stranded or trying to make their way home unaided. Consulates will make travel arrangements and help individuals trace friends and relatives who might pay for fares, but they do not provide money. One 19-year-old Londoner was paid the equivalent of Pounds 10 for four weeks grinding the surface of bricks in a German car park before being dismissed for allegedly poor work, according to the confederation. Conditions on the site were very poor. A big rise in eastern German construction following the unification of the country has increased demand for cheap labour, sucking in thousands of temporary workers from eastern Europe, Turkey and Britain. German construction workers, under the country's strict labour laws, are much more costly than foreign workers, many of whom are uneducated or do not speak German. Mrs Elizabeth Bridge, the building confederation's director of taxation services, said she was alerted to the scale of the problem after UK construction workers requested information on how to reclaim German tax paid on wages. They had been duped into accepting lower wages on the false grounds that British authorities would repay the tax. Many of the labour agencies advertising for bricklayers, plasterers and scaffolders in British national newspapers are based in Belgium or the Netherlands. Job seekers mostly are interviewed in bars or public places. The agencies cannot operate legally in Germany itself. Two brothers from Glasgow told how they were expected to live with nine other workers in a hut on a building site without sanitation or electricity.</p>

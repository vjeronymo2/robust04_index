			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Widows increases life and pensions contract sales SCOTTISH WIDOWS, the mutual life insurance company, reported increases in its sales of life and pensions contracts in 1992. Annual premiums rose 10 per cent to Pounds 122m and single premiums were up 19 per cent at Pounds 536m. Sales of unit trusts improved 62 per cent to Pounds 92m, of which Pounds 71m came from the personal equity plan and Maximiser product. The company commented on the recent recommendation by the Office of Fair Trading that independent financial advisers should be obliged to reveal to their clients the commission they receive from product providers. 'This seems to us to introduce an unacceptable bias against IFAs and is likely to alter the way in which the market operates to the long term disadvantage of consumers' said Mr Colin Black, chairman. However, Scottish Widows said it was supportive of other parts of the OFT's report, notably that consumers should be provided with greater information on the surrender value of insurance policies. The company was fined Pounds 120,000 during the year by Lautro, the life industry regulator, and obliged to review its authorised representative buiness. It said it had introduced a new management structure and an improved training programme to deal with the problem.</p>

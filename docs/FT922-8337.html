			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK INDEX futures traded in a narrow range for most of the session, with turnover down on recent levels, writes Joel Kibazo. A 2,760 opening level for the June contract on the FT-SE proved to be the session's high point, for selling shortly after the opening caused a retreat, pushing June down to 2,741 by 11am. A further dip to 2,738, the day's low, was recorded shortly after. For the next few hours June traded in a narrow range between 2,741 and 2,750. Traders were concerned by the stock overhang in the underlying equity market, following recent deals in ICI and Pilkington shares. A brief rally was seen towards the end, but June eventually stood at 2,741, down 23 from the previous finish and around 12 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover, at 5,986, was poor. The traded options market was dull with turnover of only 26,765 lots. The FT-SE option accounted for a sizeable part of that total, having had 11,310 contracts traded by the close, with the June 2,600 series particularly active. Business in stock options was very poor. Boots was the most active stock, with 1,127 lots dealt. The July 460 puts were the busiest series.</p>

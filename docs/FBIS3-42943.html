			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Emmanuil Mkrtchyan: "The Last of the Mohicans"] </F>   [Text] Yerevan--"Our Levon!"--this is how a crowd of  many thousands which converged on Theater Square from the  outskirts of the Armenian capital in response to an appeal by  the Karabakh Committee called him. It was precisely at these  rallies in 1988 that the political biography of current  President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan began. He made his way  from learned secretary of the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts  to the first president of an independent Armenia not only  through the crowds of democrats but also through the corridors  of Butyrki Prison. Together with like-minded people,  Ter-Petrosyan began to knock the already loose bricks out of the  foundation of the Soviet party and state system, which was still  quite strong at the time. Whether he is good or bad at present  as the head of state is another question. However, Levon  Ter-Petrosyan has passed the test of power.    Recently, he told journalists: "If my personality becomes an  obstacle to the democratic development of the republic, you do  not have to worry: The people will find an opportunity to get  rid of me." To be sure, Ter-Petrosyan now appeals to the people  on extremely rare occasions, nor does he like contacts with the  press. The authority of the president has been shaken  considerably over the last two years, and few people at present  call him "ours." A rampage of crime and the lack of legal and  social protection for a majority of citizens are the reasons.  Perhaps nothing remains of the romantic revolutionary spirit  that animated the people of Armenia as recently as a couple of  years ago.    Apparently, we may talk about the phenomenon of Levon  Ter-Petrosyan only in one area: At present he is perhaps the  only head of a state-former republic of the disintegrated Soviet  Union who has not shared the fate of similar politicians from  other former republics: Landsbergis, Elchibey, Gamsakhurdia. He  has managed not to lose to any of his opponents. Many people are  ready to give their votes to Levon even now, no matter how  strong the nostalgic mood is in Armenian society and no matter  how much people want order, heat, and bread. This is happening  despite the direct association between the president and the  activities of the ruling AOD [Armenian National Movement].  Judging from public opinion polls, confidence in the AOD is  close to the zero mark. The president is "hanging on" due to his  authority, and the AOD--due to the president.    The political fiasco of the AOD was built in long before it  came to power. It has its origins in the active struggle of many  AOD figures for ecology, the wisdom of which was actually  sacrificed to political ambitions. Rallies, hunger strikes, and  strikes brought about the closure of the largest chemical and  metallurgical production facilities. The campaign for  mothballing the Armenian "nuke" became the first baptism by fire  for many of the current political leaders. Thus the breakdown of  the economy of the republic was started; in the absence of the  energy sector and industry, the independence of the republic  became a mere formality. The burden of these problems  subsequently devolved on the president and his team, and they  began increasingly often to act against their better judgment.  One of the AOD leaders stated: "We proceeded toward power and at  times did not reckon with the price at which it was secured."    Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who assumed the reins of government in  the republic in 1990 first as chairman of the Supreme Council,  and subsequently as president, faced two tasks: reinforcing  state independence and resolving the Karabakh issue. His refusal  to hold the all-Union referendum in Armenia and reluctance to  maintain contacts with a communist Moscow gave certain forces  the pretext to accuse Levon Ter-Petrosyan of political  immaturity, which allegedly became the reason for military  pressure on Karabakh.    The opposition and the independent press, which criticize  the  policy of Ter-Petrosyan without restraint, frequently pay  attention to the cadre issue. The selection and assignment of  cadres became the "Achilles' heel" of the Armenian president. On  one occasion he himself admitted that he had relied on his  advisers too much and had made erroneous choices. This was quite  natural: On coming to power, AOD figures were in a hurry to pay  up on the I.O.U.'s produced by yesterday's brethren in struggle,  and it nearly came to the replacement of the entire director  corps of the country. To this day it is easy to find  nonprofessionals, ambitious amateurs, and at times simply  ignoramuses prepared to serve the AOD and the president  faithfully holding executive positions in state organs. The  nomenklatura is mostly selected on the principle of personal  devotion. Only on one occasion did the president abandon this  approach by appointing his political adversary Vazgen Manukyan  as minister of defense. Manukyan, the "godfather" of the AOD, an  ex-prime minister, and an energetic person, succeeded in  creating a disciplined and well-armed national army. However,  ultimately the president showed his character and relieved the  minister from his position because Manukyan's authority had  grown to a level that was dangerous to Ter-Petrosyan.    When it comes to the activities of the Armenian opposition,  observers evaluate it variously. Some call it weak and helpless;  others voice the opinion that the opposition does not even  strive for power and therefore does not show itself fully.  Undoubtedly, the conditions in which Armenia lives, labors, and  fights for Karabakh are absolutely unfavorable for taking power.  No matter how calamitous the situation of the republic, which is  actually in the clutches of a blockade and deprived of light and  gas, might be, external factors--the military situation in  Karabakh and the political situation in Russia--influence the  fate of its leadership tremendously.    The opposition accuses the president of an attempt to usurp  power by foisting on the people his draft of the Constitution.  The new Main Law gives the president extensive rights: He will  dissolve the parliament, appoint the prime minister, judges, and  so on. Of course, such a Constitution cannot suit the  opposition. It is preparing to do battle, which will begin as  soon as the president sets the date of a referendum. However,  the president is in no hurry.    Peculiarities of political life in Armenia shine through in  a  complete absence of pro-government forces. All parties, of which  there are about 30, prefer to remain in opposition. The Armenian  Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutyun and the  Democratic-Liberal Party Ramkavar-Azatakan are the most powerful  of them. From the time of the first Armenian republic of  1918-1920 until recently, these parties existed in emigration  but continued to operate. On returning to the motherland, the  Ramkavar-Azatakan Party first supported the president and then  went into "soft opposition." The Dashnak Party, whose  orientation is socialist, became the main opposing force. The  causes of enmity between the president and the Dashnaktsutyun  are found in differing approaches to the historic fate of the  people rather than in a struggle for power. The AOD concept is  based on gradually breaking down the geopolitical traditionalism  of Armenians, which is associated with the problem of Armenian  lands taken away by fire and sword, through mass genocide. In  the opinion of AOD leaders, including the conviction of Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia must live in the present and not use the  tragic pages of its history as a political weapon. The foreign  policy concept of the AOD does not recognize geopolitics based  on specific orientations; the AOD maintains: We have neither  eternal enemies (Turkey) nor eternal friends (Russia). The  Dashnaktsutyun, which comes out against breaking down the  Armenian national mentality, espouses the exact opposite point  of view.    At present, domestic political stability is preserved in  Armenia due to the powerful Karabakh factor. This issue is  perhaps the only area of politics with regard to which a  consensus continues to exist between the authorities and the  opposition. The efforts of Levon Ter-Petrosyan to solve the  problem by political means enjoy complete support in the  republic. Instead, the opposition has an opportunity to make its  presence known on another issue: It demands that the authorities  ensure elementary social guarantees for the people. After all,  Armenia is going through a second terrifying winter--there is no  electricity, no heat; the average salary may buy 1.5 liters of  kerosene or a kilogram of meat. At a recent extraordinary  session of the parliament, the president proposed from the  rostrum that the people eat only bread.    A wave of outrage swept the republic; the opposition  threatened a revolt. On the day of the parliamentary battle,  Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who clearly was out of sorts, nonetheless  agreed to answer several of my questions, refusing however to  touch on the topics of big-time politics and relations between  Armenia and Russia.    [Mkrtchyan] Mr. President, what is your assessment of the  situation that exists in the republic?    [Ter-Petrosyan] It is very complicated, contradictory, and  uncertain. I am not in a position to characterize it  unambiguously, although it is clear that it has emerged as a  consequence of a multitude of piled-up causes which are  characteristic of the period of transition. All of us--myself,  the leader of the state, state officials, and businessmen--are  to some degree like schoolchildren in the process of asserting  independent statehood: We are learning to live under new  conditions.    [Mkrtchyan] What are the reasons for this unprecedented  socioeconomic crisis?    [Ter-Petrosyan] On one hand, the reasons are of a purely  objective nature. As far as subjective aspects are concerned, I  can note the main point: The legal and legislative foundation is  imperfect here. We have not been able to develop clear-cut  mechanisms for adopting laws; current legislation fails to keep  up with life and causes chaos and disorder. I agree that at many  levels professionalism is lacking in the accomplishment of  particular tasks. However, we are entitled to a mistake en route  on an unknown path. My personal decisions may also be erroneous.    [Mkrtchyan] What has been your main mistake?    [Ter-Petrosyan] I admit that I do not always feel the  timeliness of a particular decision I make. This is particularly  the case with the issue of reforms in the economic and social  spheres.    [Mkrtchyan] Mr. President, what is your attitude toward the  concept of creating a coalition government?    [Ter-Petrosyan] If life commands, there will be a coalition  government; there will also be new elections, perhaps early  elections. However, for now the political situation in the  republic is developing in such a way that it is absolutely not  necessary to go for this.    [Mkrtchyan] Will you go for improving your relations with  the  opposition? What complaints do you have about the opposition?    [Ter-Petrosyan] I do not have complaints about it. The  opposition does what it considers correct, and decides itself  what it is to do. It is not up to me to instruct it.</p>

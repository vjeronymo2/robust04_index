			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Oslo envoy's sentence cut Mr Arne Treholt, 49, a former Norwegian diplomat convicted eight years ago for spying for the KGB, had his 20-year jail sentence commuted in an act of mercy by the government which based the decision to free him on fresh information about his poor health, Karen Fossli writes from Oslo. Mr Trehold has always maintained that he is innocent of the charges brought against him but failed several times to have his case reopened.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU NAMES ASSISTANT IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Susan Kubala has been named as an assistant women's basketball coach at San  Diego State, Coach Beth Burns announced Friday.  </P> <P> Kubala replaces Lyn Anastasio, who is completing her master's degree.  </P> <P> Kubala, 26, was an assistant at Kansas State last season, when the Wildcats  went 20-10. She was the recruiting coordinator and specialized in developing  post players.  </P> <P> Originally from Corpus Christi, Tex., she played as an undergraduate at New  Mexico State for two seasons before transferring to Texas A&amp;M in 1983. Her  playing career was then ended by a knee injury. She remained at Texas A&amp;M  for six seasons -- four as a student assistant and two as a graduate assistant.  </P> <P> "I think she will immediately help us work with the big kids," Burns said. "And  she's extremely well-organized, with good correspondence skills, which will  help in recruiting."  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Rabin stands firm on signing Palestinian deal: Armed Israelis march against agreement MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister, dismissed opponents of an historic Palestinian-Israeli deal as 'prattlers and liars' yesterday and said he would not be deflected from signing the agreement. Speaking as thousands of Israeli demonstrators, some armed with revolvers, marched on his office, Mr Rabin said protests 'won't budge me at all' from concluding the deal. In Washington, President Bill Clinton formally offered to host a signing ceremony for the agreement in the White House on September 13, if details of the accord have then been completed. The sticking point remained final agreement between Israel and the PLO on the precise terms governing statements of mutual recognition, after which both sides would be ready to sign the declaration of principles governing interim Palestinian self-rule. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said in Cairo that this last hurdle should be solved 'within 24 hours'. Israel is seeking commitments from the PLO over its covenant. Palestinian officials say they are prepared to supply such commitments, but say any change in the organisation's charter would require the endorsement of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile - something Mr Arafat and his colleagues wish to finesse to avoid both delay and potential internal opposition to the accord. Mr Arafat left Cairo for Oman yesterday. He is due to return to PLO headquarters in Tunis today for a meeting of the organisation's executive committee, or cabinet, to discuss the accord. Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, told the Financial Times that while there were still differences between the two sides over mutual recognition, he was 'cautiously optimistic' that the gap could be bridged by the weekend. In spite of yesterday's demonstration - which gathered under the banner 'Israel is in danger, don't give in' - political momentum in Israel continued to gather behind the deal. Mr Zalman Shoval, a leading member of the opposition rightwing Likud party, conceded in an interview that his party had little option but to accept the agreement and look forward to a general election in 1996. He said: 'It is a done deal. It is irreversible.' Mr Moshe Shahal, the police minister, said he was deploying 2,500 police to prevent the demonstrators from carrying out their threat to blockade Mr Rabin's office. Meanwhile, Israel suggested that international donors should provide Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) in immediate aid to the occupied territories. Prof Jacob Frankel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said such a transfusion should be provided to effect a 'visible improvement' in conditions. Moussa optimistic Page 4</p>

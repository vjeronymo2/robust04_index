			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 21, BNS -- The initiative group of  the Lithuanian Union of Leftists (LUL) published its draft  program saying that the union would be a parliamentary party  of democratic-socialist orientation.    The draft was published Friday [21 January] as a classified  ad in the leftist TIESA newspaper. According to unofficial  reports, the LUL wants to unite former members of the Soviet  Communist Party, who broke away from Moscow in 1990 but neither  joined the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party nor the pro-Moscow  wing of the Lithuanian Communist Party.    The emergence of a political organization based on the LUL  program would mean the creation of a new communist party in  Lithuania. The draft says, however, that the union would  be a completely new political force, unrelated to "communist and  Stalinist crimes."    The program emphasizes the need to protect "the interests  of the biggest, most impoverished and robbed part of the  population."</p>

Kolesnyk  (Simferopol): "The Current State of and Prospects for Employment  of Repatriated Crimean Tatar Population"]    [Text] The Republic of Crimea has elected the path of  introducing radical changes in the socioeconomic life of its  population. The development of the resort and recreational,  agricultural, and industrial complexes, as well as the service  industry, are under way, and the region's productive forces are  growing. The degree to which these resources are utilized fully  and effectively, especially the republic's manpower resources,  will greatly determine the future development of the region.    The transition to market relations has ushered in certain  changes in the situation. Some branches of the Crimean economy  are still experiencing a manpower shortage, but, at the same  time, there is a growing reduction in labor forces both in the  sphere of material production and in a number of branches of the  nonproductive sectors. In addition, the employment problem is  being exacerbated by the return to Crimea, their historical  homeland, of the Crimean Tatars and citizens of other  nationalities.    The attempt to solve problems associated with the return of  deported citizens and providing them with jobs is encountering  many difficulties caused by a large number of economic, social,  demographic, psychological, and other factors. In particular,  data on the labor potential of the citizens who have returned  from their place of residence in deportation is either lacking  or needs to be more precise. It is important both in qualitative  and quantitative terms to determine trends in changes in this  population's structure and reproduction. All this creates a need  for more intensive scientific study of the problems pertaining  to the utilization of human resources and the creation of new  economic, legal, and organizational forms and methods of  providing the population with jobs.    In view of this, the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian  Scientific-Research Institute of Labor of the Ministry of Labor  of Ukraine and the Committee for the Affairs of Deported  Nationalities of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of  Crimea are jointly conducting scientific studies for the purpose  of finding ways to solve the task of utilizing the labor of  deported citizens who have returned.    This article does not examine the question of employment as  it relates to all deported peoples who have returned to the  peninsula, but only as it relates to citizens of Crimean Tatar  nationality, who predominate among the returnees (91%).    The Crimean peninsula has attracted many tribes and peoples  since ancient times. The population of the Crimea has never been  ethnically homogeneous. Diverse ethnic communities formed and  coexisted here for many centuries.    According to the census conducted in April 1921, the Crimean  Tatars made up 25.9% of the Crimea's total population of  721,000. Although by the beginning of 1939, the number of  Crimean Tatars had grown to 218,000, their proportion to the  total population of the Crimea fell to 19.4%. In prewar  1940,  the number of residents of Crimean Tatar nationality totalled  220,000.    The peoples of the Crimea were harshly tested by their  common  struggle against fascist aggression. During these same years,  beginning with August 1941, 50,000 German residents of the  peninsula were resettled inland, and in May 1944, 188,000  Crimean Tatars were deported to the eastern regions of the USSR.  Somewhat later, 14,000 Greeks, 12,000 Bulgarians, and 11,000  Armenians were also deported.    The obvious outcome of this was that there were virtually no  Crimean Tatars in the Crimea in the years following the war.  Only since 1967 did Crimean Tatar families begin returning to  the Crimean Oblast as part of an organized resettlement. This  process progressed slowly and was not consistent in nature.    The years 1987 to 1989 were characterized by intensified  migration of Crimean Tatars to the Crimea, primarily from the  Central Asian republics. In the ten years between two censuses  (1979-1989), the Crimean Tatar population in the Crimea  increased by 33,000 and reached 39,400 [as published] persons to  constitute 1.6\52000060100f the total population of the Crimea. The  year 1989 marked the beginning of a mass return of this deported  people. Between 1990 and 1992, 134,000 Crimean Tatars returned  to their homeland, and the total number of citizens of Crimean  Tatar nationality living the Crimea reached 204,000 or  7.7% of  the peninsula's total population (see table).    It is difficult to predict how the process of repatriation  of  this deported people will proceed, inasmuch as there is no exact  figure indicating the number of Crimean Tatars expected to  return. Existing data are of a contradictory nature. Moreover,  they are founded more on emotion than on well-considered  estimates.    The majority of those who have returned reside in Crimea's  rural districts and have begun to build homes. Many of them work  in various spheres of the national economy and are engaged in  socially useful work.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Dynamics of the Size of the Crimean Tatar Population According to Data |  |from Censuses, Archival Documents, and Literary Sources (at the beginning  |  |of 1993)                                                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Size of population (thousands)                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Years             |Total             |Including Crimean |2000060100f total number |  |                  |                  |Tatars            |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1897              |546.6             |186.2             |34.1              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1921              |720.8             |186.7             |25.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1939              |1,123.8           |218.2             |19.4              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1940              |1,169.2           |220.0             |18.8              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1970              |1,813.5           |2.0               |0.1               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1979              |2,135.9           |5.4               |0.3               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989              |2,455.0           |38.4              |1.6               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990              |2,458.6           |70.0              |2.8               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991              |2,549.8           |113.0             |4.4               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992              |2,599.8           |154.0             |5.9               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993              |2,639.1           |204.0             |7.7               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The legislative acts and decisions relating to various  aspects of the repatriation of the Crimean Tatars attest that a  certain amount of attention has been devoted to the problem of  restoring the constitutional rights of deported peoples and to  the return of the Crimean Tatars to their homeland. The  implementation of these directives has produced a number of  positive features:    -- a Plan for the Settlement and Employment of Crimean  Tatars  in the Crimea has been worked out;    -- the rayons of Crimean Tatar settlement and the yearly  quotas for their distribution have been defined for the years  1991-95; accordingly, a Plan for the Distribution of Productive  Forces has been drafted, the number of needed jobs calculated,  and the necessary social and consumer infrastructure determined;    -- restrictions on residence permits for Crimean Tatars have  been lifted;    -- plots of land for building individual houses are being  allotted;    -- the following enterprises have been created to provide  jobs for Crimean Tatars:    a) two state farms: the Ahrarnyy State Farm in Pervomayske  and the Vodopiynyy State Farm in Chornomorske rayons;    b) two collective farms: the Avdet Collective Farm in  Rozdolne and the Batan Collective Farm in Lenine rayons;    c) the Krymahrospetsbud-2 trust and the BPMK [expansion not  given] in Simferopol and the PMK [Mobile Mechanized Column] in  Yevpatoriya;    d) the Berekety agrofirm in Simferopol;    e) the Seltemp building association and seven small  enterprises (Simferopol, Bakhchysaray, Yalta, Krasnoperekopsk);    -- construction is under way of a pedagogical school to  train  elementary school teachers of Crimean Tatar nationality;    -- one of the deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers of  the Republic of Crimea is a Crimean Tatar; there is a Crimean  Tatar deputy to the Crimean Supreme Council;    -- law enforcement organs, statistical institutions, and  other organizations have lately begun to devote serious  attention to repatriation affairs. The Ministry of Labor of  Ukraine is financing scientific-research projects studying the  employment of Crimean Tatars in the economy of the Crimea.    All these things will undoubtedly produce an effect in the  near future with respect to solving questions pertaining to  raising the living standard and providing jobs for Crimean  Tatars. Still, despite the work that has already been done in  the realm of resolving the problem of the return and settlement  of the Crimean Tatars, a number of measures outlined in the  directives remain unimplemented.    National employment policy is formulated at the state level,  and its objective is to guarantee equal job opportunities for  all citizens of the state, irrespective of nationality and place  of residence.    The processes of privatization, destatization, and  development of various forms of ownership that are under way are  producing a growing shift of blue- and white-collar workers from  state-owned enterprises, institutions, and organizations to  collectively owned entities and into the sphere of private  enterprise. This movement of labor reserves requires state  regulation and the safeguarding of social guarantees for  citizens. There are now manpower reserves in the cities of the  Crimea. As a result, the problem of jobs for the population is  becoming increasingly acute.    In light of this situation, the interdependence between the  interests of society and those of the individual is very  important. It should also be kept in mind that at this stage of  the development of the Crimea's economy, a number of factors  that complicate the placement of laid-off and unemployed workers  will have a perceptible negative effect. One such factor is the  increase in labor resources owing to the return of the Crimean  Tatars. That is why those government organs and their structural  subdivisions that deal with matters of employment have a special  task: to assist citizens in exercising their right to work more  rapidly and in filling the demand for manpower; creating new  jobs; providing support in the job market for those categories  of citizens who are poorly protected (young people, women who  are raising children, persons approaching retirement age,  invalids); preventing a high unemployment rate and alleviating  the negative effects of unemployment.    In order to study the composition of the returning  able-bodied population by sex, age, educational level, and  professional skills, as well as to discover the principal causes  of unemployment, to determine the number of people who want to  find work as soon as possible and the length of time it takes to  find a job, and other data, this study included a survey  conducted with the help of a questionnaire administered to both  employed and unemployed residents of the Crimea. In April and  May of 1993, 1,500 questionnaires were distributed among the  Crimean Tatars. In addition, the text of the questionnaire was  published in the newspaper YAN"Y DYUN'YA, which appears in the  Crimean Tatar language (circulation 15,000).    Unfortunately, however, the question of jobs has not yet  become a top priority for the Committee [for the Affairs of  Deported Nationalities], nor for its local representatives, nor  even for the Crimean Tatar people themselves. As a result, by 1  July 1993, we received back only 48 of 1,500 questionnaires and  25 letters in response to the questions published in the  newspaper. This insufficiency of data prevented us from  compiling a full description of the composition of the returning  able-bodied population on the basis of the questionnaires. It  was possible to discern only one trend: those who want to return  to the Crimea are willing to take any kind of job, while those  who have already returned and are now residing in the Crimea,  want to find work in the professions they worked in earlier.    Since the passage of the Law of the UkrSSR "On the  Employment  of the Population," the same job placement services as those  serving all unemployed citizens have been finding jobs for  persons of Crimean Tatar nationality -- in other words, priority  is given to their professional qualifications.    Another fact that cannot be ignored is that Crimea's labor  resources are unequally distributed on a large part of the  peninsula. As a result, it is not always possible to take into  account the specific features of individual cities, rayons, let  alone individual groups of residents, when solving general  economic tasks. This, unquestionably, affects employment and  creates new problems in the utilization of manpower. Hence,  reducing territorial disparities in terms of the employment rate  is assuming greater urgency, especially in this phase of Crimean  Tatar repatriation and job placement. Equalizing employment  rates by territories does not mean establishing absolutely equal  indices, but rather ensuring that the demand for jobs among the  population is met to an equal degree everywhere.    An analysis of Crimean Tatar employment in territorial terms  shows that the majority of them work in Crimea's rural districts  (85% of the total number of working Crimean Tatars). An  analogous indicator characterizing the employment of the total  population in the rayons measures 41%. Nearly 7,000  Crimean  Tatars are employed in the cities (1.1% of the total  number of  people working in cities and 15% of the total number of  working  Crimean Tatars). The reason that such a small number of Crimean  Tatars work in resort cities is that fewer members of this  ethnic group live in these cities, which, in turn, stems from  the fact that they received residence permits much later. Thus,  only 19 Crimean Tatars work in Yalta and 148 in Alushta.    An analysis by the republic's rayons indicates that the  overwhelming majority of Crimean Tatars works in Bilohirsk  Rayon. Here, the Crimean Tatars account for 2.5% of the  total  number of those employed in the Crimea, while the analogous  indicator for the Crimean Tatar population measures  10.2%. Many  Crimean Tatars also work in the Krasnohvardiyske (7.5% of  the  total number of employed Crimean Tatars), Dzhankoy (7.4%),  Kirovske (7.1%), Saky (6.9%), and Bakhchysaray  (6.8%) rayons.    A study of Crimean Tatar employment by branches of the  economy showed that the largest number of Crimean Tatars are  employed in the republic's agricultural sector -- 26,700 of  46,000 persons, or 58.1%. Many Crimean Tatars work in the  health care field (3,200 or 7.0%) and in industry (2,600  or  5.8%). On the average, the predominating fields in which  Crimean Tatars are employed in the cities are industry  (16.7%  of the total number of Crimean Tatars employed in cities),  transport (16.4%), construction (13.8%), and  health care  (13.4%).    As we know, an increase in the size of the able-bodied  population produces the need for a corresponding increase in  jobs. This will not pose a problem in areas of compact Crimean  Tatar settlement, where the development of agricultural  production, as well as of the processing and other industries  and of construction, will proceed hand in hand with the  development of a social infrastructure, which will create jobs  in the fields of public education, medicine, culture, and art. A  significant portion of those engaged in intellectual work who  settled in the cities and large population centers (especially  resort centers) is encountering difficulties in finding work.  This problem as regards this and other forms of employment will  continue to worsen as the construction of housing is completed  and the need to provide jobs for a large number of Crimean  Tatars grows. In all probability, the process of economic  stabilization will take a long time, and the unemployment rate  will rise. Engineering and technical personnel and white-collar  workers are already encountering difficulties in finding jobs.  As a rule, they will be forced to undergo retraining and change  their professions. The number of unemployed in the job market  will also increase in large measure on account of the Crimean  Tatars.    The problem of providing jobs for Crimean Tatars can be  largely solved by compact settlement. These are the regions  where the necessary enterprises should be established and new  jobs created. Consequently, the priority directions should be:    -- utilizing existing employment reserves, that is, filling  vacancies and jobs where possible;    -- developing a social infrastructure in the areas of  Crimean  Tatar settlement, which includes: a) meeting the needs of the  population for retail services, public catering, and consumer  services, and ensuring that the number of these meet the  necessary standards; b) expanding and rebuilding a functional  network of preschool institutions, general-education schools  (where necessary -- in the native language), and medical,  cultural, and artistic establishments;    -- increasing the production capacities of construction  organizations and enterprises manufacturing building materials;    -- intensifying the development of agriculture and  organizing  a modern base for preserving and processing production; creating  the necessary conditions for the effective utilization of  Crimean Tatar labor in the agroindustrial complex, raising their  interest in the results of their work, taking stock of and  applying the national skills of the Crimean Tatars in the  development of traditional occupations -- vegetable growing,  tobacco cultivation, orcharding, viticulture, sheep breeding,  horse breeding (mainly in areas of compact settlement);  promoting the development of subsidiary, private farm, and  leased farm enterprises;    -- promoting greater specialization in the light and food  industries and increasing the output of these industries to the  level needed to meet popular demand;    -- developing (along with state ownership) and strengthening  of collective, joint-stock, cooperative, and other forms of  ownership;    -- stimulating the growth of enterprises with any form of  ownership that are engaged in providing various services to the  population;    -- increasing the level of economic development in a number  of rayons located in the steppe region of the peninsula by  increasing the number of ettlements and developing a production  infrastructure and new agroindustrial complexes in them;    -- reviving national folk crafts, etc.    In order to alleviate the unfavorable economic and  demographic situation, increase the employment rate, and improve  the effectiveness with which labor potential is utilized, we  feel that we can recommend to the Council of Ministers of the  Republic of Crimea that it pass a resolution granting the right  to all citizens who possess a Crimean residence permit to obtain  employment at any enterprise in the Crimea regardless of place  of residence.    An investigation of such a complex and many-sided subject  cannot pretend to offer a comprehensive analysis of the  questions studied, nor guarantee the accuracy of its  conclusions. Some proposals have been put forward as subjects  for further discussion. In addition, future studies need to be  adjusted to take into account the time that has passed and the  practical materials that have been gathered.</p>

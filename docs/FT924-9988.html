			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Teredo directors under threat from dissidents DISSIDENT shareholders in Teredo Petroleum, the USM-quoted oil and gas producer, are seeking an extraordinary meeting to consider ousting three of the four directors. The proposal is to replace them with three former executives of Sovereign Oil and Gas, acquired by Neste of Finland. Mr David Biggins, chairman of Europa Oils, the trio's investment vehicle which owns 4.6 per cent of Teredo, said their experience at Sovereign would enable them to strengthen the board. He claimed that money raised in rights issues had been 'frittered away' over the past few years, while the market value had fallen from more than Pounds 20m to about Pounds 4m. He suggested that the company should be recapitalised and become more international. The directors that he and his colleagues, Mr Peter Tory and Mr Peter Smith, plan to replace are Mr Peter Simonis, chairman, Mr Ray Godson, managing director, and his predecessor Mr Michael Seymour. Mr Godson said the company had recently decided to concentrate on low-risk development of its existing fields, which are onshore in the UK and Spain. Although its Pounds 10.5m long-term debt meant gearing was very high, Pounds 5m of that was low-interest loan stock, one of the issues on which the rebels would like to take action.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lynda T. Jumilla] </F>   [Text] The government and the National Democratic Front  [NDF] have agreed to form four "working committees" that will  lay the groundwork for formal peace talks between the two  parties. Howard Dee, chief government negotiator with the  communists, yesterday said the committees will cover human  rights, socio-economic reforms, political and constitutional  reforms, and cease-fire and disposition of forces.    Interviewed in Malacanang [presidential office], Dee said  the  creation of the committees was one of the two agreements forged  between government and NDF representatives during their 10-14  June meeting in Breukelen, The Netherlands. The other agreement  was to get the peace process moving, after having been stalled  for several months.    "In our next meeting before the end of the quarter -- we  have  not yet decided the exact site (in Belgium, The Netherlands, and  Luxembourg) and date -- we will proceed to operationalize these  working committees," Dee said.    Both the government and the NDF will designate their  respective representatives to the committees, who will then meet  with their counterparts from the other side to discuss the issue  assigned to them.    During the meeting in the Benelux territories, the two sides  are also expected to set the venue and date for the formal talks.    Meanwhile, Dee said the government will keep its options  open  in regard to talking peace with breakaway communist factions.    This, despite the NDF's warning that the government would be  violating the joint declaration signed in Hague, The Netherlands  in September 1992, should it decide to negotiate with other  groups.    "The government position is, it is the government's  prerogative to address all those who want to have peace with the  government because the government wants to make peace with  everyone," Dee said.    But he said there was no decision yet to talk with other  groups as the government has yet to formulate a policy on the  matter.    Dee and acting presidential peace adviser Manuel Yan will  meet shortly to discuss policy recommendations on holding talks  with other groups, he said.    So far, the only other communist faction that may seek to  negotiate with the government is the breakaway Manila-Rizal  Regional Committee [MRRC] headed by Filemon Lagman. The MRRC is  the mother unit of the urban hit squad Alex Boncayao Brigade.  Dee explained that the peace panel deals only with  organizations with armed units, and these exclude mere political  groupings such as those headed by other breakaway leaders as  Ricardo Reyes and Romulo Kintanar.    "The decision (to open talks with other factions, as in the  case of Lagman) should be made at a higher level because the  case of Lagman is complex," he said.    In the case of Lagman, Dee added, the government would have  to find out what group he represents.    As this developed, former NDF chief negotiator Satur Ocampo  said the NDF was likely to insist on holding formal talks abroad  despite the government's shifting-venue policy.    The NDF's position remains that holding the talks outside  the  Philippines would minimize the risks of its negotiators and  staff being put under surveillance or arrest, he said.</p>

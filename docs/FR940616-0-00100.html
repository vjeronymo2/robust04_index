			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Certain agency programs operate under statutory definitions of ``persons with disabilities'' that are more restrictive than the definition of ``individual with disabilities'' contained in &sect;9.103. Those definitions are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that, based on disability, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with disabilities to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section does not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;9.131 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Direct threat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) This part does not require the agency to permit an individual to participate in, or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that agency when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) ``Direct threat'' means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the agency must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;&sect;9.132_9.139 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;9.140 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 (subpart G), shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;&sect;9.141_9.148 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;9.149 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Program accessibility: discrimination prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as otherwise provided in &sect;9.150, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;9.150 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Program accessibility: existing facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This section does not_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the case of historic properties, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with &sect;9.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in making alterations to existing buildings, also shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

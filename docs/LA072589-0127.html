			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH, 16, TO BE TRIED AS ADULT IN SLAYING  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Huntington Beach youth who told police that he killed his  roommate after being forced into a homosexual relationship was ordered Monday  to stand trial as an adult.  </P> <P> Brian Applegate, who admits that he fatally shot his roommate, Paul Londono,  25, and then burned his body near the beach, could face a prison sentence of 27  years to life if convicted.  </P> <P> But Applegate's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Carol E. Lavacot, contends that  Applegate himself is the victim in this case, adding that she hopes his trial  will result, at most, in commitment to the California Youth Authority.  </P> <P> Lavacot contends that Applegate shot Londono only after Londono raped him and  threatened to never let him go.  </P> <P> "Before Brian got the gun, he sat down and thought, 'Is it going to have to be  this way the rest of my life?' " Lavacot said.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jill W. Roberts said Lavacot still refers to Applegate  as a child. Roberts echoed Superior Court Judge Betty Lou Lamoreaux's statement  Monday when she ordered Applegate tried as an adult: "He is not a child  anymore."  </P> <P> State law requires that a 16-year-old be tried as an adult if the crime is  serious, shows sophistication and planning, and if the defendant has a history  of other juvenile cases.  </P> <P> "His crimes steadily became more sophisticated until it came to this," Roberts  said.  </P> <P> But at Applegate's trial, Lavacot intends to lay the blame for what happened on  Londono.  </P> <P> Applegate met Londono in Florida when he was a bus boy at a gay bar where  Londono was a bartender. Both the prosecution and the defense agree that the  two struck up a friendship and decided to move to California together in June,  1988. But it meant that Applegate would be violating his probation. He had been  arrested and placed on probation for the burglary of two neighbors' houses and  an auto theft.  </P> <P> The two moved to Huntington Beach, appearing to the outside world as brothers:  Londono was Christopher Stiles; Applegate was Sean Stiles.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Roberts claims that the trouble began when Applegate was arrested in  Orange County on suspicion of burglary. Londono told his family that he could  not put up with his young roommate's behavior and wanted him to move out.  </P> <P> But Public Defender Lavacot claims that just the opposite was true: Applegate  wanted out because Londono had coerced him into a homosexual relationship  against Applegate's will.  </P> <P> "He told Brian if he didn't cooperate, he would end up in prison back in  Florida (as a probation violator), and that what happened to him there would be  even worse," Lavacot said.  </P> <P> On Jan. 8, 1989, Londono told one of his relatives that Applegate still had not  moved out and that this was the night that they were going to have a serious  talk about it.  </P> <P> But Applegate claims that Londono was only covering up and trying to hide the  homosexual acts from his family. Lavacot claims that Applegate was the one who  wanted to move out. When he told Londono that night that he was leaving on Feb.  1, Lavacot said, Londono raped him, then told him that forced sex would hurt  even worse in prison.  </P> <P> Applegate reportedly waited between 30 minutes to an hour and a half before  getting a gun and shooting Lavacot in the head while he slept. Lavacot said she  believes that Applegate was still in a "heat of passion" state and should  receive no more than a voluntary manslaughter conviction.  </P> <P> But prosecutor Roberts alleges that Applegate's actions after the shooting are  inconsistent with Lavacot's version. Roberts alleges that Applegate burned the  body on a bike path near the beach in Huntington Beach, stopping at a service  station first to buy gasoline to set the body on fire. Then he told the slain  man's family that Londono had received a call from someone with whom he ran  off.  </P> <P> The body went unidentified for two months. It was when a new roommate began to  think that something was wrong that he entered Applegate's room and discovered  blood on his mattress. Applegate had brought the mattress with him from the  house he shared with Londono. It was the one Londono was sleeping on when shot.  </P> <P> Investigators also said Applegate had stolen Londono's car and sold it, and  wrote $840 in forged checks from Londono's bank account.  </P> <P> "It appears there was some kind of sexual relationship between the two," said  prosecutor Roberts. "But this was a case of cold-blooded, premeditated murder."  </P> <P> Applegate first denied the incident, then confessed after the body was  identified as Londono's and autopsy reports showed that he had died of a  gunshot wound.  </P> <P> Even if tried as an adult and convicted, Applegate could get a break on  sentencing if the court hears the complete story, Lavacot said. A judge would  have the option to send Applegate to the Youth Authority, where he could remain  until he is 25.  </P> <P> "If he goes to prison, he's not going to get any help," Lavacot said. "I don't  think that's where he belongs."  </P></p>

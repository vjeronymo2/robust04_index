			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasan Abu-Zayid from Gaza Eretz checkpoint; from </F> the "With the Midday Events" program]    [Text] The meeting Dr. Nabil Sha'th held with Major General  Dani Rothschild, coordinator of the Defense Ministry activities  in the territories, ended a short while ago. This meeting paves  the way for the resumption of talks between the Israeli and  Palestinian delegations on the implementation of self-rule in  the rest of the West Bank. The most important topics discussed  by the two were the release of Palestinian prisoners, the border  crossing points, and the presence of Palestinian police at them.  Dr. Nabil Sha'th spoke to us a short while ago:    [Begin Sha'th recording] I believe such meetings are very  useful to declare and actually draw up plans for the next phase  of negotiations on Palestinian authority in the West Bank. This  required a comprehensive assessment of what was implemented thus  far. This basically included the problem of prisoners and those  released -- a problem which is of concern to every Palestinian  citizen. We also discussed the problem of the implementation of  security, secure passage, border posts, international presence,  and a quadruple committee meeting to discuss the problem of  refugees. All these issues were discussed, in addition to an  assessment of the economic situation, Palestinian labor force in  Israel, and the easing of restrictions on Gaza and other  Palestinian areas. We made a comprehensive assessment. Some  solutions and the role of the security coordination committee  and the civil coordination committee in solving these problems  were discussed.    Regarding the negotiations, I cannot talk about any details  because we have actually agreed to several points. We have to  refer to President 'Arafat before any of them can be publicized.  We have also agreed to prepare for President 'Arafat's meeting  with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in  Paris on 7 July. Consequently, the beginning of negotiations  and formation of committees and the Palestinian-Israeli summit  were the subject of our planning. I will be satisfied with this  because I cannot answer questions on the venue, time, and  details because these all first require the approval of  President 'Arafat. Naturally, General Rothschild will also  consult with his leadership for the same reason. I think the  meeting was positive and I hope it will herald the start of a  new stage in the peace process. [end recording]    Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild said after the meeting that the  Israeli and Palestinian sides will prepare for a meeting between  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  on the one hand, and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 7 July on the  other. The start of negotiations between Israel and the  Palestinians on the implementation of self-rule in the rest of  the West Bank will then be announced.</p>

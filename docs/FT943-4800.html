			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Personal View: Ulster - not an issue for compromise Peace is preferable to war, and persuasion is preferable to force. Those are truisms which politicians need to respect - as much as, or more than, anyone else. But those who voice doubts about so-called progress (progress to what?) being made as a result of the IRA ceasefire are not breaking that rule. They have solid reasons for their scepticism. The beginning of wisdom in approaching Northern Ireland is to clear the mind of everything conjured up by the term 'sectarian'. If terminology there must be, it is not Catholics who are confronting Protestants - on that basis one could make no sense of the voting pattern at elections - but Irish nationalists confronting unionists. It is nationality, not race, not religion, which is at stake. On the issue of nationhood - that is, the question by whom are we to be governed - there cannot be peace through compromise or negotiation, and in Northern Ireland that is the great paramount issue. The British parliament ruled Ireland - or, what comes to the same thing, Ireland was ruled under the British parliament - from long before the parliamentary union of 1800 seated Irish representatives at Westminster. At the general election of 1918 the inhabitants of the north east of Ireland continued to send representatives to parliament, while the inhabitants of the rest of the island refused. The south voted itself out. Just as surely, the so-called north, meaning the six counties of Ulster, voted to stay in. That determination has not changed on either side since then. Listen to Gerry Adams, and you hear that. Look at the voting at general elections in Ulster, and you see that. The dispute is about nationality - about whom we are to be governed by. That is why it can only be ended if one side or the other is set upon giving way. The impression that there has been a deal done in secret which has not yet been revealed is thoroughly logical. The unionist people of Ulster are not fools. They know that what is at issue is an absolute, and they treat those, from the prime minister downwards, who talk about talks, about political progress, and about compromise and concession, as necessarily dishonest. Short of inventing a method whereby 'a man can serve two masters' there can be no peace in Northern Ireland so long as the right of the majority to their nationality is open to question. All down the years the perception that the British government really wanted rid of Northern Ireland has caused, maintained and fuelled violence. The Irish nationalists are not fools any more than the unionists. They know that the ballot'box will not put them into the nation to which they claim to belong. Ergo alternative methods must be used to bring the desired result about. The true disturber of the peace in Northern Ireland is the stance of British governments which have continually behaved as if they wished Ulster out of the UK. The Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 was a prime example. Under it, Britain agreed to govern Northern Ireland only in combination with the Irish Republic. Certitude as to the future is the precondition of peaceable living in Northern Ireland. The superficially hard-faced reassertion, in practical terms, that Northern Ireland belongs for good and all to the UK is the sole condition on which tranquility will return. In the end it may be hard to foresee the UK formally withdrawing from the citizens of the north east of Ireland the right they have possessed from time immemorial to be governed within the UK. The day is long past for looking for a wheeze to disguise or to deny that right. That way lies more bloodshed and not less. The author, a Conservative cabinet minister in the 1960s, was Ulster Unionist MP for South Down for 13 years until 1987</p>

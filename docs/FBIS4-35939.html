			<p>BFN     [Text] The shaykhs, notables, and sons of the Ba Kazm tribe  in the Districts of al-Mahfid and Ahwar in the Abyan Governorate  have issued a statement denying the reports issued by the  secessionist remnants over their media organs regarding alleged  and baseless support by their tribe. The statement said that  the shaykhs and notables of the Ba Kazm tribe, who played an  honorable role in resisting colonial rule and evil powers over  the past 25-year rule of the secessionist gang, declare their  adherence to unity and constitutional legitimacy. This  reflects, the statement added, the principled positions they  have announced in early 1991, when they met with brother  President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. During that  meeting, the statement noted, they pledged to support and defend  unity.    The statement added that the treasonous, agent, and  secessionist gang within the Yemeni Socialist Party and its  allied hirelings, feeling that they are now in their death  throes, are fabricating alleged and baseless cables of  congratulations to deceive the public opinion through cheap  tactics. They have used the name of the Ba Kazm tribe, given  its profound influence and role, in an attempt to influence the  positions of other tribes, forgetting that unity and Yemen are  dearer and more chaste than all filthy money.    The Ba Kazm notables concluded their statement by extending  their greetings, appreciation, and absolute allegiance to the  symbol struggler Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and expressing  support for constitutional legitimacy, the leadership, and the  governorate represented by Abyan Governor struggler 'Ali Shaykh  'Umar, and the forces vindicating legitimacy and unity.    God is great. Victory and pride to unity, constitutional  legitimacy, and Yemen.</p>

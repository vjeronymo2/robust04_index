			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Claude Imbert: "Fear"] </F>   [Excerpt] Can anyone really understand what the  establishment of a theocratic republic in Algiers would mean?  The flight in the direction of France of the Algerian elite  (which has already started). The reinforcement of fundamentalist  networks in France ensured of logistical support from Algiers.  The multiplication of Syrian, Libyan, Iranian threat, that is,  of state terrorism. It is not our pathetic return to Tehran of  two Iranians claimed in vain by Swiss justice that will reassure  us. Because, faced with terrorism, democracies, too, are afraid.    I lack the means or the intention to discuss the validity of  a "reason of state" that freed the culprits. On the other hand,  what is certain is that continuing to slide on this slope leads  to an abyss. One would like that another "reason of state" deal  with the real means to "terrorize the terrorists." Against a  secret and pitiless war, democracies must endow themselves with  the means of a secret and pitiless war. And one should not do  like the ostrich when faced with the threat, but find the  political will to resist. No little Munichs of the mind should  be allowed. Nowadays, there is no worse misfortune, in politics,  than the decline of courage. We have enough cunning to sell  some. But what about courage? [passage omitted]</p>

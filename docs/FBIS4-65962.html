			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tommy Oberg: "Labor Federation Will Probably </F> Take Neutral Stand on European Union"]    [Text] The No to the European Union (EU) organization got  its first major union profile yesterday. Kenth Pettersson,  chairman of the Commercial Employees' Union, is firmly opposed  to Swedish membership in the EU.    "I have not decided to take part in the campaign work. But  it  may be necessary to counteract the affirmative union figures who  travel around the country on propaganda tours," he told SD  [SVENSKA DAGBLADET].  <H5>  Concerned About Statements </H5>   Anders Lindstrom, chairman of the Seamen's Union, and Sune  Ekbage, chairman of the Papermill Workers' Union, have been on  the side of the proponents for some time, and the day before  yesterday they were joined by Goran Johnsson, chairman of the  Metalworkers' Union.    "It concerns me that Bertil Jonsson, the chairman of the LO  [Federation of Trade Unions], is also so outspoken in advocating  Swedish membership. There has been no decision within the LO on  what stand the federation will take, but in spite of this our  chairman is working hard for a yes vote in the popular  referendum," Pettersson criticized.    Therefore when the LO executive committee met on Monday [11  April], Pettersson requested a discussion of the chairman's  conduct with regard to the referendum before the organization  had reached any decision.    "I think Jonsson should act as Stig Malm did when he was  chairman. He did not become involved on either the yes or the no  side," Pettersson said.  <H5>  Commercial Union Neutral </H5>   However the executive committee of the Commercial Employees'  Union did not decide to oppose membership in spite of having 11  opponents and only two proponents on the committee. It decided  that the union should remain neutral on the referendum and leave  members free to make up their minds individually.    "The question of membership is so complex and complicated  that the union aspects represent only part of membership,"  Pettersson said and went on:    "The direction of economic policy, foreign policy and  military cooperation, and a monetary union are all questions  that everyone must take a stand on. And the leaders of the  Commercial Employees' Union are no better qualified than anyone  else to analyze and evaluate these questions."    For LO the message is that the split on the EU issue within  the federation, which was already great, has widened even more.  Therefore everything currently points to an LO decision to  remain neutral on the referendum.  <H5>  Hotel Workers' Union Opposed </H5>   On the yes side today are the Metalworkers' Union and the  Papermill Workers' Union. Within a short time they will probably  be joined by some more union organizations with industrial ties.  The Industrial Workers' Union and the Woodworkers' Union are the  ones closest to the yes line.    But they are more than outweighed by the no side. The Hotel  and Restaurant Workers' Union and the Insurance Employees'  Unions are already there.    An extensive deliberation is taking place within the  Transport Workers' Union, but the final result is expected to be  opposition to Swedish EU membership.    The Construction Workers' Union will respond after they hold  their congress in August, and the Public Employees' Union will  take a stand in the late fall after a deliberation.    LO's biggest union, Municipal Employees, is currently  leaning  toward following the example of the Commercial Employees' Union  and not taking a stand at all but leaving it up to the members  without making a central recommendation.  <H5>  Rejection Demanded </H5>   Motions to be considered at the union congress in June call  for the union to reject Swedish EU membership.    The union's executive committee has not yet responded to the  motions.    The Graphic Arts Employees' Union has already decided not to  take a central stand. The union contains both high-profile  advocates and opponents of EU membership.    Thus it is virtually impossible for the LO leadership, which  publicly applauded the negotiating results between Sweden and  the EU, especially the future status of collective agreements,  to bring the widely separated opinions together to form a  consensus opinion.    But the LO is not the only organization that will probably  keep quiet in the EU referendum. TCO [Central Organization of  Salaried Employees] and SACO [Swedish Confederation of  Professional Associations] also have no plans to reach a  decision or issue recommendations on how their members should  vote on the membership question.    Thus the central union organizations will not advocate  Swedish EU membership prior to the referendum.    Individual unions can play that role. But judging from the  Metalworkers' Union's affirmation of EU membership, the campaign  will be low-key and defensive.  <H5>  Discussion Urged </H5>   The decision by the executive committee of the Metalworkers'  Union does not mean a recommendation to its members to vote yes,  despite the committee's approval.    Instead the members are urged to discuss the issue in depth  and study the union leadership's opinions and the reasons behind  them.    The industrial workers' labor colleague, SIF [Swedish Union  of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry], has already  decided not to issue any central recommendations on how its  members should vote.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Final installment of a two-part "exclusive" interview with </F> Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, head of the Majles Research Center;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [RESALAT] The United States and Israel pursued  specific objectives in the Gaza-Jericho accord. Among the most  important of these objectives was extinguishing the struggle  against the occupiers of Jerusalem and fomenting a conflict  among the Palestinian groups.    During the period since 'Arafat's agreement with the  Zionists, have they been able to approach their objective?    [Larijani] The United States and Israel expected that most  of  the Palestinians would accept the Gaza-Jericho accord. They  claimed that 65 percent of the Palestinians would accept this  accord. What Israel truly wanted was to hand over a small piece  of populous land like Gaza or Jericho in exchange for the  disappearance of the intifadah. It also wanted the doors of the  world of Islam to be opened so that it could enter this world.  Of course, the oppressed Palestinian people displayed very  sharp political instincts during this phase.    No matter how I examine this issue, I think that the first  phase of the plan has been a complete failure because the  intifadah is intensifying. The Israelis are saying that  elections will take place if the intifadah ends but that Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] cannot gain the majority of votes!  Therefore, the Israelis have reached an interesting impasse  that has revealed many things. They came forward in the name of  democracy. But because it was possible that 'Arafat would not  gain any votes, they decided it would be advisable to put an end  to democracy and to select a group of people to manage the area  themselves!    I think that the failure of these two phases is very  substantial, and, God willing, other defeats will come. There  was a time when Israel only faced the armies of Arab countries.  Today it is facing an extremely strong and growing body--the  body formed by awakened Muslims. This body is much stronger and  more dangerous than the armies and their weapons. For example,  once Israel became friends with the Egyptian Government, the  Egyptian Army was no longer considered a threat to Israel.  Israel has not been able to ignore the people and the Muslim  masses that have started to advance, however. Therefore, there  is an immense Islamic movement facing Israel today, and this is  much worse for it than an army.    Israel insists that, along with the compromise plan, the  doors of the world of Islam must be opened upon it. It believes  that if these doors are not opened now, it will be more  difficult to do so in the future. This is also proof that the  Islamic movement is advancing. God willing, this Islamic  movement will become established in the world of Islam, and it  will save the world of Islam from Israeli domination and plots.    [RESALAT] Can the contrariness that has emerged in Islamic  and Western cultures be resolved? Some people might think that  we can work together on common points. Is this contrariness  such that they can justify this way of thinking?    [Larijani] The correct word here is not contrariness or  equivocation. The Westerners influence the world of Islam and  want to expand and maintain this influence. Therefore, they  have started an onslaught against our wealth, our independence,  and our culture. But the world of Islam is resisting. This  onslaught is aimed at gaining influence over the world of Islam.  Its history can be traced. Over the past century, the West has  been able to split the world of Islam into small pieces, plunder  Islamic resources, and place its own men in power in many key  parts of the world. In other words, their political influence  and economic plundering have very extensive cultural aspects.  And it is against this Western onslaught that the world of  Islam is defending itself. [passage omitted]    The reason why Iran is a target of this onslaught is because  we have hoisted the banner of confrontation. Fortunately, this  banner is now in the hands of all Muslims and will be handed to  the next generation. [passage omitted]    [RESALAT] France's decision to grant refuge to a number of  terrorists has enraged the people of Iran. What steps does the  Majles intend to take to confront this act by France?    [Larijani] Of course, I did not want the West and France to  act differently toward the world of Islam, but we do not fear  anyone when it comes to safeguarding our interests and our  security. Fortunately, our country is an extremely strong and  stable country. There are not many countries in the region that  enjoy the power and stability that we do.    I believe that the world cannot advance on the basis of the  hostilities that the Westerners are creating today and on the  basis of their overt intervention, lies, and duplicities. They  have seen that we are serious about confronting terrorism, and  yet their countries are the hearths of terrorism! They say that  insulting a prostitute is tantamount to a violation of human  rights, but they are prepared to place thousands in front of  their own firing squads! I think that this era is ending,  however.    As far as establishing relations with the world is  concerned,  we should keep two points in mind. The first is that we should  get to know ourselves--get to know what we have to say and where  we are going. The second is that we should be able to stand on  our own two feet. If the esteemed leader emphasizes the need  for self-sufficiency and for standing on our own two feet, it is  because we must be able to express ourselves in the best  possible way to continue living in this world and to be able to  say what we have to say to the world. This is the only way our  relations with the world can have a completely logical basis.  Of course, these principles are more or less observed today,  and I think that the West should not expect to have logical  relations with us by imposing things on us. All the governments  that tried to do so have failed. Experience has shown that  cooperation with Iran can only be on the basis of mutual respect  and reciprocal interests.    [RESALAT] How real do you consider the differences between  Europe and the United States to be? What is our opinion of this?    [Larijani] Of course, this difference is deep-rooted, and it  is still the beginning. The root of the differences between the  two is economic rivalry. [passage omitted]    I think that the smaller the power monopoly in the world,  the  better it is for us. In other words, we can live in a world  with a great deal of competition instead of a world divided into  competitive blocs. [passage omitted]    [RESALAT] In the new world order, the United States has made  great efforts to impose itself as the sole superpower in the  world. However, it has been unable to do so, and the weaknesses  in Clinton's personality, as well as the extensive criticisms  against U.S. foreign policy, are good examples of this failure.  What is your opinion?    [Larijani] What can be said to have definitely ended are the  claims of world leadership by the United States. In other  words, the world is not ready for a country like the United  States to say that it is the leader of the world, nor is it  ready to see the establishment of an exclusive club for world  leadership. [passage omitted]    The West wants to transform the United Nations into a  headquarters for world leadership. But the philosophy behind  the formation of the United Nations was that it should be a  forum for discussions among nations and not the headquarters of  a world leadership. When they say that the United Nations  should be decisive, have an army, safeguard peace,  and--according to themselves--prevent any threats to peace,  these are all incorrect charts of the course that the United  Nations should take.    I think that the United Nations is extremely decisive and  that this is sufficient. It should let the people of the world  defend themselves. We should not expect the United Nations to  send forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Nations has tied  the hands of the Muslims there. I think that there should be  some changes in the United Nations. We should support a  decrease in the power of the Security Council and efforts to  transform the United Nations into a forum where more discussions  and debates take place. We should not expect the United Nations  to act. We should ask all those who say that the United Nations  should have the power to act: Under whose leadership? Where  should it receive its orders from? They say: We will form a  world rule for you. But world rule will be established when the  imam of the ages reappears, God willing.    As for whether those who have strength should once again  rule, I believe that in our strategy at the United Nations and  in the Third World, we should support the idea of extracting the  extra teeth of the United Nations because these teeth have  always been beneficial for the hegemonists. Therefore, in this  new phase a type of joint leadership for the world is a theory  on which they are working and for this reason Japan and Germany  too want to enter the Security Council. In other words, if one  day the Americans opposed this idea, today they are insisting on  it. Therefore, today they have descended one step from their  previous position. But, God willing, their new theory too will  soon be defeated and the human race will see better days.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Criticism is being voiced in the territories over  the PLO's decision to conduct negotiations with Israeli  representatives in Tunis. The Palestinian opponents of the  peace process call the decision a capitulation on the part of  the PLO. Statements by PLO activists in support of the process  have barely been heard. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin recording] [Amir] Notables in the territories have  criticized the resumption of the negotiations between the PLO  and Israel. The Security Council resolution disappointed many  people in the territories who hoped for greater UN support for  the Palestinian cause in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Dr.  Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is identified with Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and returned to the territories following  deportation to Lebanon, said that the current resumption of the  talks signifies another PLO capitulation to Israel and will  seriously undermine the scant level of support 'Arafat still  enjoys in the territories.    [Al-Zahhar, in English] The people's reaction now very  simply is that is a new giving up or renounce from the PLO for  the benefit of Israel and at the expense of the Palestinian  side. So I think this will cancel the rest of the popular  support for 'Arafat in particular.    [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues]  Palestinian notables from Hebron also criticized the decision to  hold talks between Palestinian and Israeli officials in Tunis  today while Hebron residents remain under curfew and a closure  is still in force in the territories. Palestinians rioted in  the territories over the weekend in protest against the closure,  the Hebron massacre, and subsequent incidents. Palestinian  sources reported that at least 45 people were injured by IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in the Gaza Strip and the West  Bank. [end recording]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 20 March  carries  a related report with recorded remarks by Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar  in English. Commenting on the results of the peace talks  between Israel and the PLO so far, Dr. al-Zahhar says: "This  policy is actually practiced with the PLO and the end result was  a big zero." Dr. al-Zahhar adds: "I think this failure is  temporary because of the marked pressure created by the people  as a result of the massacre in Hebron's al-Ibrahami mosque.  Sooner or later, they are going to implement autonomy." When  asked about the possibility of a mass terrorist attack by  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the Hamas' military arm, Dr. al-Zahhar  says: "Nobody can actually tell what is going to happen,  because you know, this is a very secret organization. Nobody  actually understands their attitude at this moment. They are a  very secret organization and have no relation to the well-known  people."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Spring waterlogging has emerged in our province.  The temperature in March was fairly low, thus causing a delay  in the wheat sowing period. According to data provided by  meteorological departments, precipitation in our province last  autumn and winter was greater than the average by 20 percent.  In March this year, snowfall was 78 percent greater than the  same period of previous years, thus making 28 counties and  cities across the province suffer from varying degrees of spring  waterlogging. The afflicted areas are estimated at 10 million  mu, 5 million mu of which are areas for sowing wheat, which  accounts for one-fourth of the total wheat sowing area. In  addition, our province experienced low temperatures in March.  No warm temperatures were seen before 26 March. By 27 March,  which should be the upsurge period for wheat sowing in normal  years, only a small number of counties and cities across the  province had begun to tentively plant wheat.    Based on the information provided by the provincial  agricultural departments, as of 4 April, less than 1 million mu  of wheat had been planted, only accounting for one-twentieth of  the planned sowing acreage. However, during the same period of  last year, more than 3 million mu of wheat were planted across  the province. The province's wheat sowing period has been  delayed by 7 to 10 days, compared with normal years. The delay  in the wheat sowing period will prevent us from guaranteeing a  bumper harvest in some areas and will make us rush to plant  other field crops.    In this connection, the provincial agricultural committee  has  issued a circular calling for concentrated planting of wheat on  a crash basis. Specialists have proposed efforts be made to  adopt measures to drain excess water to stop spring waterlogging.</p>

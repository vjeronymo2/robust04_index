			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Correctly Grasp the Signal of </F> Grain and Edible Oil Prices"]    [Text] Given that soaring grain and edible oil prices in  some parts of southern China have affected the country's grain  and oil market, the state is taking swift measures to keep grain  and oil prices down. With various measures gradually put in  place, grain and oil prices have started to stabilize and will  drop to the previous level. Agricultural workers and the vast  numbers of peasants should have a sober understanding of this.    The current fluctuation in grain and oil prices is abnormal,  with some temporary, psychological, and speculative factors  playing a promoting role. In spite of this, it has also sounded  the alarm to people: We must not lower our guard on the grain  issue and on no account should we relax grain production.    Taken as a whole, the current price of grain purchased  according to contract or at a negotiated price is still on the  low side. To a certain extent this has affected the enthusiasm  of peasants to grow grain and sell it to the state. If we have  grain in our hand, we will not be in a commotion. Only when the  state has ample grain reserves in its grain depots can it  allocate and transfer grain as necessary and keep grain prices  at an appropriate level. The grain in state grain depots is  purchased from the peasants according to contract or at  negotiated prices. Only when the prices are right will the  peasants enthusiastically sell grain to the state and only thus  can the state grain depots be stocked with ample grain.  Therefore, appropriately raising grain purchasing prices is  something that should not be overlooked. The state is gradually  solving this issue.    The need to attach great importance to grain production is a  fundamental issue. Although the psychological factor  contributes considerably to the rocketing grain and oil prices  in some parts of southern China, grain is still relatively  insufficient in specific places. This tells us that grain is a  special commodity indispensable to all people in their daily  life. There should be an ample supply of grain at any time, and  this should be based on a bumper harvest with increased output.  For this reason, it is necessary to maintain certain grain  acreage and ensure a stable increase in grain output; increase  input in grain production, improve grain-growing conditions, and  raise per-unit yield; and pay attention to adjusting the grain  products structure and improving grain quality so as to meet  people's gradually increasing needs in material life.    It should be mentioned that some localities have blindly  opened development zones. In doing so they have used many grain  fields and caused a reduced grain output this year. As there is  less grain, prices naturally rise. As a result, they have to  buy grain in other places and are very worried. This is a  lesson worth learning. In opening up development zones we must  make overall plans, take all factors into consideration, and  ensure that grain acreage will not be reduced. In such a big  country with a large population like ours, this should be taken  as a principle.    The fluctuation in grain and oil prices is a signal we must  correctly grasp. Seeing that grain prices are rocketing, some  peasants become more enthusiastic to grow grain. This is beyond  reproach. However, we should also stress quality. That is to  say, we should grow strains that are readily marketable.  Otherwise, if the products are unmarketable, it will be a  burden. Seeing that the state is keeping down grain prices,  some other peasants are less enthusiastic to grow grain. This  is incorrect. In keeping down grain prices, the state wants to  keep them at an appropriate level. It is not aimed at keeping  them as low as possible. Rather, the state wants to keep grain  prices at a level which enables grain growers to have a  reasonable income and which the grain-consuming urban residents  can afford. We should unswervingly attach importance to grain  production and strive to gain a bumper harvest with increased  grain output.</p>

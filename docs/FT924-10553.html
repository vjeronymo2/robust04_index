			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Rhone-Poulenc sale may raise FFr3bn THE French government will sell at least 10.6 per cent of the capital in Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, in the latest in a series of partial privatisations. The sale, expected before the end of the year, will raise an estimated FFr3bn (Pounds 350m) to FFr4bn, depending on the price of Rhone-Poulenc's listed certificates of investment (CIs) - a kind of non-voting share. The cash will be used to create jobs and to fund other public sector companies, as in the FFr11bn worth of French public sector asset sales this year. The government will allow holders of CIs and non-voting participating shares, just over a quarter of the group's issued equity, to convert their paper into ordinary voting shares at no charge, so Rhone-Poulenc will end up with a single class of ordinary shares, instead of a complicated mixture of three kinds of voting and non-voting stock. The sell-off will reduce the government's direct ownership stake from 56.9 per cent, at which level it holds 77.5 per cent of the voting rights, to around 45 per cent, said the finance ministry. However, the public sector will continue to hold majority control because of the 20.8 per cent of the group owned by Credit Lyonnais and AGF, the state-owned bank and insurance company. The final breakdown depends on how many holders of warrants exercise their rights to buy shares. Like other state-owned companies in the recent round of partial privatisations, Rhone-Poulenc will raise no cash for its own needs. The announcement follows a 22 per cent rise in first-half operating income. However, the company has since warned that third-quarter growth slowed to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. Most earnings growth over the past 18 months came from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer of the US. Yesterday's move could pave the way for a more ambitious privatisation issue from Rhone-Poulenc, which needs fresh capital to run down debts built up to finance diversification into pharmaceuticals, said analysts. Net borrowings are due to fall from FFr33.1bn - 80 per cent of shareholders' funds - at the end of last year to FFr32bn by the end of 1992. Alternatively it could sell its stake in Roussel-Uclaf, possibly to Hoechst of Germany, which already owns a minority holding. Lex, Page 22; Grip relaxes, Page 3</p>

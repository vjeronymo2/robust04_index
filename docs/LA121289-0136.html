			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> IMELDA MARCOS HOLDS COURT  </P> <P> Sipping champagne, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos held court in a  San Jose restaurant, three months before her U.S. District Court trial on  charges that she fraudulently bought U.S. properties with funds plundered from  the Philippine treasury.  </P> <P> The Monday night affair was reportedly her first public appearance since the  Sept. 28 death of her husband in Honolulu.  </P> <P> In a restaurant owned by her former palace caterer, Del Garcia, the former  First Lady, still dressed in black and surrounded by hundreds of admirers,  dined on Swedish meatballs and fancy vegetables at a hastily arranged  testimonial.  </P> <P> Marcos, 60, flew into San Francisco last weekend for a holiday visit with her  daughters, Irene and Amy, both of whom live in the city with their families.  </P> <P> After the dinner, she entertained guests with two traditional Philippine love  songs, accompanied by a cassette tape. At her side was her son, Ferdinand Jr.,  known as Bong-Bong, who did a rendition of "Misty." His supporters hope he will  assume the Philippine presidency someday in Malacanang Palace.  </P></p>

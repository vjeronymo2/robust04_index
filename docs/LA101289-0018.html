			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA CRONY JAILED IN PROBE OF STEROID LAB  </P> <P> A man who said he was a business associate of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel  Antonio Noriega was charged with tax fraud Wednesday for running a Tijuana  laboratory that allegedly produced millions of dollars worth of illegal  steroids.  </P> <P> Noriega is believed to be the main owner of Laboratorios Milano and could be  prosecuted in the United States on charges related to the production of the  illegal body-building drugs, a U. S. prosecutor said.  </P> <P> Juan Javier Macklis, president and general manager of the laboratory, was held  at a Mexico City prison after his arrest by Mexican police Monday at the Mexico  City airport, officials at the attorney general's office told Reuters.  </P> <P> Macklis, 52, was charged with evading more than $600,000 in taxes and may face  additional charges in connection with the laboratory, they said.  </P> <P> Macklis told authorities he met the Panamanian military chief two years ago and  said Noriega's profits from the steroid lab totaled $5 million, press reports  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> His arrest followed an extended investigation by Mexican authorities and  several other arrests, including that of Macklis' son, during a raid on the  laboratory in April.  </P> <P> According to U.S. court documents, a wide range of steroids were manufactured  at the laboratory, and phony labels were pasted on the bottles to make them  appear to be the product of legitimate U.S. and European manufacturers.  </P> <P> The steroids were then smuggled into the United States for sale and reportedly  reaped millions of dollars in illegal profits.  </P> <P> Noriega invested $800,000 in the company in 1988, Macklis was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> Noriega, who survived a bloody coup in Panama City Oct. 3, is already wanted in  the United States on drug-trafficking charges.  </P></p>

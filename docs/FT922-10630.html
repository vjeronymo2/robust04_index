			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Vauxhall best performer in UK in spite of 45% fall PRE-TAX profits of Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, fell by about 45 per cent last year under the impact of the deep recession in the UK new car market. The company is expected to reveal today pre-tax profits for 1991 of about Pounds 133m, against Pounds 239.1m in 1990. Despite the profit decline, the company achieved the strongest financial performance of any UK car maker last year. Ford of Britain, the market leader, suffered a record loss in 1991 of Pounds 470m on ordinary activities excluding Jaguar, while Rover fell to pre-tax losses of Pounds 83m. Vauxhall, which is in second place in the UK new car market after overtaking Rover in 1989, suffered a fall in market share last year to 15.6 per cent (16.1 per cent). Its sales fell by 23 per cent - against a decline in the overall market of 20.7 per cent - to 248,704 (323,054). In the first quarter of this year Vauxhall increased its UK new car market share from 17.2 per cent to 18 per cent. Group Lotus, the specialist UK sports car maker and automotive engineering group which is owned by GM, has disclosed pre-tax losses for 1990 of Pounds 12.7m, compared with losses of Pounds 4.4m a year earlier. GM has been forced to pump new capital into Group Lotus, where pre-tax losses have grown rapidly from Pounds 2.1m in 1988. According to the Group Lotus 1990 accounts filed at Companies House, GM injected Pounds 13m of additional finance in 1991, some Pounds 6.5m in equity and the remainder as loans. Group Lotus turnover in 1990 amounted to Pounds 74.8m (Pounds 63.1m). The company has suffered heavy losses as it expanded rapidly for the launch of the new Elan sports car range in 1990. It then had to contract sharply in the face of recession and the failure of the Elan to meet expected sales targets. Group Lotus has not yet disclosed its results for 1991.</p>

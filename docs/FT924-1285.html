			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC sets banana quota and tariffs EUROPEAN COMMUNITY farm ministers agreed yesterday to set tariffs on banana imports from Latin America, with a fixed 2m tonnes quota at a reduced duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 79.50), and a hefty Ecu850 tariff - about 170 per cent - on imports above that level. Ministers said the deal should remove one more contentious item from the Uruguay Round world trade reform talks going on at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, because the EC has moved from protecting its market through quotas to tariffs, which can gradually be reduced. But a lawyer acting for Latin American producers said he was 'shocked and angry' at this 'worst possible disaster', and predicted the deal would be challenged both in the European Court of Justice and within the Gatt. The agreement is supposed to reconcile until now conflicting goals. The EC was forced to act to complete the single market, by attempting to unify disparate banana regimes across Europe. Yesterday's agreement will come into effect next July, six months after the single internal market starts up - if there are no legal challenges. But the EC also has to honour treaty commitments to predominantly Caribbean and African producers linked to it through the Lome convention. Lome has a protocol saying the EC will not place its banana producers 'in a less favourable situation than in the past or the present'. The Lome countries, like Euro-banana suppliers from EC outlying territories in Martinique and the Canary Islands, produce at near double the cost of Latin American, 'dollar zone' banana producers. The former two groups share two fifths of the 3.4m tonnes a year EC market, but 'dollar' bananas already have 60 per cent and with their lower costs could fast extend market share in a free-for-all. The Caribbean producers, which earn up to three quarters of their hard currency from bananas, would be wiped out in an open market and their lobbyists have warned that they would become easy prey to drugs traffickers using the eastern seaboard into the US. Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister and current chairman of the EC farm council, said yesterday that Caribbean and Lome producers 'will be absolutely amazed at the excellence of this deal'. In addition to the high tariff above the 2m tonne quota, the agreement would distribute licences to sell about a third of the dollar fruit to traditional importers of Lome and Euro bananas, enabling them to cross-subsidise their own operations. 'This is taking away the right to import from the Latin Americans and giving it to the Lome traders,' a spokesman for a dollar banana producer said. Germany, along with Denmark and the Benelux countries, had been expected to resist the plan. They consume cheaper and bigger dollar bananas and operate more open markets for the fruit. Germany, in addition, has its own banana protocol in the Treaty of Rome, guaranteeing unimpeded access to the fruit. Bonn yesterday affixed a reserve to the deal, but cannot block it, unless, as one lawyer suggested, it invokes its banana protocol. The banana deal's passage was eased because it was put into a package of measures, which in part resembled a Christmas stocking of concessions to EC farmers protesting against Gatt and common agricultural policy price, output and export cuts. The main features of the package, likely to cost some Ecu2.5bn, were: Retention for two years of the 'switchover' mechanism, compensating farmers for currency movements, once monetary compensatory amounts are abolished with the advent of the single market on January 1. The commission, which also wanted to abolish switchover, estimates that the cost of the last six month's currency movements would be Ecu1.6bn in a full year. One senior Brussels official predicted switchover would push farm spending through its allowed ceiling in 1994. At last weekend's Edinburgh summit, France, a significant beneficiary, got a clause in to the conclusions more or less sanctioning this. More money for beef and durum wheat farmers in central and south-west France, sheep and beef farmers in Ireland and sheep farmers in the UK. A 900,000-tonne milk quota increase for Italy, provided it reduces its 2.5m tonnes illicit excess by 1.6m tonnes. Compensation to Spain for giving up protection against imports it still enjoys as a latecomer to the EC. But Portugal will retain border protection, having complained that compensation offered was insufficient. The commission had estimated the cost of buying off both sets of controls at Ecu630m. In the UK interim measures would be necessary from January 1 to ensure that the UK could continue to fulfil its Lome obligations to traditional suppliers in the Commonwealth Caribbean, Mr David Curry, junior agriculture minister, said in a parliamentary written answer yesterday. 'Under our interim measures, a DTI import licence will still be required for dollar bananas, including those in free circulation in another member state, after January 1, 1993,' he said. 'It will continue to be an offence to import dollar fruit into the UK without a licence.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary application of ASTM A&hyph;106 pressure pipes and triple certified pipes is in pressure piping systems by refineries, petrochemical plants, and chemical plants. Other applications are in power generation plants (electrical-fossil fuel or nuclear), and in some oil field uses (on shore and off shore) such as for separator lines, gathering lines, and metering runs. A minor application of this product is for use as oil and gas distribution line for commercial applications. These applications constitute the majority of the market for the subject seamless pipes. However, A&hyph;106 pipes may be used in some boiler applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of this investigation includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of this investigation. Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A&hyph;106, A&hyph;53, or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53, or API 5L application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, there are certain other ASTM specifications of pipe which, because of overlapping characteristics, could potentially be used in A&hyph;106 applications. These specifications include A&hyph;162, A&hyph;192, A&hyph;210, A&hyph;333, and A&hyph;524. When such pipes are used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application, such products are covered by the scope of this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically excluded from this investigation are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing, and oil country tubular goods except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application. Also excluded from this investigation are redraw hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. This scope description is currently under review and may be altered in the preliminary determination of the companion antidumping duty investigation of seamless pipe from Italy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Injury Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Italy is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') is required to determine whether imports of seamless pipe from Italy materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. On August 3, 1994, the ITC preliminarily determined that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from Italy of the subject merchandise (59 FR 42286, August 17, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petition in this investigation was filed by Gulf States Tubes, a division of Quanex Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Corporate History of Respondent Dalmine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to its liquidation in 1988, Finsider S.p.A. (``Finsider'') was the holding company for all state-owned steel companies in Italy. Dalmine was an operating company wholly owned by Finsider. After Finsider's liquidation, a new government-owned holding company, ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), was created. ILVA took over the former Finsider companies, among them Dalmine, which became a subsidiary of ILVA in 1989, when Finsider's shareholding in Dalmine was transferred to ILVA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between 1990 and 1993, Dalmine itself was restructured. Dalmine became a financial holding company, with industrial, trading, and service shareholdings. As part of its restructuring, Dalmine made several asset purchases, sold two of its subsidiaries to private parties, and closed several manufacturing facilities. As of December 31, 1993, the Dalmine Group consisted of a holding company (Dalmine S.p.A.), four wholly-owned, and one majority-owned, manufacturing companies, and a number of sales and service subsidiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the POI, ILVA was owned by the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (``IRI''), a holding company which was wholly-owned by the GOI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Spin-offs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its questionnaire response, Dalmine reported that between 1990 and 1991, as part of its overall restructuring process, the company sold two ``productive units'' to private buyers. According to Dalmine, these sales involved assets that do not produce the subject merchandise. Based on our analysis of Dalmine's response with respect to the productive units sold, we preliminarily determine that the amount of potentially spun-off benefits is insignificant. Therefore, we have not evaluated whether these benefits are attributable to sales of the subject merchandise for purposes of this preliminary determination.

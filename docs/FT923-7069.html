			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: TT wins Magnetic Materials JUST OVER a year after failing to gain control of Magnetic Materials Group in a hostile bid, TT Group has secured its target - this time by a recommended route. The industrial holding group's 3-for-10 share offer, with a partial cash alternative, had been accepted by the holders of 10.2 per cent of the shares yesterday; that gave control to TT, which already owned 40 per cent. Now unconditional, the offer values MMG, a USM-quoted maker of magnetic components, at Pounds 11.1m - or 60.6p a share - using TT's closing price of 202p. Last year's cash bid was worth Pounds 9.9m, but more TT shares were on offer in the 4-for-10 paper alternative. The earlier bid was blocked by a family holding of 44 per cent, headed by Mr Eduard Michaelis, the group's nonagenarian founder. Since then the board had changed entirely, the group had been rationalised, planned property sales had proved difficult to attain and the economic climate had worsened. Mr Nick Walker, finance director, said the new board felt that TT could offer additional resources to MMG. The predator's tenure of a 40 per cent stake had created uncertainty over future ownership, inhibiting efforts to develop the business independently.</p>

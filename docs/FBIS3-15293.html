The detainees are suspected of premeditated  murder.    All four are members of the Russian Party. Firearms were  discovered at their homes and workplaces, and these have been  confiscated.    Nikolay Bondarik is an advocate of Hitlerite ideas. He  stated: "The global task facing the Russian Party is to create a  single racial area from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean....  Why not set up...reservations for the Yakuts and the Uzbeks?  Likewise, a national park for Jews will be set up in  Birobidzhan, where our children will go for days out, to have a  look."    This scandalous piece of news may have a noticeable impact  on  the disposition of political forces in St. Petersburg on the eve  of the elections to its City Assembly. How will the "Great  Russia" bloc (which comprises the St. Petersburg branches of the  Russian Party, the Russian National Alliance, and the Russian  National Assembly) behave now? How will the Russian Party  itself react to what has happened? For now, its supporters  intend to picket the building of the St. Petersburg Main  Internal Affairs Administration.</p>

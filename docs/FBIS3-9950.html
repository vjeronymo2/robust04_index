Carrying out a  more diplomatic than military mission, Camilion met members of  the Brazilian civilian and military ministries in Brasilia in an  effort to improve the deteriorated relations between the two  countries.    Sources close to the minister told PAGINA/12: "The Brazilian  Government invited Camilion for a visit to try to ease the  current bad bilateral relations." But Camilion is very well  known in Brazilian political circles because under a similar  situation in 1977, when he was ambassador in Brasilia, he had to  maneuver with great skill to reduce the reciprocal tension that  was threatening to explode into open conflict.    The current situation has not reached that extreme but it is  really bad. With difficulties in the process of Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] and problems on economic matters, the  foreign policies of the two countries are going in different  directions: While Argentina is getting closer to the United  States, Brazil opens new fronts of conflicts with Washington  every day.    This is particularly true on military matters. The Brazilian  Armed Forces have expressed their anti-American position and  refused to take a step back in their independent arms race  development. The Brazilian Armed Forces have charged that the  United States is trying to go over Brazilian sovereignty in the  Amazon, and have indirectly accused several neighboring  countries -- including Argentina -- of allowing the Pentagon  military exercises and bases in their territory for that purpose.    This situation has worsened the historic military distrust  between Argentina and Brazil. Camilion is aware that the  situation now involves a triangle: In his meetings with U.S.  officials in Washington last year, Camilion was able to  personally see the concern of Bill Clinton's administration over  the future of Brazil.    This is why he said on 24 February that Argentina "will  under  no circumstance sacrifice its relations with Brazil to  strengthen its links with the United States."    Argentina and Brazil also agreed that the Argentine purchase  of U.S. Skyhawk planes is no reason for conflict. Brazilian  diplomatic sources said: "No one believes the rearming effort  is against Brazil." Camilion also publicly said: "Argentina is  not interested in creating any problems with its neighbors."    It is not easy, however, to make progress on the military  chapter of Mercosur, as was clearly established at the first  Mercosur armed forces seminar, held in Buenos Aires last year,  when due to the different positions no common agreement beyond  the formal was reached.    Camilion admitted: "Integration in that area is not so  easy." As an example, Argentina and Brazil are rivals in the  bidding for supplying 764 training airplanes to the U.S. Air  Force and Navy. Camilion said: "The two countries' airplanes  are among the best." Then in a conciliatory manner he suggested  that the two countries' military industries could reach a  cooperation agreement if one of them gets the contract. The  briefing Camilion will give President Carlos Menem today after  his return to Buenos Aires on his talks with Itamar Franco will  certainly not cover just these issues.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> PICKLER WINS POST OVER OBJECTIONS  </P> <P> Councilman Irv Pickler was elected to the ceremonial position of mayor pro tem  this week, despite objections from Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilman William D.  Ehrle.  </P> <P> Hunter nominated Ehrle for the post, noting that Pickler had served one year as  mayor pro tem in 1986 while Ehrle has never served in that capacity. Councilman  Tom Daly nominated Pickler, who was elected with votes from himself, Daly and  this year's mayor pro tem, Miriam Kaywood.  </P> <P> In Anaheim, the mayor is elected by a vote of the people rather than by a vote  of fellow City Council members, as is the case in most cities. Hunter has  already announced plans to seek reelection in 1990.  </P> <P> The council agreed to ask the city's Charter Review Committee to consider a  plan under which the mayor pro tem position would rotate automatically among  council members, thus avoiding bickering about the job.  </P></p>

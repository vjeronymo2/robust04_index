			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER RATIONING GETS LUKEWARM SUPPORT;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL: PANEL SAYS IF VOLUNTARY CONSERVATION IS SAVING ENOUGH, MAYOR'S  MANDATORY PLAN MAY NOT BE NEEDED.  </P> <P> A skeptical Los Angeles City Council committee Tuesday gave conditional  approval to Mayor Tom Bradley's plan to impose mandatory 10% water rationing  this summer, while calling for a report on the effectiveness of ongoing  voluntary conservation.  </P> <P> The Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee agreed that if a study  finds Los Angeles residents are collectively cutting water use voluntarily by  7% or more, the rationing plan would not be implemented.  </P> <P> "If Los Angeles is only 2% or 3% away from its goal, it doesn't make sense to  go to mandatory rationing at this time," said committee chairwoman Joan Milke  Flores.  </P> <P> Flores asked officials with the Department of Water and Power to prepare  statistics that would show how effective voluntary conservation efforts have  been in curbing water use. She asked that the DWP measure use in the past 12  months against usage in the comparable 12 months of 1986 -- before the current  four-year drought began.  </P> <P> DWP officials had earlier reported that overall water use was down 14% in  April, compared to the same month last year, and that 8% of that was because of  water conservation efforts. So far this month, preliminary figures show water  usage down about 9%, though officials are unsure how much of that is the result  of conservation and how much is because of changes in weather conditions.  </P> <P> The mayor has called for a mandatory 10% cut in every resident's water use from  their pre-drought consumption level in 1986. Bradley proposed the rationing  plan on May 2 in a move to deal with the four-year statewide drought and the  apparent failure of the city's water users to voluntarily curb their use by  10%.  </P> <P> The Water and Power Commission last week recommended adopting Bradley's plan,  under which residents and businesses would face stiff financial penalties for  failing to cut back water use by 10% from 1986 levels.  </P> <P> The committee voted to send the measure to a hearing of the full City Council  on June 15.  </P></p>

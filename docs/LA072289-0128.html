			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE SAILORS DESERVE RECOGNITION  </P> <P> Jim Murray rightly acknowledges the fine tradition and coaching of Eddie  Merrins golf program at UCLA; and the focus on the 1988 National Collegiate  Championship for UCLA golf team is surely justified.  </P> <P> However, in recognizing other L.A. area national championship teams in 1988, he  neglected to mention the UC Irvine sailing team. Collegiate sailing is perhaps  the most demanding and competitive sailing in the world, and graduates of its  ranks go on to be the sport's Olympic medalists and even America's Cup  competitors. In 1988, Irvine won both the Dinghy National Championship and the  Team Racing Championship. Irvine also had four skippers and one crew earn  All-American honors.  </P> <P> Frankly, Coach Craig Wilson's Anteater sailing team deserves far more  recognition and credit than has been afforded it by the L.A. Times.  </P> <P> JIM MUNCH  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

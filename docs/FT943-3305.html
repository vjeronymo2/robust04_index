			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Forte buys Meridien hotels Forte, the UK hotels and restaurants group, defeated Accor, its French rival, yesterday to win control of Meridien, the luxury hotel chain owned by Air France. The British group offered FFr1.09bn (Pounds 130m) for the French airline's 57 per cent stake in Meridien, valuing the chain at FFr1.9bn. Accor's offer valued Meridien at FFr1.7bn. Forte is now required to make an offer to minority shareholders. The sale follows Forte's failure this week to fulfil its ambition to win control of Savoy, the UK luxury hotel group. This year it also failed to acquire Ciga, the Italian luxury chain, which was bought by ITT Sheraton of the US. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman said the Meridien purchase gave Forte its first entry into Asia and increased its presence in Europe, the Middle East and North America. Air France's decision follows months of competition between the British and French rivals. Accor strongly lobbied the centre-right French government, arguing that its offer would keep Meridien in French hands. Its pressure prompted a delay in the sale process, which was launched in April when the two companies tabled bids. Both companies increased their original valuations of Meridien by about FFr100m. Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, said Forte's offer was accepted because of financial considerations. The European Commission ordered the airline to dispose of Meridien by the end of the year as a condition for a FFr20bn capital injection from the French government. According to Air France, Forte has committed itself to maintaining the standard of the hotels in the Meridien chain, to assuring its development and to keeping its headquarters in Paris. Accor had wanted to add Meridien's 58 four-star hotels to its existing operations. Lex, Page 20 Battle for Meridien, Page 21 Savoy results, Page 24</p>

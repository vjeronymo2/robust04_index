			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Attwoods Browning-Ferris Industries' hostile bid for Attwoods is mean but clever. It is mean because the 109p per share offer provides no bid premium, while immediately enhancing BFI's earnings per share. It is clever because it stands a good chance of succeeding. The key to the battle is that Laidlaw, Attwoods' 30 per cent shareholder, has irrevocably pledged its stake at the offer price. So even if a higher bid materialised, the extra pennies would go to BFI, not Laidlaw. BFI trumpeted this agreement as proof that the offer was fair; the reality is that Laidlaw so badly wanted out that it was prepared to accept BFI's stiff conditions. This puts other shareholders in a bind. Attwoods can hardly argue for an independent future given its poor record. But if there was an obvious white knight prepared to pay more, Laidlaw would have found it already. Warburg, Attwoods' merchant bank, will have its work cut out to rustle up a better bid. But, since it is still smarting from its high-profile failure in the Enterprise/Lasmo bid, the bank has every incentive to prove its doubters wrong.</p>

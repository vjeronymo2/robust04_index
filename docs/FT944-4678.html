			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit ponders on insurance Kwik-Fit Holdings, the vehicle component group, yesterday confirmed that it was considering entering the car insurance market. The policies would be sold through a direct telephone sales service and underwritten by a number of insurers. Mr Peter Holmes, sales and marketing director, said: 'We are looking at the insurance market as one of a number of options. No formal decision has been taken yet.' He added that the group expected to make an official announcement in the new year. The move into the increasingly crowded market for direct insurance services will add further to the uncertainty currently pervading the insurance business. The success of Direct Line, the insurance arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland which has taken about a 13 per cent share of the car market, has attracted other entrants, to the detriment of established groups such as the Automobile Association and Swinton Insurance.</p>

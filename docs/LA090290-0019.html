			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES AS ART  </P> <P> Larry Thomas Gardner's Aug. 26 letter, describing his distaste for those of us  who refer to film as an art form, reminded me of a conversation I once had with  my father about my love life. He told me that because I was only 16, it was  impossible for me to be in love.  </P> <P> My father was wrong. It was immature, transient, flawed and fragile, but it was  love.  </P> <P> And so too is film an art form. Granted, it is an art form fraught with bad  art, but in its relative youth it has also produced films of great intellect  and beauty.  </P> <P> It sounds as though Gardner has been scrutinizing the art form with his eyes  tightly shut, and it saddens me that his clever denial of film precludes him  from the enjoyment of film. This letter, then, is not a rebuttal but a sympathy  card.  </P> <P> TIM CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

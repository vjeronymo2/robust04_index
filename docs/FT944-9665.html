			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Peru's success hampers quest for debt deal: A difficult case for generosity A powerful economic recovery could well hamper the Peruvian government's quest for an advantageous debt deal with its bank creditors. With the economy likely to grow at the fastest rate in Latin America for the second straight year, and its foreign exchange reserves at a record Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.6bn), it could be tough convincing banks that Peru deserves generous treatment. Recent announcements by economy and finance minister Mr Jorge Camet suggest talks with leading bank creditors may start in mid-December. Not before time, says Mr Carlos Bolona, former economy minister and architect of Peru's far-reaching economic liberalisation and reform programme. According to Mr Bolona, Peru had made substantial advances towards a 'Brady' debt reduction accord in 1992 'when negotiating conditions were considerably more propitious than today'. 'The time was right, when both the debt price and international reserves were still low,' says Mr Bolona. 'Now you can't go crying to the banks, and negotiating will be much harder.' Peru's debt is trading in the secondary market at around 56 per cent face value, compared with less than 20 per cent at the end of 1992. A deal in 1992 was stymied, however, by the still-unexplained sacking of Mr Bolona and a battle over a disputed Dollars 72m debt to two New York banks - which was formally recognised by the Peruvian Congress only after 10 months of deliberations. Ministry advisers are now saying they would like to see a Brady deal in place some time next year. Many bankers think this may be difficult, particularly given presidential elections next April. Two technical obstacles must be cleared. The banks insist that Peru pay some Dollars 1.5m in legal fees they incurred in legal actions against the government, and the government insists the banks withdraw all pending lawsuits. The main complication will be the huge amounts of interest arrears owed dating back to 1984. 'Peru is the country with the largest ratio of arrears to principal; that's going to involve some hard negotiations,' says Mr Peter West of the London-based West Merchant Bank. According to calculations by the Institute of International Finance, an international bank think-tank in Washington, using contractual interest rates the ratio of interest arrears to principal will be 142 per cent by the year end, and 162 per cent by the end of next year. Banks have always resisted giving generous terms on arrears to discourage debtors from delaying interest payments. The sticking point will not be the terms on the roughly Dollars 3.5bn of principal - that is likely to be fairly rapidly settled, say bankers, at a discount of 45 per cent (as in Ecuador's just completed deal) or 50 per cent (as in Bulgaria). The sticking point will be what happens over the more than Dollars 4.2bn in overdue interest. Some economists think that a generous settlement on interest is needed, given that Peru's overall debt position remains critical despite the breathers given under a generous September 1992 rescheduling deal with the Paris Club of creditor governments. The country owes more than Dollars 22bn, almost six times current annual export earnings and probably not far short of actual GDP. Mr Paul Luke of Morgan Grenfell in London argues that the banks will be forced to write off some of Peru's past due interest. Without this, he argues, it will be impossible to finance the debt deal from the country's tax revenues - which have proved notoriously difficult in the past to increase beyond present low levels of around 11 per cent of GDP. Mr Roberto Abusada, now an adviser in the economy ministry and a former vice-minister, agrees. 'We're at the limits of our fiscal possibilities and we need a highly advantageous deal.' Mr David Atkinson of Standard Bank in London believes the negotiations will not be easy, but thinks banks may well worry less about setting precedents with a relatively generous settlement on interest arrears. Many bankers think that Peru's high reserves should allow a buy-back of some of the debt for cash - something Ecuador could not afford. Furthermore, a prolonged negotiation could allow further debt to be liquidated through debt-to-equity swaps in the government's privatisation programme. Peru has raked in large amounts of cash from state company sell-offs. The total so far exceeds Dollars 2.7bn and there are important assets, including electricity generating companies, fishmeal plants, oilfields and refineries and the giant state-owned mining and refining company Centromin, still to go under the hammer. Economy ministry officials say privatisation has added some Dollars 2bn to the reserves and this cannot, by law, be diverted into debt repayments. In addition, bank reserve requirements mean that 45 per cent of all dollar deposits in Peru - about two-thirds of total deposits - are placed in the central bank, hugely swelling the reserve total. Peru also has a large deficit on current account - around Dollars 1bn for the first half year alone. It is being financed by the inflow of long-term capital, mainly from privatisations and the short-term capital still flooding into the high-performance Lima stock market. Neither of these sources can be counted on to continue for more than a year or two. Export earnings, though on target for a record Dollars 4bn this year, remain vulnerable to fluctuations in raw materials prices. Peru's real capacity to service debt has thus changed little in 15 years.</p>

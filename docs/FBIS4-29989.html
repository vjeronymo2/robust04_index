			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto, acknowledging  the Indonesian Navy's needs to bolster its fleet to defend the  archipelago's vast waters, says it still has to operate within  the budget.    Suharto however gave his full endorsement to the plan to  develop a navy base in Teluk Ratai on the southern tip of  Sumatera by making a visit there yesterday.    The project has been mentioned as a candidate for the  government axe as the Ministry of Finance and the Agency for the  Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) is now haggling  over the budget for the Navy's ambitious development plan.    "I fully support the development of the main base in Teluk  Ratai," Suharto said during a visit to the site yesterday to  launch the project. He said that given the government's budget  constraints, the base should be developed in phases.    The President, speaking without a text, stressed that the  Navy, and the Armed Forces (ABRI) for that matter, must fall in  line with the government's development program which puts  emphasis on improving the welfare of the people.    The Ministry of Finance has slashed the navy's proposal for  a  $1.1 billion budget to finance the purchase and refitting of 39  second hand warships from Germany. The budget includes spare  parts and ammunition, as well as for the construction of Teluk  Ratai base which will house some of these ships.    It has imposed a limit of $320 million for the entire  package, ordering the navy to scale down their plans. The BPPT,  which has been appointed to handle the procurement, said it  could only bring the figure down to $482 million.    In the original budget proposal, the Teluk Ratai project was  to cost US$151 million. This item was excluded from the latest  proposal from BPPT.    The haggling between Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad and  State Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie became  public knowledge when the two were questioned in separate  hearings at the House of Representatives on Tuesday.    Suharto in his speech stressed that a strong Armed Forces is  crucial for Indonesia to safeguard the fruits of development.  He acknowledged that strengthening the Indonesian Navy is a  costly venture yet emphasized that the nation needs a dependable  force to protect its territorial waters.    The German warships comprising 16 corvettes, 19 tank landers  and nine minesweepers, come from the former arsenal of East  Germany. They are being earmarked to replace about 40 of the 80  aging ships now being operated by the navy.    Suharto yesterday defended Habibie from criticism of the way  he has handled the procurement, saying that he personally asked  the minister to handle the negotiations because he was familiar  with German officials and industrialists.    "We shouldn't make a big issue out of his appointment.  Certainly it was not because we didn't trust the officers in  the Ministry of Defense and Security or in ABRI."    He recalled that the idea to buy the ships first came from a  private entrepreneur but he subsequently backed out after  finding that there would be no commission from the deal. That's  when Habibie was asked to step in.    He stressed that the ships were sold at bargain prices even  after the additional costs of refitting them were included.    The President warned that the controversy over the  procurement of the warships was fanned by people who had little  knowledge about the issue.    "They aired their views, further muddling the situation, set  one official against another, sowed mistrust between them to the  point of disrupting stability," he said. "We won't let them get  away. We will warn them, and if that doesn't stop them, we'll  take firm action."    He stressed that this had nothing to do with freedom of  speech, which is guaranteed by the constitution. "There are  laws on how to exercise this right, and any violation should be  punished."    Suharto, accompanied by Mrs. Tien Suharto, also went on  board  the KRI [Republic of Indonesia Ship] Teluk Banten, one of the 17  warships from Germany that had been delivered. From the ship,  they witnessed 23 of the navy's ships pass by.    Suharto also witnessed the presentation of five of the  German  ships from Habibie to Minister of Defense and Security Edi  Sudrajat, who in turned handed them over to Navy Chief of Staff  Admiral Tanto Kuswanto.</p>

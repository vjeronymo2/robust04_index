			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / French ex-minister investigated Mr Alain Carignon, who resigned as French communications minister in July shortly before being charged with being in 'receipt of fraud', was yesterday summoned to Lyons by police for questioning in an investigation which, according to Le Monde newspaper, has been extended to allegations that the ex-minister illegally received FFr20m (Pounds 2.4m) in gifts in cash and kind from companies. Mr Carignon, who is still mayor of Grenoble, is linked to an investigation by a Lyons judge into the fact that Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utility group, assumed the debts of a pro-Carignon newspaper shortly before the mayor's subsequent decision to let Lyonnaise des Eaux manage the city's water supply. In the course of this investigation, the judge has brought charges against a former Carignon aide, Mr Jean-Louis Dutaret, who has had to resign as head of a state communications holding company. Le Monde yesterday claimed that in the course of delving into Mr Dutaret's affairs, the judge had come across evidence that Mr Carignon had his Paris apartment rent and numerous air tickets paid for by companies in the water sector.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Lars Vogt - Queen Elizabeth Hall Vogt is the young German pianist - now about 22 - who came second to Artur Pizarro (three years older) in the 1990 Leeds Competition. He gave his London debut recital on Tuesday: late Haydn, late Beethoven and late Brahms with a couple of wilful novelties, his new Russian wife's 'Sonata' and Helmut Lachenmann's early Variations on Schubert. We have been hearing much more of Pizarro, and that has confirmed the prizewinning impression he made at Leeds. Smooth mastery of the keyboard, a 'big' style of precocious maturity, a thoroughly respectful attitude to historical norms of interpretation; but Vogt is more promisingly immature, still ready to follow his own inquiring imagination against established readings. That is no kind of prediction  - Pizarro may grow steadily toward an individual authority, or Vogt become merely quirky. At the moment, however, Vogt strikes continual sparks by unfettered alertness to his music, with his own considerable technical finesse. The Lachenmann set (pretty inconsequent stuff, presumably chosen on some sentimental ground) at least afforded him room to play with witty digital nuances. In Haydn's C major Sonata, Hob. XVI/50, he was full of eager, astringent ideas: there were bright insights every few bars, without prejudice to the poise of the whole work. Vogt made a miscalculation in the op. 119 pieces of Brahms that Pizarro would not have - here and there he essayed an innerlich pianissimo that simply failed to carry beyond the front rows; but by the end every piece had left a vivid, slightly spectral impression. Tatiana Komarova's 'Sonata' (eight minutes, one movement) proved to be a coherent fantasy in Skryabin's later 'sonata'-mould: spidery and crystalline, evoking the sound-world of Ravel's 'Jeux d'eau' and even of Bartok's 'Night Music'. It served nicely as a prelude to Beethoven's Sonata op. 111. Vogt made no pretence of wheeling out grave profundities, such as depend no less upon a venerable performer's gravitas than upon the actual playing. Instead, he laid bare Beethoven's argument in transparent terms, with only as much audible muscle as it requires. Throughout the clipped drama of the first movement and the steady unfolding of the Arietta variations, his taut tempi and his unfailing tenderness with detail gripped one's attention. It wasn't the grand, revelatory op. 111 of some people's ideals; but it was visionary in its own way, and all of it had the ring of fresh discovery. If it takes Vogt some years more to reach a settled professionalism, so much the better for his lucky audiences.</p>

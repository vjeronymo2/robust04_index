			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Technology: Clash of the titans - The software battle heating up between IBM and Microsoft Two titans of the computer industry are gearing up for a global marketing battle. With the launch this week of a revamped version of OS/2, International Business Machines is taking on Microsoft in a struggle to wrest control of PC operating systems from the software leader. For once, IBM is in the role of challenger. Microsoft currently holds a monopoly in the market for the programs that control the basic functions of a personal computer. Ironically, it was IBM's choice of Microsoft's Dos operating system in the early 1980s that set the software company on a growth path. Almost every IBM-compatible personal computer in the world now comes equipped with Dos. Microsoft reaffirmed its position as the prime supplier of PC systems software with 'Windows 3.0', a hugely successful program that works with Dos to give IBM-compatible PCs ease-of-use features similar to the Apple Macintosh. It also helped develop IBM's OS/2, an easy-to-use operating system launched in 1987 which, to IBM's chagrin, failed to gain momentum as the successor to Dos. Microsoft claims to have sold 10m copies of Windows 3.0 since its introduction in June 1990. What is more, Microsoft will next week begin shipments of an upgraded version, called Windows 3.1, amid a barrage of advertising. On the face of it, IBM seems to be attempting the impossible; unseating Microsoft from its entrenched position as the dominant worldwide supplier of PC systems software. Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, dismisses OS/2 as a weak challenger. He says Microsoft will sell at least 1m copies of Windows 3.1 over the next month. Yet being the underdog seems to have energised IBM. The computer giant is arming all of its 344,000 worldwide employees with promotional materials and asking them to proselytize friends and acquaintances. IBM will also unleash a multi-million dollar advertising campaign this month and have its top PC executives campaigning like US presidential candidates. Amid all of this hype and hoopla, personal computer users will be faced with confusing claims and counterclaims making it difficult to determine the merits of each of the competing programs, or whether indeed they need either. The decision is made more difficult by the fact that OS/2 and Windows at first glance look remarkably alike. Both present the personal computer user with a graphical interface; a screen with pictorial 'icons' that represent functions and applications that can be executed with the click of a button on a computer 'mouse'. Both also have 'pull-down menus' offering the user a choice of actions. But the true advantages of this new generation of personal computer operating systems lie in their ability to tap the power of the high-performance microprocessors that drive the latest models of PCs. With either OS/2 or Windows it becomes possible to run more than one application simultaneously. This 'multitasking' capability maps the functions of a personal computer more closely to the way that people work. Thus, for example, you might be printing out the results of a spreadsheet analysis while writing a cover letter to go with it and glancing at an incoming facsimile message at the same time. 'OS/2 will enable you to unleash all of the power trapped inside your personal computer,' James Cannavino, president of IBM's personal systems division, promises. But multitasking is not unique to OS/2, it is also an important feature of Windows. Where the differences lie is in the degree of difficulty that users face in configuring a collection of programs to perform multiple applications simultaneously. With Windows, that depends to a large extent upon whether the applications programs are designed specifically for Windows, or whether they are older, but perhaps familiar, Dos applications. IBM claims that OS/2 will run applications programs designed for Dos, or Windows, or OS/2 with equal ease. Another differentiating factor is hardware requirements. For OS/2, IBM recommends a 386 or more powerful microprocessor, with at least four or preferably eight Mbytes of internal memory, and an 80 Mbyte hard disk drive. About half of the personal computers sold this year, or about 10m machines, will meet these specifications, IBM estimates. Of the installed base of personal computers, another 10m-20m are capable of running OS/2 according to industry estimates. Windows will run on lower-cost 286-based personal computers with 2Mbytes of memory. However, the operating system performs best on a 386 with about 4Mbytes of memory. For both operating systems, the minimum hardware requirements depend to a great extent upon how many applications are used and the memory requirements of those programs. For IBM, any operating system that requires users to upgrade their hardware presents an opportunity for increased hardware sales. 'I believe that as the industry moves forward it will provide an opportunity for all hardware vendors to make PCs richer and in that environment IBM will do very well,' Cannavino acknowledges. Indeed, the forthcoming operating systems market battle bodes well for the entire personal computer industry, promises to boost stagnant personal computer sales. The market battle between IBM and Microsoft will also, however, present personal computer users with software bargains. IBM will offer its OS/2 in the US for Dollars 139 to first-time buyers, or Dollars 99 to current Dos users and Dollars 49 to users of Microsoft Windows 3.0. Microsoft's Windows 3.1 upgrade price is Dollars 50. The true costs of converting to either of the new operating systems will, however, include the price of memory upgrades, if needed. To take full advantage of the systems software, users may also decide to upgrade to Windows or OS/2 versions of applications programs. Another consideration for personal computer users is the anticipated introduction later this year of 'Windows NT', yet another new Microsoft operating system that will be a true competitor with OS/2. Only with its 'NT' version of Windows will Microsoft match OS/2's ability to tap the 32-bit processing power of the Intel 486 microprocessor that powers the latest generation of personal computers. While Microsoft can build upon its past success with Windows 3.0, IBM must recover from the dismal failure of earlier versions of OS/2. Even IBM cannot afford to lose such a high-profile marketing battle. Why then is the computer giant risking its reputation upon a personal computer program that will surely not reap high profits? The answer lies in IBM's determination to find ways to differentiate its personal computers, which currently represent about half of the computer giant's revenues, from the myriad of 'clones' that have transformed the personal computer business into a price-driven 'commodity' market. The company that controls the systems software will to a large extent determine the future direction of the entire PC industry.</p>

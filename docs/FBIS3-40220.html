			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Keli [0491 0344 7787]: ``Nation's Computer </F> Industry Enters Benign Cycle: Import and Export Trade Turnover  Has First Surplus'']    [Summary] China's computer industry import and export trade  turnover this year recorded its first surplus. According to  official statistics, the nation's 1993 gross volume of computer  imports and exports was US$2.139 billion, of which imports  amounted to $1.05 billion and exports to $1.088 billion. This  first trade surplus for the 30-odd-year-old domestic computer  industry indicates that this industry has entered the  development phase of a benign cycle [between economic  activities].    While exports of computer hardware parts and boards continue  to form the bulk of China's computer exports, a growing  percentage comes from application software and other kinds of  software. Analyzing the reasons for the nation's first  computer-industry trade surplus, Yang Tianxing [2799 1131 5887],  director of the Ministry of Electronics Industry's Computer  Department, commented that the dominant position of China's  computer industry in terms of labor, talent, and technology is  gradually coming into play amid international market  competition, and that the production scale of the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises is gradually growing -- both reasons  being critical factors for foreign-exchange-earning exports.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Arts: The Wigmore Hall is flavour of the month - Sponsorship Extracting sponsorship money from companies is proving disheartening in a recession but there are alternative sources of revenue for arts groups to explore. Trusts are committed to distributing largesse whatever the financial climate and rich individuals often feel more charitable in hard times. On November 9 the Queen will open the Joseph H. Hotung Gallery at the British Museum. It is devoted to Chinese and Indian works of art; at 360 feet it is the longest museum gallery in the UK; it is resplendently finished in gold leaf; it displays almost 4,000 masterpieces; and its Pounds 2m cost was met by one man, Mr Hotung, a Hong Kong businessman. There may be mercenary reasons why Mr Hotung has been so generous. He is acquiring commercial properties in the UK. He will get a status-raising exhibition of his own collection of Chinese jades in the gallery next year - and his name will be neatly engraved into the structure. But they are incidental to Mr Hotung's commitment as a collector. He learnt much in the old Chinese gallery at the British Museum, but felt his learning curve would have been greatly increased if the lighting there had been better. He suggested to the Keeper, Jessica Rawson, that he provide improved lighting. She nudged him towards a full scale renovation. The National Gallery has also found four private patrons, including Lady Kaye and Mrs Wrightsman (plus old friend, dealers Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox to club together the Pounds 1m needed to renovate its Lower Gallery, where it keeps its reserve collection. It will re-open next spring. The Tate Gallery gained an important work by Joseph Wright of Derby thanks to the generosity of Mr John Ritblat, who gave Pounds 100,000, encouraged by the Gift Aid provisions, while the cataloguing of Kenneth Clark's archive was paid for by John and Olivia Hughes, also powered by Gift Aid. In the main private patrons prefer to finance long lasting memorials to their munificence, but when Ken Russell's production of Princess Ida opens at the ENO next week it will be part paid for by Christine and Irwine Laidlaw, American fans of the Coliseum.                        *       *      * Amazingly there are still sponsorship success stories. Here are two. The Wigmore Hall re-opens for business on November 12 after an 18-month closure for restoration. There has been no change to the gorgeous art nouveau auditorium. All the work is back stage, and designed, almost incidentally, to appeal to sponsors. For the first time there is a large bar area, ideal for entertaining, plus an adjacent restaurant. The Wigmore hardly touched the lives of sponsors in the past. It was regarded as too cramped. But now it is flavour of the month, its popularity among artists, audiences, and even critics, filtering through to sponsors. For the first half of its 1992-93 season the Wigmore has attracted Pounds 80,000 in sponsoring income as against a target of Pounds 56,000. Apart from the smart new premises, sponsoring a concert at the Wigmore starts at Pounds 3,000, a much less demanding proposition than a Pounds 20,000 blow out at the Festival Hall. The Wigmore must become more commercial. It still gets grants from the Arts Council and Westminster City Council, which, with its landlord, the Prudential, paid for the Pounds 2m refurbishment, but the nod is that it should develop its own sources of income. National Power is sponsoring the re-opening concert, which features 16 singers, including Margaret Price and Felicity Palmer, and British Airways and Marks &amp; Spencer have joined the new backers.                        *       *      * The Wigmore Hall is acting as an out station for the Scandinavian Festival, the most ambitious of the themed arts binges put together by the Barbican. This has also touched a nerve in sponsors. If the Wigmore offered novelty, the Festival has sold itself on artistic over-drive. Its sponsorship target was Pounds 200,000 (to match an equivalent sum from the City of London). In the event it has brought in over Pounds 400,000, in cash and kind, two thirds of it from Scandinavian companies. Baroness O'Caithin, director of the Barbican, is seriously considering giving back to the City the Pounds 200,000 surplus. It would demonstrate good house-keeping. She might, however, wait until the financial balance sheet on the Festival is complete before indulging in such a dramatic gesture. The Barbican set up a sponsorship committee headed by Sir Andrew Stark, former British Ambassador to Denmark, to raise the cash and obvious names like Carslberg, SAS, Finn Air, Statoil (the Norwegian state oil company) and more rallied round, supplying, on top of cash, facilities like air tickets, hotel accommodation and the paper to print the brochure.                        *       *      * Esso is a happy sponsor at the National Gallery. It was so pleased with the response to its Art in the Making series of exhibitions that it has signed up for a successor programme, Making and Meaning, which puts major NG works in context. The first show is devoted to the recently restored Wilton Triptych, and takes place next autumn. Then comes Michelangelo. Each will cost Esso around Pounds 100,000. The National Gallery has a new head of development in Bettina von Hase. She inherited the Munch exhibition, which opens next week thanks to Pounds 250,000 from Norsk Hydro, but is seeking a backer with Pounds 200,000 to support a show planned for April of paintings from the temporarily closed art gallery in Lille. Also in the in-tray is the decorous search for six more companies (14 are already signed up), prepared to pay Pounds 25,000 a year to become a corporate benefactor and have after hours access to the NG's collection. In the longer term she must seek sponsors for a Pounds 10m renovation package for the north wing of the National Gallery. It is only 20 years old but needs repairs to its air conditioning as well as a more flexible hanging space. The aim is to renovate all the NG's galleries in time for the millennium.                        *       *      * The sponsorship success of two orchestras confirms the perennial appeal of the young. London Electricity is extending its sponsorship of the London Schools Symphony Orchestra until 1996.</p>

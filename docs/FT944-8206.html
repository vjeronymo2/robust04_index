			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Even though last week's rise in the discount rate was sharper than expected, the bond market is by no means sure the Fed has finished yet. The economy remains rather too strong for comfort, particularly in terms of consumer spending and retail sales. In spite of the aggressive nature of its move, the Fed pointedly made no comment on plans, and long bond yields actually rose slightly. The next FOMC meeting is not until December 20, so no further action is expected at least until then. In the meantime, however, the market has found something else to worry about: the risk that the Republicans, rampant after their election victory, will cut taxes ahead of their ability to control spending. However, this should be a quiet week, with the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. Tuesday brings the Federal budget figure for October, expected to show a deficit in the Dollars 33bn-Dollars 35bn range. On Wednesday come durable goods orders, where continued growth in civilian spending should be mostly offset by continued cutbacks in defence, resulting in growth of about 1 per cent or a little above. October figures for sales of existing homes, due on Friday, will be looked at for evidence that rising mortgage rates are finally taking effect.</p>

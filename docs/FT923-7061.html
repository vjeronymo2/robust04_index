			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Technology: Queue buster flies in A mobile airline check-in system designed to shorten those interminably long queues at airports has been developed by Speedwing, British Airways' external IT consulting and marketing division. Speedwing has developed software that enables British Airways staff carrying Poqet hand-held computers to access its mainframe computers to check in passengers and luggage. Passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport Terminal Four for British Airways international flights will be the first to take advantage of the system. Airline staff at the airport will 'comb' the queues in search of passengers who are waiting to check in for flights that are about to depart. Instead of queuing, passengers will be invited to complete the check-in process on the spot. A special desk will issue boarding passes and luggage tickets to these passengers. While the advantages for passengers are obvious, the airline also expects to benefit. Since the cost of delaying the departure of a Boeing 747 is approximately Pounds 900 per minute, British Airways estimates that the system will save it approximately Pounds 8m per year. The 'queue buster' system is based upon the use of the Ram mobile data radio network, which provides wireless computer communications. British Airways' use of radio data communications has been made economically attractive by the advent of public networks. In the past the airline has experimented with the use of radio communications, but faced the prohibitive cost of building its own radio network infrastructure. The Ram system is expected to be completed this year. The airline is also phasing in the system at some US airports. Future uses may include group check-in at hotels or on trains or buses taking people to the airport. During a trial of the system, mobile computers were also used to rebook connections for passengers aboard a delayed flight. Another use of the system is by pilots who want to access weather and traffic information directly, rather than via operations control staff.</p>

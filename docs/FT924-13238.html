			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Pru chief issues plea for greater treasury detail THE HEAD of one of the largest institutional investors in the UK stock market has called for greater disclosure of corporate treasury policies in companies' accounts. Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential Portfolio Managers, was speaking at a conference hosted by the Association of Corporate Treasurers in London earlier this week. Prudential Portfolio Managers has Pounds 21bn of its Pounds 50bn of funds under management invested in the UK stock market, accounting for 3.5 per cent of the market. The ACT accepted a call from Mr Jenkins to 'establish a working party with representatives of institutional shareholders in order to devise appropriate levels of disclosure of corporate Treasury management activities for publication in annual reports'. The Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Accounting Standards Board will be involved in setting up the working party. Mr Jenkins complained that, in the accounts of many of the largest listed companies, reports on corporate treasury matters are 'minimal in most cases', even though the Report and Accounts is the correct medium for such disclosure. Only a few UK companies, including RTZ and Courtaulds, describe their Treasury activities, including interest rate and currency exposure management policies, in any detail. Mr Jenkins suggested that companies' audit committees should monitor systems of risk control and ensure that internal control systems are adequate. He also emphasised that a clear view of the strategic aims of the Treasury function was vital. Mr Jenkins added that corporate treasury departments should not be treated as profit centres. 'Value can certainly be added, but treasurers should work to facilitate their companies' core business activities,' he said.</p>

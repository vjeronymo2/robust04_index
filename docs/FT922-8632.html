			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Time targets British Rail yesterday published the first figures to show its performance against targets on a line-by-line basis since the Passenger's Charter was introduced two months ago. The chart shows how four of the 15 Network SouthEast routes and five out of the seven InterCity routes are missing the punctuality targets in the BR Passenger's Charter. Regional Railways, the provincial network, is doing rather better: only two of its 22 routes (Cross Country and East and West Midlands) are failing to meet the required standard. Under the Passenger's Charter, regular rail customers will receive discounts on season ticket renewals if their lines fail to meet performance targets by more than a narrow margin over a 12-month period.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                           NETWORK SOUTHEAST  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Punctuality (Mon-Fri 0700-1000 and 1600-1900) Route                                Target              16 weeks                   (per cent within 5 mins.)           to 25 April  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Great Northern                   90                       94 Northampton                      90                       95.7 Thameslink                       89                       88.6 Chiltern                         88                       94.8 South Western                    88                       90.2 Kent Link                        88                       82 South London                     88                       87.1 West Anglia                      88                       91.6 Great Eastern                    86                       86.6 Solent &amp; Wessex                  86                       87.2 North London                     85                       92.1 Sussex Coast                     83                       85 Kent Coast                       82                       73.2 Thames London, Tilbury &amp; Southend                         80                       89.5  ------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERCITY  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Punctuality (Mon-Sat, standard 90 per cent within 10 mins) Route                                                    16 weeks                                                       to 25 April  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Anglia                                                    87.9 Cross Country                                             82.6 East Coast                                                84.7 Gatwick Express                                           94.4 Great Western                                             90.7 Midland Mainline                                          88.8 West Coast                                                83.7  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

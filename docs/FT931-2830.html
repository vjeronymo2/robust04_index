			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Gatt talks on China mark time CHINA'S attempt to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade made little headway during three days of talks with trading partners ending yesterday. More talks are scheduled for the end of May but early resumption of membership now looks improbable. 'There's no great enthusiasm to work rapidly' towards Chinese membership, said one European official. Beijing appeared to have hardened its opposition to a special safeguards clause in its membership terms which would protect trading partners from sudden import surges. Strong safeguards provisions are seen as essential by the US, the European Community and other industrialised countries which fear a flood of cheap imports once trade barriers come down. Even without Gatt membership, China is expected to enter the ranks of the world's top 10 trading nations this year. Supported by some third world countries, Beijing is pressing for standard membership terms as a developing country. However, trading partners argue that, despite substantial liberalisation, China's economy is not fully compatible with Gatt's market-based fair trade rules and requires special treatment, not least because of its size. China, a founder member of Gatt, left in 1950 after the Communists took power in Beijing.</p>

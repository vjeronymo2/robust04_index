			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / BA braced for test flight of wills: Jenny Luesby on the airline's plan to defy a landing ban at Orly The crunch may come shortly after 7am on Monday, 29,000 feet above the English Channel. The captain of British Airways flight 332, bound from London's Heathrow airport to Orly airport, south of Paris, will request permission to proceed into French air space. A refusal would be unprecedented, providing the flight plan has been accepted. The airline has already logged a flight plan for BA332 for Monday. It has done so every day since March 27, but the flight plan has never been used. So far, BA has always cancelled the flight. Not because it wants to, or does not have the right to fly, but because the French have been barring British flights to Orly in defiance of a European Commission ruling last month. BA says, however, that on Monday it will not cancel the flight. The 247-seat Boeing 767 is fully booked. Passengers include a member of the European parliament, a French television crew, BA's group managing director and a pack of journalists. The pilot knows that BA has a landing slot booked at Orly. It has check-in desks, a handling agent and a parking space. By 5am he will also know how French air traffic control and Orly airport have reacted to the flight plan. The only grounds for rejecting a flight plan are if the paperwork is not in order, if there is a security problem, if the airport is closed or if the airspace is full. The burden of proof will be on France to justify a refused flight plan. But it would bring Monday's test of wills to a swift close: no flight plan, no flight. Will the French be willing to flout European law? The pilot can only ask, and wait. If he gets clearance, the aircraft will take off - at 6.50am if it is on time. The flight should be uneventful until the aircraft reaches the English Channel where the captain will switch frequencies, announce his presence to French air traffic control and be acknowledged. But any minute could bring an order to divert to another airport. If it comes, he will argue the case. He has the landing slot. He will push for precise details of the obstacle standing between flight BA332 and Orly airport. The law is on his side. And he wants to go to Orly. He will be an experienced BA pilot, part of senior management, a fluent French speaker. And he will fight the diversion. Heathrow-Orly is a short hop - 322 miles and a scheduled flight time of 65 minutes. The captain will have more than adequate fuel. He can circle. He can argue. He can make a nuisance. And he can make a point. He will not jeopardise the safety of his passengers. French air traffic control will be obliged to keep him in safe airspace while the negotiations go on. In the end, he may win. With his landing gear on Orly's runway, he will have opened up a route that his airline wants. And if, eventually, he has to land instead at Charles de Gaulle airport, he will at least have forced the French to show their hand. Showdown over France, Page 9</p>

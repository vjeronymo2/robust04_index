			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / German public service unions call strike vote GERMANY'S power struggle over pay has entered a critical phase following the collapse of negotiations between government and public service unions on Monday night. The four main unions involved, representing all public services, yesterday called strike ballots for next week after rejecting the employers' final offer of a package worth 4.8 per cent - effectively a wage freeze. Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister responsible for the employers' negotiating team, claimed the increase, payable to around 3m employees, would cost federal, state and local governments an extra DM15bn (Pounds 5.2bn) a year. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, president of the oTV union, the second largest after the engineers' IG Metall, said the employers' proposal was an encouragement to strike. The offer came during resumed talks after an arbitration panel last week proposed - and employers rejected  - a compromise increase of 5.4 per cent plus DM600 in back-pay and holiday allowances. The oTV, with 1.25m members, is the main force in the public services sector. It represents a wide range of local authority employees, including dustmen, nurses, bus and tram drivers, power and water workers. The three other unions involved represent white collar, federal railway and postal staff. Results are expected by Friday April 24, and the oTV threatened immediate stoppages if the necessary 75 per cent vote for action was achieved. The employers' position is underpinned by determined resistance from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Bonn administration, which is committed to strict controls on public spending and wants all available resources, including company profits, funneled into the east German economy. At the personal level, Mr Seiters wants to show his mettle in advance of this autumn's cabinet reshuffle. Ms Wulf-Mathies, meanwhile, who last year won a 6 per cent increase for her membership, faces re-election in June when her 10-year term of office ends. Wavering public sympathy for union demands has so far tended to favour pay moderation, although the direct impact of disrupted public services may influence the mood. The previous public sector strike, which lasted three chaotic days in February 1974, ended with employers' capitulation and an 11 per cent pay award. All services were affected in many large towns. In the Rhineland Palatinate, power workers cut off the state government's electricity for the duration.</p>

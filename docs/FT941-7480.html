			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Swedish forestry group moves ahead AssiDoman, a newly formed state-owned Swedish forestry group due to be partly privatised next month, yesterday reported a 1993 profit after financial items of SKr983m (Dollars 124m), more than two times the 1992 result of SKr310m. The government is aiming to raise up to SKr9bn through an offering of 49 per cent of the company. AssiDoman, formed at the start of this year from the two companies Assi and Doman, is the fourth-largest Swedish forestry group and one of Europe's top 10. It intends to bid for another 51 per cent state-owned Swedish forestry group, Ncb, following completion of the partial privatisation. Analysts said the result was ahead of previous expectations of a profit after financial items of about SKr700m. Turnover of SKr12.4bn was 9 per cent ahead of the 1992 figure of SKr11.4bn. AssiDoman included an extraordinary charge of SKr791m, to leave a pre-tax profit of SKr192m, compared with a loss of SKr141m in 1992.</p>

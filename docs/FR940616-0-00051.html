			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 83. KBS and the NAB may submit comments in our future proceeding to establish regulatory fees for FY 1995, supporting their positions concerning the need to distinguish between satellite and fully operational stations when assessing regulatory fees. As explained above, for FY 1994, we shall make no adjustments to Congress' fee schedule pursuant to section 9(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Broadcast Auxiliary Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 84. The Society of Broadcast Engineers, Inc. (SBE) believes that broadcast auxiliary facilities, such as remote pick-up stations, and aural, television and low power auxiliary stations, should not be subject to any regulatory fee. SBE explains that there is no justification to apply a regulatory fee to these facilities since they are essentially self-regulating and impose little burden on our resources. As indicated above, we shall not modify any of section 9(g)'s fee requirements for FY 1994, but SBE may raise these issues in future proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. ITFS and DBS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 85. Finally, the Joint Parties contend that we should amend the fee schedule to add several services not subject to fees for FY 1994. These services include the commercial offering of Instructional Television Fixed Services (ITFS) and Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS). We decline the Joint Parties' request to add these services to the schedule for 1994 since Congress did not provide us the authority to add any service to the schedule for FY 1994. Moreover, we are aware that ITFS is a predominantly nonprofit service with limited commercial use and, further, that DBS is not expected to become operational prior to the time for calculating fee payments for FY 1994. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  To the extent that the Joint Parties wish to renew their arguments concerning the inclusion of these services for future years, they may do so when we consider our fee payment schedule for FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Joint Parties point out that the fee schedule contains no explicit fee requirement for Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS). However, our schedule, modeled on the schedule contained in section 9(g) of the Act, explicitly requires the payment of a regulatory fee by Domestic Public Fixed licensees, operating under Part 21 of our rules. Since MMDS is a Part 21 service, it is fully subject to the regulatory fee prescribed for Part 21 licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Common Carrier Bureau <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 86. Most common carrier regulatory fees are based on the size of a regulatee's communications operation as determined by its number of stations, subscribers, access lines, or antennas. We intend to rely upon the Common Carrier Bureau's licensing data bases to confirm the identity and fee amount for most radio common carriers to the extent possible. We also intend to perform periodic, random audits to determine whether individual regulatees have reported the correct multiplier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Cellular and Public Mobile Licensees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 87. The Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA) states that we should define the term ``subscriber'' as it applies to Part 22 and personal communications services licensees. PCIA suggests that we require Part 22 licensees to pay their fees based on the number of customers on their billing lists and urges that we permit Part 22 licensees to submit their fee payments pursuant to systemwide aggregations of subscribers. Also, PCIA contends that we should permit paging licensees to calculate their fees by aggregating their total subscribers, rather determining their fee payments by call sign, as required by section 9(g), and to submit one instrument of payment per carrier system. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PCIA also requests that we recalculate the regulatory fee for CMRS for FY 1995. PCIA may submit its comments regarding the fee for CMRS in the proceeding we establish to prescribe fees for FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 88. Our rules do not define a mobile service subscriber. For purposes of calculating regulatory fees, we will define a subscriber to a mobile service as an individual or entity authorized by the mobile service provider to operate under its blanket license in exchange for monetary consideration. Further, any Part 22 licensee may submit a single, aggregate payment to cover the regulatory fees due for each of its individual systems. However, each individual system and service should be clearly enumerated on the payor's FCC Form 159 accompanying the fee payment. PCIA may submit its proposal to modify the method for calculating fee payments by paging licensees in our proceeding for establishing fees for FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 89. Claircom Communications Group, L.P., GTE and In-Flight Phone Corporation request clarification of the definition of ``subscriber'' in section 9(g) when applied to the payment of regulatory fees for the Air-Ground Telephone Service. Unlike conventional telephone service, subscribers to that service, usually operators of commercial aircraft, lease their service for the purpose of making it available to their own customers. There is no contractual relationship between the air-ground service operator and the end user of its service. Consequently, as suggested by the parties, we will treat the operator of an aircraft in which its service is installed as the subscriber to the service and charge the fee based upon the number of transceivers leased by the operator. Similarly, licensees in the air-ground service should include in their total fee a payment on a transceiver basis for service they provide to users other than commercial aircraft, such as private aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Space Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 90. Comsat General Corporation (Comsat), GE American Communications, Inc. (GE American), Orbital Communications Corporation (Orbital), PanAmSat, L.P. (Panamsat) and Starsys Global Postioning, Inc. (Starsys) have submitted comments addressed to our proposals concerning the requirements of satellite licensees to submit regulatory fees. Comsat and GTE state that the regulatory fee for a geosynchronous orbit space station is excessive. Comsat argues that the fee requirement should be lowered for FY 1994 because these systems no longer require the regulatory attention they received in their earlier developmental stage. It argues that the fee also is a disincentive to maintaining older and underutilized satellites in orbit for back-up purposes and is anticompetitive and anticonsumer. As we have stated earlier, we shall not adjust the schedule of fees that Congress has enacted for the assessment of fees for FY 1994. Comsat may submit its comments in the future proceeding that we will initiate in order to establish appropriate fees for FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

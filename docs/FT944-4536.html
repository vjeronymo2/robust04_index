			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Republicans agree to procedural changes Republican members of the House of Representatives agreed yesterday to plans for a change in the House's procedural rules that would make it much more difficult to raise taxes, George Graham writes. The members agreed to require a three-fifths majority for any measure that would raise personal or corporate income tax rates, though not for increases in other taxes. An even broader change, demanding a three-fifths majority in both the House and the Senate for any tax increase, is included in the Republicans' draft of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. But while the constitutional amendment itself would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress, as well as ratification by three- quarters of the states, the change to House rules will require only a simple majority and should pass easily.</p>

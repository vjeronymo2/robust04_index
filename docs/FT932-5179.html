			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer buys healthcare stake RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American pharmaceuticals group, is investing Dollars 113m to acquire about 37 per cent of Applied Immune Sciences, a Californian-based healthcare company that is a leader in immunology. The Franco-American group also has the right to acquire 6m AIS shares before the end of June 1997, increasing its stake to about 60 per cent. The two groups plan to collaborate on research and development in gene and cell therapies. They also intend to create a 50-50 joint-venture to market and distribute cell therapy products and services. The venture will be established immediately in Europe and be expanded worldwide. The deal gives RPR access to cell therapy, a way of isolating cells from a patient's body, removing them, numerically expanding them, and then putting them back into the patient. It avoids the side-effects associated with traditional drugs. It will be providing Dollars 30m to help fund a network of worldwide centres using AIS's technology. The investment follows RPR's recent research agreements with the French Centre National de Recherche Scientifique and the Institut Gustave Roussy. 'Yesterday's move is a significant step by RPR's more aggressive and focused management,' said Mr Viren Mehta, analyst at New York-based pharmaceuticals specialists Mehta and Isaly.</p>

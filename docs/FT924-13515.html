			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Time to get tough on pay THE UK ECONOMY is in a critical state, as the depressing stream of bankruptcies and corporate redundancies demonstrates. The government is already under severe pressure to cut interest rates and the pressure will grow over the coming months. Yet the government's critics in industry and the trade unions seem oblivious to their own failure. It is their persistent unwillingness to adjust pay settlements to economic reality that risks turning a difficult situation into a disaster. Carping from Britain's industrialists and their representatives at the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation, is a normal feature of recessionary Britain. They demand lower interest rates, tax relief, public sector pay restraint: saving British industry is always someone else's job. But the dismal failure of British industry to bring wage inflation under control, even after two years of recession, gives these gripes a hollow ring. The government's target of an underlying inflation rate of 2 per cent requires average earnings growth of 3 per cent. Wages are still rising at twice that rate. Comparison with Germany forces home the extent of industry's inertia. Since the recession began, average earnings have grown by 13.5 per cent in Britain and 13 per cent in western Germany. Unit labour costs in manufacturing have also risen faster in the UK. The difference is that the western German labour market has delivered a fall in unemployment of 16,000. British unemployment has risen by 1.2m. The labour market does not seem to work in Britain. A decade of trade union reform has not altered the fact that British industrialists prefer to lay off workers rather than reduce wage growth, while expecting the government to stoke up inflation to accommodate these settlements. Inflationary psychology Membership of the European exchange rate mechanism offered hope of a change to this inflationary psychology. Pay settlements in excess of 2 per cent meant lost competitiveness as UK companies well knew, even if they failed to act upon it. Outside the ERM, there is little to stop industry from returning to the bad old days. A 15 per cent devaluation offers industry a great opportunity to become competitive. The temptation for employers will be to fritter these gains away in higher wages, just as they have always done, in the belief that the Treasury will eventually validate these pay settlements through lower interest rates and higher inflation. The pain of the unemployed will once more have been in vain. The UK has an economy-wide pay problem. It requires economy-wide action. The government will rightly pale at the mention of statutory or tax-based incomes policies. But if they are to be avoided, and its inflation targets are to be more than mere words, then the government must act to reduce inflationary expectations. Pay differentials A pay policy which applies only to the public sector, as the government is currently considering, would be useless. Simply freezing public sector wage increases, while leaving the private sector alone, would open wide the pay differentials between public and private, storing up the same problems of recruitment and retention that public sector pay review bodies were set up to solve. The government must do more than urge private industry into delivering the kind of wage adjustment it has so far been unable to deliver unaided. It should declare that the economy can only tolerate pay settlements of 2 per cent. The endorsement of the CBI and the TUC for this view should be demanded. Pay review bodies, and any other indexation bodies in the public sector, should be instructed that a 2 per cent wage increase is the maximum which should be allowed in the coming year, unless serious recruitment problems can be demonstrated. The Treasury should make a 4 per cent rate of average earnings growth a precondition for any substantial easing of monetary policy. If settlements rise, then interest rate should rise too. Individual businesses and unions would, of course, be free to ignore these strictures. But they could not do so in ignorance of the consequences. If British business prefers inflation to recovery, then so be it. But they could no longer claim that they were not warned.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister General Humberto Corado </F> Figueroa by reporter Balmore Parada on 9 June; place not given;  from the "YSU Radio News" newscast -- first paragraph is Parada  introduction]    [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado Figueroa  today condemned death threats that have been made against  Salvadoran officials and well-known personalities. Gen. Corado  offered the Army's cooperation in this regard, although this  institution is not responsible for public security. The  self-styled Domingo Monterrosa Command this week issued an  anonymous message making death threats against several  officials, including Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio  Molina Fonseca. Nationalist Republican Alliance Deputy Carmen  Calderon de Escalon also received a death threat on the phone.  Corado said that these actions will have to be neutralized so  that these threats do not materialize.    [Begin recording] [Corado] We condemn actions of this type  because they are not compatible with the current political  situation in El Salvador. There is now total freedom to  demonstrate and participate politically, and, as a result,  violence will not be tolerated. Logically, we must take these  threats seriously, with the responsibility to prevent them from  materializing, because the truth is that these threats harm our  country.    [Parada] Is the Army willing to help investigate [words  indistinct]?    [Corado] Yes. We have always said that, although public  security is not our main responsibility, we are always in touch  with the Public Security Ministry and, previously, with the  National Police and National Civilian Police to use our  resources to begin joint action with them designed to counter  these threats.    [Parada] In statements to the media, Corado also referred to  the current problems demobilized Army members are facing in the  process of reintegration. Corado noted that the process is  slow. Consequently, he urged former soldiers to be patient.    [Corado] The truth is that the reintegration process is a  very long one. We have already said that the political will and  the commitment to comply are there. However, former soldiers  must be somewhat patient because this is a slow process. For  instance, in order to award land, the government must buy,  measure, and determine who can settle in those properties. This  is a very complicated process that does not occur overnight, but  it will be accomplished. There is a moral commitment to former  Army members to provide them with all the benefits granted by  the agreements, and we have never opposed their receiving these  benefits. We must only bear in mind that it is a long process  and that they must be patient.    [Parada] They insist that over 18,000 demobilized members  are  entitled to receive compensation.    [Corado] All those covered by the legislative decree issued  for this purpose will be compensated; that is, those who can  prove they meet the requirements will receive the benefits.

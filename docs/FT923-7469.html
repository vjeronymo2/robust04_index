			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Alliance Trust asset value in decline Net asset value at Alliance Trust fell 6 per cent to Pounds 14.48 over the six months ended July 31 1992, slightly less than the drop in the FT-A All-Share index. In the UK, where 51 per cent of the portfolio was held, the share prices of the trust's holdings kept up well compared with the indices, but in the US currency had been a negative influence. The exposure to the Japanese market was minimal. On the revenue side the half year produced a reduction from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 16.8m in the total. That reflected some increase in dividend revenues, offset by the adverse effect of the weak dollar on US income and of lower interest receivable on cash deposits. Earnings per share worked through at 22.74p (23.33p) and the interim dividend is again 14p.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: EC may take some fizz out of Perrier deal - Concern over Nestle's share of the French bottled water market NESTLE may have won the takeover battle for France's Source Perrier, the world's largest mineral water company, but the Swiss food group faces as much as four more months of uncertainty while European Commission competition authorities decide how much of its prize it may keep. Brussels' main concern is the French market, where the deal would almost double Nestle's share of mineral water sales to around 40 per cent. Although the company has agreed to sell Volvic, Perrier's second largest brand, to BSN, France's leading food manufacturer, that does not solve the competition issue because it would leave Nestle and BSN together controlling about three-quarters of French mineral water sales. Nestle already owns the Vittel brand in France, Blaue Quellen in Germany and Ashbourne in Britain, while Perrier and BSN have sizeable water interests in Italy. But nowhere in Europe except France would the deal give either company a share of much more than 20 per cent. Whether the deal will pitch Paris and Brussels into another confrontation over competition policy remains to be seen. But Nestle seems confident that it can square any objections by disposing, if necessary, of some of Perrier's other interests. Mineral water production is one of the world's simplest businesses. The raw material is free and requires no manufacturing: the technical skill  - and profit - lies largely in knowing how to run bottling plants at close to capacity. Yet few other food or drink sectors have enjoyed such high growth and buoyant profitability in recent years. Since the mid-1980s, worldwide sales volumes have risen by around 10 per cent annually. Margins of the larger water producers are typically between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. In some cases, demand has outstripped supply. Sales have remained robust, even though advertising budgets have been cut and bottle sizes reduced in an effort to conserve supplies. Evian, BSN's best-selling still water, is expected to hit production constraints in 10 years. BSN has several other untapped springs and is in the process of launching a sparkling water, La Salvetat, from one of them. However, introducing new products is an expensive way to grow in a business where competitive advantage depends heavily on advertising and marketing support. Hence BSN's eagerness to snap up Volvic, a successful brand with ample spare capacity. Mr Sylvain Massot, drinks industry analyst with investment bank Morgan Stanley, says: 'To expand in mineral water, you have to acquire.' Although recession has recently slowed the industry's sales growth, the longer-term outlook remains appetising - particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world where there is plenty of demand waiting to be tapped. Prospects are bright in the US, where mineral water has begun to carve out a niche in a country long addicted to colas. Bottled waters account for only 11 per cent of US soft drinks sales, but volumes have been growing by 6 per cent a year, twice as fast as the total market. Perrier is already the leading supplier in the US, and Nestle is expected to commit substantial extra resources to strengthening its position. The spearhead is unlikely to be Perrier's best-known product: though notionally a global brand, high transport costs have severely limited US sales and profits. The most rewarding opportunities lie in building on Perrier's locally-produced North American brands. These include Arrowhead, Great Bear and Ozarka, purchased from Beatrice Foods in 1987, and Ice Mountain, purchased from PepsiCo the following year. By pushing these products through its sizeable US distribution system, Nestle could get them on to more supermarket shelves, while making its own offering more attractive to retailers. Analysts estimate that such rationalisation could quickly add as much as three percentage points to Perrier's 7 per cent profit margin in the US. There should also be further improvements in Perrier's performance as it continues to recover from the dent in operating profits caused by the benzene scare two years ago. All this adds up to a tonic for Nestle. EC competition authorities willing, the Perrier deal should be just what the Swiss group needs to put some fizz back in its performance after a flat spell in the second half of the 1980s, when its annual increases in earnings per share averaged a meagre 3.5 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       QUENCHING A THIRST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mineral water sales and consumption 1990                          Dollars bn*    Dollars per     Litres per                                         person          person Germany                  2.98           47.76            83.49 Italy                    2.57           44.33           105.10 US                       2.50           10.16            33.11 France                   2.24           38.90            77.22 UK                       0.44            7.67             6.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromonitor * 1990 exchange rate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma </F> Committee for Economic Policy: "Everything Is Fine, Beautiful  Marchioness. Today the Second Readings of the Draft Federal  Budget for 1994 Begin"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The first version of the  draft federal budget was submitted to the Federal Assembly 18  March. [passage omitted]    The draft federal budget immediately generated sharp  criticism in several significant spheres. First of all,  it was submitted without the necessary accompanying  documents, the main one of which is a forecast of economic  and social development for the year and a preliminary report on  the implementation of the budget in the previous year.    Second, the realistic nature of the  draft federal budget and the forecast based on it  generated a great deal of doubt. The findings of the Committee  for Economic Policy noted that attempts to meet the figures for  the average annual deficit incorporated in the forecasts by  further squeezing the real money supply could cause a  continuation in the reduction in production by 25-30 percent as  compared with last year, which, in its turn, will generate a  sharp increase in the state budget deficit, and, as a  consequence, a growth in inflation, whose rate far exceeds the  forecasted scale. [passage omitted]    Third, the question of the correspondence of  the draft federal budget for 1994 with the priorities  of the state socioeconomic policy arose. [passage omitted]    Fourth, important potential income was not taken into  account in the draft federal budget. [passage omitted]    Fifth, the prevailing practice of forming funds outside  the budget was subjected to serious criticism; these are  formed out of quasi-tax payments, but are not taken into account  in the budget. [passage omitted]    Sixth, a lot of contradicting information and basic  arithmetical mistakes were discovered in the draft budget  and the attached materials, the form of the presentation of the  budget makes it impossible to assess allocations for many  spheres, and the absence of a breakdown of expenditure for  programs makes funding and supervision of the implementation of  ratified federal programs difficult. [passage omitted]    A large part of the criticism of the budget being adopted  remained unanswered, and the insignificant changes which the  government made to the draft did not lead to a fundamental  improvement. The income, increased by 3,776.5 billion rubles  [R] and the deficit, by R6.4 trillion, were mainly targeted at  the needs of agriculture, which increased the disproportions in  the funding of priority spheres of structural policy even more.    Amplifications were not made to the forecast of the  development of the Russian economy, which was evidently at  variance with reality. Proceeding from this, the Committee for  Economic Policy adopted a decision -- to recommend  that the State Duma should reject the draft Federal  Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" given the amendments  presented by the government 26 April 1994.    The majority of deputies disagreed with this proposal and  voted for the adoption of the budget at the first reading.  Although practically all factions made a negative assessment of  the draft federal budget and stated the need for its cardinal  improvement. Curiously, the opposition parties, which had  sharply criticized the economic policy which remains unchanged  under the approved draft federal budget, voted in favor of the  ratification of the draft federal budget.    It is hard to understand the logic of this decision.  Everyone was hoping for the improvement of the draft federal  budget during its revision for the second reading, but they were  deceiving themselves.    It is impossible to improve the draft budget  within the framework of an economic policy conducted on the  condition of "collective irresponsibility." Behind every entry  for items of expenditure in the draft federal budget which has  already been approved at the first reading lie opportunist  interests which have already proved their supremacy in respect  of the approach to the national economy.    Obviously, it will scarcely prove possible to reduce  expenditure following the adoption of the draft federal budget  in the first reading with such an approach toward forming it.  Consequently, it is only possible to improve the draft budget  by increasing its income part. And increasing this presupposes,  first of all, a repeat examination of the draft federal budget  in the first reading, and, second, the need for a serious change  in the economic policy being conducted; if only in accordance  with the directions of the president's message to the Federal  Assembly, which was supported by the Duma.    But that is what the government evidently does not want to  do. It is no accident that the proposals of the Committee for  Economic Policy to increase income from the privatization and  commercial use of state property were given a hostile reception.  This is a troublesome matter, requiring long and painstaking  work and the implementation of mechanisms for State Committee  for the Management of State Property organs to carry  responsibility for the use of the state assets they have been  entrusted with controlling, strict accountability for income  received, and so on. It is far more convenient to continue the  policy of the uncontrolled pulling apart of state property on  the pretext of building national capitalism. The program of  so-called post-voucher privatization is based on the previous  mechanism of spontaneous privatization "from below," geared to  privatization for the sake of privatization at the fastest  possible rate, without taking into consideration the criteria of  economic efficiency.    The same goes for restoring order in the sphere of foreign  economic activity. Further increasing income by R6.65 trillion  proves to be a less attractive task than the shady  redistribution of state income in favor of privileged  structures. The adoption by the prime minister of new decisions  on granting privileges in violation of legislation was a kind of  reaction to the Duma's demand for the revocation of unlawfully  distributed privileges and the Edict of the President No. 1007  (once again ordering the government to revoke the unlawful  privileges). These include privileges for the purchase of  foreign airplanes (and this in a situation in which domestic  aircraft builders cannot sell finished airliners amid the acute  need to renew the fleet of airplanes, and the program for the  development of civil aircraft is being underfunded), privileges  on the import of goods for the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg  (although usually the organizing parties try to use  international rivalry to stimulate internal demand), and also  privileges for the export of oil to Tatarstan (which is in fact  a subsidy and should be reflected in the distribution of  transfers in the federal budget).    No response has been received to the requests of the  Committee for Economic Policy that the government should present  some kind of justification for the privileges that have been  granted. The same has happened with the inquiries concerning  the number of shares of privatized enterprises retained in  federal ownership and the dividends received on them....    The answer the Ministry of Finance gave to the proposals  made  by the Committee for Economic Policy to increase budget income  by revoking unlawful privileges is curious. It rejects this  proposal because the government has planned to reduce the export  tariff rate, which will entail a reduction in income under the  heading of foreign economic activity. Obviously, no  calculations are cited here. There is no reasonable explanation  for this latest unplanned change in the income base of the  budget in the process of its examination, either. The aim of  such actions is to raise enterprises' income from the export of  raw materials, which have gone up in price in relative terms as  a result of the growth in domestic prices, which outstripped the  fall in the rate of the ruble by 8 percent in the first six  months of the year. But after all, bringing the dynamics of the  ruble rate into line with price dynamics is an obvious measure  in this situation -- the correct policy for the exchange rate  should actually be geared to settling tasks relating to support  for the competitiveness of domestic output and stimulating  exports of it. Instead of this, an obviously damaging decision  is being adopted -- to reduce the export tariff rate, which will  lead not only to a significant and unplanned reduction in budget  income, and consequently, to the underfunding of planned  expenditure and an ensuing increase in nonpayments, but also to  the raising of the domestic prices of raw materials.  Correspondingly, the competitiveness of domestic output will  continue to fall, the structure of exports to worsen, and its  volume to decrease, home-produced goods will inevitably be  squeezed out by imported ones, and domestic production will be  steadily reduced. The income base of the budget will also  undoubtedly be reduced.    The most surprising thing is that the proposal to reduce  export tariffs comes from the Ministry of Finance, which, by  virtue of its functions, should be concerned about increasing  the income base of the budget. It is paradoxical but true that  the State Committee for the Management of State Property is  pursuing a line of spontaneously giving away the property it has  been entrusted with, without even being interested in the income  it brings, and the Ministry of Finance is proposing to reduce  the income part of the budget, and is spending state funds  without conforming to the economic effectiveness of this  expenditure. And the government is approving and supporting  this strange policy, assuring citizens that things are going  well and that there will soon be an upturn, whereas even the  forecasts made by government research centers inexorably testify  to the catastrophic fall in industrial production. As the  famous song goes: "Everything is fine, beautiful Marchioness,  everything is fine..."    The second reading of the draft federal budget, for which  the  Committee for Economic Policy has prepared detailed amendments,  will take place this week. Their adoption will make it possible  to solve the most acute problems of preserving the country's  scientific-industrial potential, developing long-term spheres of  scientific research, effecting conversion of the defense  complex, preventing the degradation of the education system, and  implementing the necessary investment programs. This will not  have to be paid for by an increase in inflation and a growth in  social tension. And responsibility for the management of state  property must be reestablished and violations of legislation in  foreign economic activity must be ended as soon as possible.</p>

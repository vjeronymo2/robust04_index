			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "jk": "`Not Stand Idly By Like a Lamb'"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- At the moment, Austria does "not have the  slightest reason to doubt Italy's loyalty to the treaty,"  Andreas Khol, foreign policy spokesman for the Austrian People's  Party, said in a news conference with South Tirol Governor Luis  Durnwalder in Vienna on Thursday [29 April]. One assumes that  the future government in Rome will not touch South Tirol's  autonomy. If, however, things turn out differently, "we will not  stand idly by like a lamb."    The background to this are statements from neofascist  circles  that form part of the Italian right-wing alliance and that have  challenged parts of South Tirol's autonomy, on the one hand, and  called for the revision of the Osimo treaty, on the other, which  settles Italy's border with the former Yugoslavia.    Durnwalder and Siegfried Brugger, chairman of the South  Tirol  People's Party (SVP), called on Foreign Minister Alois Mock on  Thursday, when they were assured of Austria's function as the  protecting power. Even before, Mock had noted that developments  in Italy would be observed carefully.    As Durnwalder emphasized once more, the SVP will not agree  to  a government with neofascist ministers. If only "the smallest  part" of autonomy be threatened, South Tirol would immediately  resort to all necessary means at all levels. "Then, even  self-determination would no longer be a foreign word to us."    What is irritating for Khol is that fascist ideas have come  to the surface in Italy. Those who challenge the Osimo treaties  , question any postwar borders. "Austria can certainly not keep  out of this dynamism," Khol said in allusion to the Brenner  border.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA correspondent Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 </F> 5468): "The Responsibility Is Totally on the British Side --  Commenting and Analyzing the Origin and Breakdown of the Sino-  British Talks"]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Sino-British talks  on Hong Kong, which people once pinned their hopes on, have  totally broken down. Who pushed the talks into a dead end? Who  should be held responsible?    This correspondent took part in covering the talks from  beginning to end, which lasted more than seven months. From  what I covered and from what I learned from various sources, we  know there is only one answer to these questions: Britain  stubbornly insisted on its erroneous position of "three  violations"; from beginning to end Britain had not the slightest  sincerity towards the talks; and in the absence of a  Sino-British agreement, Hong Kong Governor Patten unilaterally  took action, submitting part of the "constitutional reform  package" to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion.  These are the root causes which resulted in the breakdown of the  talks.    It is evident Patten himself established numerous obstacles  in order to completely block the talks, yet recently he  hypocritically called for "continuing the talks" as if the  responsibility for their breakdown belonged to China. Such an  outdated colonialist trick of the thief calling someone else a  thief and putting all the blame on the victim cannot deceive the  people in light of justified public opinion from the mainland,  Hong Kong, and the world.    As everyone knows, China and Britain held 17 rounds of talks  from 22 April to 27 November 1993. The major topic of the talks  was the final elections to be held in Hong Kong while still  under British rule -- that is, the arrangements for the  1994-1995 elections of the 19 district councils, the two urban  councils (the New Territory Regional Council and the Hong Kong  Island and Kowloon Urban Council), and the Legislative Council.  This deals with a string of specific problems on whether or not  the four-year three-level framework resulting from the elections  will continue after Hong Kong returns to China in 1997. In  other words, it deals with Hong Kong's stable transition and the  smooth handover of Hong Kong's political power in 1997.    Before and during the talks, the outstanding focus of the  dispute between the two sides had persistently revolved around  whether the common understanding, understanding, and agreements  [gong shi, liang tie, xie yi 0364 6224 6156 6043 0588 6231]  reached between the two sides in the past should be abided by --  in other words, it is a problem of whether or not one should act  in good faith.  <H5>  The Origin of Differences and the Proposal for Talks </H5>   In fact, in the decade following 1982, both sides held  protracted, consultative talks on the recovery of Hong Kong by  China, its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong once again,  and the development of the political system during Hong Kong's  transition period. Their talks produced a series of results,  including the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong signed  by both sides, together with relevant agreements,  understandings, and common understandings reached between the  two countries.    The signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration solved all  the problems concerning Hong Kong's reversion and its smooth  transition.    In the process of formulating the "Basic Law" of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region, China incorporated a number  of reasonable suggestions made by Britain, and the latter also  repeatedly promised to converge with the "Basic Law."    In seven letters containing nearly 10,000 characters  corresponded between Chinese and British foreign ministers  shortly before the promulgation of the "Basic Law," they  exchanged views on Hong Kong elections to be held in 1995, the  number of districts in which there would be direct elections of  the Legislative Council, and other issues concerning the  political development of Hong Kong, and reached an understanding  and some agreements in principle.    Therefore, if China and Britan could discuss the issue of  Hong Kong's political system under comparatively cooperative  circumstances during the decade following 1982, it should be an  easy matter for both sides to conduct friendly consultations on  election details when Hong Kong is approaching the elections,  which are due to be held in 1994 and 1995.    However, things went contrary to one's wishes. On 7 October  1992, without prior consultation with China, Britain suddenly  presented a "constitutional package" through Hong Kong Governor  Chris Patten's policy address. It sent a serious message to  China, namely, Britain was prepared to repudiate the basis on  which it had maintained consultations and cooperation with  China over the previous decade and to tear up the agreements  both sides had reached. The method by which the package was put  forward, and its substance, violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the principle of converging with the "Basic Law,"  and the relevant agreements and understandings (called the three  principles for short) reached between the Chinese and British  Governments.    The presentation of the package was such that Chris Patten's  sudden attack directly deviated from the stipulation that the  two countries conduct "discussions," "consultations," and  "deliberations" on matters related to the smooth handover of  Hong Kong's political power in 1997, which are contained in  Annex II of the "Basic Law." Please take a look at a few events  which occurred before the policy address was delivered:    -- First of all, on 18 September 1992, the British FINANCIAL  TIMES reported the news that Britain had made a major change to  Hong Kong's existing political system.    -- When British Foreign Secretary Hurd met Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen in New York on 25 September 1992, he  briefly mentioned Chris Patten's policy package. Foreign  Minister Qian unequivocally set forth China's stand there and  then.    -- Britain sent a brief note to Lu Ping, director of the  Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, and  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu on the policy package  less than 10 days before it was made public. Immediately after  receipt of the notice, Director Lu Ping sent a reply letter,  reaffirming China's stand.    However, ignoring China's persuasions and clinging  obstinately to his course, Chris Patten unilaterally took  action, thereby stirring up an open polemic between China and  Britain which has lasted now for six months.    The core of the "constitutional reform package" is to  emphasize "change."    The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that Hong  Kong's existing political system, economic system, and way of  life will remain unchanged and its laws will remain basically  unchanged. However, Chris Patten has made great changes in the  political development and in the electoral arrangements which  will directly affect the systems after 1997. Several examples  are as follows:    -- Of the 441 members of district boards and two urban  councils, 140 are appointed. Such a practice can complement  direct elections, and help bring in people of ability with  various specialities, and it conforms to the aspirations of the  Hong Kong residents. However, Chris Patten has proposed that  all the appointed seats be abolished.    -- Dual membership of both the Executive Council and the  Legislative Council of Hong Kong has always been permitted, and  some Executive Council members are concurrently Legislative  Council members. Such a practice is conducive to the operation  and mutual restraint of the two councils. However, Chris Patten  has called for a complete separation of the two councils,  attempting to change "leading role of the administration to the  leading role of the legislature" and wantonly raising the status  of the Legislative Council.    -- Articles 45 and 68 of the "Basic Law" stipulate that Hong  Kong's political development should be carried out in accordance  with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. However,  Chris Patten advocates immediate, drastic changes, such as  expanding Hong Kong's basic constituency from fewer than 100,000  voters in 15 functional groups (organized among specialized  people in business, economic and other sectors) in 1991 to 2.7  million, including all non-specialized personnel, by 1995. He  attempts to create chaos and exclude genuine, specialized  personnel on the pretext of "democracy."    Chris Patten's package, therefore, is designed to completely  negate the agreements reached between China and Britain in the  past. Its only purpose is to prop up a pro-Britain, anti-China  force in the Hong Kong Government, turn Hong Kong into an  independent or semi-independent political entity, and thus  continue British rule over Hong Kong in a disguised form after  1997.    Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" has been  strongly criticized by people from all walks of life in Hong  Kong. Early last year, Britain was compelled, under pressure of  criticism, to express its desire to hold talks with China.  Considering the overall interest of Sino-British cooperation,  as well as the fundamental interest of the two countries, the  Chinese side agreed to hold talks between government  representatives of the two countries, hoping the British side  would abandon its "three violations" and return to the track of  Sino-British cooperation. So, the two sides conducted internal  consultations from early February to 12 March. During the  course of consultation, the Chinese side insisted on the "three  principles" as the basis of talks. The British side agreed  verbally, but deliberately complicated the issue and requested  that Hong Kong Government officials participate in the talks as  "official representatives." In order to hold the talks at an  early date, the Chinese side assumed a flexible attitude and  agreed to let Hong Kong Government officials assist British  Government representatives as advisers and experts.    When the two sides were about to reach an agreement on the  talks, Chris Patten suddenly decided to publish the  "constitutional reform bill" in the Hong Kong Government's  Gazette for the purpose of submitting it to the Legislative  Council for discussion. So, the British side unilaterally  discontinued internal consultations between the two sides on 12  March 1993. In early April last year, the two sides resumed  internal contacts and agreed to hold talks in accordance with  the "three principles." To avoid external interference, the two  sides promised to keep the contents of the talks secret.  <H5>  Set Up Obstacles and Talks Bog Down </H5>   During the talks, Chinese Government representatives abided  by the agreement reached between the two sides and, from  beginning to end, did not disclose any substance of the talks to  the press. However, before and after the talks, Chris Patten was  always ready to air his unfavorable view of the talks by every  possible means in an attempt to influence Hong Kong's public  opinion, and even "jumped the gun" to obstruct the smooth  progress of the talks. During interviews with reporters before  every round of talks began, British representatives repeated  that they adopted a "positive" and "constructive" attitude  toward the talks and that they wanted to make efforts to enable  the talks to "ascend a peak," but, on the other hand, they set  up roadblocks from time to time to obstruct the "mountain  climbing" of the talks.    When China and Britain concluded their third round of talks  and were about to begin the fourth, the British authorities in  Hong Kong hastily adopted "Draft Regulations on the Boundary and  Election Commission" on 26 May last year. A few days later, the  Legislative Council's constitution drafting group on 31 May  passed an agenda on holding discussions on a draft plan for  elections once every two weeks [as received]. Thus, Britain  unilaterally took action on issues that should have been solved  by representatives of Chinese and British Governments through  consultation in an attempt to force China to accept Chris  Patten's "constitutional package" and to bring the talks into  Patten's orbit by varying its tactics. China very quickly saw  through the scheme.    Despite the fact Britain made some alterations to Patten's  package under pressure, it still has not given up its erroneous  stand on the "three violations."    During the talks, Britain kept setting new, unreasonable  demands and even attempted to meddle in affairs under China's  jurisdiction by virtue of its sovereignty. For instance,  according to a stipulation of the "Basic Law," the "Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" to be  established by the National People's Congress [NPC] in 1996  "shall be composed of mainland members and no fewer than 50  percent of Hong Kong members and its chairman and members shall  be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee." But Britain  proposed during the talks that Hong Kong members of the  Preparatory Committee must be appointed by China and Britain  through consultation. Britain also wanted China to guarantee  that general elections will be held for the Hong Kong  Legislative Council in 2007, and proposed that the 1995 election  committee established through talks should become the pattern of  the recommendation committee and election committee for the  chief executive of the special region after 1997.    The issue of the "express train" [zhi tong che 4160 6639  6508] was an important agenda item discussed by the two sides.  Elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council are held once  every four years. The Legislative Council elected in 1995 will  remain in office until after 1997. It will be called the Hong  Kong Legislative Council for the first two years and the  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region in the last two. According to a stipulation in a  relevant resolution adopted by the NPC, if the formation of the  Legislative Council elected in 1995 complies with the resolution  and with relevant regulations of the "Basic Law," if its members  support the "Basic Law," and if they are willing to pledge  loyalty to the government of the special region and meet the  qualifications stipulated by the "Basic Law," they may make the  direct transition to become members of the first Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong Special Region in 1997 after they are  approved by the Preparatory Committee of the Special Region.  They are, therefore, described as being in the "express train."  However, Britain proposed that members of the Legislative  Council elected in 1995 become members of the first Legislative  Council after merely swearing an oral oath. This disregards the  basic condition for "boarding the express train" stipulated in  the NPC resolution and attempts to strip the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of its  power to approve Legislative Council members.    Continuous obstructions on the part of Britain made it  difficult for the talks to proceed; the talks kept pacing up and  down at the crossroads.  <H3>  The Motive for Deliberately Complicating the Issue is All  Too Clear </H3>   In order to promote progress in the talks, the Chinese side  in the early stages of the talks proposed that the election of  district boards and the two urban councils and the 1995  Legislative Council election be separated in discussion.  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated the proposal during his  meeting with Foreign Secretary Hurd in New York in October 1993.  The reason is that the district boards and two urban councils  are not organs of a political power by nature, elections to them  involve fewer questions, the questions are relatively easier to  solve, and the elections to them will be held first. The  Legislative Council elections involve such questions as the  functional groups and electoral committees, and the questions  are relatively more difficult to solve. For this reason, we  might take care of elections to the district boards and two  urban councils first, and the elections to the Legislative  Council later. In other words, "easier things first."    The British side at first rejected the proposal, though  later  expressed consent. However, it put forward three conditions --  lowering voting age, adopting the "single-seat, single-vote  voting system," and abolishing appointed seats in the district  boards and two urban councils. Although it insisted on honoring  the agreements reached between the two sides in the past, the  Chinese side assumed a very flexible and open attitude toward  Britain's proposal and agreed to lower the voting age from 21 to  18. It also agreed to adopt the "single-seat, single-vote  voting system" in elections to the district boards and two urban  councils. On the question of appointed council members,  however, the Chinese side maintains that to properly retain the  appointed seats can complement direct elections in terms of  ensuring sufficient number of specialized personnel among the  council members. At the same time, the Chinese side holds that  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself should decide  the number of the appointed seats on the district boards and two  urban councils after 1997, according to Article 98 of the "Basic  Law." By adopting this position, the Chinese side is in fact  giving telling the British side it need not set up more  appointed seats before 30 June 1997.    We could say that the Chinese side has made every compromise  possible to deal with the three conditions set by the British  side. While the two sides had almost reached an agreement in  view over elections to the district boards and two urban  councils, the British side insisted on simultaneous discussion  on the voting method for the Legislative Council election. The  Chinese side continued its restrained and patient attitude, and  maintained that the voting method question could and should be  discussed in later talks, together with the discussion of other  matters concerning Legislative Council elections. The British  side, however, completely ignoring our view, openly and  unilaterally proposed to discontinue the talks on arranging the  election of regional organizations. Such an act clearly showed  that the British side did not have even the slightest bit of  sincerity in the talks. In short, they were pretending to  participate in the talks, but their true intention was to carry  out Patten's package. While the two sides failed to reach  agreement, Chris Patten recently wantonly submitted part of his  reform bill to Hong Kong's Legislative Council for discussion.  Are his motives not all too clear?    The aforesaid facts show that it goes without saying that  the  responsibility for the failure of the talks lies entirely on the  British side. The failure is something which people in all  walks of life on both the mainland and in Hong Kong do not want  to see. The failure to reach an agreement on arrangements for  the 1994/1995 elections also means that the question of the  through train mentioned in the talks has become non-existent  with the end of the talks. The three-level councils, as  component parts of the present British Hong Kong government,  will be disbanded with the end of the British rule in Hong Kong  on 30 June 1997.    People on the Chinese side fully believe that so long as the  6 million Hong Kong residents work hard together, the prosperity  and stability created by them in Hong Kong can surely be  maintained and enhanced. The Chinese side will, as always,  continue to implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration, work  strictly according to the "Basic Law," and earnestly practice  the principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong. We  can anticipate that tomorrow's Hong Kong will certainly become  even more prosperous.</p>

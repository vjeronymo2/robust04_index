			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Perot stumbles as Clinton thrives GOVERNOR Bill Clinton arrived in New York at the weekend for the Democratic party convention, fresh from a demonstration of why, notwithstanding the reluctance of Mr Jesse Jackson, he seems likely to win an overwhelming majority of black and other minority votes in November's presidential election. Mr Jackson, the black Democratic leader who has clashed repeatedly with Mr Clinton over the past few months, offered a grudging endorsement of the Clinton campaign on Saturday night, but on Sunday he went on to make clear that his differences with the Arkansas governor remained unresolved. However, Mr Clinton's warm reception at a meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the leading black and minority rights advocacy groups in the US, suggested that Mr Jackson, though clearly still influential with African-American voters, does not speak for them all. Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, his vice-presidential running mate, received a generally enthusiastic response from the NAACP audience in Nashville on Saturday, contrasting with a cool welcome for Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who appears all but certain to run for the presidency as an independent candidate. In a speech to the NAACP delegates, Mr Perot recounted how well his father had treated his poor black employees and repeatedly referred to 'your people'. Some black leaders at the meeting called the comments condescending. Mr Perot later apologised for his language, but several NAACP delegates said he had betrayed his lack of experience with minorities. Mr Jackson, who has publicly flirted with the idea of backing Mr Perot, despite a clear rebuff from the Perot campaign, was in a more forgiving mood yesterday towards the Texas independent than he has been towards Governor Clinton. 'That gaffe was not intentional,' he said. Senator Gore also said Mr Perot deserved the benefit of the doubt for this 'slip of the tongue', but Governor Ann Richards of Texas, who is chairing this week's Democratic convention, said Mr Perot's remarks suggested 'a level of insensitivity'. 'If you have people working around you . . . who are black, who are brown, who are Asian, who are female, you don't make mistakes like that,' she said. Mr Jackson and his allies have complained that the Clinton campaign has targeted white middle class voters at the expense of poorer urban minorities, and needs to be more inclusive in its approach. But although opinion polls show less than exuberant support for Mr Clinton among black voters, his long experience in southern politics has helped him forge alliances with many black elected officials, such as Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta and Congressman John Lewis. These officials may be just as effective in winning Mr Clinton African-American votes, without requiring the extravagant homage that Mr Jackson regards as his due.

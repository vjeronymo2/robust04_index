			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: La Corporacion revamps zinc unit La Corporacion Banesto, the Spanish industrial group, is planning to recapitalise Asturiana de Zinc, the world's fourth-largest producer of zinc metal. Analysts believe this is a preliminary step towards La Corporacion reducing its majority stake in the company. La Corporacion, owned by Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), has told the Madrid stock exchange commission it intends to re-adjust Astu-riana's balance sheet, by first reducing the company's capital by Pta15.4bn (Dollars 119m). It will then, through a debt-to-equity conversion, inject fresh funds of Pta15bn in a rights issue which will be wholly-subscribed by La Corporacion. La Corporacion will pay above market price for Asturiana's new shares: in any event, it will not pay less than Pta1,600, compared with the current trading price of just over Pta1,500. The deal will raise its holding in the company from 51 per cent to around 55 per cent. Analysts said the financial engineering would significantly strengthen the zinc company's balance sheet by reducing its debt from Pta31bn to Pta16bn. Also, an upturn in zinc prices indicates Asturiana is set to increase profitability. It is expected to turn forecast losses this year of Pta3.2bn into profits of Pta2.5bn next year, and of Pta7.9bn in 1996. La Corporacion realised Pta1.6bn in September when it sold 23 per cent of its shareholding in Asturiana.</p>

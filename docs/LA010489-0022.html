			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE COALITION REINTRODUCES ERA IN CONGRESS  </P> <P> A bipartisan coalition of more than 130 House members on Tuesday reintroduced  the equal rights amendment in Congress.  </P> <P> The amendment, which became the first joint resolution of the 101st Congress,  must be approved by two-thirds of both the House and Senate and ratified by  three-fourths of the states to become part of the Constitution.  </P> <P> The extended deadline for ratification of the last ERA resolution expired June  30, 1982, three states short of the 38 necessary to support the amendment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Equality of Rights'  </P> <P> The amendment introduced Tuesday, like the previous resolution, states:  "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United  States or by any state on account of sex."  </P> <P> The measure was co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 137 House members. Its  primary sponsor is Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), who chairs the House  Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. Among co-sponsors  are Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr. (R-N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the House  Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a longtime ERA  proponent.  </P> <P> The resolution is expected to be introduced in the Senate next month, and  Edwards said he expects to hold hearings on the measure before his subcommittee  in February or March.  </P> <P> "Let this year be the one in which we finally bring women into the  Constitution," Edwards said in a statement. "It is time we extend full equality  of rights under the law to all of our citizens."  </P></p>

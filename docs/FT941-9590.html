			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Wickes - Other companies The DIY and timber retailer is expected on Thursday to announce a strong increase in full-year profits to Pounds 17m-Pounds 19m, more than double last year's pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 7.8m. Analysts are keen to hear whether Wickes is benefiting from the upturn in the housing market, but are concerned about the impact of the recession on its continental European operations. They are also anxious for good news on current trading, after Wickes introduced deep price cuts on 1,000 of its 3,500 products in its latest catalogue.</p>

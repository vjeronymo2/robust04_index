			<p>BFN     [Text] The Presidents of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are  meeting at the Latvian resort of Jurmala today. The agenda of  the presidents' closed meeting includes: the Russian-Latvian  agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops and future policy  toward Russia, the Polish-Lithuanian treaty on good-neighborly  relations, and other political matters.    The presidents will meet in private without even their  advisers present. A Baltic News Service correspondent learned  in Jurmala, where the presidents are holding the meeting, that  they are not going to hold a news conference, although a joint  statement could be released.    Final arrangements for the meeting and the topics for  discussion were made by Presidents Guntis Ulmanis, Algirdas  Brazauskas, and Lennart Meri by phone yesterday.    The meeting was provisionally planned for an earlier date,  but it was decided to hold it following the visit to Moscow by  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis.</p>

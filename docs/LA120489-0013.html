			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS  </P> <P> Does Saudi Arabia have a "consistent record of commitment to economic and  political stability in the Middle East," as Shehab claims? If so, this  commitment is at the expense and to the detriment of Third World and Western  nations.  </P> <P> During the economically turbulent 1970s and early 1980s, oil price gouging by  Saudi Arabia and OPEC plunged the world's economies into crisis. Remember $40  barrels of oil and the long lines at gasoline stations?  </P> <P> Adding to Saudi Arabia's lack of concern for the U.S. economy is its voting  record at the United Nations. Saudi Arabia voted with the United States only 8%  of the time, while voting in agreement with the Soviet Union 100% of the time.  Thus, politically and economically, Saudi Arabia has, more often than not,  maintained a record of opposition to U.S. interests.  </P> <P> Shehab's claim that this Saudi "friendship" should be rewarded in the form of  U.S. tank sales is outrageous and insulting. Saudi Arabia has demonstrated  again and again its preoccupation with its own self-interest and an  unwillingness to aid America's interests.  </P> <P> DAVID A.

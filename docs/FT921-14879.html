			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: RSPB executive's case for Fisons finding solution on peat bogs Sir, Fisons' director, Mr D R Peters, (Letters, January 9) describes the company's peat extraction operation as 'an environmental issue of small commercial significance'. But since peat extraction has brought Fisons into direct conflict with Britain's leading environmental organisations, one might well ask why it is still being continued. The destruction of peat bogs may be of small significance to Fisons, but many are sites of prime nature conservation importance, which can suffer irreplaceable damage through large scale industrial peat extraction. Peat is not a sustainable resource when mined wholesale from bogs, and companies operating within Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) must recognise their wider responsibilities. Attempts to resolve this conflict require an imaginative and flexible approach. Some companies have seen the economic sense in developing alternatives to peat. Retailers, such as B &amp; Q, now offer alternatives while refusing to stock peat mined from SSSIs. It would seem to be in Fisons' best interests to reach a solution which does not damage the remaining peat bogs and secures a wider share of the peat alternatives market and its shareholders should urge it to do so, Barbara Young, chief executive, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, The Lodge, Sandy, Bedfordshire</p>

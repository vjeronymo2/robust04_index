			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: United they fall The foreign exchange market appears to be losing patience with European countries that dawdle over cutting interest rates. While the Spanish peseta was resilient in the face of yesterday's half point cut in money rates, the French and Belgian francs have come under pressure. According to conventional wisdom, the exchange markets will soon force these countries to crack. Unless they cut their interest rates below those in Germany, recession will swell their budget deficits uncontrollably. Paradoxically, lower interest rates, which would alleviate this risk, might actually strengthen their currencies. Yet there is a large difference with the situation at the end of July when the French franc was at its floor in the ERM. Now the D-Mark could rise another 36 centimes before the resolve of the authorities to defend its wide-band limits would be tested. The Belgian franc is more vulnerable as long as the country has no social pact, but a similar argument applies. Currency speculators are not remotely in sight of the substantial short-term gains which drove them into such a frenzy in July. As long as they continue to believe German rates will fall reasonably soon, the French authorities, and probably the Belgians too, may still consider temporary currency weakness preferable to an open severance of their link to German policy. A belief that this link is paramount for long-term credibility on inflation would explain their behaviour since the August crisis. It is cold comfort to British exporters who are looking for signs of economic life on the continent to fill up their order books.</p>

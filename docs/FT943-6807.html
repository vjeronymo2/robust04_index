			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Japanese borrower launches Dollars 500m issue The Eurobond market appeared to start winding down for the long weekend, with London closed for a bank holiday on Monday. Japan Highway Public Corporation launched its long-awaited Dollars 500m 10-year bond issue, with Nomura and LTCB International as joint lead managers. The bonds were priced slightly more tightly than expected, yielding 32 basis points over Treasuries at their re-offer price. The spread widened slightly after the issue was freed to trade, but it is expected to be held in by the lead managers. Some east Asian demand was reported, but the majority was said to have been taken up by European institutional investors. However, the prospect of heavy supply of Japanese government-backed bonds in the near future held some investors back, one trader said. A swap opportunity in the Ecu market spurred the launch of two retail-targeted four-year bond issues from triple-A rated borrowers: Ecu150m for KfW International Finance via BZW and Ecu100m for General Electric Capital Corporation via UBS. Both deals were priced almost identically, offering a 7 3/4 per cent coupon and maturing on the same day. Both lead managers reported solid demand for their deals from Swiss and Benelux retail accounts, helped partly by investors' desire to roll over funds from expiring Ecu bonds. In the Canadian dollar sector, Toronto-Dominion Bank led an issue of CDollars 100m of five-year bonds for itself. Priced to yield 23 basis points over the interpolated Canadian government bond yield curve, the terms were deemed by some to be too aggressive, but others said recent Swiss and Benelux retail demand for four-year Canadian dollar paper would lend the issue support. 'It's not a generous spread, but the issue will go over time,' said one syndicate official. Late in the day, CS First Boston launched a three-tranche asset-backed issue totalling Dollars 1.2bn for Banc One Student Loan Trust.</p>

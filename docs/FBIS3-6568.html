U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, host of the first  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers  meeting, promised there will be no "arm twisting" from  Washington. "APEC is pioneering a model of consensus-building  which I believe we can adopt here," Bentsen said in opening  remarks to the group's first of two closed-door discussion  sessions Saturday.    The APEC ministers sat down to swap experiences of how their  countries are promoting economic growth. The discussion came  after spending Friday getting to know each through informal  bilateral and multilateral contacts.    "Overall, there were no sharp disagreements during the  course  of discussion," U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers  told reporters. Summers said there was a general consensus  among APEC ministers of the importance of "market forces" in  promoting economic growth and the flow of capital to developing  countries in the region.    The APEC ministers were scheduled to wind up the two-day  event with a joint press appearance Saturday afternoon where  Bentsen was to release a "chair's summary" of their  behind-the-door deliberations.    APEC, a loosely organized group set up in 1989, groups  Japan,  the United States, Canada and Mexico along with some of the  world's fastest growing economies in East Asia. The 17 APEC  members, rising to 18 with the addition of Chile this fall,  account for half of the world's economic output and generate 1  trillion dollars in trade among them.    The United States, which proposed the finance ministers  meeting at the APEC summit held last November in Seattle, has  sought to ease the flows of capital investment and promote more  open financial markets in the region.    The fast-growing countries in the region acknowledge that  they need a bigger inflow of foreign capital to develop their  economic infrastructure, but are wary of pressure to open their  financial markets at a pace they see as too fast.    "There is no question that we must encourage the flows of  international capital into our countries," Indonesian Finance  Minister Mari'e Muhammad said in a paper describing Indonesia's  policies to promote private capital inflows.    Developing countries "need a temporary breathing space" to  build their own financial service sectors, Malaysian Finance  Minister Ibrahim Anwar told reporters.    There was persistent concern within among Southeast Asian  members of the APEC group that they might be forced to conform  against their wishes in the search for common APEC financial  policies. "Given the diversity of our cultures, political  systems, and economic backgrounds, we can only (accomplish APEC  goals) through open and honest dialogue," Muhammad told his APEC  colleagues Saturday.    Hong Kong, a freewheeling haven in east Asia, however,  believes that the road to prosperity lies in less government  intervention. "Free enterprise offers the best means of  ensuring allocation of resources to the most efficient and  profitable business ventures," Hong Kong's Treasury Secretary  Donald Tsang said.    Tsang argued that a noninterventionist policy does not mean  the government "just sits back and does nothing."    "The government must create and maintain a socioeconomic  environment that is conducive to business growth," he said.    Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said financial  markets should be open but advised his APEC colleagues that  market opening measures should be carried out in a "balanced  manner." "Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii said.</p>

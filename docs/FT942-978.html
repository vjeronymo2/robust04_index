			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Accountancy dips its toe in corporate water: KPMG's look at restructuring could be part of a trend When the UK's largest accountancy firms announced their latest fee-income results earlier this month Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, predicted that incorporation was eventually inevitable in the profession. Little was he to know how quickly his thoughts might come true, as a group in rival KPMG Peat Marwick's top management was already considering that option. This Friday the most senior partners in KPMG are set to debate options for the future structure of their firm, which may lead to one of the most radical restructurings of the profession since its historical roots in the last century. If it goes through, the firm would for the first time be able to gain some protection of partners' personal assets. In exchange there would be both tax implications and the requirement for public filing of information - including financial results. The main reason for incorporation is seen to be an attempt to protect the firms from the growing number of legal actions seeking redress for alleged negligent advice. Although it has never happened a claim can theoretically lead to the forfeiture of both the property, cash and other assets of the firm, and of all the individual assets of each of its partners - as its owners, all of them have unlimited liability. In a company the shareholders have no such commitment. Some have also argued that a significant driving force towards change is the tax system. In the next three years changes instituted by the Inland Revenue will mean that partnerships will have to move towards paying taxes on a 'current-year' basis - they would no longer be able to defer their payments to future years. At the very least, this change removes one of the attractions of partnership. Incorporation is not simply being considered in the UK. In the US, where the liability crisis facing accountants is much more serious, all the larger firms are at an advance stage of preparation for change. Most are expected to take advantage of laws in Delaware, which will allow them to register as limited partnerships, protecting their assets across the country - at least as far as this state's rules are accepted by the courts in other states. Yet in the UK there has been little sign so far of incorporation. Under by-laws issued by the ethical committee of the chartered accountancy institutes, firms have for many years been able to provide certain services through companies, notably data processing and management consultancy. More recently changes introduced in the 1989 Companies Act and in professional ethical rules amended in late 1991 have meant that all services provided by accountancy firms - including the core audit function - can be provided through companies. Firms that are incorporated can exploit laxer regulation. For example, to use the title 'chartered accountants' they need only ensure that three-quarters of the voting rights of the firm are held by chartered accountants. For partnerships, chartered accountants must also comprise three-quarters by number of those in charge. Yet the up-take remains small. Figures from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales show that of 19,409 practitioner firms and individuals, 192 operate through companies. One reason may be a reluctance by the firms to disclose their fee income - something they have always been able to keep secret in spite of growing calls for greater accountability. Another is tax. Partners in a company would be required to pay at least an additional 10 per cent in National Insurance contributions on top of their existing income taxes. They could avoid this if they received their income in dividends rather than salary. But some fear a future Labour government might introduce a new dividend tax which would prove at least as costly. An internal briefing paper prepared last year by the largest eight UK firms in response to the audit liability crisis said that incorporation was no solution, because partners could still be sued in their personal capacity. KPMG is nevertheless looking at options involving a more complex structure than pure incorporation. By having a series of subsidiaries with a range of legal structures, and most partners as shareholders rather than directors, most may be able to protect personal assets. Those directly involved in work for which they are subsequently sued could still be sued personally. One thing is certain. KPMG's rivals will be watching its actions over the next few weeks with considerable interest. They all have a personal stake in the outcome. Option to incorporate, Page 25</p>

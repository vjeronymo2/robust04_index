			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / French farm policy under fire in Cairns group When the Cairns group of 14 farm exporting nations meet in Geneva this weekend, there can be little doubt their common bogey will be France, and the Balladur government's pre-emptive strike against liberalisation of farm trade. 'Agriculture negotiations in the Uruguay Round are not merely a transatlantic affair,' said Mr Peter Cook, Australia's trade minister and chairman of the Cairns group, during meetings in Brussels with top trade negotiators from both the European Community and the US. 'There are many countries across the developing world that are in much tougher situations than the French over farm trade, but they are still playing a positive role in the round,' he said. 'France is likely to find itself in a situation of splendid isolation. The answer to its problems has to be found in Europe.' For the Cairns group, which represents countries ranging from Australia and Canada to Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina and Uruguay, liberalisation of trade in farm goods is key to their support for the Uruguay round. Many of their economies have been severely hit by barriers against exporting to the EC, Japan and the US. Subsidised EC exports of surplus farm produce has also devastated farm prices on world markets, damaging export earnings, and undermining domestic farm sectors. The group is expected to deliver at the end of its summit a polite but unequivocal rebuttal of French aims. It is likely to insist on: no renegotiation of the US-EC Blair House agreement limiting European exports of subsidised farm goods; no removal of farm trade from the Uruguay round agenda; speedy action by the EC to come forward with significant cuts in tariffs on its imported farm products. no exceptions to the rule that quota limits on farm imports should gradually be replaced by tariffs. The minimum commitments in the draft Uruguay Round agreement tabled at the end of 1991 involved tariffs being cut by an average of 36 per cent over six years, with no imported item escaping with cuts of less than 15 per cent.</p>

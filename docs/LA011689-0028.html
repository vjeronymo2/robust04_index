			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SYMPHONY REVIEW;  </P> <P> UNDER SHAW'S BATON, CONCERT WAS ODE TO JOY  </P> <P> The challenges of presenting a monument such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony are  legion. Too much reverence may induce somnolence, but a jaunty approach risks  reducing lofty aspirations to catchy jingles. Even in its own era, the "Choral"  Symphony's naive, homely themes invited critical derision as mere back alley  tunes. It takes a seasoned hand to shape this mighty, sprawling work and probe  the depth of the composer's vision.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the San Diego Symphony secured the services of Robert Shaw to  conduct the local orchestra and San Diego Master Chorale in the Ninth. Still  effervescent and curious as he approaches his 72nd year, Shaw brought the best  of both worlds to his conducting. The Atlanta Symphony's conductor laureate  displayed the vigor of a youthful spirit and the security of a mature  technique.  </P> <P> Friday night at Symphony Hall the Shaw trademarks were evident in abundance:  crisp diction from the chorus and precise rhythmic inflection from both singers  and instrumentalists; brisk but not breakneck tempos, and a broad palette of  finely-tuned dynamic levels. Most rewarding to the listener was the dramatic  tension he built from the opening phrase of every movement, which he carefully  tended and sustained through the widest arches of the composer's architecture.  He conducted as if no motif were superfluous and every idea had a unique  calling in the ultimate scheme.  </P> <P> If such analyses appear unduly fussy, it is only because the level of  conducting practiced on this orchestra's podium over the last two seasons  leaves so much to be desired from the twin perspectives of technique and  inspiration. Guest conductors routinely drive through scores on auto pilot, or  engage in displays of cute choreography that add nothing to the music but  visual distraction. Shaw's solid stance and clean-cut motions put the prancers  and dancers to shame.  </P> <P> It was a great night for the Master Chorale, which sounded fresh and  enthusiastic after sitting through the lengthy opening movements. Slightly  augmented with additional voices for this concert, the chorale gave the maestro  the lithe, disciplined sound he asked for. Their German was more than  recognizable, but their timbre lacked richness and they did not muster a  thrilling forte. But they have room to grow.  </P> <P> Overall, the orchestra put its best foot forward for Shaw. Execution of those  delicate little fugues for strings, especially in the second movement, exposed  those sections' lack of precision and nervous entrances. Surprisingly, the  usually reliable cellos fell short of tonal perfection in their solos at the  opening of the finale. However, the orchestra's solid ensemble and well-focused  energy left an overriding positive impression.  </P> <P> Among the quartet of vocal soloists, bass-baritone Terry Cook's stentorian  lyricism and soprano Lorna Haywood's luminous, arched phrases made solid  impressions. Tenor Jon Garrison sounded a trifle forced, and mezzo Shirley Love  seemed unduly buried by the other voices, although the entire quartet was  placed at the far side of the stage -- hardly a favorable position from which  to sing over the orchestra.  </P> <P> Shaw opened the evening with the overture from Bach's Third Orchestral Suite.  Oddly, he reduced the number of players for the Bach, then urged them to push  out more volume. This notion was not successful; it only made the Baroque work  sound tense and distorted. For the Beethoven it was an unnecessary prelude.  </P></p>

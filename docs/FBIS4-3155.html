			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton reaffirmed today that the United States "maintain  absolutely firm support" of the United Nations' policy on  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Clinton told reporters at the White House that since the  U.N.  has taken a more vigorous approach, asked NATO to provide close  air support and created the safe zone around Sarajevo,  "substantial progress has been made."    "We've had relative peace in the Sarajevo area," he added,  "we've had the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims  which is holding."    Clinton conceded that there were "some friction as a result  of the last round of very modest airstrikes as a result of the  shelling of Gorazde."    Under U.N. and NATO direction, U.S. warplanes carried out  air  strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim  enclave of Gorazde on Monday [11 April] and Tuesday.    Clinton claimed that "we can't have our U.N. personnel there  vulnerable to shelling and to attack with no one there to defend  them."    But, the President said, "the United States has no interest  in having NATO become involved in this war and trying to gain  advantage for one side over the other."    "Our position is to be firm but not provocation and not  trying to change the military balance," he stressed.    Clinton called upon all the parties to get back to the  negotiations, saying that is "the most important thing."</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV REPORTED MISLED ON PRISONERS  </P> <P> Two American congressmen who visited a notorious Soviet prison camp said  Thursday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is being misled by officials who  tell him there are no longer any political prisoners in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In fact, the congressmen said, most of the prisoners they interviewed Wednesday  at Perm Camp 35, 1,000 miles from Moscow in the Ural Mountains, told them they  had been imprisoned for such offenses as trying to emigrate or to form groups  to monitor human rights abuses in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "We spoke to 24 of the 38 prisoners held in Perm, and most of them declared  they were political prisoners," Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) said.  </P> <P> He said prisoners told them that as punishment, they were placed in isolation  cells with cement platforms for beds and denied sheets or blankets, even though  the cells were icy cold in winter. Some said that for years, they were denied  mail or visits from relatives.  </P> <P> "They ought to close the camp down," Wolf said. "It's a terrible place and  ought not to be in existence."  </P> <P> Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) said that Gorbachev, who told the United  Nations in November that all political prisoners had been released, was  probably speaking in good faith but "may have been misled by his own people."  </P> <P> Smith said he was told that Gorbachev had never personally visited Perm. It  appears, he said, that many prison officials "have not yet been de-Stalinized"  -- a reference to the dictator Josef Stalin, who sent millions of political  opponents to prison camps or into exile.  </P> <P> The congressmen, the first American lawmakers to visit the prison camp,  declined to specify how many of the inmates of Perm they believe are there for  political reasons. They said they had spoken to some of the prisoners for only  5 or 10 minutes.  </P> <P> According to Richard M. Stephenson Jr., a State Department officer who  accompanied the congressmen, the department knows of more than 100 prisoners of  conscience in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indirect Confirmation  </P> <P> Stephenson said that the prison official who runs Perm 35, Lt. Col. Nikolai  Osin, indirectly acknowledged that there are prisoners of conscience. He said  that after the congressmen toured Perm, Osin said, "Can you tell us about your  political prisoners, now that you have seen ours?"  </P> <P> The prison camp, named for the industrial town of Perm that is situated nearby,  acquired a reputation for inhuman conditions after former prisoners -- among  them Natan Sharansky, a former refusenik who now lives in Israel -- told their  stories to the West.  </P> <P> The congressmen praised Soviet officials for permitting them to visit the camp.  They said this was a case of bringing "glasnost to the gulag" -- openness to  the Soviet prison camp system.  </P> <P> They said Perm appeared to have been dressed up for their visit, with walls  freshly whitewashed, floors polished and flowers placed in the barracks.  </P> <P> But they said they remain convinced that prison conditions are terrible. They  said that if the Soviet Union does not make improvements before the Helsinki  Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to take place here in 1991, the Kremlin  may well be embarrassed by criticism.  </P> <P> The congressmen said some of the prisoners told them that they had been  punished for speaking to A. M. Rosenthal, a New York Times columnist and former  executive editor, who in December, 1988, was the first Westerner to visit Perm  35. Some inmates, they said, told them that prison officials refused to give  them packages sent by their families and denied them showers.  </P> <P> Stephenson said the kind of punishments meted out at Perm "seemed well  calculated to break a man's will." For example, he said, prisoners were often  denied protection from the cold and refused small treats like chocolate.  </P> <P> But the congressmen described the camp's inmates as "proud and courageous."  </P></p>

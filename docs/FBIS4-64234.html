			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition Raises Its Head as </F> Berlusconi's Hour Nears"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 --- The opposition Democratic  Left and Green parties on Thursday [28 April] warned of alleged  dangers to freedom of the press and possible conflicts of  interest if President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro gives media magnate  Silvio Berlusconi a mandate to form a government coalition, as  he is widely expected to do later this afternoon.    At a press conference, Green spokesman Carlo Ripa Di Meana  announced his group has issued an official protest to the Lower  House speaker, claiming that a mandate to Berlusconi would  violate current laws on conflicts of interest and appealed to  the president "to reflect with all his wisdom to avoid an  intolerable moral and political distortion."    Ripa Di Meana also claimed that Scalfaro, in private  consultations with Green party officials, acknowledged that the  March elections which swept Berlusconi's three-way coalition to  victory were "unequal." "I quote directly, unequal," he  repeated, referring to Berlusconi's ownership of the country's  three largest private television networks, controlled by his  Fininvest Group.    Pierluigi Capone, an attorney for the Greens, asserted that  Berlusconi, being in control of three nationwide TV  broadcasters, stands in violation of a 1957 law on conflicts of  interest. He said "the army of Fininvest employees and  officials who are filling up the Lower House" are in the same  position.    Separately, Democratic Left Party Secretary Achille Occhetto  said a mandate to Berlusconi "raises serious concerns" because  "the Fininvest owner would assume political power and, at the  same time, enormous economic power, especially power over  information, something that has no equal in other countries."    Occhetto wondered whether "democratic guarantees will be  respected, beginning with the right to information" under such  conditions.    "We must prevent Fininvest from acting in the service of the  executive," he added, claiming that the guarantees offered by  the president are certainly part of his duties but not enough to  guarantee plurality in mass media.</p>

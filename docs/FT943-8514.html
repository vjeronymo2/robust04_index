			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Lib Dems diverge over tax proposals The Liberal Democrats yesterday suggested giving people a greater choice over parts of the taxation system by asking them which projects they would like to be paid for by taxes. The radical proposals, contained in a preliminary report by one of the party's working groups, appeared, however, to run ahead of what the Lib Dems are prepared to advocate as national policy. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's Treasury spokesman, while calling for the tax system to be more transparent, distanced himself from some of the bolder suggestions contained in the report, Being Honest About Taxation. The report group says ear-marking, or 'hypothecation', of some tax for specific projects would help clarify the link between tax and spending. The report suggests converting National Insurance Contributions into a 'pensions payment' to clarify its purpose and that every household should receive an annual government statement of tax and spending plans. It also says that health, which accounts for more than Pounds 30bn of government spending, could be covered by allocating to it excise duties on alcohol and tobacco and a smaller slice of income tax. Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the proposals were 'confusing and dishonest', and questioned why health spending should be dictated by alcohol and tobacco consumption. Mr Bruce said he did not believe that the ear-marking of taxes could work across the board, but it could make a significant difference on the 'margin'. He accepted that if the hypothecation was too big people would forget what they had been asked to pay for. He said, however, that people would not mind paying more tax if they knew what it was going towards. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour Treasury spokesman, criticised the proposals as 'a soggy confusion of concepts'. Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'It simply tells us what we already know, that the Liberal Democrats want to increase public expenditure and will have to raise taxes.'

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Arts: Music in western Switzerland Ninety years old and still game for a song: Hugues Cuenod, Swiss tenor extraordinaire, celebrated his 90th birthday last month with a special concert in his home town of Vevey on Lake Geneva. With Cuenod, the years do not seem to count. Here was a spry man of tall, upright posture, elegant and witty, occasionally extravagant in manner, keeping his audience amused with a few select stories and songs, and generously sharing the stage with pupils and friends. Cuenod is the sole surviving link with a whole era of composers, performers and teachers who helped shape 20th century musical history. He premiered works by Honegger and Milhaud in the 1930s, was a regular recital partner of Clara Haskil and Dinu Lipatti, created the part of Sellem in The Rake's Progress in 1951 and was a noted interpreter of Schutz, Monteverdi and baroque composers long before they returned to fashion. British audiences know him primarily from his Glyndebourne days (more than 400 performances). In recent years he has won admirers among a younger generation at master classes in Aldeburgh and Manchester - and it is good to know he intends to return. His birthday concert, attended by le tout Vevey and televised throughout Switzerland, was a pot-pourri designed to appeal to the widest possible audience, and yet it summed up the man and his artistry. On stage, Cuenod has never pretended to be anything more than a character tenor but his gifts go much further. A selection of Apollinaire songs by Poulenc, followed by Babar the elephant, demonstrated undiminished powers of characterisation and timing. His unaccompanied rendering of a fragment of Orlando di Lasso found him still capable of a long vocal line. Like Peter Pears, Cuenod's trademark has always been his command of style and expression: what appealed was not so much the timbre of the voice, but what he did with it. Judging by the rest of the Vevey programme, Cuenod remains young at heart. There were interludes of soul, jazz and contemporary dance. Michel Dalberto played Debussy, Nikita Magaloff a Faure Impromptu. Nicolai Gedda offered Lensky's aria, revealing technique and artistry unimpaired, even if the tone has lost its bloom. The event was staged in Vevey's attractive little theatre, which after lying shut for the best part of 20 years has just been given a SFr15m renovation (a quarter paid by Nestle). The other outstanding end-of-season event in western Switzerland was Attila at the Grand Theatre, Geneva, with Samuel Ramey and Elizabeth Connell (which was broadcast live on Radio 3). Ramey's prowess in the title role has helped re-establish this opera on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 10 years. His voice has the agile muscularity to cover up Verdi's fitful inspiration - the cabaletta to his dramatic first act aria brought the house down, a rare accolade in Geneva - and he looks so good, with bare breast, pony-tale and fur cloak, like an amalgam of Noble Savage and Genghis Khan. But with Ramey, physique and voice are everything: despite his vast improvement as an actor, he still lacks the animal magnetism of a Raimondi. Jerome Savary's production, a succession of picturesque early Romantic landscapes first seen last year in Milan, offered an equally flattering platform for Miss Connell, who has now unmistakably settled into her prime in the dramatic soprano repertory. Her high-voltage Odabella (which is to be repeated alongside Ramey at Covent Garden next season) has everything this fearsome role needs - grandezza, confident, declamatory attack and pearl-like mastery of line and decoration  -and she moves remarkably well on stage. With strong performances from Paolo Coni as Ezio and Michael Sylvester as Foresto, and lusty contributions from chorus and orchestra under Gabriele Ferro, Attila came across as an exciting foretaste of Macbeth and later operas, laced with the irresistible vitality of youth.</p>

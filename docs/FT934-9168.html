			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar features in subdued day ACTIVITY in the foreign exchange market was relatively subdued as traders squared positions ahead of today's holidays in many important markets, writes Conner Middelmann. However, the US dollar had another volatile day and weakened significantly against the yen and the D-Mark in late London trading. It closed at DM1.6920, down from DM1.6950 the previous day, and fell as low as DM1.6870 in London after-hours' trading. Against the Japanese unit, it ended at Y107.20, down from Tuesday's close of Y108.25. New York trading finished with the dollar at DM1.6875 and Y107.08. Throughout the morning, most currencies languished in narrow ranges as traders awaited the release of the October US consumer price index. Following the publication of much lower than expected producer prices on Tuesday, traders were looking to the latest CPI data for a clarification of the inflation outlook in the US. In the event, the 0.4 per cent month-on-month increase in the overall inflation rate was broadly in line with market forecasts, although some who had hoped for a lower number after Tuesday's weak PPI data were disappointed. 'The CPI numbers indicate that we do not have to revise our inflation picture, despite Tuesday's PPI,' said Mr Rainer Marian, senior market analyst at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt. He expects the dollar to continue trading in a DM1.68 to DM1.71 range in the near term and the dollar/D-Mark rate to continue tracking the yield spread between German 10-year bonds, or bunds, and 10-year US Treasury notes. The benchmark bund currently yields 5.88 per cent, some 12 basis points above its US counterpart, and as that gap narrows, the dollar is likely to appreciate further against the D-Mark, Mr Marian added. However, he warned that the next leg of the rally could be preceded by a correction back to around DM1.67. The D-Mark gained some support yesterday after comments by Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the future president of the European Monetary Institute. He said the date of 1997 for creation of a single EC currency was 'improbable', which was seen as an indication that the D-Mark would remain the strongest currency in Europe. Sterling made up most of the losses suffered on Tuesday and posted solid gains on largely technical trading. It ended at DM2.4975, up from a previous DM2.4900, and against the dollar it rose to Dollars 1.4760 from Dollars 1.4685. The Belgian franc weakened further as market participants focused on the spectre of widespread strikes over controversial plans for a social pact. The currency finished at BFr21.42 to the D-Mark, compared with Tuesday's BFr21.35. Belgium and France will be closed today for a national holiday. After stabilising during early London trading, the Canadian dollar later came under further selling pressure.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: STRAIGHT FROM CELEBRITIES' LIPS  </P> <P> Lots of people collect autographs. It's a fairly common hobby -- seeking the  signatures of famous men and women.  </P> <P> Jilly Eddy, of Walnut Creek, Calif., has a similar hobby. Similar, but quite  different. Eddy collects lip prints.  </P> <P> "Lip prints are just what they sound like," said Eddy, who sells appliances for  Sears. "They're prints of people's lips." Lip prints, she said, are also  referred to as "lipographs."  </P> <P> Eddy, 44, said she has been collecting lip prints for almost 10 years. "I keep  them in a lip print book," she said. "It's pretty much like an autograph book,  except it's filled with people's lip prints."  </P> <P> On each page of her lip print book is the lip print of a different person. "A  lip print is much more personal than an autograph," Eddy said. "People sign  their names lots of times. They sign checks and stuff every day. They don't  even think about it. A lip print, though, is special. You have to press your  lips against a piece of paper. And each lip print is as individual as a  fingerprint. No two lip prints are the same. But a lip print is much more  sensuous than a fingerprint."  </P> <P> In order to give Eddy a lip print, a person must first put lipstick on his or  her mouth (more about that in a moment). Then there is a certain technique. .  .well, let's have Eddy explain it herself:  </P> <P> "You put the lipstick on. You keep your mouth open just a bit when you're  pressing it onto the paper. While you do it, you should pretend that you're  kissing someone you really like -- pretend that you're giving that person a  good kiss. Without any tongue, though -- that leaves a smudge."  </P> <P> The results, she said, are beautiful.  </P> <P> "I like lip prints from a person who has nice, full lips. Lips that have a nice  shape to them. The best kind of upper lip, I think, has a bowed shape, with an  indentation in the top. The best lower lips are just a little fuller than the  upper lip."  </P> <P> She claims she can tell something about a person just by his or her lip print:  </P> <P> "I have found that a person with full lips usually likes to talk a lot --  people whose lip prints are full are gabbers. People with thin lips tend to be  more conservative."  </P> <P> Eddy collects lip prints from both men and women. This sometimes presents a  problem. As we have noted, to give a lip print, a person must put on lipstick.  </P> <P> "Women tend to love the idea," Eddy said. "They really get into doing this. I  tell them to put on a really bright red lipstick. Most women wear peach  lipstick or pink lipstick; but for a lip print to look good, I tell the women  to put on the kind of lipstick that Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield used to  wear. Bright, bright red, really spread over the lips thickly.  </P> <P> "Some men are willing to put lipstick on if they know it's for the purpose of a  lip print. The others, though, I tell to kiss a woman who's wearing a lot of  lipstick, and then to put their lip prints in my book while the women's  lipstick is still on their lips. It's pretty easy: A man kisses a woman, then  he kisses my book."  </P> <P> Interestingly, this man-kisses-a-woman-then-kisses-the-book technique was first  tried out on a rather well-known man: Johnny Cash.  </P> <P> "I was living in Bellingham, Wash., at the time, and I was driving a limousine  for a living," Eddy said. "I was driving Johnny Cash when he was in town, and I  picked him up at the Holiday Inn; he was with his manager and his lead  guitarist. He signed his autograph for me, and I told him that I would rather  have his lip print.  </P> <P> "He didn't say anything for a second, and then in this deep, deep voice he  said: 'I don't wear lipstick.' So I said to him, 'Well, what you can do is kiss  someone who does wear lipstick, and then kiss my book.' He said, 'Well, OK,'  and he gave me a big kiss and then he kissed my lip print book.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, I was wearing this very expensive Estee Lauder nonsmudge  lipstick that day, and because it was nonsmudge, not all that much of it got on  Johnny Cash's lips, so his lip print in my book is sort of faint."  </P> <P> One of the nice things about collecting lip prints, Eddy said, is that --  unlike autographs -- a lip print from a non-celebrity can be as good as a lip  print from a celebrity. With an autograph, it's how famous the person is; with  a lip print, it's how good the person's lips are.  </P> <P> And, no, Eddy said, there is absolutely no way to tell from a person's lip  print whether or not that person is a good kisser.  </P></p>

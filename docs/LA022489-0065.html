			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SPANISH AIRLINE CANCELS FLIGHTS  </P> <P> The Spanish state airline Iberia canceled some of its transatlantic flights on  Thursday and today because of apparently intentional damage to some of its  planes.  </P> <P> "Faults have been detected which appear to be intentional," a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> She said the faults coincided with a series of strikes by the maintenance  workers' union ASETMA. The damage consisted of broken cables and panels but was  not serious.  </P> <P> The airline's entire 85-plane fleet will be inspected, and transatlantic  flights will resume on Saturday, she added.  </P></p>

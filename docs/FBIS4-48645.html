			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister in charge of broadcasting, Dr. Pallo  Jordan, says the government will follow an arms-length approach  with broadcasters. At the start of a two-day conference on the  future of radio, Dr. Jordan said that in the past governments  had too easily abused their links with broadcasters. An  independent body such as the Independent Broadcasting Authority  should regulate the industry. Mr. Jordan said the government  would want to monitor and restrict any possible cross ownership  of the media, but that the government will ensure that the  airwaves were free.</p>

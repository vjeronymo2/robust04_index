			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I truly enjoyed the premiere of "Christine Cromwell." The mystery was filled  with continual twists and turns that made me sit on edge. I look forward to  future shows. Congratulations to Jaclyn Smith.  </P> <P> Maika Watanabe, Los Angeles  </P></p>

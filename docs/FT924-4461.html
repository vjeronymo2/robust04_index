			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Chambers of commerce missed an opportunity Sir, I refer to Mr D P Roberts' letter 'New role of chambers of commerce' (November 24). I am always rather amused when organisations that extol the virtues of free enterprise suggest protectionism when it comes to their own organisation. Compulsory registration is an absurd suggestion. Indeed, such a suggestion calls into question the credibility of the chambers of commerce. The solution is simple; they must offer and effectively market services that others want, and have the vision to grasp opportunities that various government departments create from time to time. I have no doubt that if chambers of commerce had been more dynamic and forward thinking instead of lethargic and backward-looking then they could have been doing the job of the training and enterprise councils. The chambers of commerce were ideally placed but failed to exploit the opportunity that was theirs for the taking.

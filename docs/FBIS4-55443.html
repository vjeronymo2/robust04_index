			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin Prime  Minister Milo Djukanovic said today that the hopes that  Montenegro, as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will  be given somewhat different treatment as regards sanctions are  unrealistic. The international community is not even  considering a partial relaxation of sanctions against Montenegro  alone, and such a solution "would not be good for either  Montenegro or Serbia," he said.    Speaking about a possible lifting of the sanctions against  Montenegro, which has been talked about increasingly often among  the public, Djukanovic said at a news conference that the only  relaxation that Montenegro could expect is the reestablishing of  traffic links with Italy and somewhat more generous humanitarian  aid, due to the large numbers of refugees.    The Montenegrin prime minister stressed that the awareness  of  how senseless the sanctions are is gaining strength in the  international community, for it is being realized that they have  not achieved their objective. Asked how much the sanctions have  cost Montenegro, Djukanovic said that the "amount of the losses"  cannot be precisely quantified. However, he added, the lost  exports and revenue from tourism, the non-functioning of the  merchant fleet, and the inability to meet contractual  obligations to foreign partners have so far cost Montenegro some  $3.34 billion.    Speaking about new economic measures, Djukanovic mentioned a  possible increase in salaries in the republic, but warned they  have to be kept in line with other parameters, particularly with  production.</p>

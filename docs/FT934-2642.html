			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / People: Dreyfus' bear turns bullish Howard Stein, who over the past quarter of a century has built Dreyfus into one of the US's biggest mutual fund groups, is nothing if not consistent, writes Richard Waters. The perennially cautious Stein (below) made his first big impact by pioneering money-market funds during the 1970s, at a time of soaring inflation and interest rates. Even today, during an equity and bond market boom, Dreyfus (and Stein) remain temperamentally wedded to more cautious money-market funds, though the firm has made belated efforts recently to jump on to the equity market bandwagon. So it was with a dash of humour that the lugubrious Stein unveiled last week's plan to sell Dreyfus to Mellon Bank in an all-stock deal valued at Dollars 1.7bn. Stein, a tall, patrician figure renowned for his hands-on management of Dreyfus (he still manages some of its funds), says: 'This 67-year-old bear you have been writing about lately has finally found something to be up about.' Not that he remained up for long; he found time to remark on the 'potential dangers inherent in an exploding mutual fund and financial services world', and left it to Mellon Bank's Frank Cahouet to talk about the benefits. For Stein, who also pioneered the development of tax-free municipal bond funds in the US, the deal is a mixed culmination to a remarkable career. Had it not missed out on the mutual fund boom of the past two years, Dreyfus (with assets under management of Dollars 80bn) is unlikely to have countenanced such a takeover. The changes will inevitably bring an end to the family-company style Stein has always adhered to.</p>

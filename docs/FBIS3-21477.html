The four countries  developing the aircraft have pledged to buy 600 of the planes in  the event it is produced. The company hopes to sell an  additional 400-450 to a number of countries, including Saudi  Arabia.    There are currently seven experimental prototypes of the EFA  2000. Development of the plane is faced with numerous obstacles.  However, it has been decided that the plane will make its first  sortie, which has been postponed repeatedly, by the end of next  April. It is estimated that by the start of the next century,  Saudi Arabia will have its own aircraft industry. British  Aerospace hopes that the Kingdom will be able by then to  participate in the technologies and production of the EFA 2000.    British Aerospace is currently manufacturing 48 Tornado  military aircraft for Saudi Arabia as part of an accord  announced last January. The cost of each Tornado, an  interceptor-bomber, is 20 million pounds sterling.    The British firm still hopes that Saudi Arabia will confirm  its previous request to purchase 60 more Hawk training aircraft.  It is evident that with its request to purchase 48 Tornado  aircraft, plus 72 F-15's from the United States, Saudi Arabia  will need additional training aircraft soon.    British Aerospace will deliver the 48 Tornado's in 1997 and  1998 at the rate of two aircraft monthly. In addition to  producing the Tornado's, the firm is making efforts to enhance  this type of fighter plane. The company is currently making  improvements on 17 out of 72 Tornado's previously purchased by  Saudi Arabia.    British weapons exports to Saudi Arabia are part of the  al-Yamamah Program, which is being implemented in accordance  with the two "memoranda of understanding" concluded by Britain  and Saudi Arabia in 1985 and 1988. In addition to weapons sales,  the program includes training plans. British Aerospace is the  main company in al-Yamamah Program, and has 3,500 employees in  Saudi Arabia currently.    In the first phase of the program Saudi Arabia acquired from  British Aerospace 72 Tornado aircraft, including 48 designed as  interceptor-bombers and 24 designed for air defense operations.  Saudi Arabia also acquired 30 Hawk-65 training aircraft.    The second memorandum of understanding covered the latest 48  Tornado's, which were requested last year, and the 60 Hawks  which the corporation is trying to get confirmed.    British Aerospace directors say that contrary to the  Americans, they have not received to date any Saudi request to  reconsider payment arrangements. They added that should such  proposals be submitted, they will be carefully considered. Last  Saturday, Saudi Arabia and the United States concluded an accord  that permits rescheduling the payment of $9.2 billion in weapons  purchases from five U.S. corporations. The accord permits the  payment period to be extended beyond the two years set in the  original accord.    British Aerospace points out the presence of large  differences in the method by which U.S. and British weapons  sales to Saudi Arabia are financed. Whereas U.S. military sales  are in cash, the arrangement in accordance with which British  weapons costs are paid includes the delivery of 500,000 barrels  of Saudi oil daily. This deal is more flexible and permits for  the introduction of greater modifications, when necessary. This  confirms the successful character of the concept of al-Yamamah  Program as a whole.    British Aerospace may take care in the future of modernizing  the Tornado's already owned by Saudi Arabia. It is likely that  the corporation will upgrade 140 GR-1 to GR-4 [Tornado] aircraft  belonging to the British Air Force by changing the capabilities  of their computers and electronic equipment. The 48 aircraft  purchased by Saudi Arabia are GR-1's. The Saudi Air Force may  adopt the GR-4 after it is introduced to the British Air Force  and after the aircraft proves its fitness practically.    The Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 have been developed especially for  export. The Hawk 100 is a two-seat training aircraft designed to  attack ground targets. The Hawk 200 is a single-seat light  fighter equipped with complex systems from Westinghouse. The  cost of a Hawk aircraft is estimated at 9-11 million pounds  sterling.    It is to be noted that the old Hawks are of the Hawk 60  series. Several Gulf states have purchased Hawk aircraft. In  addition to Saudi Arabia, these states include Kuwait, Abu-Dhabi  (which recently received a number of Hawk 100's), and Oman  (which purchased four Hawk 100's and 12 Hawk 200's in 1989). It  is hoped that Qatar will become a new client. Qatar currently  has French-made Alfa Jet and Mirage aircraft. But it will seek  to upgrade its air force at a later time in the 1990's. Qatar  has firm relations with France.    Since 30 October 1993, i.e. when the Dubai Air Fair was  held,  British Aerospace has organized a major tour to market the Hawk  100 in the Gulf, Southeast Asia, and the Far East. During this  tour, Hawk aircraft have traveled more than 40,000 miles and  have presented 42 exhibitions and 22 air shows for clients. All  this has been done using no more than four liters of engine oil  and changing the tires just twice and the brakes just once.</p>

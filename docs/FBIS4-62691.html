			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of the Georgian delegation at talks on a  settlement in Abkhazia, Dzhaba Ioseliani, told INTERFAX that the  main aim of the agreement on a cease-fire and troop separation  signed in Moscow on 14 May was "setting up a security zone for  the return of refugees with the help of peace keeping forces."    He said that this zone would include territory from the  Western Georgian city of Zugdidi to Gali -- a regional center in  Southern Abkhazia.    He said that the peace keeping forces (2,500 to 3,000 men --  INTERFAX) will enter the "security zone,", which will be set up  after the withdrawal of Georgian and Abkhaz formations from the  Inguri river, by the end of May. At the beginning of June  refugees will start to return to the Gali region. He said that  88 UN observers based in Abkhazia would also control the  situation in the security zone and that an increase in their  numbers was currently being discussed. "No Georgian or Abkhaz  troops will be in the security zone," he emphasized.    Ioseliani also reported that mobile patrol groups made up of  up to 400 peace keeping soldiers would be formed in the Kodor  canyon, from which Georgian and Abkhaz troops must withdraw.    He stressed that all these are initial moves and that talks  would continue and a plan worked out for returning all the  refugees to Abkhazia.    He said that at the end of this week military  representatives  of Georgia, Abkhazia and the CIS would meet. The meeting will  establish the exact position of the peace-keeping forces.</p>

The news was conveyed to  them shortly after 8PM by South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei,  Mr Piet Goosen.    Mr Goosen was escorted to a hall at the Bisho police  college,  where the strikers have been for most of the day, by members of  the Border Regional Peace Committee.    He read them a statement issued earlier by Foreign Affairs  Minister Pik Botha. "The administration of Ciskei shall  henceforth from tomorrow be by an administrator." He could not  divulge the name but "I assure you that you know the gentleman  in question...you will have faith in his ability to ensure a  clean administration".    He said it was in their interests and that of every citizen  of Ciskei in South Africa that they did their best not to  contribute to the "very volatile situation that exists".    He pleaded for them to go back to work and asked them to  "please" release two seconded South African policemen they were  holding hostage.    The hall erupted in jeers and boos.    The appeal for the release was echoed by co-chairman of the  peace committee Rev Godfrey Leeuw.    Speakers from the floor said angrily that "no-one will leave  this door until Brig Oupa Gqozo comes to address us".    A speaker gave the ambassador the assurance the officers  would not be harmed.    Another speaker said "the ambassador must go put pressure on  Gqozo to come address us tonight if the hostages are to be  released here".    Mr Goosen then left for nearby King William's Town saying he  would telephone the Ciskei leader and put the proposal to him.    The rest of Bisho was calm.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday night  decided that Brig Gqozo should be replaced by two administrators  appointed by the TEC and the South African Government.    African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa  said a TEC team should be sent to Ciskei immediately to relieve  Brig Gqozo of his post.    Government TEC representative Roelf Meyer said a South  Africa's Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans should be  dispatched to the homeland.    The Ciskei's Mickey Webb said it was not a hostile takeover.  He said Brig Gqozo was in agreement with the move because he  wanted to save lives and prevent destruction of property.</p>

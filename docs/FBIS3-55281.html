This statement was made to journalists  today by Aleksey Prigarin, leader of the Union of Communists,  who talked about the results of the meeting of the ruling bodies  of all-Russia communist parties, held at the end of last year.  The meeting, he pointed out, proclaimed the start of the  consolidation of the previously uncoordinated and extremely  small All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Russian  Communist Workers' Party, the Russian Party of Communists, the  Union of Communists, and the Leninist Platform in the CPRF  [Communist Party of the Russian Federation].    According to Aleksey Prigarin, the basis for the  consolidation of these forces was provided by their common  stance on the December elections and referendum.    Particular attention was devoted by the news conference  organizers to an exposition of their view on the stance adopted  by the CPRF leadership, given the conditions actually existing  in Russia. As Aleksey Prigarin put it, the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation, headed by Gennadiy Zyuganov, had, in  effect, adopted social-democratic positions. Aleksey Prigarin  decribed the emergent Union's relations with the CPRF as  "amicably hostile."</p>

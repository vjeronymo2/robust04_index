			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 16 (AFP) -- France's conventional forces  will have a new role independent of nuclear weapons under a  defence white paper being prepared by the government, officials  said Wednesday.    A meeting of the country's defence council attended by  President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,  other top ministers and senior officers was set to approve the  white paper later Wednesday [16 February].    Since German reunification, France has carried out partial  nuclear disarmament, reorganised its command structure and  reduced its troop numbers.    The purpose of the white paper was to define post-Cold War  strategy for the next 20 years, the officials said.    Up until the collapse of the Soviet Union, French strategy  was founded on a single scenario -- a massive French  conventional engagement alongside NATO allies in Central Europe,  most likely in former Czechoslovakia.    The white paper sets out six scenarios for the commitment of  French forces, the officials said, starting with "major  conflict", implying use of nuclear weapons.    Others range through use of force to protect sovereignty of  overseas posessions and the French sphere of influence in Africa  and French action in a regional conflict developing from the  breakup of the Soviet Union.    The white paper also states the need for French forces to be  capable of sustaining long-term and distant operations, as in  peace- keeping in Yugoslavia and Cambodia, and as in the Gulf  war.    Mitterrand resisted pressure for change in nuclear strategy,  informed sources said, and his views prevailed.    Sections of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR)  lobbied  for a resumption of nuclear testing in order to develop small  warheads that could be used in limited operations in a "madman"  scenario.    Instead the strategy remains that of "the weak against the  strong", as during the Cold War when the French deterrent was  aimed against tens of thousands of Soviet warheads, the sources  said.    Mitterrand has ordered an acceleration in the development of  a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, the M5, scheduled to  succeed the M45 in the year 2005.    The white paper will be presented to parliamentary defence  and foreign affairs comissions ahead of debate in the National  Assembly next June on financing new weapons over the five years  1995-2000.</p>

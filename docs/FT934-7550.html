			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Pair of commodes sold for Pounds 991,500 A PAIR OF mahogany commodes made in the 1750s, probably by the royal cabinet maker William Vile, sold for Pounds 991,500 at Sotheby's last night. The buyer was a private collector and the price was more than twice the estimate. The commodes were the highlight of a successful auction of English furniture which totalled Pounds 4.85m - against a Pounds 2m pre-sale forecast. The collection was acquired in the 1940s and 1950s by Eric B. Moller, the shipowner, who settled at Thorncombe Park in Surrey. It is regarded as one of the finest collections of English furniture to appear on the market in recent years and the prices paid suggested that the best 18th century English furniture is approaching in value French furniture of the same period. A pair of rococo mirrors, carved by Matthias Lock and, as the commodes, created to furnish Hampden House in Buckinghamshire, made Pounds 397,500, also way above target.</p>

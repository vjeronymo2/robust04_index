			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTAINMENT: 'ALTERED' STATES  </P> <P> Accolade's "Altered Destiny" turns a romantic evening for two into . . . "The  Twilight Zone." It is a traditional adventure-style game with a good story set  against an effective, entertaining science-fiction backdrop.  </P> <P> It's Friday night and regular guy P.J. Barrett makes a date with girlfriend  Trudy Foxlitner to watch videos at his place. P.J. stops after work to pick up  his television from the repair shop. Entering the shop, he passes a large,  Neanderthal warrior carrying a television. You guessed it: P.J.'s TV. But  neither the repair man nor P.J. wants to confront the big guy, so P.J. takes  home a loaner. And that's when P.J.'s life turns really weird. As soon as P.J.  turns on the TV, he gets sucked through the tube into somewhere described as  "between here and there." Our hero immediately meets a disappointed, frail  specter named JonQuah. (JonQuah was naturally expecting the warrior with the  wrong television.) Settling for second best -- or just what he can get --  JonQuah gives P.J. the old you-must-save-the-universe routine and leaves him to  drift down into a world of sci-fi fantasy.  </P> <P> While Accolade continues to provide excellent support for its adventurers, the  company is still having trouble programming smooth movement functions for its  characters. P.J. runs into a few spots that make play frustrating. Watch  yourself in the Canyons of Fear and the Caves of Death.  </P> <P> Save often. Sometimes every few steps. Save at the Bottom of the Stairs -- and  prepare to die -- a lot, while trying to cross the bridge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALTERED DESTINY  </P> <P> Rating: ***  </P> <P> IBM and compatibles, Tandy, Amiga; 640K -- hard drive required. List: $59.95.  </P> <P> Computer games are rated on a five-star system, from one star for poor to five  for excellent.  </P></p>

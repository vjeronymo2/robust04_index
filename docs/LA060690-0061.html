			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS ALLOW RAIDERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH BELL  </P> <P> The Rams, who have long avoided trades involving their cross-town rivals, have  granted the Raiders permission to negotiate with tailback Greg Bell.  </P> <P> Bell's agent, Steve Feldman, said he spoke with Raider owner Al Davis Tuesday  and that they are close to working out a deal.  </P> <P> Although he gained 2,349 yards and scored 33 touchdowns the last two seasons,  the Rams balked when Bell, 27, asked to renegotiate his 1990 contract of  $475,000.  </P> <P> The Rams, who dealt Eric Dickerson to Indianapolis in 1987 rather than  renegotiate, countered by signing free-agent tailback Curt Warner in March.  </P> <P> The Rams' asking price is reportedly a middle-round draft pick.  </P> <P> "All Greg Bell wants is to be paid market value," Feldman said. "We don't  foresee the Raiders having any problem paying market value. . . . They are  extremely aware of his statistics."  </P></p>

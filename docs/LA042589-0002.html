			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> EGYPT JAILS 1,500 MILITANTS  </P> <P> In a nationwide crackdown on extremist agitation, Egyptian security authorities  have reportedly arrested about 1,500 alleged Muslim militants in the last two  weeks. The arrests followed an April 7 clash between Muslim zealots and police  in the town of Fayoum, southwest of Cairo, that left eight people wounded,  officials said. Maj. Gen. Zaki Badr, Cairo's interior minister, said he has  ordered a probe to determine whether there was foreign involvement in a recent  wave of anti-government activity. Badr, whose remarks were carried by the  Middle East News Agency, did not elaborate. Muslim militants have been  campaigning for years for an Egyptian society based on Islamic law.  </P></p>

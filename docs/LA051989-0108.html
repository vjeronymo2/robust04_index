			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A committee of the National Religious Broadcasters has urged Paul F. Crouch,  president of Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network, to seek "Christian  arbitration" to resolve a bitter dispute with a former business associate. The  decision appears to be at least a partial victory for Crouch's longtime  adversary, the Rev. Keith A. Houser of Dallas, who has sought such a resolution  for nearly three years. The NRB's five-member Ethics Committee strongly  recommended that Crouch and Houser submit the "alleged business practices that  relate to contractual disputes" to "a recognized Board of Christian  Arbitration." Houser said he welcomed the finding. Efforts to reach Crouch were  unsuccessful. In his complaint last year to the Ethics Committee, Houser  accused Crouch of unethical conduct in connection with Trinity's 1981 purchase  of WTBY-TV in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., which Houser helped found.  </P></p>

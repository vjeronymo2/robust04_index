			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bosnian crisis unsettles senior bourses FEARS of possible air strikes by the US and its allies in Bosnia, threatening European political and economic stability, and suggestions that support in Denmark for the Maastricht treaty might be waning, unnerved many investors yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS dived steeply after midday on a combination of negative factors: the CAC-40 index finished down 41.92 or 2.2 per cent at 1,878.57, a fall of 3 per cent over the week. Turnover was estimated at FFr3.1bn. Mr Simon Hopkins at James Capel in Paris commented that while most of Monday's budget measures had largely been discounted, the market was waiting to learn what fiscal incentives would be provided to encourage take-up of the privatisation programme that lies ahead. The fall yesterday may have been precipitated by disappointing first quarter sales figures published by key blue chips, he added; although some big pension funds were seen coming back as buyers in the post bourse. Next week he expected a bounce off the support level of 1,870. FRANKFURT eased on futures-led selling, amid low volumes as most investors, cautious over the situation in Bosnia, remained sidelined. The DAX index fell 11.34 to 1,611.92, the lowest level since early February. The index declined a marginal 0.9 per cent on the week, reflecting dull trading. Turnover was DM5.4bn. Traders said shares were testing lower levels. 'We don't know if the 1,600 support will hold,' said Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler. Commerzbank was one of the hardest hit, falling DM3.30 to DM292. The bank announced a 25 per cent rise in first quarter operating profit yesterday, but investors were discouraged that it had lost DM200m in bad loans to Hafnia Holdings, the ailing Danish group. MILAN edged marginally higher, but was restrained by weakness in Fiat and book-squaring ahead of the end of the May account next week. The Comit index added 2.32 to 543.08, for a weekly rise of 3.2 per cent. The successful passage last night of parliamentary votes of confidence on the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi should help to boost the market. Fiat, down L80 to fix at L6,601 before L6,455 after hours, was depressed by figures showing a 28 per cent drop in Italian car deliveries in April, while speculation continued about a sharp fall in the dividend when the company reports on May 31. Generali, which soared L160 or 3 per cent to fix at L38,950, edged back on the kerb to L38,400 after hopes began to fade that the insurer would announce a bonus issue along with its results later. Olivetti shed L93 or 4.7 per cent to fix at L1,857, before L1,855 after hours, ahead of the launch of its capital rise. ZURICH was easier with Roche providing one of the few bright spots. The SMI index shed 4.8 to 2,160.9, for a 1.4 per cent rise on the week. Roche continued the advance that has taken the bearer shares 12.2 per cent higher over the past two weeks. The company has received recommendations from analysts following its announcement of annual results and medium-term forecasts. Kleinwort Benson commented this week that Roche was one of a handful of pharmaceutical stocks worldwide that was in a strong position to weather the current wave of healthcare reforms. James Capel said that the company would grow significantly above average for an international pharmaceutical stock over the next few years. Roche bearers rose SFr260 to SFr7,500, while its certificates added SFr30 to SFr4,450. Pharma Vision, which holds large investments in Roche, added SFr160 or 4.9 per cent to SFr3,220. AMSTERDAM improved slightly after the rate-cut with the CBS Tendency index putting on 0.1 to 107.9, little changed on the week. The publishing sector remained weak with Wolters Kluwer off Fl 1.00 at Fl 89.00, down some 4 per cent on the week, and Elsevier off 50 cents at Fl 128.20. STOCKHOLM advanced strongly on Astra and Ericsson, while S-E Banken continued to draw high volume although the C shares closed off SKr1.50 at SKr25.50 and the A's were down SKr1.00 at SKr27. Astra was helped by a positive broker's comment with the B shares up SKr30 at SKr723 and Ericsson, up SKr7 at SKr299, was firm ahead of Tuesday's first quarter results. The Affarsvarlden general index closed 9.7 higher at 1,068.7, a gain of 3.7 per cent on the week. MADRID lost ground amid light trading. The general index fell 1.48 to 241.29, down 1.3 per cent on the week. Banesto declined for the third consecutive day, falling Pta40 to Pta2,060, as the bank's announcement of a Pta130bn equity expansion plan prompted selling.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices May 7 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30    11.00     12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1149.74  1150.51  1149.75   1149.20 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1203.58  1204.70  1204.73   1204.17                         13.00    14.00    15.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1144.83  1144.07  1142.72   1142.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1201.23  1201.15  1199.39   1200.34  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 6    May 5    May 4   Apr 30   Apr 29 FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1152.03  1153.13  1148.16  1144.33  1143.23 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1205.10  1206.61  1207.82  1206.79  1199.62  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1150.77; 200 - 1205.14 Low/day: 100 - 1142.19 200 - 1198.49.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

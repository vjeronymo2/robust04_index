			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DIRECTOR PAPP REJECTS NEA GRANT  </P> <P> Theatrical impresario Joseph Papp has rejected a $50,000 National Endowment of  the Arts grant, saying he will not accept the restrictions on obscenity the  agency has imposed since October, a published report said today.  </P> <P> Papp, director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, had been offered the  federal grant to help underwrite the Festival Latino, a monthlong program of  Latin American theater, music and films set for August, The New York Times  reported in today's editions.  </P> <P> Papp's decision to turn down the grant comes at a time of financial struggle  for his ventures.  </P> <P> "It's a difficult time for us," he told the newspaper. "We're losing 'A Chorus  Line' tomorrow, and we have a deficit of over $2.5 million right now. This is  the worst time for me to do this. It's a matter of censorship. How could I  produce plays by Vaclav Havel and do that?"  </P></p>

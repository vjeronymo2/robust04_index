			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerhard Hennemann: "The Federal Government Had </F> To Pay DM7.5 Billion for Export Losses in 1993"]    [Text] Bonn, 6 May -- The risks that the Federal  Government has taken with its export guarantees have again  increased sharply. According to the Federal Finance Ministry,  the highest ever compensation had to be paid in 1993, owing to  payment problems of several debtor countries. The Federal  Government had to spend approximately 7.5 billion German marks  [DM] to cover Hermes [credit insurance company] guarantees --  twice as much as in the record year, 1992. The Finance Ministry  states in its confidential 1993 annual report that these  expenditures compare with receipts of no more than DM2.9 billion.    The report, which contains data on foreign and domestic  trade  and payments guarantees, illustrates that the serious financial  situation will be further aggravated further for the Federal  Government in the current year. An essential reason for this is  the fact that the receipts from payments, the reflux of capital,  and interest paid last year increased from DM1.1 billion (1992)  to DM2.9 billion, which was attributable to unexpected high  receipts from debt rescheduling agreements with Brazil and  Russia.    In this connection, the experts in the Federal Finance  Ministry say, however, that this relatively favorable trend  regarding receipts will not repeat itself in the foreseeable  future, and that another deterioration of the ratio of receipts  and expenses must be expected.  <H5>  Increasing Deficit </H5>   The resultant deficit influencing the cash funds in the  federal budget increased from DM1.95 billion in 1992 to  approximately DM4.63 billion last year. If we only consider  payments and the real reflux of capital (not including  interest), the Federal Government's cash deficit even increased  to DM5.7 billion. Of this amount, DM5.1 billion (DM2.3 billion  in 1992) fell to Hermes, which, regarding liabilities, receipts,  and expenses, constituted the largest share by far in foreign  trade and payments guarantees. The deficit that has accumulated  in this area since 1950 -- not including interest received and  imputed interest paid -- reached the DM19-billion mark by the  end of 1993. This accumulated loss from federal export  guarantees currently compares with claims transferred to the  Federal Government of DM27.2 billion in compensation payments to  German exporters.    However, according to the Finance Ministry, the volume of  these claims can hardly be assessed realistically regarding the  expected reflux. Depending on the extent to which such claims  are realizable and on the development of the loss potential  contained in the Federal Government's overall liabilities, the  Federal Finance Ministry says that the question must be answered  of whether the Hermes guarantees will be adequate over the long  term, or whether another increase in payments must be  considered. In any case, it is clear that high expenses for  debt rescheduling and payments for political damage must also be  expected in the future.    Broken down by countries, the Federal Government's  liabilities in 1993 clearly increased for Russia and China,  whereas they declined in the case of Iran. Ranking at the top  in 1993 of export deals guaranteed by Hermes in the past was the  former USSR (with a volume of DM18.2 billion), followed by Iran  with DM9.3 billion, and Brazil with DM8.9 billion. Ranking  fourth, however, is the "new" Russia with approximately DM8.6  billion, which is above all attributable to the high pledges to  cover exports from the new federal laender. Following are Iraq  with DM7.2 billion, South Africa with DM6.1 billion, and China,  Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Indonesia each with approximately DM5.5  billion.    In the category of untied financial credits guaranteed by  Bonn, it is again the former USSR that ranks first  (approximately DM7.4 billion), followed by Poland with less than  DM2 billion and Hungary with DM1.6 billion. In the group of  German capital investment abroad, the former CSSR ranks first  with DM1.2 billion, followed by the People's Republic of China  with DM876 million and Hungary with DM769 million. The former  USSR plays a relatively insignificant role here, accounting for  no more than DM48 million. Nonetheless, the sum of all three  categories (export deals, untied financial credits, and capital  investment) makes the former USSR account for the largest  overall liabilities of approximately DM25.6 billion, followed by  Brazil (DM9.6 billion), Iran (DM9.4 billion), and the new Russia  (DM8.6 billion).  <H5>  More Differentiated </H5>   The Finance Ministry estimates the existing spending risk at  approximately DM20.8 billion. While the credit standing of the  successor states of the former USSR -- with the exception of the  Baltic states -- has been assessed in the past as being more or  less equal, Bonn is now increasingly taking different  developments of the individual CIS republics into account and  now defines the covering options for each country separately.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese broker upgrades forecast DAIWA Securities, one of Japan's big four brokerage houses, yesterday moved against the trend in the domestic market and upgraded its interim earnings forecast. The firm said that the improved result would be due to higher-than-expected bond trading profits in the wake of lower interest rates. Daiwa raised its expected pre-tax profit for the first six months to September to Y35.3bn (Dollars 333m) from Y30bn, nearly 20 times the amount earned in the corresponding period last year. The announcement reflects a difference in investment strategies between Daiwa and other leading brokers. Last month, Nomura Securities, the largest broker, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, revised downwards their expectations due to weaker-than-expected stock trading commissions on the Tokyo market. During the six months to September, daily value of turnover on the Tokyo stock exchange was 10 per cent lower than original expectations, and the Nikkei index hovered around 20,000. Daiwa placed the bulk of its funds into the government bond market, which rallied because of lower interest rates. An increasing number of investors, discouraged by the sluggish stock market, also piled into the market. Daiwa said commission income was also better than expected.</p>

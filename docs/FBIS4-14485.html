			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kokanov: "Army of Officials...Retreating. </F> But for How Long?"]    [Text] In the Smolnyy the ides of March were marked by the  high-speed transformation of the local executive administrative  structures. The Government of St. Petersburg has been formed,  and the administrative and territorial structure of the city has  been altered.    The Government of St. Petersburg, which is headed by  Anatoliy  Sobchak, includes 11 top officials, mainly former chairmen of  City Hall sector committees.    From the end of March seven city rayons will vanish at a  stroke from the map of St. Petersburg. They are being replaced  by three new, larger ones -- Tsentralnyy, Admiralteyskiy, and  Kurortnyy. The authorities have a totally convincing case:  Expenditure on maintaining the rayon-level bureaucracy must be  reduced.    As for the citizens, they have no particular enthusiasm for  this latest reshaping of administrative structures. The man in  the street has always been accustomed to our bureaucrats finding  themselves a job which suits them. People are more worried  about something else: What is going to happen to the social  welfare offices, housing offices, militia departments, advice  centers, and other rayon services to which everyone has become  accustomed.</p>

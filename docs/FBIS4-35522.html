			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by defense analyst Rahul Roy Chowdhury] </F>   [Text] The commissioning of the submarine INS [Indian  Naval Ship] Shankul by the prime minister is a significant  achievement for both the country and the navy. It demonstrates  India's ability to indigenously build a highly complex and  sophisticated warship along with the navy's resolve to  adequately defend its maritime interests in the Indian Ocean.  Both these issues continue to remain critical to Indian  security. Shankul is only the second submarine to have been  built in India. The first such submarine INS Shalki was  commissioned into the Indian Navy just over two years ago. Both  these vessels were constructed at the Defense Ministry's  Mazagaon shipyard in Bombay. While a German (?sales) firm  provided material packages and access to certain technologies,  Indian workers carried out the bulk of the construction work on  the submarine. This included the welding of the hulls and  manufacture of various critical items and components. Through  these activities they have been able to gain sufficient  experience for the construction of similar vessels in future.    Shankul is a modern and sophisticated submarine which is to  be used primarily for antisubmarine and antiship operations in a  situation of war. It has a standard displacement of 1,450 tons  and is formally classified as a stretched and a heavier version  of the German HDW class 209 type of vessel. While its level of  (?self-noise) is relatively lower than other submarines of its  class, its range of some 8,000 miles is considered to be a  record one. Shankul is also well-armed with eight 21-inch  Torpedo tubes and mines. In addition, it is equipped with  advanced radar and solar systems. Amongst the submarines  operated by the Indian Navy, Shankul and Shalki are unique as  they possess an integrated (?escutcheon) for the entire crew at  times of emergency. With the commissioning of Shankul, the  strength of the Indian Navy's submarine force has risen to 18.  Besides the two built in India, it comprises submarines  acquired from Germany and the erstwhile Soviet Union. The  acquisition of additional vessels in the last few years became  necessary to replace an older class of submarines and to defend  India's extended maritime interests in the Indian Ocean.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / IOC team ready to award biggest prize: Lobbyists stalk the Olympics committee like exotic game MEMBERS of the International Olympic Committee know what it is to be hunted. In the lobbies and corridors of Monaco's five-star hotels they are stalked by representatives of bidding cities like rare and exotic game. On the eve of the IOC's decision tonight on the choice of city for the 2000 Olympics, the chairman of one city's campaign yesterday described the IOC members as 'in purdah'. The ballot of these 91 individuals will award a prize worth billions of dollars and immeasurable international prestige. Even the appearance of a member such as Panama's Mr Virgilio de Leon, at 74 only one year from mandatory retirement, can signal the instant arrival of eight or nine eager Beijing publicists, piling in like a rugby scrum at a ruck. Cities such as Manchester or Sydney may be more discreet in their wooing but the thrust of effort is the same. When Greg Norman won the Open golf championship, the Sydney campaign quickly put signed photographs of the Australian golfer in the post to every IOC member known to enjoy 18 holes. As a group the IOC is predominantly white, elderly, male and from the Old World. A total of 38 members are from Europe, only four of them women. Of these two are princesses, the Princess Royal from Britain and Princess Nora of Liechtenstein. Other royal members include the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Prince Albert of Monaco. Membership of the IOC is by invitation and then election by the full membership. At the Barcelona games 170 countries took part but fewer than half of these had nationals on the IOC. It is often said to be the best and most exclusive club in the world. Members travel first class to their many meetings and conferences and stay free of charge in the world's best hotels. Even 20 years ago it was very different. 'When I first became a member we paid all our own expenses and it was often difficult to afford to attend different events,' said Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, who has been the spearhead of the IOC's campaign against drugtaking. The executive board, the powerhouse of the IOC, is headed by Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, the retired Spanish diplomat, who is its president. His key lieutenants are businessmen. Mr Richard Pound, 51, is a punchy Montreal lawyer and former Olympic swimmer. His marketing expertise and skilled negotiation of television rights have brought the IOC's finances from penury to assets of Dollars 125m in the past decade. Mr Kevan Gosper, an Australian oil executive, is another vice-president with a professional background. Ten years older than Mr Pound, he may have missed his chance to succeed Samaranch, but his egalitarian style has been crucial in changing the IOC's approach to the world. This meritocracy within an anachronistic elite is reinforced by the distinguished presence of Mr Keba Mbaye, a retired Senegalese judge and international jurist. Mr Justice Mbaye has enormous influence within the IOC and was pivotal in the process which led to South Africa being readmitted to the Olympics. His undoubted probity has also been important in the IOC reforming dubious aspects of the bidding process. During the 1980s, candidate cities notoriously handed out gifts such as fur coats and expensive jewellery to IOC members and their wives. Air tickets to inspect facilities were routed through the most exotic, out-of-the-way locations. These kind of excesses, harshly criticised both by outsiders and such insiders as the Princess Royal, have disappeared. But a waitress at a Manchester bid reception, heaping smoked salmon on to the IOC plates, was still able to observe: 'If there is reincarnation, I want to come back as part of the IOC.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   The Olympic runners and their form  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BEIJING FOR:         China becomes fully part of international community              Vast marketing potential for sponsors AGAINST:     Human rights record              Renewed doubts about national stability post-Deng  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BERLIN FOR:         Strong capable organisation              Symbol of a reunited Europe AGAINST:     Vociferous opposition to Olympics within the city  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ISTAMBUL FOR:         Neutral ground between Europe and Asia              First Olympics to Moslem world AGAINST      Poor city infrastructre              Politically unstable with Kurd nationalists referring to              the city as 'a war zone'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANCHESTER FOR:         British tradition within international sport              Strong central government backing AGAINST      Short on glamour              Everybody's second choice  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SYDNEY FOR:         Climate              Excellent facilities AGAINST      Lack of market potential for sponsors              Distance to travel              Poor time-zone for television  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

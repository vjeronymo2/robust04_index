			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3833.1&hyph;7&blank;Filing requirements for maintenance fee exemptions (waivers). This section would be revised to identify the documents required and deadlines for applying for a waiver of payment of the maintenance fees under the Act. This provision operates in advance of each upcoming assessment year. The assessment work performed during a given assessment year, certified to under this section, holds the mining claim for the next assessment year without payment of the maintenance fee. For those claimants who do not pay the required claim maintenance fee and who instead seek a waiver from such payment requirement, the failure to file a certified statement by each August 31 certifying that the assessment work was done for the assessment year just ending will cause the mining claim to be forfeited under the Act. In addition, failure to file affidavits of annual assessment work on or before December 30 of the year in which the small miner certification was made will cause the mining claim to be forfeited under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. (For example, a certification filed by a qualified claimant on August 31, 1994, certifies performance of assessment work for the assessment year that began at noon on September 1, 1993. This allows a waiver of payment of the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994, to hold the claim for the assessment year beginning at noon on September 1, 1994. However, if the affidavit of labor is not filed by December 30, 1994, for the work done for the assessment year beginning at noon September 1, 1993, the claims are deemed abandoned and void and are forfeited. This process begins again with the next certification deadline of August 31, 1995).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3833.1&hyph;8&blank;Refundability of service charges, location fees, rental and maintenance fees. This section, which would be moved from &sect;3833.0&hyph;5(v) in the current regulations, would be amended to reference location and maintenance fees, allow refunds of service fees in certain circumstances, allow for refunds of duplicate payments, and allow for refunds in any other situation in which a payment is made for a mining claim that was void by operation of law at the time the payment was made. Also added is a provision that voluntary actions are not considered a reason for a refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3833.2&hyph;3&blank;Consistency between the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the General Mining Law of May 10, 1872, the Act of October 5, 1992, and the Act of August 10, 1993. The section title would be revised to add the Act of August 10, 1993, and paragraphs (d) and (e) would be amended to reflect the new dates in 1999 when assessment work is required to be resumed when the Act expires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3833.2&hyph;6&blank;When evidence or notice is not required. This section would be amended to add the conditions contained in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3833.3&blank;Notice of transfer of interest. Paragraph (c) would be amended to state clearly when a transfer of interest becomes effective on the title records of BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3833.4&blank;Failure to file, or to pay rental, maintenance fees, or location fees. The section title would be revised by adding maintenance and location fees. Paragraph (a) would be amended by adding the conditions of the Act. The amendment in this paragraph would not allow claimants who do not qualify for a small miner waiver to claim a waiver on only ten or fewer claims. This provision does not cause an automatic relinquishment of a claimant's mining claims or sites that are over the ten-claim limit for small miner waivers. Paragraph (b) would be amended by correcting cross-references. A new paragraph (c) would be added to explain the Bureau's policy on the effect of failure by a purchaser or transferee of a mining claim or site to record the new ownership interest with the BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart 3851_Assessment Work: General. This subpart also would be amended to implement the statutory changes contained in the Act. A discussion of the sections to be affected and the changes to be made follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3851.3&blank;Effect of failure to perform assessment work. Paragraph (c) of this section would be amended to state that the Act suspends and supersedes the requirements to perform assessment work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3851.4&blank;Failure of a co-owner to contribute to annual assessment work or to the payment of rental or maintenance fees. The section title would be amended by adding maintenance fees. The existing section is divided into new paragraphs (a) and (b) and the failure to pay the maintenance fee is added as another ground for action against a delinquent co-owner. A new paragraph (c) would be added to identify the action required of co-owners who have met the publication requirements of &sect;3851.4 to terminate the interest of a delinquent co-owner, and would like the BLM record title to the mining claim corrected. A new paragraph (d) would be added to refer to the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act and the fact that pursuant to that Act, an active duty military person may not be so ``published out'' for failure to contribute as long as he or she is on active duty and has complied with &sect;3851.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3851.5&blank;Assessment work not required after allowance of mineral entry. This section would be amended to reflect the effects of the Act on claims for which mineral patent applications have been filed. After the first half of the mineral entry final certificate has been issued by the Secretary of the Interior confirming the mineral entry, there is no longer a requirement to perform assessment work, and no requirement to pay the rental or maintenance fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New &sect;3851.6&blank;Assessment work not required for active duty military personnel. This new section would be added to explain how an active duty military person may apply for and receive an exemption from the performance of assessment work and payment of maintenance fees under the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Callejas, who met with Discua today to examine the report  issued by the National Commissioner for the Protection of Human  Rights [CNPDH] concerning 183 missing people, pointed out that  the request made by the Committee of Relatives of Missing  Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh) concerning the temporary  suspension of the military chief "has no legal validity."  According to Callejas, Cofadeh cannot "level accusations or  establish responsibilities" concerning the people who  disappeared during the past decade; he said the preliminary  report issued by CNPDH head Leo Valladares concerning the  disappearance of individuals should serve to "build, not  destroy, and to unite, not divide." The president expressed  concern because attempts are being made "without legal validity  to lay the blame and responsibility" on civilians and military  people implicated in the forced disappearances. He added that  the courts of justice are the only ones that can establish  responsibility for any crime.    In his 29 December report Valladares said that civilians and  military people were responsible for the disappearance of over  100 people. He recommended that the state acknowledge those  violations, apologize to the relatives, and initiate an  investigation.    Among other military men, Cofadeh points to Discua as the  person responsible for certain disappeareances because in 1984  he was commander of the "3-16" counterinsurgency battalion.    Discua has denied any involvement in the disappearance of  people and as he entered and left the presidential palace today  he avoided reporters who were expecting answers from him  concerning the Cofadeh's request.    On Friday, Cofadeh will ask the Legislative Assembly's  permanent commission that Discua be temporarily suspended from  his post and subjected to an investigation concerning the  disappearances.    Cofadeh Coordinator Bertha Oliva told ACAN-EFE that "it is  not necessary to have legal status to identify individuals  responsible for the disappearances," and that "what President  Callejas wants is for us to forgive and forget." "If the  president had a missing child, brother or any relative, he would  be at our side demanding justice" added Oliva, wife of Tomas  Nativi, who disappeared during the 1980's.    Callejas underscored that the right thing to do regarding  the  missing people is to "end this phase of recriminations, ill will  and differences within Honduran society in order to establish a  process of national reconciliation that will be constructive and  not destructive." The president also said that Honduran society  "must not create permanent wounds," the events that have taken  place "must result in something, and an admission should be made  to the missing people's relatives."    "When we are told where the guilty parties are and when they  have been punished, we will be able to forgive and forget,"  Oliva added.</p>

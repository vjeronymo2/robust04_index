			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Index-linked certificates lead National Savings INDEX-linked National Savings Certificates were the best-selling National Savings product in 1990-91, with net buying by the public of Pounds 1.18bn in the certificates. That investment was by far the largest contributor to National Savings, with a positive investment of Pounds 1.4bn (a contribution to public-sector borrowing) in the financial year 1990-91, compared with a net disinvestment ( ) of Pounds 1.68bn in 1989-90. The recent public appeal of the certificates reflects high levels of inflation. At the same time, the public was disenchanted with fixed-interest National Savings certificates last year, with a net sale of Pounds 1.22bn. Income Bonds and the National Savings Investment Account, both popular with non-taxpayers because income is paid gross, also did well, with net investment of Pounds 785.7m and Pounds 632.5m respectively. Capital Bonds, with net investment of only Pounds 204.1m in 1990-91, have still not become popular since their launch a couple of years ago even though they pay benefits gross.</p>

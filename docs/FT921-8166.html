			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Palestinians will attend peace talks: Israel trades heavy artillery fire with Hizbollah militia in South Lebanon THE Palestinians announced last night that they would attend next week's negotiations in Washington despite anger over the arrest of two members of their delegation. Syria, Lebanon and Israel have already announced their acceptance of the US invitation to the third round of negotiations opening on February 24. Israel and Lebanon's Hizbollah militia traded heavy artillery fire yesterday but the continuing violence failed to derail the Middle East peace process. Gunners from Hizbollah, the Shia Moslem fundamentalist organisation, fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel yesterday in retaliation for Israel's assassination of their leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi in south Lebanon on Sunday. The rockets caused little damage but forced local people to take refuge in bomb shelters. Israel and its local militia allies responded with heavy shellfire from the slice of southern Lebanon they occupy. Israel also launched another attack by helicopters, this time on the home of a Hizbollah official. Local reports said a five-year-old child was killed and at least six people were wounded. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, warned Israelis to expect more Hizbollah attacks. Lt Gen Ehud Barak, the Israeli Chief of Staff, called on the Lebanese government to bring Hizbollah under control. 'If there is not quiet, those who disturb the quiet will have to pay a very high price,' he said. But Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, elected to succeed Sheikh Abbas Musawi as Hizbollah secretary general, told mourners at the dead leader's funeral in the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbeck: 'Israel is digging its own grave. We will continue the march even if we are killed and our homes destroyed. We will not abandon resistance.' Palestinian delegates to the Middle East peace talks had earlier raised doubts about their participation because of the arrest by Israeli security forces of two of their negotiating team. Mr Mohammed Hourani and Mr Jamal Shobaki, both academics from the occupied West Bank, have been accused of organising unspecified 'terrorist actions'. They were arrested under six-month detention without trial orders. The action was attacked by the Palestinians as unwarranted harassment designed to undermine negotiations. However, Mr Yasser Abed Rabbou, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee, later said after talks with Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, that Palestinians would join other Arab parties in Washington next week. With internal leadership elections in Israel's ruling Likud party due tomorrow night, the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir has shown no inclination to help in lowering the regional temperature. He yesterday visited Ma'ale Adumim, the largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank, to celebrate its elevation to city status. The prime minister again defied US and Arab demands that Israel should freeze settlement expansion. He said. 'There is no doubt that following this city, other cities will come.'

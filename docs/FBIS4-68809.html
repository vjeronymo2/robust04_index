			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Spisarenko: "The Governor Is Certain of One </F> Thing: Self-Reliance Is the Key, Because It Is Impossible To  Rely on `Uncle,' and He Objects Vehemently to Politicization...."    [Text] On 11 April L. Roketskiy had another of his  now traditional, semi-official meetings with representatives of  the news media. Although he began with the equally traditional  mounting of his "peasant" hobbyhorse, the range of topics  discussed at the conference was nevertheless quite broad.    As far as rural issues are concerned, the oblast  administration is adhering to the principle of maximum support.  Everything possible has been done to secure a good supply of  seeds, including outside purchases of corn and sunflower seeds.  Credits have been obtained for purchases of new equipment, which  the farmers themselves are not in any hurry to buy--it costs too  much.    As for performance indicators for the first quarter, they  are  not that encouraging. Industrial production is declining, and  this automatically reduces the income portion of the budget and,  consequently, the amount of tax collected. This will affect  people directly because the payment of wages will be delayed,  although the administration is "able and willing" to minimize  the negative consequences. The RF Ministry of Finance now owes  the oblast around 13 billion....    Despite all obstacles, the governor has also remained  committed to his plan to build highways, and I think that there  will be no objections to this. In particular, the RF Ministry of  Highway Construction has offered its guarantees and support, all  necessary repairs will be made on the road linking Tyumen with  Yuzhnyy Balyk and Tobolsk, and the Yekaterinburg-Tyumen-Omsk  highway now has federal status.    This was followed by a discussion of higher academic  institutions and their students: They are experiencing  difficulties, and the problem is not the administration, but the  flawed mechanism of the federal system, which is responsible for  "science," but has not taken this responsibility seriously  enough.    When I asked whether the State Duma and RF Federation  Council  would be able to whip the system of federal agencies--not only  higher academic institutions, but also state inspectorates, the  police force, and other "budget dependents"--into shape before  the 1996 deadline, the governor replied, in a dejected tone:  "Not likely! So far, we have been able to rely only on  ourselves...."    A paradoxical situation has taken shape in the oil and gas  complex: It appears that our "black gold" is losing its  competitive edge in the market, and many of yesterday's most  steadfast clients now prefer other suppliers. L. Roketskiy  blamed this on the oil producers and their lack of a complete  system of production and refinery units, leading to a situation  in which the fuel for the Tyumen enterprises' own gas stations  frequently has to be purchased from...dealers in Tyumen.    I asked the governor a "probing" question: "Is this a result  of the oblast's loss of administrative functions in the oil and  gas complex?" He avoided a direct response by saying that these  functions had been under the control of federal officials for a  long time. It is true that this control is rather weak, but the  administration itself is still doing something.    In particular, Academician Aganbegyan spent days analyzing  the situation as part of a field study in Tyumen Oblast and  concluded that numerous violations had been committed in the  privatization of the oil and gas complex. Besides this, the  oblast did manage, even if only after some delay, to acquire an  additional share of the oil dividends through the property fund  headed by V. Zagvyazinskiy.    The loss of competitiveness was mentioned again during a  discussion of the products of agricultural processing: Although  our cheese and sausage are considered to be ecologically clean  and absolutely delicious, they are too expensive to compete with  products from Kogalym.    The administration wants to allow our competitor-neighbors  into our market to protect consumer interests, but L. Roketskiy  did not answer my question about the intention of the executive  branch to cooperate with the union of local entrepreneurs and  commercial producers in this sphere: I suggested the need for a  jointly developed and centralized system of interaction.    The administration plans to cut its committee staff  positions  by 20 percent and to demand the same from federal agencies. The  governor had some words to say about the anti-monopoly  directorate headed by V. Samoylik, which has "sheltered" the  Republic Party within its walls and communications network.    He was equally blunt in his statement that the commotion  over  the municipal committee on ecology was dictated precisely by  "political elements": In this case, however, it is one of the  subspecies of the communist movement instead of the Republic  Party. Anyway, this will not make the streets of Tyumen any  cleaner.    In short, the head of the oblast administration, without any  reservations, reaffirmed his commitment to the edict on the need  to depoliticize the work of government agencies.    He has advised local politicians and the leaders of peasant  unions and movements to avoid fueling political passions and to  unite within the framework of the general accord around the  shovel and rake, directing all of their democratic-revolutionary  fervor into clearing all of the winter debris out of the city:  "Total concentration on Environmental Cleanup Day!"    Roketskiy explained that the budget--in the oblast and in  the  Russian Federation as a whole--would have to be broken down into  quarters because of all the present difficulties. No annual plan  could withstand the current rate of inflation.    The conference ended with a discussion of...the Turks. It  appears that the Russian common man thinks too much of himself  and is too fastidious to do wet and dirty work like plastering,  and prefers dryer and higher-paying jobs. The Turks, on the  other hand, will do anything. They take care of each and every  stage of a construction project, and they do the work quite well  besides. This is one of the grim realities of market  competition. Eventually, Russian builders will be forced out of  the market by the Turks.    All of this was also discussed at the press conference in  the  governor's residence. Once again, Roketskiy repeated his fervent  hope for the cooperation and constructive support of the new  oblast duma, underscoring the high caliber of its membership,  during the resolution of the whole mountain of current problems.</p>

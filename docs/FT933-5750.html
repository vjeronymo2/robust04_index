			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Anger in refugee camps at meagre offer of land - Opposition to Arafat is mounting CRAMPED and crowded, the Bekaa Camp in Jordan houses over 90,000 refugees, most of whom were displaced when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. Palestinians in the camp see no prospect for an improvement in their lives as a result of agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organisation for autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. The latest bon mot in the sprawling camp west of Amman plays on the Arabic for Jericho (Ariha) which sounds like the word 'smell' or 'stench'. The general consensus is that the Gaza-Jericho accord 'stinks and means absolutely nothing,' according to Ayman Shahin, a 22-year-old pharmacy student at the University of Jordan who was born in the camp. '(Yassir) Arafat has sold Palestine and over 40 years of struggle,' he says. The refugees are angry at the modest size of the land offered and they fear that this small step will be the last. Large families are cramped into small concrete and corrugated iron huts where economic deprivation is prevalent. Although all the Palestinian factions are represented in the Bekaa camp, it has traditionally been a stronghold for Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah group. However, in recent months opposition to the peace talks and the curtailment of financial aid and welfare benefits from the cash-trapped PLO has led to disillusion and contempt for Mr Arafat's policies. The refugees fear the worst from the Gaza/Jericho accord. They refuse to believe Mr Arafat's claim that the deal will be the initial stage to a full Israeli hand-over of the West Bank and they see little improvement for themselves should the deal be implemented. In some quarters of the camp there is open hostility or murderous undertones at the mention of Mr Arafat's name. Fuelling the anger are various Islamic groups, particularly Hamas which has seen support grow since the inception of the peace process in Madrid in 1991. Bands of fundamentalists can be seen walking around the camp lobbying for support of their rejectionist policies of an all-or-nothing deal with Israel. Their uncompromising stance is that either they take all the pre-1967 lands back immediately and capture the rest of Israel later or the armed struggle will continue. The Amman-based spokesman for Hamas, Mr Mohammed Nazal, condemns the agreement as 'an end to Palestinian hope'. Furthermore he predicts that it could lead to increased inter-Palestinian rivalry and possibly civil war both inside and outside the occupied territories. The majority of Palestinians in the camp support the Hamas line of continued armed resistance, whatever the outcome of the current 11th round of peace talks. Jordan is home to the largest number of Palestinian refugees. Figures from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency show that in 1992 more than 1.1m refugees were registered in the kingdom. Almost 70 per cent of Jordan's population is Palestinian and one quarter of the country's population are considered refugees. The future of the refugees is an important point of discussion on the Israeli-Jordanian track at the peace negotiations, but the Palestinians in Bekaa are not comforted by discussions and the peace agenda. In the al-Hussein refugee camp in the heart of Amman, refugees reacted with anger or resignation. 'We reject all of this because all of Palestine, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean is ours,' said Mr Adnan al-Hindi, a Hamas supporter who runs a pharmacy in the Amman camp. 'These people (Arafat and the PLO) either gave up half way through our struggle. . . or are traitors,' added Mr Hindi, who was born in the town of Qibab and who has been a refugee in Jordan since the 1948 war. But Sami Ahmed, a butcher at al-Hussein who supports Mr Arafat, said: 'We have no choice but to accept the Gaza-Jericho plan. . . We have been fighting the Jews for 45 years and we got nowhere. Now we have to make concessions to get somewhere.' 'We have had enough statements and heroics,' said Mr Hussein Abdullah, 60, and a merchant in the Ain al-Hilweh part of Amman. 'Thousands of Palestinian martyrs have fallen in the armed struggle but nothing has been achieved. Perhaps this step is a beginning to building an independent Palestinian state.'</p>

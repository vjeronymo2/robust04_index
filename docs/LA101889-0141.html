			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TOO RELAXED 'TOWN' HAS ITS MOMENTS  </P> <P> The Brea Theatre League's "Wonderful Town" is often too leisurely for its own  good, belying the near-feverish, cosmopolitan energy of New York City that the  1953 musical is meant to evoke. But it does have enough of a screwball sway and  a punchy performance by Carole Ball in the key role of Ruth to be diverting.  </P> <P> Based on the popular 1940 stage laugher, "My Sister Eileen," the Leonard  Bernstein/Adolph Green/Betty Comden show doesn't try for much more than setting  up the gag that two sisters can get into lots of trouble and meet lots of  peculiar people in the big city. The songs are wrapped around this premise not  like a fur coat, but like a good wool jacket -- functional but not exceptional.  </P> <P> The kicks come not so much from the score but from watching Ruth and Eileen  (Christine Martin) move from one scrape to another, whining about going back  home to Ohio but (of course) being thrilled by the jaw-dropping charm of  Manhattan, especially Christopher Street, where artists, beatniks and other  eccentrics gather like strange fauna.  </P> <P> Director Kent Johnson goes at all this with a relaxed gait, never quite pumping  up the action to reflect the chaos the girls encounter. Roberta Kay's  choreography is reasonably imaginative and generally well-performed, but it too  has a processional pace to it.  </P> <P> Still, Johnson does manage to locate the daffiness of "Wonderful Town" even  though it's a blurred sort of daffiness. His best moments come when Ruth, a  writer with a Hemingway bent, is asked to act out some of her stories and when  Ruth, again, gets entangled in a Conga line with a gang of amorous Portuguese  sailors. Did I mention that this is a very silly musical?  </P> <P> Ball gets much of the credit for making these scenes work. Her voice doesn't  soar, but she does understand what acting in a musical is all about. It's a  fully inflated but entertaining turn.  </P> <P> As the prettier, more naive Eileen, Martin has a difficult time keeping up with  Ball, but she doesn't really have to. Everyone here is suppose to support Ruth,  and Martin keeps up her end, especially by bringing the best voice to the  production.  </P> <P> There are dozens of wacky characters scattered through "Wonderful Town," the  most interesting being the dim ex-jock Wreck (Gary Gibson), magazine editor Bob  Baker (Steve Williams), newspaper hack Chick (McCullon Smith), painter  Appoplous (Fred Valencia) and ever-ready hooker Violet (Laura Sellers).  </P> <P> 'WONDERFUL TOWN'  </P> <P> A Brea Theatre League production of the musical, with lyrics by Betty Comden  and Adolph Green, music by Leonard Bernstein and book by Joseph Fields and  Jerome Chodorov.

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN BACKS WILSON ON CRIME BILL  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson and the man he hopes to succeed as governor, George  Deukmejian, disagree on abortion rights, offshore oil drilling and the  regulation of dangerous pesticides. But the state's two most prominent  Republicans showed Monday that they can always find common ground in that old  GOP standby: crime.  </P> <P> At a Capitol news conference with several crime victims and family members of  victims present, Deukmejian endorsed Proposition 115 -- the so-called "speedy  trial" initiative -- which Wilson has sponsored and made a chief component of  his campaign for governor.  </P> <P> And Wilson pooh-poohed as a "cynical ploy" Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's  warning that a provision in the law-and-order ballot measure could threaten the  abortion rights of California women if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the Roe  vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in 1973.  </P> <P> He said Proposition 115 will improve the state's court system. "For better than  a quarter-century the state Legislature . . . has refused to prosecutors, peace  officers and the citizens of this state the protections they are entitled to  have," Wilson said. "There is a fundamental right of all Californians not to be  victims."  </P> <P> Deukmejian said the initiative campaign gives new meaning to the old maxim that  "justice delayed is justice denied."  </P> <P> "It's the victims and their families who are denied justice as a result of  these long delays," said Deukmejian, who has built his 28-year political career  around an anti-crime theme.  </P> <P> Among other things, Proposition 115 would eliminate pretrial hearings after  grand jury indictments, give to judges rather than lawyers the right to  question jurors before a trial and consolidate trials of multiple defendants  accused of committing the same crime.  </P> <P> The measure would also conform the right of privacy in California law to that  in federal law, where the right to privacy is not spelled out in the  Constitution but instead is subject to the interpretation of the U.S. Supreme  Court. Van de Kamp and several abortion-rights groups argue that this provision  of Proposition 115 could give new life to an old law on the California books  that makes certain abortions a crime. That law has been considered  unenforceable since California voters placed a right to privacy in the state  Constitution in 1972.  </P> <P> Wilson rejected Van de Kamp's use of the abortion-rights argument as an  underhanded attempt to defeat the initiative. "His tortured legal theory is a  cynical ploy," Wilson said. "The ballot language makes it clear that this is in  no way a threat to the existing . . . right of privacy which the people of  California voted into the Constitution."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor against  former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, is circulating his own  court-reform bill to get the necessary signatures to put it on the November  ballot. It is identical to the Wilson initiative, except that it has language  saying abortion rights would not be affected. Feinstein has endorsed the Wilson  initiative.  </P></p>

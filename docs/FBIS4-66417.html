			<p>CSO     [Text] In FY94 the STA's National Aerospace Laboratory  (Director, Kazuaki Takashima) will start developing a  world-class, high-temperature shock wave wind tunnel which can  create temperatures of 10,000 degrees C as well as hypersonic  speeds of Mach 10-20. The plan is to create an environment as  close as possible to that of atmospheric re-entry, essential for  R&amp;D on the ``HOPE'' space shuttle and manned ``spaceplane.''  The  new wind tunnel will make it possible to ascertain the micro  phenomena of ionization and atomic state collision against  airframes when atmospheric air is compressed under shock waves.  The design phase is scheduled to start in FY94 and construction  will be completed in 3 years at NAL's Kakuda Research Center.  Japan's ``extraterrestrial'' research system will be established  with the completion of the new wind tunnel.    For space shuttles such as the HOPE to re-enter the  atmosphere and return to the earth, it is essential to develop  structural materials and heat-resistant materials able to endure  shock wave compression of several thousand atmospheres and  atmospheric frictional heat. To solve these problems, NAL has  been developing various kinds of wind tunnels. However, this is  their first high-temperature, high-speed shock wave tunnel.    Only a handful are available in the world, namely Germany's  HEG, Australia's T-3 and T-4, and the U.S. Calspan96HST. NAL's  wind tunnel will be superior in performance to those existing  wind tunnels. For example, a wind force of 4-8km/second and  temperatures in the range of 3,500-10,000 degrees C will be  produced. Impulsive force will reach 2,000 atmospheres. The wind  tunnel is capable of testing under the molecular dissociation  phenomenon which occurs at high temperatures (oxygen dissociates  when the temperature goes above 2,200 degrees C, nitrogen, above  6,000 degrees C), and the ionization (above 8,000 degrees C)  phenomenon. The wind tunnel is 80 meters long, the compressor  tube is 45 meters long, and the shock wave tube is 20 meters  long. The measurement section measures 1.2 meters. The testing  time is 2 milliseconds.    In order to generate a shock wave, first compressed air is  discharged from a high-pressure gas storage vessel at 300  meters/second. Next, helium gas in the pressure tube is led to  the shock wave tube at 2,500 atmospheres and 3,000 degrees C.  Finally, the gas in the shock wave tube is discharged into the  measurement section at speeds up to Mach 20. It is a structure  similar to a three-stage water pistol. Much attention is being  paid to the new wind tunnel which can produce data from actual  tests that cannot be obtained through simulation.</p>

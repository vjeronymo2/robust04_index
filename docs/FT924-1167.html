			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Too staid for coded clue Sir, Until I saw the letters column of December 15 I had innocently assumed that David Cannadine's article ('The Royal dilemma that won't go away', December 12) was a leg pull by your admirable crossword editor. It seemed to be a coded clue: Contributor is one canned and avid colonial (5,9) - (David Cannadine). As a reader of 50 years' standing I should have realised you are much too staid to include first year undergraduate humour; at least by intention, even if execution goes awry every decade or so.

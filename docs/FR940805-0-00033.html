			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Several commentators argued that, in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation costs incurred outside a storage facility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution costs should also include all costs (i.e., labor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, and occupancy costs) incurred after a sales order has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been received, regardless of whether these costs are incurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inside or outside a storage facility. They stated that the costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of retrieving the goods and readying them for shipment are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the nature of deductible selling and distribution costs and do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not relate to the production, acquisition, or holding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the proposed regulations cites the Blue Book  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the 1986 Act which states that deductible ``distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses are intended to include only external distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, that is, those costs incurred in transporting goods from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayer's warehouse or retail outlet to the customer, or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the customer's agent, a common carrier, or some other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary. Distribution expenses do not include costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moving inventory from a taxpayer's warehouse to its retail store  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other internal transportation costs.'' Joint Committee on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taxation Staff, General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986, 99th Cong., JCS&hyph;10&hyph;87, 510 n.61. Commentators contended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this reference was taken out of context and suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it should be used to define the nature of an activity (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment to a customer vs. internal transfers) rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location of an activity (e.g., inside an off-site storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility vs. the loading dock).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These final regulations retain the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution costs contained in the proposed regulations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service and Treasury continue to believe that this definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution costs provides for a better matching of income and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related expenses because gross income is not typically recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the sale of an item when an order is placed, but rather when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the item is shipped, delivered, or accepted, or when title to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item passes to the purchaser. Since costs incurred inside a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage facility are typically incurred prior to an item being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipped, delivered, or accepted, or when title passes, these costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be capitalized until income is recognized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Conference Report to the 1986 Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically states that ``processing, assembly, repackaging, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar costs, including labor costs attributable to unloading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goods (but not including labor costs attributable to loading of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goods for final shipment to customers, or labor at a retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility)'' should be capitalized. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 841, 99th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cong., 2d Sess. II&hyph;306 (1986), 1986&hyph;3 (Vol. 4) C.B. 306. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because Congress intended that costs incurred prior to loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goods for shipment be capitalized, distribution activities should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be construed to begin any earlier than at the loading dock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Pick and Pack Costs and Repackaging Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Several commentators have expressed concern that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of distribution costs contained in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations may result in some taxpayers abandoning the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the simplified resale method. In response, these final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations except ``pick and pack'' costs from the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitalizable handling costs incurred inside a storage facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These final regulations define pick and pack costs as those costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred inside a storage facility in preparing specific goods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for imminent shipment to a particular customer after the customer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has ordered those goods. Examples of pick and pack costs include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred to move specific goods from a storage location in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation for shipment to the customer, pack or repack those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goods for shipment to the customer, and stage those goods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment to the customer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pick and pack costs, however, do not include occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, such as rent, depreciation, insurance, taxes, utilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and maintenance. The Service and Treasury believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion of these costs from the scope of pick and pack costs is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with Congressional intent that all off-site storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and warehousing costs be capitalized. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. II&hyph;306 (1986), 1986&hyph;3 (Vol. 4) C.B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 306. Furthermore, this position is supported by the Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report to the 1986 Act. In a footnote to the Conference Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conferees state that ``[o]ffsite storage and warehousing costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally include the cost of a facility whose primary function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the storage or warehousing of goods.'' H. R. Conf. Rep. No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. II&hyph;306 (1986), 1986&hyph;3 (Vol. 4) C.B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 306. Thus, because the primary function of an off-site storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is the storage or warehousing of goods, all occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred at an off-site storage facility must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitalized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the above rule for pick and pack costs essentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaces the exception for repackaging costs contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations, the separate exception for repackaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs is unnecessary and has been eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

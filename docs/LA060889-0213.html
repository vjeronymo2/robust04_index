			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HARD-PRESSED GRAF BEATS 15-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> Defending champion Steffi Graf, pushed to the limit by the tournament's  youngest player, outlasted 15-year-old Monica Seles 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 today to  reach the French Open women's final.  </P> <P> Seles, an unseeded Florida-based Yugoslav with smashing ground strokes on both  her forehand and backhand, gave Graf her toughest match in a Grand Slam  tournament for more than a year as she forced the West German into a stream of  errors.  </P> <P> In the final Saturday, Graf will meet 17-year-old Arantxa Sanchez, the first  Spanish woman ever to reach the championship match at Stade Roland Garros.  Sanchez, the No. 6 seed, downed Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami -- fourth-round  conqueror of Gabriela Sabatini -- 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> Sanchez only had to keep the ball in play to make it to the final. Fernandez  made a catalogue of elementary errors and hardly hit a winner as she was blown  away in an unspectacular match that lasted one hour, 18 minutes.  </P> <P> By contrast, the Graf-Seles match was full of thrills.  </P> <P> Going for the lines on almost every point, Seles stopped Graf from getting into  her usual attacking groove and stayed with the world's No. 1 player until 3-3  in the final set.  </P> <P> Only in the last three games did Seles' hopes of pulling off one of the  greatest upsets in women's tennis evaporate. She dropped her serve to go down  5-3 and Graf, relaxing for the first time, served out the match at love.  </P> <P> "I'm really satisfied," said Seles, who was playing her first Grand Slam event  and had eliminated two seeded players, Zina Garrison and Manuela Maleeva.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter I lost. I'm proud of myself. To tell the truth, all through  the match I didn't think I could win," Seles said.  </P> <P> "Maybe just a little bit, when it was 2-1, 30-love in the third set, I thought  I might have a little chance, but when I started to think about it, my hands  started shaking."  </P> <P> Seles did far better than that, becoming the first player since Sabatini in the  final of the U.S. Open eight months ago to take a set off Graf in any of the  world's four major tournaments.  </P> <P> "I was playing pretty badly; I wasn't scared of her," Graf said. "Sometimes you  have good days and bad days. Today was not my day at all.  </P> <P> Throughout the tournament, Seles had attracted more attention than any other  woman player because of her age, colorful costumes, bubbly personality and  devastating base-line game. The confrontation between the new young star and  the world champion was one of the most eagerly awaited of the tournament.  </P> <P> Sanchez has met Graf in two semifinals this season already, at Amelia Island,  Fla., and Hilton Head, N.C., winning a total of 11 games.  </P> <P> "I've got nothing to lose now," said Sanchez, who has reached the semifinals of  all eight clay court tournaments she has competed in this season. "I'm playing  the No. 1 player in the world. I'll just try to play my game."  </P></p>

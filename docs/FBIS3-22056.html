This is why trafficking gangs are now hijacking the trucks  that transport these chemicals. The police have reported that  20 to 25 tons of sulfuric acid have already been stolen by  criminal gangs.    The police source said that links have been established  between the gangs that attack these trucks and trafficking gangs.    Since the middle of last year there has been close  coordination between the Industry Ministry, the National Customs  Administration Superintendency, and the Antidrug Division  (Dinandro) over the importation of chemical products.    In the past few weeks Dinandro agents discovered that two  gangs are hijacking trucks that transport chemical products used  to prepare cocaine base. It has been established that the  stolen chemicals were sold to trafficking gangs that manufacture  cocaine.    Several attacks on trucks transporting sulfuric acid from  Centromin Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] were reported  recently in Cerro de Pasco and La Oroya.    The police have said that traffickers are paying $16 per  liter for sulfuric acid when its normal price is $1.    The police are trying to break this connection between  common  criminals and traffickers in an effort to prevent this from  becoming a new method to escape police control on chemical  products used to manufacture drugs in Peru.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Jockeying for position - The battle in the TV listings market Until March 1 this year the market for television listings magazines in the UK was a market like few others, quaint even by British standards. All over the rest of Europe a diversity of listings magazines, some countries with as many as 30, is normal. Yet in Britain there was only the Radio Times for BBC programmes and later on TV Times for commercial television. Each jealously guarded its monopoly and sued any publisher which broke it. The only limited exception was for newspapers - they could print weekday schedules 24 hours in advance, 48 hours at weekends. The listings duopoly was nearly overturned by the Monopolies Commission in 1985. The commission found that the listings duopoly was anti-competitive but, on the casting vote of the chairman, Sir Godfray Le Quesne, strangely it found that it was not against the public interest. A suggestion by the commission that other publishers should be able to get the information under licence was ignored. The drama intensified in December 1988 when the European Commission ruled that the titles of programmes should be freely available. A year later the then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd denounced 'the dotty duopoly' and set the beginning of last month as the date for opening up the market. Partly because of the government's own Copyright Act which strengthened the concept of intellectual property, the 'dotty duopoly' could not be overturned entirely. In future, however, the broadcasters had to make the listings available to any other legitimate publisher under licence - a licence they could charge for. For the first time the British viewing public is able to get all its programme schedules - BBC, commercial television, satellite and cable - under one cover. The controversy is, however, far from over. Companies such as ITP, publishers of TV Times and What's On TV, are threatening to take the BBC to court in the UK and to Brussels for abusing its dominant position by using its own airtime to promote its magazines such as Radio Times. Newspapers are also angry because they now have to pay for listings material that once was free - some weekly papers are even boycotting programme listings because they cannot afford them. Formal complaints have been made to the Copyright Tribunal, the body that will adjudicate on fair rates for listings. It's all a long way from the hopes of the original campaigners who argued that publicity for television programmes benefited broadcasters and that programme details should simply be available for free.</p>

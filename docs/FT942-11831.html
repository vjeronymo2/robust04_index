			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / CBI warns on rising wages: Factory pay 'up 2.7%' The Confederation of British Industry yesterday warned manufacturers to keep pay awards under control as it published figures that showed settlements edging up and productivity increases slowing. According to the latest report from the CBI's pay databank, manufacturing pay awards averaged 2.7 per cent during the first quarter of the year. This was a slight increase on the 2.5 per cent average for pay awards in the three months to February and it is ahead of the current inflation rate of 2.3 per cent. Productivity improvements fell marginally, averaging 4.4 per cent provisionally for the first quarter, compared with 4.6 per cent in the second half of last year. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, warned that pay behaviour during the coming months would determine whether or not manufacturing consolidated the competitive gains made over the past couple of years. He said: 'Other countries in Europe are now tackling their cost competitiveness in a determined way. German labour costs are falling and pay settlements are running well below the inflation rate.' Pay settlements in service companies continued to drop over the first three months of this year. Pay awards averaged 2.4 per cent for the first three months of the year compared with 2.6 per cent for the last quarter of 1993. The CBI figures show that in both manufacturing and service sectors the spread of pay awards has widened, which it believes reflects 'the varied picture of economic activity in different industries'. One-in-six manufacturers and one-in-four service companies had imposed pay freezes for periods of up to 12 months in the first quarter. Since last August, 44.7 per cent of manufacturing settlements were between 0.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent, with a further 26.4 per cent making settlements of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent and another 9.1 per cent between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent. In services, 15.4 per cent of the private service settlements since last August were freezes, while 34.8 per cent were between 0.1 and 2.5 per cent and 28.5 per cent between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent. Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts, said: 'Pay deals have been edging up since the start of the year reflecting higher output and inflation. Firms appear to be settling faster because of April's tax changes.' The CBI databank annually covers about 1,200 settlements in manufacturing and over 500 in services.</p>

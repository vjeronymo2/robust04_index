			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rule, the Agency will not grandfather existing uses except in specifically identified cases. The grandfathering provisions under SNAP do give the Agency flexibility to address unacceptable listings that might disrupt industry's transition away from ODSs. For this final rule, the Agency was not presented with significant evidence from the public comments to believe universal grandfathering of existing substitutes is warranted. The Agency believes that given the diversity of the industries covered under the SNAP program, a case-by-case review of applications using the banned substitute would be necessary to protect human health and the environment. Moreover, EPA must be able to justify any grandfathering on a case-by-case basis under the grandfathering criteria established in the Sierra Club case, as described below in section VI.B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of HCFC&hyph;141b, the Agency has elected to maintain the proposed grandfathering period for existing uses, since many users switched to HCFC&hyph;141b when it was believed to offer sufficient risk reduction. In comparison, for perfluorocarbons, the Agency has made clear from the beginning of their suggested use as substitutes that the Agency has concerns about the global warming potential of these chemicals. EPA believes, therefore, that an extended grandfathering period in this case is not warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Agency agrees to grandfather for use, existing supplies of a substitute in the possession of an end-user as of March 18, 1994. Therefore, persons who transitioned to a substitute for an end-use prior to this final rule may continue use of all existing supplies of the substitute purchased prior to March 18, 1994 until that supply is exhausted. As of the effective date of this final rule, only substitutes purchased prior to March 18, 1994 can be used. Under the four-part test to judge the appropriateness of grandfathering (see section VI.B of this final rule), the Agency determined that, on balance, the results of this test favors this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing inventory of final products manufactured with or containing a substitute designated unacceptable as a result of final EPA rule-making within an end-use covered under SNAP could theoretically be legally sold after listing. Producers should be aware, however, that they will be effectively barred from selling a substitute for use once it has been deemed unacceptable under SNAP, because potential purchasers will not be able to use it. After the effective date of this final rule, users will not be able to use any additional supply of a banned substitute purchased after the publication date of the unacceptable listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exemption for small sectors and small volume uses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA proposed to exempt small volume use applications requiring less than 10,000 pounds per year of an ODS substitute from SNAP review. This proposal generated substantial confusion. Many commenters pointed out that the 10,000 pounds exemption from reporting and review under SNAP was vague, and asked for additional clarification. Specifically, commenters asked whether EPA intended the 10,000 pound limit to apply at the process, plant, company, or sector level. If applied at the sector level, some commenters noted that an individual end-user might have enormous difficulty compiling volume information related to the behavior of an entire industry sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to these comments, EPA has decided to maintain the small use exemption but provide the needed additional clarification of the Agency's intent. The Agency will exempt from the section 612(e) notification requirements substitutes used in quantities of 10,000 pounds or less per year within a major industrial sector covered under SNAP. The responsibility for reporting under the notification requirement for SNAP falls on those introducing substitutes into interstate commerce, not on the individual end-user. Similarly, relief from reporting, if within the bounds of the small use and sector exemption as defined, rests with the same person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

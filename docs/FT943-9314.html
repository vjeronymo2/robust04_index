			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Telecom Italia gets approval Italy's anti-trust authority yesterday gave the formal go-ahead to Telecom Italia, the telecommunications operator created from the fusion of five state-owned companies. But the authority warned the Italian government that if problems in certain areas of telecoms liberalisation were not dealt with quickly, 'the competitive development of the markets could be compromised'. The authority urged Rome to accelerate implementation of the EU's directive on liberalisation of telecoms data and added-value services, guarantee free and non-discriminatory access to networks, promote alternative networks, set up an effective independent regulator, and end potential discrimination in the maritime communications sector. Trading in Telecom Italia shares - which replace shares in Sip, the domestic telecoms operator - will begin next Thursday in Milan.</p>

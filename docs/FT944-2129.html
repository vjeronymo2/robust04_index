			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kolbenschmidt hits out over T&amp;N stakebuilding Kolbenschmidt, the German automotive components supplier, yesterday attacked the attempted acquisition of a majority stake by T&amp;N, the UK automotive components and engineering group, as 'an unfriendly takeover'. Mr Heinrich Binder, chairman of the Kolbenschmidt management board, held talks with the German cartel authorities in Berlin yesterday in an attempt to block the deal. Protest petitions signed by 2,500 workers have been sent to the economics ministers of four German states. Mr Binder said: 'We do not need anyone to help us financially. We have achieved the turnround and are back in the black.' T&amp;N announced in September that it would pay up to DM282.6m (Pounds 117.7m) to acquire a 52.5 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, which designs and manufactures a wide range of engine pistons, bearings and bushes, oil and water pumps and aluminium castings. The deal would make T&amp;N one of the world's leading producers of engine pistons, vying for the number one position with Mahle of Germany. In bearings it would rival Federal Mogul of the US. The UK group has secured an option to purchase the majority stake, but the deal is subject to approval by competition authorities in the US, Germany, France and the UK. Mr Binder said he believed that the German cartel office would block the deal. T&amp;N claimed that it had received 'numerous offers of support' from leading German vehicle makers. It acquired its option on the majority stake as part of the restructuring of Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and engineering group, which sold its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt to Commerzbank and institutions. T&amp;N's option expires at the end of March. An initial verdict from the German cartel office is expected in February. Kolbenschmidt said yesterday it had achieved a pre-tax profit of DM14m in the year to September, against a DM114m loss. Group turnover fell by 21 per cent to DM1.25bn.</p>

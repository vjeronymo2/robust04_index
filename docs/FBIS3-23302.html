Last year the interior board servicemen liberated 47  hostages, including 6 children. During the past two months 12  hostages have been liberated. In the meantime, Sidorenko  believes that criminals actually seize at least twice as many  people.    In his opinion, an increase in hostages in the near future  will be caused by the aggravating competition among criminal  gangs for the spheres of influence in St. Petersburg. In this  connection, Sidorenko noted a considerable rise in illegal arms  supplies. According to him, since the beginning of this year,  the regional board for combat against organized crime has  confiscated about 70 firearms, supplied mainly from Estonia.  Sidorenko pointed out that it is difficult to trace arms  supplies due to the lack of cooperation with the police of the  Baltic states. "Sometimes it is easier for us to cooperate with  FBI and Scotland Yard than with the Baltic states' police," he  noted.</p>

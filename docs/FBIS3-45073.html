			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station correspondent Li </F> Renzhu (2621 0088 0031) and XINHUA correspondent Li Niangui  (2621 1628 6311)]    [Text] Beijing, 23 Dec (XINHUA) -- At the Second Presidium  meeting of the 12th Executive Committee of the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions [ACFTU] which ended today, ACFTU  President Wei Jianxing called on trade unions [TU] at all levels  to enhance their consciousness of opportunity and their sense of  the overall situation, and to fulfill the duties of a TU in  promoting development of the overall situation.    Touching on the arrangement for next year's work for the  ACFTU, Wei Jianxing stressed it is necessary to successfully  carry out the following five tasks in a down-to-earth manner:  1) persist in focusing efforts on economic construction and  treat the promotion of economic development as the central task  of the TU's; 2) take active part in reform and promote reform  by laying emphasis on successfully transforming the operating  mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a modern  enterprise system; 3) play an active role in establishing a  stable labor relationship, in maintaining the legitimate rights  and interests of staff and workers, and in maintaining social  and political stability; 4) take more part in legislation and  policies, and give full play to the role of TU's as a democratic  channel and in social regulation; and 5) strengthen the building  of contingents of staff and workers.    Wei Jianxing pointed out: In the face of heavy and  complicated reforms next year, TU's must unite and mobilize the  broad masses of staff and workers to stand steadfastly in the  forefront of reform and to vigorously support, participate in,  and promote reform by laying emphasis on successfully  transforming the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and  establishing a modern enterprise system. He said transforming  the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a  modern enterprise system are the basis for the establishment of  a socialist market economy, the orientation for the reform of  state enterprises, and the focal point for the next-step assault  on fortified positions and for our TU work. He believed  implementation of the fundamental policy -- rely on the working  class wholeheartedly -- must not change in socialist China. So  long as the role played by the public ownership of enterprises  as the principal part remains unchanged, the position of staff  and workers as the masters of enterprises; their rights to  exercise democratic management of, democratic participation in,  and democratic supervision over enterprises through staff and  workers' congresses and through other forms; and the rights of  enterprise TU's to represent and maintain the legitimate rights  and interests of staff and workers, as well as to independently  conduct work according to laws and according to TU regulations,  shall remain unchanged no matter how state enterprises'  operating mechanisms are transformed.    Wei Jianxing stated: Stabilizing labor relationships and  maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of staff and  workers is an important social responsibility of TU's. There is  a lot of work to do now. Four points must be stressed: First,  we must show concern for the livelihood of staff and workers who  encounter difficulties. Second, we must attach importance to  production safety. Third, we must maintain the legitimate  rights and interests of staff and workers of enterprises, and in  particular, of foreign- invested enterprises and private  enterprises. Serious infringement on the legitimate rights and  interests of staff and workers, and even violation of their  personal rights and insult to their human dignity, have occurred  from time to time among these enterprises. We must pay close  attention to such phenomena. Fourth, we must quicken the pace  of establishing experimental TU's for village and town  enterprises. He said: TU's represent staff and workers to  participate in administration of state and social affairs and in  democratic management and democratic supervision of enterprises  and institutions. This is a great trust placed by the party in  TU's, a demand set by staff and workers on them, and a right  vested by law in them. TU's at all levels must make efforts to  enhance their law consciousness and must take the initiative to  successfully fulfill their duties of participation with perfect  assurance.    The presidium meeting opened on 20 December. It was convened  mainly for the purposes of studying and implementing the  "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and determining the ACFTU's major tasks in 1994 in the  light of the actual conditions of TU work. In addition, it  heard a report on the investigation of the serious "19 November"  fire accident at Shenzhen and discussed how to improve TU work  among foreign-invested enterprises.</p>

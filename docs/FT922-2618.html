			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Unholy alliance of the heart robs Ukraine of its head: Nationalists back the old communists where independence is the deal and policy the price THE statue of Lenin which once presided over the Ukrainian parliament has been replaced by a huge blue and yellow Ukrainian flag. In government offices the hammer and sickle have given way to the trident, the Ukrainian national crest, and portraits of Lenin have been replaced by those of Taras Shevchenko, the national poet. But in that parliament and those government offices, the old communist deputies and party functionaries still dominate. The reason is an alliance that Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, has forged with the nationalists who form the bulk of the organised political opposition in Ukraine. It is an alliance based on an unwritten deal: Mr Kravchuk and the moderate communists he leads have backed Ukrainian independence and in return Ukrainian nationalists have allowed the apparat to remain in power. And economic policy is footing the bill. 'The communist nomenclatura which was in power yesterday and the day before yesterday is still in power today,' said Mr Volodymyr Filenko, one of the few Ukrainian members of parliament who directly criticises the government. Mr Kravchuk has generously fulfilled his side of the bargain. Historically, Ukrainian independence has been a losing proposition - in the past millenium Ukraine has enjoyed only three periods of statehood, each more tenuous than the last. But with the cunning Mr Kravchuk at the helm Ukraine has successfully sailed past the dangerous shoals of the Soviet Union and is moving out of reach of Russian domination. Mr Les Taniuk, a theatre director turned politician and one of the most vocal critics of the nationalist-communist alliance, says many Ukrainian nationalists take the view: 'Let us unite with the devil, with the Bolsheviks, with anyone at all, so long as we become independent.' Two of the three co-leaders of the strongest independent movement in Ukraine have said that they support the president. This spring, the newly-elected heads of the Ukrainian Republican Party, once the most radical in Ukraine, said that their organisation should choose co-operation rather than conflict with the government. Mr Kravchuk, pleading the need for a strong executive able to implement economic reform, has won extensive authority to rule by decree and has created a network of presidential plenipotentiaries throughout Ukraine. Nearly 80 per cent of these representatives are former communist functionaries and they enjoy the same nearly feudal powers once exercised by the old communist regional bosses. For example, Mr Ivan Sali, the presidential representative in Kiev, has tried to oust western organisations with valid leases on city property in the hope of replacing them with higher-paying tenants. Western officials privately acknowledge their concern about the authoritarian turn in Ukrainian politics, which extends to Ukraine's sycophantic mass media, but Mr Kravchuk is gambling that the west will accept Ukraine's touted political stability as a proxy for genuine pluralism. Ukraine has been less successful at selling its lacklustre economic programme abroad. On a recent visit to Kiev, Mr Larry Summers, chief economist of the World Bank, warned Ukrainian officials that: 'There is an understanding that reforms are necessary but that which is going on in Ukraine today can not be called reform.' Mr Summers found fault with almost every aspect of the government's reform plan: the budget, seen as a cosmetic effort to please the International Monetary Fund, setting over-ambitious targets and not establishing a structural basis for reform; the tax scheme, according to which enterprises can pay a wapping 60 per cent of revenue; the social welfare net, more generous than impoverished Ukraine can afford; the price system, still not fully liberalised; the state order, a code word for central planning which remains the guiding force in the Ukrainian economy; and the privatisation plan, which looks good on paper, but has not yet been implemented. Ukrainian politicians who oppose the government's course warn that failure to reform the economy will ultimately backfire. Their fears are borne out by wildcat strikes throughout the Russified eastern Ukraine - which supported independence in the belief that it would bring prosperity - and the Donbass miners' threats to go on strike. However, in the short term, Ukrainian communists are cushioned from public pressure by their nation's rich black earth,which guarantees Ukrainiansa relatively high standard of living no matter how inept their government. Just over six months since the nationalist-communist alliance drew an overwhelming 90 per cent yes vote in Ukraine's referendum on independence, dissenters are emerging, with the goal of creating a real alternative to Mr Kravchuk's government. Mr Viacheslav Chornovil, a former political prisoner from western Ukraine, hopes to transform the republican party into a genuine opposition party. New Ukraine is trying to unite eastern Ukrainians, ethnic Russians and businessmen around a call for more radical economic reform. The two groups came together last week to call for the resignation of conservative prime minister Vitold Fokin. But their bid was defeated in a 168-154 vote in parliament which prompted Mr Volodymyr Lanovoy, deputy prime minister and a member of New Ukraine, to threaten to resign. But the mounting hostility between Ukraine and Russia threatens to breathe life into the alliance which swept Mr Kravchuk into power in the first place. As Mr Taniuk, a Chornovil supporter, warned: 'If the chauvinist line is strengthened in Russia, that is dangerous because it will enhance Kravchuk's authority here.'</p>

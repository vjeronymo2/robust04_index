The Mojahedin-e Khalq said in a statement published by its  Paris office that "it never carries out bomb attacks that  endanger the lives of innocent people," adding that it "clearly  condemns this sort of act."    Three passers-by were wounded and shops were damaged near  Ferdowsi Square in downtown Tehran late Thursday when two bombs  apparently placed in a rubbish bin exploded on a street corner,  the official news agency IRNA said in Tehran.    A woman later phoned IRNA from Paris to claim responsibility  for the blast on behalf of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, Iran's main  armed opposition group, the agency reported.    An IRNA reporter saw an ambulance rushing three people to  hospital, where officials said one of them was critically  injured.</p>

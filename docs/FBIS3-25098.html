			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Fifty officers of the future Mozambique Defense  Armed Forces [FADM] today began a command and management  training course. Ceremonial speeches were expected to be  delivered on the occasion, but Mozambique National Resistance's  [Renamo] Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo caused a stir.  [passage omitted]    [Begin Ngonhamo recording] I would like to repeat that this  is a nonpartisan army. Its officers can never make political  decisions, because the politicians are the right people for  that. Your decisive role is to defend the country from any  possible threat or aggression. Our country is threatened from  all corners. All neighboring countries pose a threat to  Mozambique. Likewise, there are some Mozambicans who are still  guided by the spirit of revenge and violence. Some of them are  hiding arms; others are secretly training forces. You, however,  have bet on peace, not violence. There is no reason for alarm.    I would like to answer a question posed by two officers. My  answer will be for all of you. They asked me what was the  mission of the troops undergoing training. For your  information, Mr. Nihia, the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] Party secretary for Nampula, is the leader of a  1,000-man group that has been secretly trained in Nampula. The  United Nations is aware of it. The United Nations has been  informed and tried to investigate the case in the field, but was  prevented from going there.    My question is: Who will those troops attack? They will not  attack Renamo, Frelimo, the Mozambique United Front-Democratic  Convergence Party, the National Convention Party or any other  party. They are supposed to attack the FADM. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, General Eduardo da Silva Nihia has reacted to  Gen.  Mateus Ngonhamo's accusations. This afternoon, Nihia rebutted  the accusations, saying his mission in the province is to  educate Frelimo members and sympathizers as well the residents  in general on how to take part in the multiparty elections  scheduled for October 1994. He demanded that Gen. Ngonhamo  produce evidence about his alleged involvement in the training  of the 1,000 men and the hiding of arms.    [Begin Nihia recording] I do not know where Gen. Ngonhamo  got  his facts. He must produce evidence. He must say that arms are  hidden in such and such a place and Nihia is responsible, and  that men are being trained in such and such a place and that  Nihia is responsible. The truth is that, right now, I know  nothing about it. My task has to do with the Frelimo Party.  Gen. Ngonhamo will have to produce facts, places, and districts  in Nampula Province. The war is over, and our party believes  that. [end recording]    We asked Nihia to comment on Renamo's accusations leveled  against him.    [Begin Nihia recording] My reading of the situation is that,  in Nampula Province, Renamo is desperate. Renamo has been  unable to consolidate its position here. The residents have  rejected Renamo.    You will recall that in November 1992, Renamo claimed that  it  had a strong following among Nampula Province residents. Now,  the situation is different. When they come here they talk about  me precisely because I am charge of this province politically.  I feel Renamo does that because they realize they have no room  for maneuver here.    Pensado [Renamo's representative for Nampula Province] is  always insulting people. That is his policy. We do not wish to  argue on the basis of insults. That is to go too low. He  insults me, [Nampula Province Governor] Gamito, and other  people. He has no grounds for such insults. So, I think Renamo  is desperate. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Arts: Agongo: an opera in the making - Jane Mulvagh reports on Damien Hirst's first venture into this medium Live rats suspended in a cage, a snake and an indefinable embryo - Damien Hirst, the enfant terrible of contemporary British sculpture, is at it again. This time, however, his chosen medium is opera. Firefly Productions, a new young multi-media creative team, presents the overture and finale of its new opera Agongo at the Edinburgh Festival next Sunday alongside Hirst's installation for the piece. The opera preview, at the Demarco European Arts Foundation, is part of Firefly's drive to raise Pounds 300,000 to complete the production. Its full-length debut is to be held at the Union Chapel, Islington, in May next year and there are plans to take it to Berlin, New York, Venice and Sydney. Firefly Productions is the brain-child of young art dealer Daniel Moynihan, who has commissioned talents from across the range of the arts to create an opera based on an environmental short story he wrote 15 years ago. The music is by Mark Springer and Sarah Sarhandi. Piano and viola performers respectively, Springer and Sarhandi set up the high-energy band Rip, Rig and Panic, which has recorded with Virgin Records. The sets are by Hirst; the costumes by Japanese fashion designer, Kohji Tatsuno; and Julian Hope, with experience at Glyndebourne and the Welsh National Opera, will direct. Hope's influence will, it is suggested, temper the assortment of radical talents to meet the inter-disciplinary rigours of opera. The Edinburgh taster suggests that Hirst's visceral observations on modern life and Moynihan's bleak libretto will be counterbalanced by the beautiful lyricism of Springer and Sarhandi's score. In a 35 square foot room the viewer will walk round a 25 square foot cage suspended at head height. The cage confines live rats bedded down in bottles and is suspended over, but cut off from, a verdant jungle beneath which an indefinable embryo struggles to be born. A series of neon-lit images - a snake, a capsule, a tablet - hang on the walls and the 15 minute experience is supported by a synchronised light show 'playing to' the overture and finale. According to Moynihan, the opera's theme dwells on man's mindless adherence to tyrants who exploit any belief - science, medicine, environmentalism - for self-aggrandisement. A tribal chief, Agongo, is in the thrall of a dwarf who controls the tribe by metamorphosing from witch doctor to Russian general and finally to western surgeon, wreaking havoc with broken promises. The music fuses conventional instruments with sounds of the jungle and the industrial world. Sections of the score focus on solo players - a clarinet plays over the dawn chorus, for example - while the libretto includes confrontational raps, with one singer chanting a mantra of diseases in Latin while another retorts with surgical and pharmaceutical palliatives to the accompaniment of respirator machines. Neither side is granted victory, but there is hope that Agongo may become a 'green' man. This cautiously proselytising work is targeted at the kind of audience which might attend Philip Glass operas or Michael Clark ballets and Moynihan hopes that commercial sponsors - fashion labels or ice cream brands, perhaps - eager to ally themselves to modish issues and target a specific age group and lifestyle, might see marketing benefits here.</p>

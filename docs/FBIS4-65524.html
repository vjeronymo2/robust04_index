			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Skinhead Demonstrations; Maroni </F> Issues Ban, Replaces Officials"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- As a national demonstration  staged by skinheads Saturday [14 May] in the northern city of  Vicenza continued to spark a hue and cry of protest throughout  Italy, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni this evening said that  he had imparted instructions that from now on such  demonstrations would be banned and recalled the Vicenza police  chief and prefect.    Maroni said that the Vicenza police chief had authorized the  march off his own bat, without informing the ministry, and that  the latter had evidently given the green light after taking only  matters of public order and safety into account, with no  political assessment.    In fact, no violence broke out during the demonstration, but  the sight of hundreds of skinheads marching through the streets  in black leather, arms raised in the Fascist salute, set off  alarm bells up and down the peninsula. Already Sunday evening,  national police chief Vincenzo Parisi issued a communique saying  that he had issued instructions that no such marches or rallies  would henceforth be allowed, in the interests of public order.    The Vicenza police chief Romano Argelio was said to be  replaced by his colleague Di Censo, while the prefect Michele De  Feis was being replaced by Castronovo.    Meanwhile, it was learned that police blocked an attempted  demonstration outside the French embassy in Rome Monday night  [16 May] by a score or so of extreme right-wing youths belonging  to an association called Spina nel Fianco (Thorn in the Side).    Men from the special Digos branch of the police force  detained the youths who said they wanted to commemorate  Sebastien Dyzisu, the 22-year-old ultra who plunged to his death  from a fifth-floor window in Paris on May 7 trying to escape  police after clashes which erupted when a skinhead boutique was  shut down. Among the members of Spina nel Fianco detained and  later released was Stefano Andrini who, along with his brother  Germano, was convicted in 1991 to 4 years and 8 months in jail  for taking part, along with other skinheads, in an attack on two  youths in Rome in June of 1989.    For his part, Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightist  National Alliance [AN], said those who took part in the skinhead  demonstration in Vicenza over the weekend were numbskulls who  would do better to go work in the mines. There is absolutely no  connection between the entrance of the AN in the government and  this first ever national skinhead demonstration in Italy, he  insisted.    It was later learned that he called for the withdrawal of a  bill presented earlier by the AN to abrogate that part of the  Constitution which bans the recreation of the Fascist Party.    The Vicenza demonstration was led by Piero Puschiavo, who is  under investigation for attempting to re-form the banned Fascist  Party of Benito Mussolini.    Puschiavo, who heads an organization calling itself the  Veneto Skinheads Front, founded in Rome in 1991, at a rally  following the march praised Fascist ideals and compared Fascists  killed during World War II to those who died fighting against  Mussolini and Hitler.</p>

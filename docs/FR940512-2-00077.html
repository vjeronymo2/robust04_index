(``EPS''), owner of the Money Access Service (``MAC'') regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') network. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The complaint alleges that EPS's refusal to allow the MAC network's bank customers <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  to obtain ATM processing services from providers other than EPS violates the antitrust laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPS is a Delaware corporation owned by four bank holding companies: CoreStates Financial Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; PNC Financial Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; and KeyCorp, Albany, New York (successor to Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio). These four bank holding companies consolidated their various ATM networks (MAC, Owl, Jubilee and Green Machine) into EPS. MAC had previously been owned entirely by CoreStates. EPS plans to add two other equity owners: Mellon Bank Corporation and National City Corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The customers of an ATM network are the depository institutions (banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions) that seek to give their depositors access to an ATM network. These depository institutions are referred to collectively as ``banks'' in this Competitive Impact Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complaint's two counts allege: (1) That a business practice of EPS is a tying arrangement that is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1, and (2) that this typing arrangement is a means by which EPS has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of the State of Ohio (the ``affected states''), in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of this practice is to foreclose competition from competing data processing companies in the affected states. Furthermore, because those competing data processing companies would otherwise provide means by which MAC member banks could access competing regional ATM networks, this practice has the effect of excluding those networks and maintaining EPS's monopoly in regional ATM network access in the affected states. The complaint seeks an injunction prohibiting EPS from continuing the tying arrangement, and other relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, March 7 (XINHUA) -- China's first cable  television station in Kazak language was formally opened for  service Sunday [6 March] in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, another step in bringing modern culture to  one of the world's last nomadic cultures.    The station will broadcast colorful locally-made or  translated Chinese and foreign films, TV plays and other  artistic programs in the Kazak language to about 500,000 viewers  all over the Asia-Pacific region who have waved farewell to  nomadic lives.    The 1.1-million Kazak population is mainly scattered in  Xinjiang and Gansu Province.    Traditionally the Kazaks have lived on horseback, spending  their whole lives moving about seeking pasture and water for  their herds, totally cut off from basic education and health  care facilities, not to mention advanced culture.    In recent years state and local governments have encouraged  and helped more and more nomadic Kazaks to settle down and  engage in the processing of livestock products instead of their  single traditional pursuit of animal husbandry.    Along with efforts to stimulate local economy, governments  at  all levels have attached great importance to promoting  traditional Kazak culture to satisfaction of the Kazak people's  spiritual needs.    Broadcast and television have been cited to perform the  task,  having the advantages of being rapid, popular and vivid.    In 1989 the first Kazak-language TV news programs were  beamed  to the whole autonomous region, enabling Kazaks along both sides  of the Tianshan Mountains to be well informed and entertain  through a product of modern civilization for the first time in  their lives.    Moreover, 24-hour Kazak-language TV broadcasting programs  have been offered since the end of last year by the local  regional TV station.    Traditional Khazak culture, including ancient poems, fairy  tales, proverbs and mottoes, which used to be transmitted mainly  by storytellers, has spread even wider among the Kazak people  thanks to TV and radio broadcasts with distinct local flavors.</p>

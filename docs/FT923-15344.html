			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Observer: Overlooked There's no question that the UK Treasury's chief economist Alan Budd is right to call for outside advice on topics economic. But whether he's asking the right people to give it, is another matter. True, given the dismal science's strong rivalries, any list that didn't include everybody was bound to put some noses out of joint. Even so, there were some brow-furrowing omissions from the affable Budd's Great George Street pow-wow. One was David Stout, chief economist at Unilever and soon to begin a new career in interpreting business strategy at London Business School. A second absentee was Shell International Petroleum's formidable head of economics DeAnne Julius. Still others were Julian Tapp of British Aerospace, Glaxo's Robert Jones, and Jim Hirst of Esso. That is, of course, not to imply any inability on the part of those who were invited to give a good blow-by-blow account of the spiralling decay being experienced by large chunks of British industry. They included, for instance, Richard Freeman of ICI, RTZ's Phillip Crowson, Kate Barker of Ford and GKN's Leslie Gunde. Next time, however, Budd would do well to spread the net wider. In particular, why not invite some of the livelier City economists who're always complaining about lack of opportunities to swap data with Treasury counterparts?</p>

A universal view in the West is that this program  has been set out as NATO's new strategy, which aims at dealing  with the new challenges facing European security in the wake of  the Cold War.    The so-called new strategy is that NATO will establish  peaceful bilateral relations with partnership countries to  gradually expand NATO to the eastern part of Europe, thus  establishing a new European security system with NATO as its  core.    This new strategy has been developed on the basis of the two  previous NATO summits that determined changes in military  strategy and expanding dialogue and realms of cooperation; it  involves NATO's role and all aspects of the new structure of  European security under the new situation. Viewing the summit  communique and President Clinton's speech, the main contents  include the following:    1. The United States is determined to play a new leading  role in a historic turning point for NATO to revitalize the  organization;    2. NATO's gate will be open to East Europe, the CIS, and  other West European countries; NATO will decide whether or not  to accept their membership depending on military conditions and  political cooperation between the two sides;    3. As a means of military intervention, it will organize and  establish a multinational joint task force comprising NATO and  non-NATO member countries; this task force will be under the  command of the Western European Union, with access to NATO's  communications, equipment, and logistics forces;    4. Under the conditions of a termination of the "common  enemy," NATO's chief target is to deal with "common dangers,"  and presently the emphasis is being laid on dealing with  existing border and ethnic contradictions and the conflicts  arising therein, such as the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and    5. NATO is to accelerate its conversion from a military-  political organization to a political-military organization so  that it can safeguard European security and stability more  effectively.    To promote NATO's new strategy, the United States has  presented a new attitude of improving relations with closer ties  to its European allies. President Clinton called for joint  U.S.-European efforts to restructure European security, and said  that the United States would continue to carry out its  obligations in Europe. Clinton pledged before the leaders of  the 15 member countries that his administration would be  different from that of his predecessor and that he "will support  European efforts to promote its own security and interests."  The United States wants to exercise leadership over NATO, but  is unwilling to get too involved in European conflicts; it can  openly allow Europe to "play a greater role," with its European  allies taking a greater responsibility for defense. Another  cause in which the United States finds the assistance of its  European allies indispensable is if it wants to "merge" East  European countries with the West; everyone knows that some East  European countries have long expressed the hope to join NATO.  Viewing actual conditions, Western Europe also has aspirations  to strengthen security, but its unity on defense remains quite  fragile. On the security issue, Europe will have to continue to  rely on the United States. The strongest voice for U.S.  assistance to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina came from  France, which has always advocated independent defense; this  serves as a very good example.    The prerequisites for expanding NATO and realizing European  security are U.S.-European solidarity and cooperation. However,  viewing the present situation, the United States needs to handle  well its relations with Russia. Some people believe that the  most significant symbol of President Clinton's European trip was  the U.S.-Russian summit. Those observers who show concern for  NATO, whether in favor or not of NATO pushing eastward,  "consider Moscow with anxiety." Those who are in favor of this  worry that they will be labeled as "opposing" Moscow, and those  who oppose it are not without misgivings about "isolating"  Moscow. It was by no means accidental that the United States  did not dare to present a list of countries included in a plan  to push NATO eastward. Clinton had to go to Prague to remove  some of the leading contenders misgivings; more importantly, he  had to go to Moscow personally to weigh the pros and cons of the  issue. Two points of major U.S. concern are, namely, first,  whether or not Russia's political stability and economic reform  are on the right track; and second, what is really in Yeltsin's  mind about the expansion of NATO, and whether or not Russia  insists on possessing a "particular position" and "leadership"  in security arrangements involving Eastern Europe and within the  CIS.    In Moscow, Clinton stated that he would continue to support  Yeltsin, and, giving much food for thought, the two sides  announced that no new dividing line should be drawn in Europe.  It seems that this proves the fact that in pushing NATO's new  strategy, the United States has continued to adopt the cautious  policy of giving "priority to Moscow." Although the United  States has repeatedly stated that East European security and  U.S.-European interests are linked as one, and that it is ready  to implement the "partnership for peace" program, nevertheless,  all this cannot affect U.S.-Russian relations. It seems that it  will not be easy for the United States to realize NATO's new  strategy. Let alone the Russian factor, viewing the West, we  find that it will be very difficult to unify the differences  which exist in understanding between the United States and  Europe and within Western Europe. As for Eastern Europe and the  CIS states, their reaction to NATO's new strategy has been  different. Under such circumstances, it is still hard to tell  what the bottom line is in pushing NATO eastward, which country  will be the first to be absorbed, what the effects and results  will be, and what a future European security structure will look  like. In commenting on the results of the current summit,  REUTER said: "The problems caused by NATO's role in Eastern  Europe and other regions will be more numerous and more  serious." That is not an exaggeration.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Franco-German oil joint venture A joint venture between units of Germany's Thyssen Lurgi and Technip of France yesterday finalised a DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) contract for a turn-key oil refinery in Leuna in eastern Germany, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. The refinery will process 8.7m metric tons of crude oil annually and will produce high octane petrol and diesel fuel with a low sulphur content. The joint venture to design and construct the refinery was formed in February 1993 but became bogged down in negotiations with authorities in eastern Germany.</p>

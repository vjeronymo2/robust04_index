			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Strauss back at Garsington - Opera Once the home of Lady Ottoline Morrell and her husband Philip, Garsington Manor is now the mini-Glyndebourne of Oxfordshire. The Morrell gardens, more romantic than Glyndebourne's, are superbly kept up; and this year for the sixth Garsington Opera season the terrace-auditorium has been expanded and equipped with a retractable canopy. Emboldened by the success of Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos last year, Garsington has mounted his Capriccio as the opening 1994 show. No mean undertaking: old Strauss's 'conversation-piece for music in one act' is in fact a substantial opera in length, singing personnel and orchestra. Ideally it requires more seasoned stars than Garsington can afford - and a singable English version (half the audience kept their eyes glued to the bilingual text, until it became too dark for reading). That said, however, this brave performance was full of sympathetic charm. The conductor Elgar Howarth found just, unhesitating tempi, and balanced his modest Garsington Opera Orchestra with expert finesse. Except in the lovely opening string sextet - but anyhow the producer-designer David Fielding chose to counter that with onstage distractions. Not content with the basic joke, that the Capriccio we are watching is the very opera that its participants are deciding to write, Fielding has made it into a practical dress rehearsal, with the 'director' La Roche constantly fussing at the edges. That slightly spoiled Countess Madeleine's final monologue too, where she havers exquisitely between Words (the poet Olivier) and Music (the composer Flamand). Yet Edith Pritchard, tall and svelte, had a warm grip on its sense; all she lacks so far is the long-breathed amplitude for its most celestial phrases. Her Olivier was Nicholas Sears, with a disaffected touch of the Gary Oldmans and a sharp white suit; voice forceful at climaxes, dry elsewhere. When Flamand first appeared in the comfortable, spreading person of Richard Morton, I took him for the Major-Domo, but he displayed a nice lyrical intelligence. If Glenville Hargreaves looked a bit senior for Madeleine's roue brother, his easy subtlety with the German words and the music surpassed everyone's. Contrariwise, young Patrick Donnelly has to play 30 years older for La Roche, but cleverly. Other roles were well filled; all very pleasing. In repertory until July 8, with Haydn's L'Incontro improvviso and Rossini's Barbiere di Siviglia (Garsington 0865 361 636) Since the premiere of his Tryst at Peter Maxwell Davies' Orkney Festival five years ago, James MacMillan - 35 this year - has become one of the most successful and sought-after composers of his generation. His 1990 Proms commission, The Confession of Isobel Gowdie, was a palpable hit; and at the beginning of last season the Philharmonia made him their Visiting Composer. This week he conducted them in two of his pieces - respectively old and new, both very striking: Into the Ferment from 1988, and the trumpet concerto Epiclesis he wrote last year for John Wallace. Both of them celebrate states of blissful intoxication, the one on malt whisky (inspired by a Burns ballad, 'Willie brew'd a peck o' maut') and the other on the mystery of the Eucharist. MacMillan is a devout Roman Catholic with a musical sense of humour. Into the Ferment, a Scottish Chamber Orchestra commission, belongs to that burgeoning genre, music designed for a youth orchestra - here the excellent Kent County band - stiffened with some professional players. It is a model of its kind. It rollicks seriously, if not soberly; gives its younger performers plenty to do (notably a trio of reeling trombones); and deploys the grown-up players only where they count, not so as to reduce the band to mere accompaniment-status. The nine movements of Into the Ferment are audibly well-argued as well as funny, and they amount to a little epic of unexpected breadth and depth. Epiclesis is expressly about transubstantiation, unlikely though that may seem. MacMillan's device is to set up two distinct musical strands, an impassioned explosive one and a rich, grave one based on Gregorian chant, and let them interpenetrate little by little by osmosis. The solo trumpet, wild and brilliant, serves as a first-person-singular protagonist (Wallace was superb), with a long, questioning cadenza-reverie. The large orchestra - six horns, a plethora of percussion - runs from sonorous mystical background to hammer-fisted blows. The trombone trio of Into the Ferment acquires a tuba, the better to intone the candidly hymn-like material. MacMillan's sophisticated rhythmic tricks take on a towering, exuberant force as the music moves into ecstatic dance-mode: not unlike Messiaen's comparable movements in spirit, but far less ritually formal. It is a mystery why British composers should be at the fore in enhancing the meagre trumpet repertoire, but they are. Along with Birtwistle's Endless Parade and the recent Maxwell Davies concerto, MacMillan's Epiclesis sounds like a permanent gift to virtuoso trumpeters.</p>

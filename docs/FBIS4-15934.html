			<p>BFN     [Text] An expert of Russia's Social-Ecology Union Marina  Khotuleva told newspeople in Moscow that the radiological  situation in different areas of the Russian Federation was  complicated owing to the continued operation of the state  nuclear complex facilities. More specifically, the  environmentalists are worried about the situation at the  chemical plant Mayak in the Chelyabinsk Region of the Urals.    According to the Social-Ecology Union, Mayak produces daily  up to 100 Mn [million] curie [Ci] of radioactive waste and dumps  more than 1 Mn Ci into the lakes Karachai and Staroye Boloto.  The two lakes are responsible for the contamination of the  region's underground waters.    Mayak operates in a zone of high seismic activity where  earthquakes of up to 7 points on the Richter scale can take  place, at the same time a number of man-made lakes with a total  of some 400 cu m [cubic meters] of liquid radioactive waste in  them have been dug out in the main flow of the Tech River.    The large amount of radioctive waste in the Chelyabinsk  Region explains why there are 60 percent more cases of  children's leukemia in Chelyabinsk-65 and Chelyabinsk-70, where  Mayak operates, than in other industrial centers. The  Social-Ecology Union feels the region must be declared an  ecological disaster zone.</p>

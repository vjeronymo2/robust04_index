This is an important meeting in the  process of reform, opening, and economic development in this  region.    The tasks of the conference are to: Comprehensively  implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee and the national economic work conference;  analyze the current economic situation; arrange this year's  economic work; and mobilize cadres and the masses in Ningxia to  further emancipate their minds, unify their thinking, grasp the  opportunity, quicken reform and development, and create a new  situation in the economic work of this region.    Party and government leaders of the autonomous region Huang  Huang, Bai Lichen [chairman of the regional government], Ma  Qizhi, Ma Xiguang, Wang Yu, Ma Wenxue, and Liu Zhong attended  the meeting. Wang Qixing, vice chairman of the autonomous region  government, presided over the opening session. Responsible  comrades from all prefectural, city, and county governments and  departments in charge of economic work; leaders of all relevant  regional departments; representatives of large and medium  industrial enterprises in Ningxia; and responsible comrades from  the democratic parties, totalling over 300 people, attended the  meeting.    At the opening session, Bai Lichen, chairman of the regional  government, delivered an important speech entitled: "Deepening  Reform, Adjusting Thoughts, Grasping the Opportunity, and  Accelerating Development." The speech was divided into five  major parts. While analyzing the current economic situation,  Bai Lichen pointed out: In 1993, we comprehensively implemented  the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and continued to  carry out the instructions Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave on his  inspection tour to the south; we also made positive explorations  regarding the establishment of the socialist market economy and  made major progress in this region's economic and social  development. On the basis of the economic recovery [hui sheng  0932 0581] in 1992, economic growth moved onto a faster lane  last year and the GDP for the whole year reached 9.5 billion  yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the previous year and  exceeding the target of 9 percent. The output value of primary  industry increased by 4.5 percent; that of secondary industry  increased by 13.2 percent; and that of the tertiary industry  increased by 9.2 percent. Local financial revenue reached 1.08  billion yuan, increasing by 40.6 percent over the previous year.  When affirming that the region's economy was developing  healthily and stably, Bai Lichen also analyzed the existing  difficulties and problems in the course of economic development:  People's thinking was still not completely free from the  shackles of the old concepts and systems and was still not  commensurate with the requirements of the new situation; the  pace of reform was not quick enough and some deep problems in  economic life have not been thoroughly solved; a considerable  number of state- owned enterprises have not effectively  transformed their management mechanisms and continue to incur  serious business losses due to poor management and poor economic  efficiency; and no marked results were achieved in handling the  "bottleneck" problems which constrained economic growth with  some becoming even more serious.    This year, reform in the whole country will make advances  across the board and breakthroughs will be made in some key  areas; economic construction will enter a new development period  as the process of establishing the socialist market economic  structure will be quickened; and this region will also grasp the  opportunity to advance reforms and accelerate development. In  his speech, Bai Lichen said: According to the "Decision"  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the spirit of the national economic work  conference, the guideline for this year's economic work in  Ningxia is: Follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory about building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  profoundly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee and the national economic work  conference, further emancipate our minds, advance reforms across  the board, expand opening to the outside world, adjust the  structure in an intensive way, enhance the economic efficiency,  take firms steps to build the basic framework of the socialist  market economic structure, and promote the sustained, rapid, and  healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660]  development of the region's economy.    The second part of Bai Lichen's speech called for deepening  understanding, emancipating the minds, and boosting morale to  meet the new opportunities and challenges. When analyzing the  favorable and unfavorable impact of the international and  domestic situations on this region's reform and development, he  pointed out seriously that, apart from being constrained by  certain objective conditions, people still lack the sense of  market and have not yet emancipated their minds thoroughly.  They are still affected by the traditional concepts of the  planned economy over a long period of time, so they are slow to  react under the new situation and lack a sense of crisis and  urgency. This is a major obstacle to our current work. In  order to accelerate development, such mental obstacles must be  removed; otherwise, we shall not be able to make advances. Only  through substantial emancipation of the minds can great  developments be made in reform and economic construction.  Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the concepts of reform and  development, to increase the sense of competition and  efficiency, and to adopt the concepts of self-strengthening,  self-reliance, and self-development. It is also necessary to be  fully aware of the favorable conditions, increase confidence,  and boost morale. We must be bold in making advances and we  must not hesitate and let opportunities slip. We cannot slow  down reform because we are afraid of difficulties and continue  to wait; cannot slow down development by holding a negative  attitude of complaining about the difficulties; and we cannot  see the widening of the gap between this region and other  localities by having a parochial and complacent attitude.    In the third part of his speech, Bai Lichen called for  intensifying reforms, advancing reforms across the board, making  breakthroughs in key areas, and quickening the pace of  establishing the socialist market economic structure. He said:  This year will witness the adoption of more reform measures  than in the past 10 years and more and the breadth, depth,  difficulty, and intensity of reform will all be unprecedented.  Our main reform task is to further deepen the enterprise reform  and more rapidly establish the modern enterprise system. This  is a key point and also a difficult point in the economic  structural reform of this region. We must take major actions  and adopt decisive measures to strive for major breakthroughs.  We shall conscientiously reform the financial and taxation  system, steadily advance the banking reform, quicken the reform  of the investment system, deepen the reform of the foreign trade  system, more quickly establish the social guarantee system, and  further advance the price reform. Bai Lichen stressed: When  advancing reforms in all fields, it is necessary to properly  handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. We must effectively advance reforms while keeping  stability, and, in turn, promote social stability through  deepening reform and accelerating development.    The reforms for the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure will inevitably produce a major impact on  economic development in this region. Therefore, in the fourth  part of his speech, Bai Lichen said that we should act  positively in compliance with the reform trend, increase the  intensity of adjustments according to the actual conditions of  this region, sort out our ideas and plans, fix a clear and  correct orientation, and effectively shift the economic work to  the path of being focused on the enhancement of economic  efficiency. First, we should renew our understanding of the  conditions of this region, adjust the investment structure, and  use the limited financial resources on the projects which will  yield the best returns. Second, we should constantly take  enhancement of economic efficiency as the central link in our  economic work and give top priority to optimizing the structure,  strengthening management, and enhancing efficiency. Third,  foreign trade should produce effects in nurturing production  development so that the Ningxia economy can be linked with the  international market. Fourth, new economic growth points should  be fostered and the individual and private economies and the  township and town enterprises should be developed greatly.  Fifth, great efforts should be made to foster and develop the  market system and to raise the market-oriented proportion of the  economy.    In the fifth part of his speech, Bai Lichen required  governments and departments at all levels to transform their  functions more intensively and improve their style of work more  effectively, thus guaranteeing the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the economy. In this regard, Bai Lichen stressed  three major points: First, it is necessary to quicken the  administrative structure reform of the governments in the course  of functional transformation. Government functions must be  separated from enterprise management and the administrative  structure should be streamlined and unified so that higher work  efficiency can be achieved. Through reform, we will establish a  new administrative structure which is suited to the requirements  of the socialist market economy and functions flexibly and  efficiently. Second, it is necessary to change the style of  work effectively and strive to improve the work quality. Local  governments and departments at all levels should overcome  seriously the superficial style of saying more than doing,  issuing general calls rather than giving concrete guidance, and  they should resolutely overcome the bureaucratic and formalistic  style in their administrative work. Leaders at all levels  should spend more time on making in-depth investigations and  studies in grass-roots units and among the masses and should pay  more attention to settling concrete problems in the work. It is  necessary to make qualitative and quantitative analyses, find  out the position of their own departments in the whole country  and find out their shortcomings, work out feasible measures, and  adopt the target responsibility system. It is also necessary to  bear in mind the overall interests and properly handle the  relationship between the overall interests and the local or  departmental interests, thus ensuring the smooth implementation  of all reform measures. Third, it is necessary to use both  hands to grasp the work and to keep both hands tough. At  present, it is necessary to use the theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics to educate cadres and the masses;  form the consensus of understanding, supporting, and  participating in reform in the whole society; and actually turn  the reform measures into the conscious actions of the masses.  While concentrating on reform, opening, and economic  construction, it is also necessary to attach importance to  education, science and technology, culture, public health,  family planning, and the work in other fields.    Finally, Bai Lichen said: We are now in a crucial historical  period and are facing arduous reform and development tasks.  Doing the economic work well this year is of great significance  for Ningxia's future development. As long as we further  emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, maintain unity,  boldly break new ground, and handle our work in all fields in a  down-to-earth manner, then we shall certainly be able to fulfill  all tasks; effect the sustained, rapid, and healthy development  of the economy in this region; and take new steps in the course  of establishing the socialist market economic structure.</p>

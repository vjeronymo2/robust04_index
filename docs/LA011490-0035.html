			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACING THE DIRECTIONS OF GAY THEATER  </P> <P> Probably the main reason theaters exist to do plays in which lesbian and gay  characters are central is that theaters such as the Mark Taper Forum do not do  such plays.  </P> <P> While the Taper touts its commitment to social issues such as prejudice, it has  consistently chosen to present only plays in which homosexual characters are  marginal, when they appear at all.  </P> <P> Significant plays in which the issue of homosexuality is central -- such as "As  Is," "The Normal Heart," "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove," "Torch Song Trilogy,"  "Bent" and "Kingfish" -- all managed to escape the Taper's notice. Even South  Coast Repertory produced "Breaking the Code" and "Cloud Nine," despite the  severe homophobia which infects Orange County.  </P> <P> This contrasts with the Taper's record, in which only plays such as "Fifth of  July" and "The Colored Museum" included gay characters.  </P> <P> DAVID LINK, Los Angeles  </P> <P> A third Taper play that included a gay character was the three-character "Burn  This."  </P> <P> </P></p>

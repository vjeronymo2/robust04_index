			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) ensuring that each institution of higher education in the State remains in compliance with the standards developed pursuant to section 494C of the HEA (these provisions are discussed below in greater detail);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assurances that the SPRE has the authority under State law to make agreements between the State and the Federal Government;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Assurances that the SPRE will review institutions reported to the State by the Secretary under section 494C(a) of the HEA (referred institutions) for the purpose of determining whether those institutions should participate in the Title IV, HEA programs on a schedule to coincide with the dates set by the Secretary to certify or recertify those institutions as provided in sections 481 and 498 of the HEA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Assurances that the SPRE will perform the functions authorized under this part and keep such records and provide such information as may be requested for financial and compliance audits and program evaluation, consistent with the responsibilities of the Secretary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A description of the relationship between the SPRE and the State approving agency for Veterans Affairs, the State guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the State agency responsible for administering the SSIG program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Provisions for SPRE contracts. The agreement must provide for the contracts the SPRE enters into with nationally recognized accrediting agencies or peer review systems as required under section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA, and the contracts the SPRE enters into with private agencies, accrediting agencies, or peer review systems for assistance in performing SPRE review activities as provided in section 494C(f) of the HEA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A plan for performing the functions described in section 494C of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to element (1) paragraph (A), the SPRE must represent any State entity that provides a license to postsecondary institutions to operate in the State or otherwise legally authorizes institutions to provide postsecondary education in the State. The Secretary wishes to make clear that the statute does not provide the SPRE the authority under the SPRP to provide licenses to or legally authorize institutions to operate in a State; the SPRE merely represents State entities that perform those functions. Similarly, under element (1), paragraph (B), the SPRE must represent any State entity that is responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards. Again, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the statute does not provide the SPRE the authority under the SPRP to ensure that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards; rather the SPRE must merely represent any State entity that has that responsibility. Moreover, a State is not required, for the purposes of this part, to create an entity responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards if such an entity does not currently exist. These statutory provisions are repeated in &sect;667.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the entities listed in the statute under element (5), in &sect;667.3(b)(4), the Secretary proposes to require the SPRE to describe its relationship with any State licensing body, any State-level entity that approves service providers under the Job Training Partnership Act, and any State-level entity that certifies vocational education. The Secretary proposes this requirement to ensure that all entities in the State involved with postsecondary institutions or postsecondary educational programs coordinate with the SPRE actions taken regarding those institutions or programs. The agreements the Secretary signed with States to implement the SPRP in fiscal year 1993 did not provide for a description of the SPRE's relationship with these additional entities. Thus, if any changes are required to be made to the agreement as a result of this proposal or other proposals in these regulations or as a result of public comment, States will be provided sufficient opportunity to execute new agreements. Any new terms will have a prospective effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for the proposed requirement under element (5), that the agreement describe additional relationships between the SPRE and other State authorities, the requirements contained in section 494A(b) of the HEA described above are repeated in &sect;667.3(a) and (b) and therefore cannot be changed by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

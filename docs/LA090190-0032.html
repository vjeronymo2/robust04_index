			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT FACES SMUGGLING CHARGES STEMMING FROM BOY'S DEATH ON I-5  </P> <P> A citizen of Mexico was charged Friday in federal court in San Diego with  felony alien-smuggling linked to the death of an 8-year-old Mexican boy who was  struck by a car and killed last month while dashing across Interstate 5 near  the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint.  </P> <P> Antonio Marin-Colon, 24, who was arrested Thursday by Border Patrol agents, may  also face federal and state prosecution, possibly even an involuntary  manslaughter charge, in the Aug. 8 death in northern San Diego County of  Constantino Loreto Marin, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> A manslaughter charge, which would be filed in state court, would mark an  aggressive and novel turn in the prosecution of alien smuggling that results in  highway deaths. The boy's death already has renewed calls for bolstered safety  measures to reduce the hazard to the undocumented pedestrians who regularly  cross busy San Diego-area freeways.  </P> <P> Over the past two years, the count of illegal aliens negotiating the area's  freeways on foot has increased dramatically, reflecting the rising volume of  illegal immigration, U.S. officials have said.  </P> <P> State prosecutors said Friday that they are still deciding whether the  manslaughter charge can be legally brought, but said initial indications are  that it would be proper.  </P> <P> "We'd have to satisfy the requirement of finding that (Marin-Colon) put (the  boy) in deadly peril through a very negligent act," said John A. Hewicker, a  deputy district attorney and chief of the office's complaints department.  </P> <P> "But, geez, crossing eight lanes of high-speed traffic in the commission of a  (purported) federal felony, it just seems like, and I haven't looked at the  statutes or looked at the laws, it seems, common sense-wise, that it ought to  be a punishable act," Hewicker said.  </P> <P> Hewicker said deputies did not have an immediate deadline for reaching the  decision.  </P> <P> Marin-Colon, a native of the southern Mexican state of Guerrero who has listed  his residence as Tijuana since last year, was arrested at 5 p.m. Thursday in  San Ysidro, Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said.  </P> <P> Also known as Amado Marcial-Hernandez, he was identified in a photo lineup by  other people who alleged he had smuggled them across the border, Swofford said.  </P> <P> Marin-Colon was charged Friday in federal court in San Diego with a single  count of alien smuggling, Assistant U.S. Atty. Pat O'Toole said.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Barry Ted Moskowitz set a bail hearing for next Friday, O'Toole  said. Marin-Colon is awaiting that hearing at the federal Metropolitan  Correctional Center in downtown San Diego, O'Toole said.  </P> <P> Marin-Colon has been arrested twice on felony alien smuggling charges, once in  September, 1989, and again last July, Swofford said. His record shows one  misdemeanor conviction -- for illegal entry -- from the two cases, Swofford  said.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, are studying additional charges against  Marin-Colon, most likely conspiracy to smuggle aliens, O'Toole said. Charges  directly stemming from the boy's death would have to be brought in state court,  O'Toole said.  </P> <P> Constantino Loreto Marin, accompanied by his mother and five other brothers and  sisters, was en route to Orange County from Mexico when he was hit and killed  along I-5 shortly after midnight Aug. 8 by a southbound car. The driver of the  car was not charged.  </P> <P> The boy was last in line among a group that was crossing the freeway about 1  1/2 miles north of the U.S. immigration checkpoint in northern San Diego  County. He died at the scene.  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: The Rake's Progress - Brighton Festival Brighton's Festival, large and popular, owes a debt to New Sussex Opera for its imaginative productions in the Dome in past years of Benvenuto Cellini and Tannhauser. NSO opened the musical part of this year's programme with Stravinsky's Rake's Progress, quite unsuitable for the Dome and given in the Gardner Centre. With no orchestra pit, limited stage possibilities and total absence of theatrical atmosphere that building has its own kind of unsuitability, underlining how inadequately Brighton, in spite of cultural pretensions, houses the arts. The likely outcome was that Stravinsky's prickly, glinting orchestral score would play havoc with the voices. Mercifully, thanks to devotedly careful playing from the NSO orchestra and to the watchful and understanding conducting of Lionel Friend, that did not happen. There was some toning down of sharp edges, and at favourite moments like the saraband for Baba's entry into Tom's house, there was more sound than bite. But given the circumstances the results were honourable. Among the leading soloists, Mary Hegarty's Anne Trulove was a delight. One does not often find a soprano who can look like a country girl and give such an accomplished account of both the big aria at the end of act one and the lullaby in act three. Tom Rakewell was Mark Curtis, a polished tenor without quite the full lyricism the difficult solos need. Adrian Clarke, the Nick Shadow, has an incisive, tenorish baritone, not black enough for this role, but as effective as the producer allowed. And so to the staging. John Lloyd-Davies may well have been anxious to avoid comparisons with the Cox-Hockney Glyndebourne Rake, still fresh in the memory. He has certainly made his version as unlike as possible. The permanent set is an outdoor jumble of drapes with a black and white cut-out of tall modern buildings expressionistically slanted and a no-style house for Tom. The Rake however marked a return to formal values: among other things a sense of place (not necessarily period place) is required by Auden and Kallman's text as well as the music. Of this there is no sign. Whimsical contemporary references abound, making a point or two - for a brief moment. Shadow communicates with Tom from an executive's desk by telephone. An expanding row of Roman clock-face numerals marking the running-out of Tom's permitted time is partly hidden by the orchestra. Lighting of the cyclorama by changing, possibly symbolic colours, is overdone. Moments in the score normally strongly poetic, like the trumpet solo uncannily evoking winter in a deserted London square, go for nothing. Were there ever whores so un-erotic (identical red ballet skirts)? The NSO chorus sings lustily; its acting is mainly notable for rushing about. Auctioneer Sellem was overplayed and undersung by Philip Slane, in a pop-star jacket. Mary King's Baba the Turk was touching in her kindness to Anne. Anthea Nayall's Mother Goose was barely audible. In the small role of Anne's father, Stephen Richardson was absolutely right. With all its faults, the show deserves a larger audience than it drew for the first night on Friday. Our expiring century has not produced many operas of such high quality. Performances tonight and tomorrow. Festival Box Office (0273) 676747.</p>

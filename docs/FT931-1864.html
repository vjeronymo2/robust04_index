			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Doubts over costs of Scottish reform MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, yesterday said the savings that could be made by reforming the structure of local government in Scotland may have been miscalculated, James Buxton writes. It is understood that some estimates of possible savings, made by Touche Ross for the Scottish Office and published in a green paper in October, may be too high, and some estimates of the cost of transition may be too low. The green paper proposed a move from the existing nine regional councils, 53 district councils and three unitary island councils to a single-tier structure. Touche Ross said savings would range from Pounds 192m a year for a 15-council structure to Pounds 55m for 35 councils, while a 51-council structure would cost Pounds 58m more. Transition costs ranged from Pounds 215m for 15 councils to Pounds 159m for 51 councils. But Strathclyde regional council pointed to flaws and omissions in the basis of the calculations and in an interview in The Scotsman Mr Lang said: 'It may well be that some of the assumptions made by Touche Ross will be less relevant when the final decisions are taken. For example assumptions about numbers of staff that would be needed are open to question.'</p>

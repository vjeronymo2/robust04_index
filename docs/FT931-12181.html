			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): New fund will track smaller companies - Investment Trusts / Indexed trusts offer the investor a degree of insurance: his holding should not be sabotaged by poor fund management decisions THOSE WHO believe in the long-awaited smaller companies revival got a chance to back their hunch at the end of 1992 with the launch of Hoare Govett's Smaller Companies Index Investment Trust. The new trust aims to track the extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding investment trusts) which included some 1,377 companies at the start of 1991. Indexed investment trusts are still relatively rare but offer the smaller investor a degree of insurance; his holding will keep up with the market and should not be sabotaged by the poor decisions of the fund manager. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index has outperformed the All-Share over the period since 1955; however, over the last four years the effect of recession and high interest rates have meant that large company shares have consistently beaten smaller stocks. The recent years may have taken their toll on investor demand; Hoare Govett raised only Pounds 28m for the trust, compared with its aim of up to Pounds 50m. But the Hoare Govett trust will prove a useful benchmark for other smaller companies trusts; the managers will need to beat the HG trust to prove they are earning their fees. BEYOND THE MERGER THE MERGER of Henderson Administration and Touche Remnant has created the largest fund manager in the UK investment trust sector. The combined group will have three of the top five performers of the past 10 years: Lowland (managed by Henderson) and Law Debenture and TR City of London (managed by Touche Remnant). Since investment trusts are legally independent companies, it was thought unlikely that merger would result in any management changes within the group's investment trust range (the unit trusts are another matter). Touche Remnant had been acquired by French bank Societe Generale in 1989, but the French group decided TR no longer had the critical mass needed in fund management. The combined Henderson-Touche Remnant would have around Pounds 10bn of assets under management - however, the problem of distribution, for a company with no links to banks or insurance companies, may remain. WHAT'S IN A BRAND? THE ISSUE of corporate governance was one which the investment trust sector was quick to tackle in the wake of the Cadbury report. The Association of Investment Trust Companies produced a set of guidelines in December, with the premise that an independent board is the best guarantee of good practice. This independence has come into question in recent years, with the growth of 'branding' of a range of trusts with company names incorporating the identity of the fund manager. Branding does have some advantages, because it helps to differentiate the trust in a crowded market, thereby attracting more investors and narrowing the discount, to the benefit of all shareholders. But is the board of a branded trust really likely to risk the loss of identity involved in sacking the investment manager? The AITC does not believe that branding will be a problem, provided that the majority of the trust board is independent. Independence will be rigorously defined. The AITC guidelines state that 'the condition of independence cannot be fully satisfied where a director is an employee or former employee of the manager, or a professional adviser to the manager, or is in any way remunerated by the manager.' It is to be hoped that the guidelines of the AITC, a purely voluntary body, will be followed by a sector which has known its fair share of scandals in the past. PEP AIMS FOR 9 PER CENT YIELD INCOME is the main selling point for the Schroder Split Fund, a split-capital investment trust, and the high income Pep linked with it. The fund has three classes of share: capital shares (where the return depends on gains made by the trust); zero-dividend preference shares (where the return is expected to be 8.25 per cent over the life of the fund); and income shares (which make up about 55 per cent of the fund but are entitled to receive the whole of its income). The high-income Pep will invest in the income shares of the Split Fund, which are expected to have a gross starting yield of 9 per cent. Fund manager Chris Rodgers says the trust's portfolio will be fairly concentrated, with about 50 different shareholdings geared to stocks yielding about 30 per cent more than the market average. Although he does intend to include some convertibles among the holdings, these are not expected to exceed 15 per cent of the total portfolio. The income shares involve the buyer in the risk that he will lose part of his original capital. The trust's assets will need to grow by 4.2 per cent a year for the income shares to be repaid in full. The zeros are more than covered (ie, there are enough assets to repay them in full) at the issue price. The minimum investment in the Schroder High Income Pep is Pounds 1,000, and the group will be giving priority to investors applying for up to the Pounds 6,000 Pep maximum. The initial plan charge of 5.25 per cent is to be waived for investors who apply for a Pep (for either 1992-93 or 1993-94, or both) during the launch period. The annual plan charge is 1 per cent, and income from the Pep can be paid out four times a year.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / TeleWest set to postpone float TeleWest, the largest cable television operator in the UK, is expected to announce today that it intends to postpone a flotation that would have valued the company at Pounds 1.7bn. The expected decision to postpone will be blamed on deteriorating market conditions. The TeleWest reassessment came as General Cable, one of the largest UK cable communications groups, yesterday became the second cable company on consecutive days to postpone flotation plans. The company, a subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, said it had decided to defer its proposed London listing 'in the light of market conditions'. Telewest, a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest cable operator in the US, and US West, the American telephone company, would only say last night it was assessing its options with advisers Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort Benson. The decision by TeleWest, which was planning a listing on the London Stock Exchange and a registration of American depository shares on Nasdaq, will have considerable influence on other cable companies planning to come to market. As recently as Wednesday Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive, suggested the float would go ahead. On Wednesday, Comcast UK Partners which was planning to raise funds through a secondary share issue in the US, postponed the sale because of poor conditions in the market. Comcast UK, part of Comcast the Philadelphia-based cable communications company, had planned to sell 11.75m shares for up to Dollars 18 each. When investors showed little interest at a floor level of Dollars 14 a share, the offering was postponed. General Cable holds cable franchises in the UK covering some 1.6m homes in areas including Windsor in Berkshire, Hillingdon and Hounslow in west London, and Birmingham, one of the most successful franchises in the UK. General Cable said yesterday that it remained committed 'to providing an opportunity for UK and international investors to participate in the development of the UK cable industry'. It would list in the UK and internationally when market conditions were favourable. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Early move on monopoly welcomed - Gas deregulation Independent gas companies hoping to enter the lucrative market for supplying Britain's 18m households were relieved to see that legislation for removing British Gas's mono-poly will be introduced soon. The shape of that legislation will be crucial in determining how many companies participate in the domestic market, where many have pledged to cut bills by 10 per cent. One of the most important tasks of the legislation will be to spell out the transitional arrangements and a timetable for bringing the industry into full competition by 1998. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has signalled that the market will be opened up in stages with an area - possibly the size of a county with 500,000 inhabitants - set up as a pilot project in April 1996. After that would follow a larger pilot involving 2m people in 1997. But most companies are looking to the onset of full competition a year later, when they will be able to compete on a national scale with British Gas. They want government legislation to contain a clear date for opening up the market to avoid gas deregulation being put off, especially after the next general election. Mr Peter Bryant, chairman of Utilicorp UK, an offshoot of the big US gas company, said: 'Companies need to make substantial investments to go into the household market, and uncertainty over when it will be opened up has hung over the industry for too long.' He reckons it takes at least Pounds 10m to set up the sort of infrastructure required for becoming a significant operator in the household supply market. This covers spending on computer systems, trained personnel and facilities for customers to pay their bills, before the price of securing supply from gas fields is considered. But the amount of investment required to enter the domestic market will depend very much on the regulatory requirements imposed on operators in return for a licence to supply households. British Gas is keen to see its rivals forced to meet the same social obligations as are now imposed on its monopoly business. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said: 'For everyone to share the benefits of competition it is essential that all entrants to the market share the obligations as well as the rewards.' The legislation should determine how onerous these social obligations will be. Generally it will involve independents setting up special provisions to cope with customers who have difficulty paying bills. It should also set rules on disconnections, care of older and disabled customers and advice on energy efficiency. If the regulatory requirements were very stringent they could deter some operators from entering the market. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen and oil company Conoco, said: 'We have to convince our shareholders that there is at least some margin and benefit in going into the domestic market.' This is why some players favour deliberate vagueness on social obligations, preferring to give the regulator discretion to change service standards as the market develops. Intense competition in the business gas supply market has already eroded margins to the point where British Gas is not much interested in trying to win back its lost market share. Competition will also be tough in the household market, with a shake-out expected in the next couple of years. Mr Bryant believes that only half of the present 30 to 40 operators in the business market will survive in a deregulated domestic market. The forthcoming legislation will have to set down rules governing the use of the pipeline system, which British Gas will continue to run, as well as giving new powers to the regulator to police pipeline operations.

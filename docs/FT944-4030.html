			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Elliott committed for trial Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman and former president of the Liberal party, was yesterday committed for trial on charges of theft and conspiracy. Three other former executives at his Elders IXL brewing and agribusiness group, one of Australia's most prominent companies in the late-1980s, were also ordered to stand trial. The ruling by Melbourne magistrate Graeme Hicks that the matter should go to trial follows four months of committal hearings, during which the prosecution alleged that the individuals had been involved in sham foreign exchange transactions totalling ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 33m). The purpose of these transactions, it was claimed, was to transfer money from Elders to companies connected to Mr Allan Hawkins, the now-jailed New Zealand businessman. The prosecution relied in large part on the testimony of Mr Ken Jarrett, another former Elders executive, who was orginally charged alongside Mr Elliott but subsequently pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and agreed to give evidence against his former boss. Mr Hicks, in his ruling, acknowledged Mr Jarrett was a self-confessed perjurer and had a motive for minimising involvement in the sham. However, he also said Mr Jarrett did not appear to be a manipulative and cunning liar, but a reliable and honest witness.</p>

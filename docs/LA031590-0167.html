			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED WAY CLOSING IN ON $95-MILLION GOAL FOR 1990  </P> <P> With less than two weeks remaining in its annual fund-raising campaign, United  Way of Los Angeles has raised $80 million of its $95-million goal.  </P> <P> Donations have been running 5% ahead of last year's pace, a campaign that  raised a record $88.3 million, campaign officials said. They predicted that  this year's campaign, which raises money for 360 social service and health  organizations in the region, will break that record.  </P> <P> "The finish is the toughest part of any race, but we are reasonably optimistic  that we can get it," said James Miscoll, Bank of America executive vice  president, who is campaign chairman.  </P> <P> Fund-raising efforts are just getting under way among some of the traditional  large donors, including financial institutions, aerospace firms and major  retailers. If the goal is reached by the March 29 deadline, it will be only the  third time in 20 years that the campaign has achieved its goal. The last time  was five years ago.  </P> <P> According to campaign officials, corporate giving is up 6%. Employee  contributions, which usually represent about two-thirds of campaign receipts,  increased 8%. United Way, which has been operating under new leadership, has  undergone major organizational changes in the last two years. Chief among these  is its expansion into new areas of fund raising.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the umbrella charity has looked to the workplace for most of its  contributions, with the largest companies and their employees providing most of  the donations. However, in recent years, economic conditions, company mergers  and consolidations and labor problems have eroded that donor base.  </P> <P> This year, United Way continued a strategy begun in 1989 of targeting smaller  companies and professional groups, including hospitals and universities, the  entertainment industry and the ethnic business community. Officials said they  initiated United Way campaigns in nearly 5,000 new businesses in the last two  years, 2,700 of them during this campaign. The most dramatic change has been  the board of directors' decision to discontinue setting aside a "reserve fund."  In recent years, the fund had been used to bail out campaigns that fell short  of their goal, said Leo Cornelius, United Way's executive director.  </P> <P> Traditionally, he said, money was allocated to the agencies before the money  was raised. The fund-raising goal was set based on these projections, often  resulting in shortfalls for the agencies. Now, Cornelius said, the campaign  will be conducted before the money is allocated.  </P> <P> "We are going to cut the cloth to fit the pattern," Cornelius said. "We'll only  spend what money we have to spend, and that is good fiscal management."  </P> <P> Campaign volunteers doubled to 1,700 during the last two years, officials said,  including an increase in the number of executives "loaned" to United Way by  companies to do staff work during the campaign.  </P> <P> Giving by Los Angeles county government employees reached $1,975,000, up  $25,000 despite a restraining order that limited the county's ability to raise  funds for United Way and another charity, Brotherhood Crusade. The order,  issued in November after the United Way campaign was well under way, was in  response to a lawsuit filed by a group of county employees who accused the  county of coercing its workers into contributing time and money to fund-raising  events.  </P> <P> The campaign calendar also was streamlined this year, cutting fund raising to  six months, almost three months less than in some recent years.  </P> <P> Miscoll said that move will benefit the campaign.  </P> <P> "Aristotle said that a work of art has a beginning, a middle and an end,"  Miscoll said. "Campaigns should not be any different. It adds urgency and  discipline to the effort."  </P></p>

Speaking to the English-language daily Tehran Times, Reza'i  denied Western reports that his country let the hardline  communist state to test-fire a medium range missile in Iran.    "We are very sensitive to having our soil and military  facilities used by foreigners," he said. "Iran will never opt  for such cooperation no matter how friendly the countries are."    Western newspapers and several military officials have  charged that North Korea would test the missile, named the  Nodong-2.    Reza'i revealed Tehran had turned down repeated requests  from  Russia to sell it US-made F-14 jet fighters and wire-guided  anti-tank missiles (TOW), "despite the enmity between Iran and  the United States."    The Islamic republic also refused to deliver to the United  States a Soviet-made T-72 tank, seized from Iraqi forces during  the war, as requested by Washington "through various channels,"  he said.    The general denied as "rumor and baseless" Western charges  that Iran tried to acquire nuclear weapons. "Political logic,  moral concerns and world realities stop us from trying to have  such deadly weapons."    Pyongyang, a main supplier of arms to Iran during its  1980-1988 war with Iraq, is suspected by the West of offering to  provide Tehran with 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) range Nodong-1  missiles, and to help in nuclear research.    Iran has repeatedly denied the charges, insisting that  contacts between the two countries are limited to economic  cooperation.</p>

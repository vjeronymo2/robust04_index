			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK siren song fails to charm Brussels THE UK's decision to revive proposals for a hard Ecu to trade alongside Europe's national currencies drew a cool response from the European Commission yesterday, Although there was no official reaction to the British idea, EC officials made clear that it would most likely meet the same kind of opposition from Brussels which helped to sink the plan during negotiations on the Maastricht treaty two years ago. Despite the de facto suspension of the exchange rate mechanism, the Commission is not ready to consider a British proposal which would be tantamount to withdrawing the Maastricht timetable for European monetary union and going back to the drawing board. Monetary officials in France, which has previously been cool towards the proposal of a hard Ecu, declined to comment on the proposal. But they emphasised France's continuing commitment to the existing timetable for monetary union, despite the widening of fluctuation bands within the exchange rate mechanism. A French finance ministry spokesman said the ERM would be able to return to narrow bands before very long and that convergence with Germany remained the objective of the French government. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, recently said that 'the principle of the EMS has been maintained' and that France was preparing a convergence plan in line with the Maastricht treaty. He said the plan would be ready by the end of the month. A Commission spokesman said British plans for the hard Ecu were still confined to news reports from London. Until Mr John Major's government submitted its proposals for improving economic co-operation in the EC, 'we have absolutely no comment'. Other officials in Brussels suggested that Mr Major's revival of the hard Ecu was aimed primarily at filling the political and economic vacuum created by the recent ERM crisis.</p>

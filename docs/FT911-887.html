			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Civil Service job-loss rules to change THE government is planning to end restrictions on how ministries choose civil servants for enforced redundancies. The initiative will further challenge the perception that a Civil Service job is a job for life. The Treasury will abandon advice to government departments that they adopt a 'last in, first out' principle when choosing candidates for redundancy. It is also withdrawing an 'order of discharge' list which lays down the types of employees who should be the first enforced redundancies. Until now, certain groups of civil servants, including those over 65 and those on temporary appointments, were first. The Treasury wants to give departments more freedom to choose, increasing the likelihood that less talented civil servants will be selected first. Civil Service unions are angry about the initiative. They believe the jobs for life image is already outdated after job losses in the past decade. The IPMS specialists' union said the government's latest move would enable departments to tackle redundancies in a more brutal manner than before. It and other unions are braced for enforced redundancies over the next few years in several departments, including the Ministry of Defence and the Property Services Agency. The abandonment of the 'last in, first out' and other selection principles is part of a trend in Britain. In the recession, more companies have been adopting policies enabling them to make the least valuable workers redundant first. The Treasury has told unions that the former criteria on redundancies placed 'undue restrictions' on departments that are reducing workforces but need to maintain 'viable operations'. The initiative fits with the government's belief that departmental and agency managers should have more freedom to run their operations. Previously, guidance on redundancy procedure has been enshrined in a model agreement, drawn up in 1975 by the Treasury in consultation with the unions. That will be replaced with a code of practice that will advise departments on statutory legal requirements. The code will also abandon the model agreement's strictures on procedures to be adopted before redundancies are announced. Labour plan, Page 9</p>

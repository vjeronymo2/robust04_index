Chairman Lin Yinghai also expressed the following views on  how to successfully build a socialist market economy and further  improve CPPCC work:    1. It is necessary to understand the importance of  successfully conducting CPPCC work under the socialist market  economy and to unify ideology in accordance with the resolution  adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee. To this end, Lin noted, we should bear in mind that  successfully conducting the CPPCC work under the socialist  market economy is an objective demand of the development of  socialist democracy, a glorious mission for the CPPCC  organizations in the new period, and a realistic demand of CPPCC  work that is being enriched and expanded,    2. It is necessary to emancipate the mind, seek truth from  facts, and make CPPCC work commensurate with the socialist  market economy,    3. It is necessary to improve CPPCC work, heighten the  standard of CPPCC work, and make CPPCC work more conducive to  the socialist market economy,    4. It is necessary to conscientiously study all the relevant  materials, improve work skills, and create favorable conditions  for CPPCC work under the socialist market economy.    Chairman Lin Yinghai stated: The CPPCC work under the  socialist market economy is a completely new topic. We should  constantly carry out experiments, make painstaking efforts, and  be fully enthusiastic and ready to work in a down-to-earth  manner. As long as we work hard, seek truth from facts, remain  pragmatic, strive to make Henan prosperous, and unceasingly  press ahead with the work, we will certainly be able to push  Henan's CPPCC work onto a new stage under the socialist market  economy.    In conclusion, Vice Chairwoman Liu Yujie declared: The  Second Session of the Seventh Henan Provincial CPPCC Committee  has now come to a successful close!</p>

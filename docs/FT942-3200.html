			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Five-year EU court battle is lost in the translation A five-year court battle was lost in translation yesterday when the members of an alleged plastics cartel had fines totalling Dollars 27.5m (Pounds 18.3m) dismissed because of a series of errors made by the European Commission. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg overturned the fines against a group of 14 PVC companies because of discrepancies between the German, English and French texts of the Commission's decision on the cartel. The textual differences invalidated the entire legal process, the court said. It ruled the Commission must pay legal costs for itself and the 14 companies. The Commission said it was too early to say how large the costs might be. A further problem was that Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had signed the original decision, taken in 1988, in only three of the five relevant language versions. The process did not stand up in court, the court said yesterday. 'Acts tainted by an irregularity whose gravity is so obvious that it cannot be tolerated by the Community legal order must be treated as having no legal effect,' said the judgment. The Commission, still determined to impose the fines, hit back with a decision to begin the process all over again. In a statement it said it proposed to restart the action, 'correcting the procedural errors'. Although Mr Delors signed French, German and English versions of the decision, it was delegated to Mr Peter Sutherland, then the competition commissioner, to sign the Dutch and Italian versions. The court said the papers should only have been signed by the Commission's president and executive secretary. 'Far from being, as the commission claims, a mere formality for archival purposes, the authentication of the acts is intended to guarantee legal certainty by ensuring that the text . . . becomes fixed in the languages which are binding,' a court statement said. A Commission official said: 'These sorts of mistakes don't happen very often. 'We have changed our procedures to make sure it doesn't occur again.' There were no plans to sue any translators, he added, but one or two civil servants may be ticked off. The Commission works in nine different languages and it is not the first time that linguistic misunderstanding has come between Europeans. Victor Hugo, the French novelist, once translated the Firth of Forth, the Scottish estuary, as 'Le premier du quatrieme'.

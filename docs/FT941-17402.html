			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / W German production drops sharply West German industrial output fell by an unexpectedly sharp 2.1 per cent in November, and was 4.5 per cent down on the same period a year earlier, the Economics Ministry reported yesterday. The ministry put part of the blame on bad weather and snow. However, the figures have raised doubts about the economy's recovery. Nonetheless, economists said that while the weather-induced downturn could not be discounted, rising orders and confidence in many industrial sectors still suggested that the recession had bottomed out. Construction work dropped 6.5 per cent, while gas and electricity production rose about 1 per cent. A two-month comparison, favoured by the ministry because it reduces the impact of short-term influences, showed total production in October and November down 1.5 per cent on August and September, and 4.5 per cent lower than in the comparable period in 1992. Within the overall two-month figure, capital goods output was down 3 per cent on the previous two months and 9 per cent lower than a year earlier. Raw materials production was unchanged compared with August and September and was up 1 per cent on October and November 1992. Demand for housing is particularly strong, and with falling interest rates expected to continue bolstering order books, construction output is forecast to rebound after the winter. However, prospects for domestic demand in other sectors remain dim, especially among automotive and investment goods manufacturers. Their expectations have been reduced by falling real incomes and under-use of existing plant capacity, although rising productivity and competitiveness - thanks to payroll cuts - have raised hopes of a better export performance this year. A further sharp increase in German corporate insolvencies will take the total to 19,000 this year compared with 15,000 collapses in 1993, according to the Burgel credit inquiry agency.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: The thoughts of Hurricane Mel - Mel Brooks gives his gale-force views on films, comedy and Hollywood. Nigel Andrews takes cover In hurricane-prone lands, as natives know, the way to keep your home intact is to open the windows a crack. That way the winds can sluice through, dissipating force and equalising pressure. The same principle applies when talking to Mel Brooks. He is one side of his Hollywood desk, cracking gale-force aphorisms. You are the other, opening parts of your brain you never knew you could ventilate so Mr B's surplus brio can hurtle through. Brooks is Hollywood comedy's Force of Nature. He gave us The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. He makes movies that never heard the words 'taste' or 'restraint'. And even when he has a bad run of brainstorming - his new film Robin Hood: Men In Tights (opening in Britain on December 17) marks a slight upturn after recent mishaps such as Life Stinks and Spaceballs - he is still the man with the loudest, quickest, freshest opinions on the movie business. No dithering, not even in response to my first question. 'Raisin toast] Mr Brooks had raisin toast for breakfast]' (This to test my recorder's sound level; it gets turned sharply down). Like many paid laughter-makers Brooks knows almost everything about comedy except - we begin with fundamentals - precisely where it comes from. 'Jokes' ponders the ruminative ball of energy, 'go through a strange metamorphosis. Time is the important element. A series of events, some traumatic, some unperceived at the time, merge. And suddenly you're struck by a brand new idea that's surfaced from the 'mud' of your unconscious storage bin.' Brooks's own storage bin is large enough to contain all the mud a humorist could require. He was born to a large, loud family in Brooklyn. He gatecrashed world consciousness as a TV gag writer, sharing an NBC round table with the likes of Neil Simon, Carl Reiner and the man who was to become his neck-and-neck rival in movie comedy, Woody Allen. And he progressed through stand-up comedy to stage work and then to making the movies we know today: frescoes of lunatic ambition and largesse from blazing Westerns via teeming toga sagas (History Of The World Part 1) to the all-human-life New York of Life Stinks. 'Ideas that appeal to Woody are to do with defeating death. His big obsession is immortality. Me, I'm interested in 'social flux'. I don't care a lot about the psycho-dynamics of a situation. But I care very much about why - socially, historically - more than 10 people at any time are swayed to do something together or are oppressed.' Hence the guest appearances in Brooks movies by Hitler, Torquemada and others. Hence too his messianic reason for going into comedy in the first place: 'I thought the world was foolish and I thought comedy was the best way to express how foolish it was.' Like many comics turned film-makers, from the Allen of Sleeper to the Steve Martin of Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Brooks has found film-making itself a handy target for that onslaught on folly with his genre parodies, taking the mickey out of silver-screen tropes and cliches; and doing it all with a sneaking fondness. 'It's like jazz, it's very satisfying. You take a tune everyone knows and you play riffs on it. In High Anxiety all I had to do was take Hitchcock and move him this way or that - a little to the left, a little to the right - and I got big laughs.' Give Brooks a broader target to pepper, though, and he is more likely to attack it off-screen than on. If there has been a disappointing side to his career, it is that his whirlwind opinions on larger contemporary topics than movie genres tend to be excluded from his movies. The follies of Washington; the Japanese 'invasion' of American industry and American cinema; his own Jewishness and what it means to him. 'Hollywood used to be run by the Jews. You know why? Because in Europe, Jews could not own land. They were used to being barred from owning banks or railroads, but they could be 'amusants'. 'Please, amuse us]' So when they came to America, naturally many gravitated to the entertainment industries. 'Then later, when Hollywood became established as a machine for commerce, the Jews were thrown out. Today the Japanese own it. (Phone rings in outside office). They're calling me now]' So Brooks belongs to the Yellow Peril faction in Hollywood - those who think Tokyo is bad news for Tinseltown? 'I don't think the Japanese will control film-makers through censorship  - that's the case argued by 'Would they make a film about Pearl Harbour?' paranoids. But they'll promulgate a concept that's very dangerous to the art of cinema. That's the concept of the 'hit'. Money. 'Do the books, do the books]' The Japanese want black ink not red in the ledgers, and lots of it.' But Hollywood always wanted that? 'No. Wrong] The Sam Goldwyns, the Louis B. Mayers, they were out to break even, not make a killing. When they started out, they knew they were in this small retail business like groceries. Instead of selling butter and eggs they were selling Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler. There was no big money in it when they began, but there was great joy and - the one word that's missing today  - pride] Sam Goldwyn would have all the chorus girls in a Danny Kaye picture dressed in silk] You never saw their underwear, but he said they felt good, so they performed better. 'The studio bosses were happy if they broke even and made a modest profit and could keep what was the glory of those days, the cadres of talent. Fifty actors, fifty writers, fifty directors in one studio: mix 'n' match] 'Hollywood today - this is the lead of your article] - doesn't want to make good movies or try out new things, it just wants to make hits. People think Home Alone is a good movie because it made Dollars 500m worldwide. They think people enjoyed it because it was good. But people enjoy things that are easy to assimilate, easy to digest, they enjoy a lot of bland crap. And the dynamic stuff, the daring, irreverent stuff, that puts them off]' As Hurricane Mel blows through, I open more parts of my brain to control damage. He is not quite right. The Golden Age moguls made a fortune not a 'modest profit'. But he is not quite wrong either. Obsessive book-keeping and cautious, sequel-prone production slates have become prevalent in parts of Hollywood today: with only the safety valve of TV and video allowing, as Brooks observes, some of the pressure to be released from the inflated importance attached to the big-screen hit. 'There is this heaven called video] My last picture Life Stinks had this Jekyll and Hyde history. It did well in Europe, and Fox who distributed the picture over there send me flowers every day. It did badly in America and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer try to run me over: every time I leave the kerb, this big car with an 'MGM' number-plate bears down on me. 'So video has become our chance for an afterlife. For me, seeing my movies on video is like going back to TV where I began. On the small screen people see the humanity again, the little gestures.' Little gestures in a Brooks film? Well, perhaps. But what we treasure them for is their rudeness and flamboyance. Brooks himself, in more Brooksian mood, admits that his flair is for the OTT: 'In the cutting room a take I didn't like on the set, because it was over-the-top, I'll almost always use because it was dizzier and more inspired, and the others are too tame.' Tameness and formula are the things he is quickest to chastise in most screen comedy today: especially the kind that grew out of the safety-first TV sitcom tradition, from Roseanne to The Cosby Show. 'TV viewers, especially Americans, are brainwashed into responding to rhythm not thought. 'De woman wasn't sick]' 'What?' 'De woman was d-e-a-d]' Studio laughter] They laugh when they're told to laugh. 'Where did she go? Did she come in there?' 'Come in there? She came in t-h-e-r-e]' Studio laughter] That's not comedy, that's like a doctor hitting you on the knee to get a jerk. 'In movies we work in a different way. We work on improvisation and experiment and risk. We work on a lovely marriage of thought and emotion and physical activity.' So what was the next product of this wedded bliss? (We were talking shortly before Brooks officially announced his Robin Hood project). 'I'm waiting for something to come up from the dark ooze of my unconscious. Something that speaks to me about the human condition and how to attack and celebrate it. Hatred is always a good starting point. I hated racial prejudice and we got Blazing Saddles. I hated poverty and we got Life Stinks. I hate politicians, so maybe there'll be a political comedy from me next. Something about the rich taking from the poor, the poor taking from the rich. Wait]' - mock-dramatic Brooks pause with hand held high as if struck by shining vision - 'I see a tall, green man wearing tights . . .'</p>

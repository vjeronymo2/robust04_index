			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Pretoria unveils bill of rights: Death penalty would be reimposed for some crimes THE SOUTH African government yesterday published proposals for a bill of rights which would outlaw race and sex discrimination and protect private property, but which would impose the death penalty for certain serious crimes and permit detention without trial. The proposal forms an essential part of Pretoria's blueprint for a constitution which prevents blacks from dominating whites. However, it will not become law without the agreement of the African National Congress and other parties to constitutional negotiations. The draft bill of rights seems specifically designed to outlaw the gross human rights abuses committed by the ruling National party during its 44 years in power, including torture, murder, discrimination by race and infringements of basic freedoms of speech, movement and association. Asked whether the proposals did not represent a 'deathbed conversion' to human rights protection, Justice Minister Kobie Coetzee admitted the current constitution permitted abuses against fundamental rights, and that abuse had taken place. Pretoria's proposal is likely to provoke wide controversy, as it would reimpose the death penalty (suspended since 1990) for certain crimes, would permit 10-day detention without trial, and includes only limited provisions to protect individuals from race discrimination while providing far more protections against sex discrimination. It makes no move to redress any of the economic wrongs of apartheid, including forced expropriation of land from blacks, but outlaws expropriation by any future government. Measures included in the bill to protect private property rights will attract widespread criticism, as they are designed to protect whites. The ANC is likely to oppose the proposal on the grounds that economic rights, such as the right to employment, housing, health care and education, are not guaranteed. The ANC's own draft bill of rights includes such guarantees, but the National party argues that they cannot be enforced against a government which lacks the resources to finance huge social investment. Government officials say the publication of their draft bill of rights demonstrates Pretoria's desire to move rapidly away from apartheid discrimination. Other recent moves have also been announced, including a decision to remove the racial bias in per capita education spending.</p>

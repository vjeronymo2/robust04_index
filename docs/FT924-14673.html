			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (9): Spectacular growth - Profile of Foodmark DESPITE the relentless decline of the Danish fishing industry in recent years, gross exports of fish products are worth DKr14bn a year to the country. That is because its fish processing industry has managed to ensure that its fortunes are not entirely dependent on those of the Danish fishing fleet. Imports make up as much as 50 per cent of the raw fish processed. Foodmark stands out within the sector not just by virtue of its size but because of the speed at which it has grown in the past three years. In 1989 it had just 278 employees and a net turnover of DKr277m. Today turnover is about DKr2.4bn, and it employs 2,400 people. The spectacular growth has been achieved thanks to an acquisition strategy formulated by Mr Lars Rahbek Hansen, managing director. He was recruited by the old investment company, SN Invest, from which Foodmark has evolved. Mr Hansen had previously been in charge of his family fishing concern, Rahbekfisk, and it this company which Foodmark has used as the platform for its expansion. In just 2 1/2 years a total of five companies have been bought through a strategy which has not just begun the process of rationalisation in the fragmented Danish fish processing sector but which has also taken the group into Europe. Rahbekfisk, an oven-ready dishes specialist, was the first acquisition, although the takeover was only completed in November 1991 after a period of stake-building dating back to May 1988. It remains the largest company in the group, with about 800 employees in Denmark and 250 in England. Two other Danish companies have also been acquired - Thorfisk Holding and Hugo Mogelberg Fiskeindustri. Thorfisk employs about 700 people and concentrates on exporting fresh and frozen fish. Hugo Mogelberg, with 250 employees, specialises in plaice exports. The most recent acquisitions, both carried out this year, have taken Foodmark into Norway and further into the UK. The Norwegian company Nordkyn, which has a filleting factory in Meeham, was bought at the beginning of the year. However, much the bigger purchase came in September when the group bought the Scottish company Macfish for Pounds 9.2m from Geest and Associated Fisheries. Fraserburgh-based Macfish concentrates on smoked fish and breaded products, mainly for the retail market. Foodmark's expansion strategy has been shaped by two main factors - to secure sources of supply and to get as close to the customer as possible. As these customers comprise many of the leading supermarket chains throughout Europe, the group feels it has to guarantee them not just quality but continuity of supply and rapid delivery. The group has already become the leading fish processing group in Denmark and, with its Danish companies exporting 94 per cent of their production, it is also the leading Danish exporter of fish products. Now the group has set itself a much more ambitious goal which is to become one of the leading producers of fish products in Europe. Further acquisitions are planned and are more likely to be in Europe than in the home market. 'We don't get more fish through Danish ports by buying more Danish companies,' says Mr Hansen. Nevertheless, Mr Hansen believes overcapacity means further rationalisation within the Danish fish processing industry - characterised by small, family-owned companies - is inevitable. 'The restructuring will take care of itself because the fishing industry is facing a very difficult time. It is a game of survival of the fittest,' he says So far the strategy has certainly been successful, if judged in profit terms. The group's net result has expanded from DKr28.8m in 1989 to DKr32.2m in 1990 to DKr45.0m last year. A further positive development is expected this year. It is not surprising therefore that the group's main shareholders seem happy to back its expansion plans, obviating the need for a stock market listing, at least in the near future. Yet uncertainties remain, not least the impact of currency movements on a group that is so export dependent.</p>

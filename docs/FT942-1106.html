			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Where discipline rules and mavericks are out - Schroders Seeing how other people manage money helps you to manage your own better. That is the theory behind our new series by Joanna Slaughter on private client investment managers. To get the most from the series, you should note carefully what the managers do and what they avoid. As professionals, most of them invest according to a definite system. They will, for instance, have a method for deciding on overall asset allocation - which countries and which types of shares. And they will have another for picking individual shares. They do not rely on hunches or insider information. Over the next few weeks, we will be talking to a selection of firms in the City of London. This week: Schroders. There are no maverick managers at Schroders, according to John Henderson. He is managing director of Schroder Personal Investment Management (SPIM), the private client arm of the merchant banking and investment management group. 'This is a very disciplined and conservative house,' adds Henderson, who describes its style as 'research-driven, low turnover, international.' He adds: 'All the investment managers follow the Schroder house view. They have the opportunity to feed in their thoughts as to the relative attractions of a sector but, once the committees have decided the direction Schroders should go, everyone follows.' Take last year, when Schroders decided to reduce its Pacific rim investments and increase its exposure in Japan. The shift in asset allocation was reflected in every Schroder portfolio; only the percentage weightings varied to reflect a client's particular requirements. Schroders has 383 managers and analysts world-wide, and 1,000 investment staff. 'With 35 offices in 27 countries, l would suggest that we are the most international of the merchant banks,' says Henderson. This international dimension no doubt owes something to the philosophy of the company's founder, John Henry Schroder, who moved to London from Hamburg in 1804. The bank made its first investment in Japan in 1870 and established a New York presence in 1923. Today, more than half Schroders' 3,900 staff, and 50 per cent of its operating capital, are employed in offices overseas. SPIM manages portfolios in 10 currencies, tracking many different benchmarks, and Henderson describes the growth in overseas clients as 'spectacular'. The team approach is central to the company's management of private client money. Each client is looked after by three managers - an investment director, an investment manager and an administrator - who decide overall investment strategy and diversification. Long-term strategy is determined by the senior directors, advised by the Schroder economists and the heads of regional equity and fixed interest teams, while tactical asset allocation is the preserve of a specialist team. Present portfolio weightings are gilts, bonds, and cash (14 per cent); UK equities (55 per cent); North America (4 per cent); Japan (10 per cent); other Far East markets (5.5 per cent); continental Europe (7.5 per cent) and emerging markets (4 per cent). Stock selection is delegated to other specialists and there is a selected equity list of 186 shares. Any stock not on this list is on trial. Henderson says: 'Investment managers know that if they want to invest in something that is not on the SEL, their necks are on the block.' Certainly, managers who do not provide performance for private clients appear to have no hiding place. The three executive directors of SPIM review individual portfolio diversifications at least each quarter and monitor the comparative performances. Schroders has been managing private client money since the turn of the century and it still looks after the descendants of its first customers. Henderson describes the company as 'a family bank' where 'people stay and clients form a relationship with an investment management team that can last for generations'. Solicitors and accountants are the source of 80 per cent of all new clients, and Henderson is used to fighting the firm's corner in fiercely-contested beauty parades. Last year, Schroders won 106 new private clients and lost one - a Swiss, who was unhappy with the house emphasis on equities. Henderson says: 'If we do a good job for the client of a solicitor, he will put us in the beauty parade when another client comes along. We are never handed anything on a plate. It is a jungle out there.' Even the Schroder name does not necessarily open doors. 'Most people think we are a German kitchen manufacturer,' Henderson notes. Clients' annual fees are based on the size of their portfolios and the complexity of their demands. Henderson points out: 'We have the best incentive to make the portfolio perform well, and to minimise risk. We have no conflict of interest.' Although Schroders has a large derivatives team, it uses only currency hedges for private clients. Henderson says: 'We very rarely hedge out of the base currency of the portfolio, and we have no currency hedges outstanding at the moment for our sterling clients. We want to stick to what we have a record of doing well, which is fundamental investment management and fundamental sector research.' An initial Pounds 100,000 is needed to become a Schroder private client, and individual client money ranges from this minimum figure to Pounds 100m. It is something of a surprise, therefore, to learn that nearly all clients invest to some extent in Schroders' own products. 'We have portfolios of Pounds 20m invested entirely in our unit trusts,' says Henderson.' There is often a misconception among the public that unit trusts are only for the smaller investor - and, of course, a unit trust does not have the same excitement at the golf club as a portfolio of shares. Yet, the bigger the client, the bigger the tax and administrative benefits of a unit trust.' The core unit trust for private clients is the Pounds 60m Schroder World fund, which is open also to any non-client with Pounds 1,000 to invest. The fund, which has 280 stocks in its portfolio and is used for all private clients with less than Pounds 500,000, produced a return of more than 30 per cent last year, and its geographical diversification makes it a shop window for the firm's investment skills. A 'cocktail' of Schroder unit trusts is constructed for those with assets of more than Pounds 500,000. Direct equity investment usually is confined to clients with more than Pounds 2m. The Schroder view is that portfolios should include at least 25 stocks in each market sector, and Henderson argues that the risk of a direct equity investment is too high for any investor with less than Pounds 2m. 'It doesn't give any scope to trim the holding and it restricts the flexibility of the manager, so clients do not get the added value that Schroders should be able to bring.' Liquidity in clients' portfolios is low but managed actively. Henderson explains: 'Because we are long-term, cautious and conservative investors, if a client needs funds in the next two years, we will raise the money today and hold it in low coupon, short-dated gilts. 'We will always have at least 10 per cent of the portfolio at 24 hours' notice. Nothing is locked in for longer than one month unless the client has sanctioned us to invest in venture capital.' Prospective private clients certainly need to be convinced of the Schroder investment pedigree because they may be asked to liquidate their existing portfolios so the firm's investment managers can start with a clean sheet, especially if the unit trust route is to be followed. Henderson concedes that this is a tough requirement. 'Liquidation crystallises capital gains for taxpayers, and there is no way round that. But we would urge clients to do it, for it will enable us to hold the things in the portfolio that we like. The client has to decide whether it is worth taking the initial hit for the benefits that Schroders can bring.'</p>

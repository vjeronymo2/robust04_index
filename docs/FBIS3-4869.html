			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] The private sector must bear a heavy burden in  the Second Long-Term Development Plan (PJP II). Greater  confidence has been placed in the private sector in this second  25-year development period than in the previous PJP.    During PJP I the government gave the private sector a  60-percent role in total national investment; in the upcoming  25-year period the private sector will be given an even greater  role, i.e., about 73 percent and the remaining 27 percent will  remain the responsibility of the government.    This means that during PJP II the private sector, including  the State-Owned Corporations (BUMN) and cooperatives, must be  able to provide 660 trillion rupiahs of total national  development, a very large figure. How will the private sector  furnish or try to find such a large amount? The only way is for  it to work harder than it has to date. In addition, the  government must create a climate conducive to its development  and determine which part of the private sector must be given the  highest priority in playing a role and developing.    The government has said that in developing the private  sector  small and medium businesses have been given the highest  priority. This is in line with trends found in other countries,  in which the role of large businesses (conglomerates) will shift  more and more to small and medium businesses.    Nevertheless, the government warns that private  participation  in national development should not depend on foreign loans. It  cannot be denied that foreign loans are needed for development  but if the amount is too great, it will harm Indonesia.    In that connection, it is hoped that the private sector will  no longer dream of glory by continuing to force the construction  of megaprojects. These require large amounts of money. Where is  the money to come from if not from abroad? Also, the failure to  build megaprojects due to the inability to pay off the foreign  loans can prove fatal. It might increase Indonesia's "country  risk" for foreign investors. It would be quite different if  these megaprojects were 100 percent Foreign Capital Investments  (PMA) because this would mean the introduction of foreign  exchange into Indonesia, especially if the PMA is a state  investment. However, we must also be careful with these  100-percent PMAs because a megaproject based on a 100-percent  PMA might in fact use investment funds originating within the  country.    At the present time, Indonesia's "country risk," according  to  an evaluation made by an international institution, is triple B  minus, not such a bad category. But if this is not watched or  run carefully, it is quite possible that Indonesia will get a  worse "country risk" rating. For example, the recent problems  that the Bentoel cigarette factory in East Java experienced in  paying off its foreign loans had serious consequences. A lack  of trust in the Indonesian private sector developed abroad at  that time.    Nevertheless, that does not mean that foreign loans are  unnecessary. They continue to be needed even though they are not  without risk, especially if they are in foreign currency, for  example Japanese yen or American dollars.    Foreign loans can result in an increase in the Debt Service  Ratio (DSR/ratio of installment debt to total value of exports)  for which the government must assume responsibility. At the  present time Indonesia's DSR is 32 percent, 21 percent of which  is government debt and 11 percent is private-sector debt. Since  foreign debt is not a government monopoly, in all honesty it is  very difficult to detect private-sector foreign debt. "There is  no monetary authority in the world which can control the traffic  in private loans," said the Minister of Finance.    The Bank of Indonesia (BI) itself, as a monetary authority,  may not be able to find out whether someone in the private  sector has obtained a secret loan from abroad. It is possible  that many private companies do not register the foreign loans  which they have obtained. [passage omitted]    The private sector's role in national development will be  challenged even more by the signing of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT is a big opportunity for the  domestic private sector to prove whether it can compete in  international trade. Given our current work ethic, it is certain  that we will not seize this opportunity. The Indonesian private  sector, whether it wants to or not, must be able to produce  goods which are more competitive in quality or in price than  those produced by other countries. But it cannot just rely on  itself. The various institutions closely connected with the  private sector must provide support, especially capitalization,  to allow it to compete in international trade.    At the present time domestic bank interest rates do not  support the development of the private sector very well.  Interest rates of about 18 percent, which are relatively high  compared with those in other countries, make it hard for  domestic firms to compete in this era of globalization.    Actually, in order to make the private sector a moving force  in the next 25 years, the government must also pay close  attention to the role of the capital market as a source of  funding. The market had not yet played much of a role in PJP I,  but PJP II is the time for the government to entrust the it with  this vital role. No less a person than Minister of Finance  Mar'ie Muhammad would like the capital market to play a greater  role, parallel to that of the money market, in funding national  development. So, in order to make that market parallel to the  money market the government has issued a policy allowing the use  of stocks as additional collateral when submitting an  application for credit. This policy would seem to be very  simple, but since it is accompanied by certain conditions  stating that not all stocks can be used as collateral for credit  its effect has been to churn transactions on the capital market.  Under these regulations, non-liquid stocks (sleeping stocks) to  be used as collateral in applying for credit must be transacted  first.    Unwritten government stipulations concerning the Price  Earnings Ratio (PER) have also supported this feverish activity.  At first, on grounds of watching out for investor interests,  especially small investors, the government set a maximum PER of  13 for a single issue of new stocks because a low PER means that  initial offerings are within the reach of investors and will  also give investors the opportunity for capital gains on the  secondary market. However, the Minister admitted, prospective  issuers (companies that go public) do not like a low PER because  with a maximum PER of only 13 the hopes that issuers have of  obtaining more funds by going public are only a dream.    Not long afterwards, however, the government, in this  instance the Capital Market Oversight Board (BAPEPAM), changed  the maximum PER standard from 13 to 15. BAPEPAM's policy differs  from the Minister of Finance's more conservative policy of  wanting a maximum PER of 13. Irrespective of that difference,  BAPEPAM has strong reasons for raising the maximum PER limit to  15. It is hoped that a PER of 15 will continue to protect  investor interests while not harming the interests of issuers.  Conditions very beneficial to both parties might provide an  impetus for issuers to speed up the process of going public,  which in turn might brighten the Indonesian stock market. Hopes  are particularly high for State-Owned Corporations, which on  average have performed better than companies going public at the  present time. According to figures issued by the Indonesian  Business Data Center (PDBI), there are about 24 BUMNs suitable  for entering the capital market. Up to now, unfortunately, only  Gresik Cement Inc has started to do so.</p>

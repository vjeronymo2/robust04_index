			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Hatchet honed to a softer point: Robert Horton, former boss of BP, is changing his abrasive image for the chairmanship of Railtrack If there is one thing worse than being spoken of unkindly, it is not being spoken of at all. Anyone who doubts it should consider the case of Robert Horton, the man who will take charge of Britain's 10,000-mile network of railway tracks next April when rail privatisation starts coming into effect. Barely a year ago, in one of the most sensational palace coups in recent UK corporate history, Mr Horton was ousted from his position as chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum with accusations of abrasiveness and megalomania ringing in his ears. Now, as chairman of Railtrack, the government-owned company that will take over the tracks from British Rail next year, he is preparing to re-enter the public arena in a job that will not only thrust him more than ever into prominence, but threatens to turn him into an object of vilif-ication if he fulfils people's worst fears about what he might do. Mr Horton, 53, is a government appointee to the chairmanship of Railtrack. That is bad enough for members of the rail lobby, since they mistrust ministers' commitment to the railways. But far more disturbing is Mr Horton's reputation as an axe man ('Horton the Hatchet', as the sobriquet has it), for it recalls the swingeing cuts to the railway system instigated by another Conservative government appointee in the 1960s - Dr Richard (later Baron) Beeching, then-chairman of the British Railways Board. Mr Horton's reputation for toughness was built up during a 35-year climb to the top at BP. His record was that of an aggressive cost-cutter, first in the tanker and chemical divisions and then as head of BP's North American operations. Mr Horton's determination and boundless ambition went down well in the US, where they satisfied notions of what captains of industry should be. But his American-style management methods were less well received in the UK when Mr Horton became chairman and chief executive in 1990. He made it his mission to shake up a corporate culture stultified by bureaucracy. Head office committees were abolished, layers of management were swept away, and thousands of jobs went. Responsibility was delegated to unit managers, who were told that they would 'own' problems and be 'empowered' to deal with them. Unfortunately the changes coincided with adverse economic conditions which caused a sharp fall in profits. Worse, Mr Horton generated personal antagonism with his reputation for arrogance. 'Because I am blessed by my good brain, I tend to get to the right answer rather quicker and more often than most people,' he said in a notorious interview with Forbes, the American business magazine. In June last year, his fellow directors decided they could no longer work with him and cast him out. But Mr Horton was not to stay out of the limelight for long. As chairman of Railtrack, he may have exchanged the Pounds 787,000 he earned in his last year at BP for a more modest annual salary of Pounds 120,000; he may have left BP's palatial City headquarters for a dowdy, down-at-heel office block opposite Russell Square tube station; but he is back. He is also at pains to soften the harder edges of his image. Whatever else he may have been brought into Railtrack to do, he says, it is not to take an axe to the railway network. 'It is very different from the situation I found in the oil industry, because BP had diversified into a lot of businesses that were not core, such as minerals and animal feed,' he says. 'It seemed to me that an oil company ought to stick to being an oil and petrochemicals company. But railways are quite different: railways are a core activity in themselves, and I have absolutely no intention of being a Dr Beeching mark two.' Rather, he says, his goals are to improve the quality of the existing infrastructure and to increase capacity by installing better signalling systems and removing bottlenecks. 'I believe in the efficiency of public transport, and far from wanting to reduce what is available, I want railways to become a more popular and more used mode of travel.' If this sounds slightly suspect coming from someone whose previous business was making petrol for cars, Mr Horton is ready to acknowledge it. 'Obviously with my background, I start from the point of view that the car is a great liberator for people who, 40 years ago, would not have travelled beyond the town they lived in,' he says. 'But we are faced with a situation in which this cannot continue in an unfettered way because we live in a little island with a lot of people and a lot of beautiful countryside, and we don't want to see it turned into a concrete jungle.' The implication of that, says Mr Horton, is that motorists will sooner or later have to start paying more for the use of the roads, so encouraging a switch to rail for goods and passenger transport. So is Mr Horton the railwayman's friend? It would seem so. One difficulty he cannot gloss over, however, is how he will fund the track improvements he wants at a time when the prospects of getting more money out of the government are close to zero. An easy solution would be to raise the money from the train operators by inflicting high charges for the use of the tracks. But that is not Mr Horton's plan - nor, presumably, the government's - for it would mean either large and politically unacceptable fare increases or bigger state subsidies for the train operators. Instead, the money will have to come from efficiency gains within Railtrack's operations. And this, above all, is why Horton the Hatchet has been drafted into the railways - to take an axe to Railtrack's costs, so easing fears among would-be train operators that their track charges will be dictated by a lazy, inefficient monopoly. Railtrack will be a lean machine, says Mr Horton. Its headquarters will employ about 150 people, half from BR and half from the private sector. The company will also take on BR's signalling and train control staff, taking employee numbers to 10,000-12,000. But everything else - track maintenance, signalling renewal, engineering work and the rest - will be contracted out, with BR's existing staff competing with the private sector for the work. Job losses are potentially large: BR employs 40,000 people on track maintenance and engineering. But Mr Horton is politician enough to duck the question of exactly how many will go: 'I am not going to say - that's just asking for trouble.' The other big change will be the creation of 10 geographical zones to run Railtrack's day-to-day operations. Managers will be given a high degree of devolved power to run their businesses, Mr Horton says. Headquarters will set quarterly targets and zonal managers will be left to achieve them, with financial rewards geared to the degree of success. If this begins to sound like the 'empowerment' which Mr Horton so strongly advocated in the past, he is not about to disagree. 'I have not fallen in love with committees since I left BP,' he says. Nor does it sound as though he is planning any drastic changes in his management style. If you lead from the front and take difficult decisions, people will say you are arrogant and abrasive, which I don't think I am,' he says. 'I think my management style is actually highly consultative - I really do delegate. But I believe in active leadership and not ducking leadership, and in a complicated business there is limited scope for endless debate.' Even so, the bruising circumstances of Mr Horton's exit from BP have left some scars. He speaks bitterly of the events leading up to his departure: 'I had over 30 very happy and stimulating years in the oil industry. It was hardly my fault that the deepest recession for 30 years was under way.' Is this then a new, softer, gentler Bob Horton taking charge of Britain's railway infrastructure? 'Possibly,' he says. 'Possibly. I am very conscious of the fact that I have a lot of learning left to do. Mind you, so has everyone. We are at a new dawn now.'</p>

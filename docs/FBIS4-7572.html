			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/3/1994 -- "The visit paid by  Minister Grachev is a first proof of a relaunch in the  collaboration ties between Romania and the Russian Federation,  holding a major contribution also on a political plane and not  only on the military one," said the Romanian head of diplomacy  Teodor Melescanu after the Monday [28 March] interview with  General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, currently  on a visit to Romania at the invitation of his Romanian  counterpart, Gheorghe Tinca.    The Romanian high official also said that during the talks  stress was laid on the importance Romania was giving to the  building of a security system at European level, which would  ensure also Romania's security, which depends on other elements  too such as the democratic process in Russia and the ties  between the two countries.    In the context, both sides referred also to other security  structures, pointing on the role held by the CSCE, the role of  bilateral ties, as well as on the contribution of regional  collaboration to bring stability in the area.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> ABSENTEE VETERAN HAYNES IS RELEASED  </P> <P> Cornerback Mike Haynes, who failed to report to training camp because of a  contract dispute, was released by the Raiders Thursday.  </P> <P> After asking the team to let him play a final season and move him to safety,  Haynes was unable to agree to terms with the Raiders, who relinquished their  rights to him. He is free to negotiate with any team.  </P> <P> "We tried to get Mike in here, but there comes a time when you have to say  goodby, and that time came," Coach Art Shell said.  </P> <P> If Haynes' NFL career is indeed over, Raider owner Al Davis thinks the  defensive back will be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> "He was a truly great player who made a tremendous contribution to the  greatness of the Raiders," Davis said. "And we'll always appreciate him for  it."  </P> <P> Haynes, 37, was one of the NFL's best defenders during the past 14 seasons,  intercepting 46 passes. But Haynes became expendable because of his age and the  Raiders' talented young corps of defensive backs.  </P> <P> Raider cornerback Lionel Washington said Haynes taught him to play defensive  back.  </P> <P> "I think he was one of the best corners that played here," Washington said. "I  learned a lot from Mike. He's going to be missed by a lot of players because he  was an inspiration."  </P> <P> The Raiders cut Haynes last season, then re-signed him after cutting his salary  in half to $375,000. Used as a fifth defensive back in passing situations,  Haynes played in 13 games, starting one.  </P> <P> Is there a possibility that the Raiders would ask Haynes back this season if he  does not sign with another team and their defensive backfield was depleted by  injuries?  </P> <P> "I'm sure if we made the call, he'd be willing to come back," Shell said. "When  I retired, I would have come back, but I'm glad they didn't need me because I  was through."  </P> <P> Haynes did not return calls to comment on the situation.  </P> <P> After spending the first seven years of his career with the New England  Patriots, Haynes joined the Raiders in mid-1983 and intercepted five passes in  five regular-season games and three playoff games, including the Super Bowl. In  1984, he intercepted six passes.  </P> <P> "Mike Haynes was a great contributor to this football team; he helped us win a  Super Bowl," Shell said. "He's a future Hall of Famer. He's one of the best  defensive backs ever to play the game."  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Displeased with practice Thursday, Coach Art Shell delivered a tirade. "We made  too many mental errors," he said. "Sometimes those things happen, but we've got  a game to play in two days and it's too late for those kinds of errors to be  happening.". . . Shell said there has been no progress in negotiations with the  Raiders' unsigned players -- quarterback Steve Beuerlein, defensive end Greg  Townsend and safety Vann McElroy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIX MORE UNLV PLAYERS SUSPENDED FOR UNPAID PHONE BILLS  </P> <P> Six more UNLV basketball players have been ruled ineligible for one game  because of non-payment of long-distance phone bills, bringing to nine the  number suspended for a single game by the NCAA.  </P> <P> A ruling by the NCAA Friday means that two players will miss each of the next  three games, against Louisiana State today, Utah State on Thursday and North  Carolina State on Saturday.  </P> <P> The six players are Stacey Augmon, Travis Bice, Chris Jeter, James Jones, Moses  Scurry and Barry Young.  </P> <P> UNLV officials have been allowed to select which two players will miss each of  the games.  </P> <P> Augmon, the only starter among the six, has been suffering from the flu and was  questionable for today's game anyway. He and Jeter were told at the airport  Friday that they would not make the trip.  </P> <P> Starting guard Greg Anthony and center David Butler were ordered to sit out  Thursday's Big West Conference game against UC Santa Barbara because of unpaid  phone bills.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, guard Anderson Hunt was forced by the NCAA to sit out the  Temple game because of failure to keep current on a student loan.  </P> <P> UNLV officials say the long-distance calls were made from hotels where the  Rebels stayed for games in Hawaii and San Jose.  </P> <P> University officials said they thought the phone charges were a matter between  the player and the hotel. "Before all road trips, the university sends a letter  to hotels at which the team will be staying, directing (the hotels) to shut off  telephones to the student-athletes' rooms and to deny student-athletes room  service and other incidental charges," a UNLV press release said.  </P> <P> "Recently obtained records indicated that during the 1988-89 season, some  hotels failed to enforce those rules; and that some student-athletes did make  long-distance telephone calls and incur other incidental charges."  </P> <P> The UNLV players stay two to a room, and the phone calls may have been charged  by either roommate.  </P> <P> The NCAA declared both players in each room responsible and subject to the  suspension because they did not know which player made the calls.  </P></p>

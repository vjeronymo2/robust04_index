			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of joint Libyan-Chadian communique, issued in </F> Tripoli on 5 June]    [Text] At an invitation of Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi,  brother leader of the Great al-Fatih revolution, and in the  framework of the relations of fraternity and friendship linking  the Republic of Chad and the Great Socialist People's Libyan  Arab Jamahiriyah [GSPLAJ], Colonel Idriss Deby, president of the  Republic of Chad, paid a working and friendly visit to the  GSPLAJ at the head of an important delegation from 3-5 June  1994. The great guest and the delegation accompanying him  enjoyed a popular and official welcome, which expressed the  depth of the relations linking the two fraternal peoples.    Very important bilateral talks took place between the  brother  leader of the revolution and President Idriss Deby, at which  prevailed an atmosphere of friendship and common understanding  and which covered a number of issues at the bilateral, African,  and international levels.    The brother leader of the revolution briefed his great guest  on the achievements of the Great al-Fatih Revolution in the  political, economic, cultural, and social fields. He informed  him also of the intellectual and practical foundations of  people's authority, which enabled the Libyan Arab people to  practise their authority through their people's congresses and  committees without having anybody to act on their behalf or  represent them.    President Deby informed his brother, the leader of the  revolution, of the political and economic program of the Chadian  Government and its efforts in the field of economic and social  development in a way that consolidates stability and security  for the Chadian people. In the field of bilateral relations,  the two sides expressed their satisfaction with the continuous  development of their strong relations and fruitful cooperation  and stressed the need to adopt the necessary measures to  consolidate the bilateral relations in all fields and achieve  economic and social cooperation between the two countries. The  two sides stressed the need to find the suitable mechanisms to  guarantee the follow-up and implementation of all the agreements  and minutes of meetings through the joint committee and ensure a  permanent supervision by the leaderships of the two countries,  within the framework of direct contacts and consultations.    During the visit, a treaty of friendship and cooperation,  which consolidates the relations between the two fraternal  countries, was signed.    The Chadian side was informed of the Lockerbie issue and the  mandatory sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab people and the  negative effects on the human and economic levels that have  affected the Libyan Arab people and the neighboring states,  including the Republic of Chad. The Chadian side expressed its  solidarity with the Libyan Arab people against these unjust  measures and expressed support for Arab, African, and  international efforts to find an urgent and just solution to  this question, which concerns the region as a whole, through  direct dialogue in a way that protects security and peace in the  region. In this context, the two sides expressed their regret  for the way the UN Security Council deals with this issue and  expressed their anxiety about the intervention policy applied to  small states.    On the African level, the two sides welcome the political  transformations in South Africa and its joining the OAU. They  express their annoyance at the continuation of armed conflicts  in various parts of the continent and the destruction they leave  behind both in human and material levels. The two sides  stressed the need for the OAU to find the efficient solutions to  the problems of the continent and stressed the importance of  Arab-African cooperation in general and the development of  cooperation between the Arab Maghreb states and the states of  Central and West Africa in particular. They stressed the  importance of consultations between the states of the African  Sahel and the GSPLAJ.    They stress that the debt issue is heavy on most African  states and that the exemplary solution to this question lies in  the control by African states of their natural resources and  wealth and the setting up of an equitable economic order that  secures and helps stability and development in African states.    At the end of the visit, Chadian President Idriss Deby  expressed his great thanks and appreciation to the brother  Colonle Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the Great al-Fatih  Revolution, and to the Libyan Arab people for the generous  hospitality and warm fraternal welcome devoted to him and the  delegation accompanying him.    His Excellency President Idriss Deby extended an invitation  to the brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the  Great al-Fatih Revolution, to visit the Republic of Chad, which  he accepted with gratitude. Its date will be fixed later.    Written in Tripoli on 4 June 1994</p>

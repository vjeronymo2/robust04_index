			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, a top  Chinese leader, has emphasized the importance of unswervingly  implementing measures to expand reforms and soberly solve  various specific problems.    During April 13-18, Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee  of the National People's Congress, China's legislature,  inspected a number of major state-owned enterprises and  township-run factories in south-west China's Sichuan Province.    Qiao asked local officials to firmly implement various  reform  measures taken since the last quarter of 1993, by seizing  current domestic and international opportunities favorable to  China's economic construction and following Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    "Everyone has noticed that these reform measures have played  a significant role and reported initial successes," said Qiao,  who is also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau  of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.    The leader also noted that problems are bound to crop up  when  profound reforms are being carried out in a vast country such as  China.    "We must be calm and sober-minded when encountering  problems," he said.    Qiao Shi also stressed the need to strengthen the Communist  Party's leadership in the course of implementing reform measures.    He urged party and government officials at all levels to  guard against corruption, work in the interests of the people,  improve their style of work, go to grass-roots units, show  concern about people's work and livelihood and lead the people  in overcoming difficulties.    Speaking of enterprise restructuring, particularly major  state-owned companies, Qiao said that all enterprises must get  in gear with the market, invigorate their operational set-up,  improve their product quality and economic returns, and enhance  their competitiveness.    It was imperative to continue strengthening the leadership  over the farming sector and rural work and take practical  measures to solve problems that have cropped up in agricultural  development, he said.    Moreover, effective measures must be taken to increase  farmers' incomes and ensure an increase in production of grain,  cotton and cooking oil, he added.    He expressed the belief that China's rural areas will become  increasingly prosperous by expanding production of township-run  factories and speeding up construction of small cities and towns.    Speaking of surplus labor in rural areas, he said that  Sichuan should solve this problem by providing labor services to  other areas, expanding production of rural factories and  accelerating infrastructure construction in a variety of forms,  such as mobilizing farmers to build roads and water conservancy  facilities.    While visiting the Sichuan provincial museum and a number of  other cultural facilities, Qiao said that in China's  modernization drive, it was necessary to draw on what is good in  foreign cultures and carry forward outstanding Chinese national  culture.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (20): Converging technologies offer commercial gain - Andrew Emmerson highlights computer-telephone integration One of the most overworked expressions in the information technology field is the 'genuine breakthrough' and often the more strident the hype, the less significant the advance. Computer-telephone integration or CTI (also known as computer-supported telephony), however, has been introduced with little fanfare, yet it is generating new opportunities, not just by cutting costs but also by creating new business possibilities. In spite of constant talk of the convergence of computer and telecommunication technologies, CTI is harnessing the power of the computer to the telephone in ways never dreamed of before. Enterprising organisations are using CTI to seize the competitive edge, especially in enhancing their level of customer service. Providing first-class service calls for innovative techniques and CTI provides an effective answer. For example, National Breakdown, a leading car-recovery organisation, needed a mechanism enabling it to provide help more efficiently than the competition - crucial when a stranded motorist will call on whichever organisation offers the fastest assistance. CTI allows National Breakdown to do this. Using the company's system, a motorist who's car has broken down can call from a toll-free roadside telephone. The National Breakdown operator needs to ask only two things: the car's registration number and its location (even the latter will not be needed once caller identification from phone numbers becomes available). The rest of the process is automated. From the registration number, the computer instantly identifies the driver and the details of his or her vehicle, enabling the operator to greet the driver by name and refer to the car make and model. On-screen maps pinpoint the car's whereabouts and also indicate the nearest garage, sending help on its way within minutes. Retailing is an equally competitive field, in which CTI also has an important role to play. In the US, MicroWarehouse uses CTI to maintain its position as a leading mail order supplier of computer software and accessories. Customers ring a toll-free number and before the call has been answered, caller identification tells the computer who is calling. Thanks to this information and CTI, the sales agent who answers the call already has on screen the name, address and credit card number of the customer, and the details of his or her last order. She greets the customer by name and then asks if, for example, the word processing software ordered three weeks ago is satisfactory. Not only is customer business handled more efficiently, clients feel better dealing with a firm which appears to value their custom. In many other retail and commercial operations computer-assisted telephone centres are already the norm. Hotel and airline reservations provide a clear illustration of how linking telephone agents to computer systems improves both customer service and the ability to sell effectively. As more business is done by phone, the role of CTI will increase. Telephone banking is now well established and buying insurance by telephone is the fastest growing sector in the financial services market. CTI is also used to assist staff making a large number of calls, reducing the time wasted on ineffective calls. This application is used widely by banks, finance houses and credit organisations for speeding up the recovery of debts. It may increasingly be used for telephone selling, as in the US. But CTI is not only for use by large-scale enterprises. The technique works just as powerfully at the other end of the scale, enabling the one-man business to take on much larger firms. Imagine, for example, you want to turn your spare-time business into one earning full-time profits. You sell specialist books and video tapes by mail from your home but find that an answering machine is a poor substitute for personal service while you're away at the day job. By adding a card and some software to your PC and it becomes an automated telephone attendant, inviting people to key 1 to place an order, 2 to hear information on your products, 3 to order a catalogue or 4 to leave a message on other business. The cost of this add-on is less than Pounds 500 and small businesses across the US are successfully exploiting the idea. For large organisations, the opportunities to save costs are even greater, using staff resources more effectively and matching the number of phone lines rented exactly to the level of business handled. Productivity increases of up to 300 per cent have been claimed by the Bank of Scotland, while a debt recovery firm's collectors can now contact more than 200 defaulters in a day compared with fewer than 60 previously. In the US, the computer company Tandem cites the case of a system it installed for an electricity supply company. Its client has claimed savings of Dollars 3m a year and managed a full payback on its investment within four months. The UK company Datapoint quotes the experience of a bank using automated dialling systems which it supplied. In the first year of operation, accounts handled rose by 33 per cent, promises to pay rose by 65 per cent and all this was achieved with existing staff. These may be exceptional cases but they are indicative of the technology's potential. Although CTI is a relatively new discipline, it is based on mature technology. Organisations adopting CTI are gaining an undeniable advantage over the competition and the market for these systems is set to grow considerably over the next few years. 'A key factor in keeping pace with change in today's business world is the ability to communicate efficiently at all times - whether it be by voice, data or image - regardless of location,' says Mr Claude Olier, pictured above, left, chief executive of eunetcom - the joint venture of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. In a deal with International Business Machines in March this year, eunetcom  -officially spelt without a capital E - signed a contract for the delivery of high-speed, managed transmissions services to 40 IBM locations in France, Germany and other European centres. The services will be controlled by eunetcom's network operations centre in Frankfurt, which will go into operation on July 1, says Mr Olier. The eunetcom network also has 'hubs' in France, the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy and the US. By the end of this year, hubs will be added in Sweden, Singapore and Japan. This month, eunetcom signed a worldwide, Dollars 200m outsourcing service agreement with the New York-based Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a leading provider of information, software and service, for the services currently provided by the international 'DunsNet' network - eunetcom will provide all of D&amp;B's worldwide data communication needs for a five-year period.

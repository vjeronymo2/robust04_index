			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Britain well out of social 'shackles' Sir, At last European Commissioner, Padraig Flynn, shows the Commission's true colours on social policy ('Brussels to side-step UK on works councils issue', September 7). In backing the absurd notion of a World Social Charter, he is again pushing the idea that if we cannot compete effectively then everyone should be equally handicapped with higher employment costs. Those saddled with the high costs of implementing the Social Chapter are now waking up to their loss of competitiveness in relation to the Pacific Rim. Their response has not been to throw off the shackles, but to call for the same costs to be imposed around the world. The UK is well out of it. Richard Brown, deputy director general, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QB</p>

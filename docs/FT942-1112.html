			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Powerful men with money to burn - London One - often futile - way to prop up flagging paper assets is to allow powerful men with money to burn to intervene in the marketplace. Central bankers tried it with the dollar yesterday with limited success. Earlier in the week, Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch tried it with their flagship newspapers, slashing cover prices of the Daily Telegraph and The Times to stimulate circulation. The likely outcome will be the same in both cases: much money will be spent but for negligible net gain. Some currencies and newspapers will rise, others will fall while the men who tried to move the markets will be a lot poorer. The currency effect on global markets was dramatic from the opening of trading on Monday. The dollar weakened rapidly particularly against the yen and D-Mark. Factors cited ranged from worries about rising US inflation, worsening US-Japanese trade relations and accelerating growth in Germany. Bonds in the US and Europe took fright, dragging down equities with them. The FT-SE 100 index shed a net 146.3 points to end the week at 2,876.6, its lowest mark since July 26. But few people resorted to ditching their shares. This was supposed to be the year of the strong dollar, thanks to rising US interest rates, falling German rates and other favourable economic conditions. Instead, it has weakened against some currencies as investors have become nervous about inflation and politics. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the dollar is now stronger than two years ago on the more realistic basis of its trade-weighted average. More turmoil is ahead, though, argue those analysts who see exchange rates as a key influence of capital markets. SG Warburg's economists believe the dollar will be driven lower by four factors: the US trade deficit is deteriorating; US inflation will run ahead of Germany's; the US Federal Reserve, driven by domestic economic considerations, will not raise interest rates enough to help the dollar; and doubts are growing about the Clinton Administration's competence in handling geo-political problems. Yet not everybody is glued to the currency screens. 'The weakness of the dollar is a distraction. You shouldn't take any notice of exchange rates,' says Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court. They might tell you something about relative inflation rates but it is much more important to focus on interest rates. Policy makers have made some big economic mistakes concentrating on currencies rather than interest rates, not the least of which for the UK was its experience in the ERM. Lyon took comfort this week from the failure of US bond prices to comprehensively breach the lows they reached a month ago. 'There may be some sort of light at the end of this tunnel.' Moreover, sentiment is changing in the UK equity market. He notes that at the beginning of the year, high optimism was signalled by an historically high ratio of calls to puts in the derivatives markets. Now the ratio is historically low, signalling high negativity. Such sentiment is typical of a selling climax at the bottom of the market. Thus it also tends to be a good indication of the moment to resume buying. When will consumers of goods and services start buying more is a question many companies in the news this week have been asking themselves. Even with only moderate demand, British Steel was able to report pre-tax profits for the year to April of Pounds 80m against year-earlier losses of Pounds 149m after restructuring costs. But to try to bring more rational behaviour to the marketplace, it is going to take the EU to court over its steel subsidies. First Leisure reported disappointing interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.1m, up 16 per cent. It is still finding consumers cautious about spending their income on recreation. Perhaps the public - like Eurotunnel investors who left one-third of the UK rights issue with underwriters - just want to spectate rather than participate. Guinness, for example, has reported brisk stout sales during the World Cup. During the Ireland-Italy game, one pub pulled five times the number of pints it would in a normal evening. The corporate calamity of the week was Hazlewood Foods. Its shares fell sharply after it announced lower profits, production problems at four new plants and consequently the resignation of the head of its UK operations. Silentnight's shares fell after it said people were buying fewer beds. But if the public is not eating and sleeping the way it was, can it be persuaded to read more newspapers? Rupert Murdoch is convinced it can. Or at least that he can snatch readers. Since he cut the cover price of The Times 10 months ago, its circulation has risen from 370,000 to 515,000. Some of those readers have converted from the Daily Telegraph which had tried to remain aloof. But with the Daily Telegraph's circulation recently falling below 1m a day for the first time in more than 40 years, Conrad Black could hold out no longer. He retaliated with his own price cuts. A few other things were slashed in the process, including The Telegraph's share price, along with that of United Newspapers, the Daily Mail Trust and other publishers. It was the most dramatic moment in The Telegraph's history since Lord Camrose halved the price to  1/2 p in 1930, an event some Telegraph readers would still remember. Murdoch counter-punched by cutting The Times' cover price to 20p. At that price he needs to sell some 300,000 more a day to break even. It might be cheaper for him to buy all the extra copies himself. Such market intervention would cost him personally about Pounds 18.7m a year.</p>

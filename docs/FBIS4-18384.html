"Unemployment is decreasing significantly," Hesoun said. At  the end of March, 228,865 people were registered as unemployed,  thus 4.3 percent fewer than at the same time last year. Apart  from the stimulation of the labor market through the spring  season and the mild weather, there was also a stimulation of the  economy, Hesoun noted. With an unemployment rate of 4.6  percent, as calculated according to OECD methodology, Austria  retains the third best international position. Only Luxembourg  (2.7 percent) and Japan (2.7 percent) have more favorable rates.  [passage omitted]</p>

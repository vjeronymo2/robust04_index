			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke cancels scrip dividend after shares fall Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, yesterday cancelled its alternative scrip dividend in light of a sharp decline in its share price in the last month. The offer to pay shareholders in equity instead of a 4.92p cash dividend was conditional on a market price of more than 151p per share at the close of business on Monday. About 6 per cent of shareholders, owed dividends totalling Pounds 3.5m, had elected to receive shares. Ladbroke's shares, which were 174p on November 8 when the offer was made, closed at 148p on Monday. They fell further last night to 145 1/2 p. The announcement follows recent controversy over Ladbroke's dividend policy. The leisure group was last week believed to have retreated on an earlier decision to take advantage of the foreign income dividend (FID) scheme when making its 1993 final payout. FIDs are perceived to be detrimental to Ladbroke's pension fund investors, which benefit from tax credits on normal dividends but not on foreign income payouts. This, along with a substantial share sale by a senior executive last month, is thought to have contributed to the recent fall in Ladbroke's share price.</p>

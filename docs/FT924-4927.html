			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / New fears raised over coal jobs ONLY ABOUT a third of the 31 threatened British Coal pits would be saved even if the most radical measures to boost demand for UK coal were adopted, one of its senior executives said last night. Mr Andrew Horsler, director general of marketing, said the most radical measures could provide a market of 50m tonnes. That compares with 40m tonnes which British Coal has tentatively agreed to sell the electricity generators next year and 30m in the following four years. On the BBC2 Money Programme, Mr Horsler said that if 50m tonnes could be achieved it would result in 10 to 12 of the 31 threatened pits being saved. His estimates underline the difficulties the government will have in formulating an energy policy which saves enough coal jobs to satisfy MPs and the public. Separately, further opposition has emerged among the regional electricity companies to suggestions that the government should delay a planned increase in competition in the industry to make room for a bigger coal market. Seeboard, serving Kent, Surrey and the Sussex area, has told MPs inquiring into energy policy that deferring liberalisation would strengthen the position of the two main electricity generators and frustrate customer expectations of increased choice of supplier. Last week suggestions by Southern Electric to the Commons energy committee that liberalisation could be postponed to allow electricity companies to buy an extra 15m tonnes of coal a year on medium-term contracts were criticised by Eastern Electricity. It had been assumed that most other regional electricity companies would accept such a solution, in part because of fears about the effects of increased competition. Under the plans the competitive part of the market, which is restricted to large companies, would be open to medium-sized companies in 1994. In 1998 all customers, including households, would be able to choose from which company to buy electricity supplies. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, strongly supports increased competition and some believe his position would be untenable if liberalisation plans were modified significantly. For this reason some regional electricity companies would be happier with a compromise. East Midlands Electricity has applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for a licence to supply regional customers with a range of telecommunications services.</p>

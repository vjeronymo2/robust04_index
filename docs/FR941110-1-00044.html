			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers sometimes market their Walla Walla Sweet Onions themselves. In such cases, those growers would be the first handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions and would be responsible for paying assessments and complying with other order requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.(a) Certain terms should be defined for the purpose of designating specifically their applicability and limitations whenever they are used in the order. The definition of terms discussed below is necessary and incidental to attain the declared policy and objectives of the order and Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Secretary'' should be defined to mean the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, or any officer, or employee of the United States Department of Agriculture who has been or who may be delegated the authority to act for the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Act'' should be defined to mean the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674). This is the statute under which the proposed regulatory program would be operative, and this definition avoids the need to refer to the citation throughout the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Person'' should be defined to mean an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other business unit. This definition is the same as that contained in the Act and insures that it has the same meaning in the order as it has in the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``registered handler'' should be defined to mean a person who is a handler with adequate facilities for procuring and sorting, grading, packaging, and performing any other handling function or who is a handler with access to such facilities. This provision would require all Walla Walla Sweet Onion handlers to register with the committee after meeting certain qualifications. Some handlers may have grading and storage facilities outside of the production area. Handler registration would aid the committee in determining compliance with order requirements. Registration also would enable the committee to obtain the necessary information to levy assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No testimony was presented concerning the actual method of registration. However, based on similar orders using handler registration the committee should be authorized to recommend, for approval of the Secretary, procedures with respect to handler registration. This provision has been added to the definition of registered handler. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``container'' should be defined as a box, bag, crate, hamper, basket, package, or any other receptacle used in packaging, transporting, sales, shipment, or other handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. It is necessary to define the term since it may be used throughout the proposed order and any rules established thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``producer'' should be synonymous with ``grower'' and should be defined to identify those persons who are eligible to vote for, and serve as, producer members and alternate producer members on the committee and those who may vote in any referendum. The term should mean any person engaged in a proprietary capacity in the production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for market within the production area. Each business unit (such as a corporation or partnership) should be considered a single producer and should have a single vote in nomination proceedings and referenda. The term ``producer'' should include any person who owns or shares in the ownership of Walla Walla Sweet Onions such as a landowner landlord, tenant, or sharecropper. A person who owns and farms land resulting in that person's ownership of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions produced on such land should be considered a producer. The same is true with respect to a person who rents and farms land resulting in that person's ownership of all or part of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions produced on that land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Likewise, any person who owns land which that person does not farm, but as rental for such land obtains the ownership of a portion of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions produced thereon, should be regarded as a producer for that portion of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions received as rent. The tenant on such land should be regarded as a producer for the remaining portion produced on such land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

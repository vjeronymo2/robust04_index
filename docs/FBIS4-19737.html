			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["R.S." report: "Northern League: `False Accusations'"] </F>   [Text] Milan -- He [Clean Hands public prosecutor Di  Pietro] busted the five-party coalition wide open and evicted  the League from the ranks of the honest. He also made it clear  that the PCI- PDS [Italian Communist Party-Democratic Party of  the Left], though temporarily reprieved through lack of  evidence, would also get it in the neck. While the Bottegone  [PDS headquarters] is refraining, at least for the time being,  from answering back, the bandwagon [League nickname] is shooting  pointblank against Italy's most famous public prosecutor. The  latter, the champion of the thief hunt, the magistrate who had  always been incited by the League, yesterday shot them down in  flames by indicating that the League had also eaten a slice of  bribe city pie.    A communique which the League immediately issued yesterday  started by saying: "We did not behave like the others." It  then attempted to refute the accusations made by the public  prosecutor in his final report. This was the first strike. In  a TV broadcast, Di Pietro publicized a copy of a letter signed  by League Forli section secretary Bellettini -- a letter  requesting a meeting between [League Secretary] Bossi and  [former Enimont official] Carlo Sama. "This was," the  communique pointed out, "a request for publicity, which  Bellettini thought could be made more official by speaking of a  `private meeting.'" There is, then, the question of the 200  million lire received by [League official] Alessandro Patelli.  In the hearing, the League complained, Di Pietro forgot to  mention Bossi's "counterstatements" (whereby the bandwagon's  leader made known the decision to hand over the 200 million lire  to the magistrate). "Among other things," the communique went  on to say, "this amount was stolen by the `usual unidentified  persons,' who broke into the League's headquarters a few hours  later because they, or their instigators, were hoping that this  would lead to a denunciation which would stir up a scandal on  the eve of the 1992 general elections." In any case, the 200  million lire cannot be considered a bribe: "No exchange of  favors on the League's part was involved. If anything, this was  a simple administrative misdemeanor, which can be defined as a  donation that was not entered in the accounts and that therefore  could be subject only to a fine."    However, it is one of Di Pietro's sentences ("The League  behaved like all the other parties") which made League  supporters go into a rage. In their view, this was clearly "a  political consideration, which would undermine the basic  objectivity of any legal proceeding, and certainly of this one  in particular." They explained their reasons by means of a  theorem: "If the League had behaved like everybody else, bribe  city would have never exploded." The indignant conclusion was:  "Di Pietro should think things over." League Deputy Marcello  Lazzati stressed the point: "There is nothing new. The League  has nothing to do with all this and anyone saying the opposite  is making assertions which are not only slanderous but also  historically false."</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL BEATEN IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> After Occidental College inducted three people into its basketball hall of fame  at halftime Saturday night, Chris Anderson gave the crowd a glimpse of a  possible future member by finishing with 30 points and 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> But the 6-foot-9 1/2 senior center's performance wasn't enough as Occidental  fell, 80-77, in overtime to La Verne, one of its rivals in the Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> "(Anderson) is a super player," La Verne Coach Gary Stewart said. "There is no  way we could stop him. We could only try to contain him as best we could."  </P> <P> La Verne (13-4, 3-1) built a 76-72 lead with 3 minutes, 17 seconds remaining in  overtime, but Occidental closed to 77-75 when Ethan Caldwell was fouled while  making a five-foot hook shot 13 seconds later. He sank the free throw.  </P> <P> Mark Loomis hit a free throw to put La Verne ahead, 78-75, with 2:11 left, but  Anderson hit a 19-foot baseline jump shot with 50 seconds remaining to slice  the lead to one.  </P> <P> Occidental had a chance to win the game with seven seconds to play, but DeShang  Weaver intercepted a pass by Anderson and scored on an uncontested dunk.  Caldwell's desperation shot from halfcourt fell short as time expired.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 70-70, with 34 seconds remaining in regulation, Occidental  played for the last shot. Caldwell drove up the middle, but his shot bounced  off the left side of the rim and the game went into overtime.  </P> <P> "It's been a hard season," said Occidental Coach Brian Newhall, whose Tigers  lost in the closing seconds to Whittier last week. "We can't seem to put games  away in the final four minutes."  </P> <P> Weaver gave La Verne a 70-68 advantage with 1:37 to play on a two-handed dunk  off a back-door pass.  </P> <P> The Tigers tied the score on Phil Engebretsen's reverse layup with 51 seconds  remaining.  </P> <P> Occidental fell behind by 11 points, 49-38, early in the first half. But the  Tigers went ahead for the first time, 65-64, when Anderson tipped in his missed  shot with 3:09 left.  </P> <P> Shaun Manning and Weaver led La Verne with 21 and 20 points and Caldwell added  15 for Occidental (5-11, 0-3).  </P> <P> La Verne led at the half, 40-33, and was ahead by nine points twice in the  first half.  </P> <P> With Occidental trailing, 40-31, with less than a minute to play in the opening  half, Anderson cut the deficit to seven with a one-handed jam off a baseline  drive then blocked a last-second jump shot by Loomis.  </P> <P> Anderson established the inside game early for Occidental, scoring 12 of the  Tigers' first 14 points and 18 in the first half, mostly on short jump shots.  </P> <P> Occidental opened a 16-13 advantage midway through the half, but La Verne went  on a 13-2 run over the next five minutes to take a 26-18 lead.  </P> <P> Stephen Bertz cut the deficit to four on a 15-foot jump shot, 33-29, at the  2:56 mark. However, Manning squelched the Occidental rally, scoring five  unanswered points.  </P></p>

He urged the trade unions and political parties to  come up with projects that can instill and improve such  awareness. Speaking to the media at Madras Harbor on Saturday,  he said that most of the common people did not know anything  about the Dunkel proposals. (Arthur Dunkel drafted the proposals  on which global trading agreemnt is being designed. The  proposals turned out to be controversial, but with some  revisions, most of the countries in the world have accepted  them).    He said that if the trade unions and farming institutions  co-operated in opposing the Dunkel plan, then the government  will be compelled to re-examine its stand. He told them that  only the initial debates on the proposals were concluded on the  15th of December. There was a whole year for the government to  decide on signing or rejecting it. He added that there was  enough time for the government to re-examine its decision. On a  specific issue that could throw light on the implications of  entering hastily into agreements the following meeting report is  helpful:    He had come to Madras to participate in the meeting of an  action committee appointed to examine the issue of the  methodology to be adopted in the bilateral negotiations on the  dock-workers' salary raise. He said, "We are not opposing  starting ports under the private sector, but we are worried how  it will affect existing ports. No one is opposing re-organizing  trade sectors. But we are requesting that the improvements do  not prove detrimental to workers' interests and their jobs.  There are already efforts to reduce the number of workers in  ports."    Finance minister Manmohan Singh's repeated claims that there  is no reduction in the work force is just a show. There are no  jobs to meet the resultant unemployment. [passage ommitted] The  finance department has to make decisions on about 55 sick and  ailing industries. When they finally close there will be a big  clash between the trade unions and the government. Since the  government has decided to sign the Dunkel Draft, this clash may  reach serious proportions.</p>

The move is considered helpful  in introducing labourers into the city, the largest industrial  base in the country, and beneficial to having this work done in  an organized and ordered way and to the easing to a certain  extent of the "labour wave" imposed upon the municipality.    The city has recently set up an office in charge of  administration over such labourers employed by entities and  units in the city. The markets designed for such labourers will  be open to all places in the country and allow various places to  export labourers to the city where the introduction of such  workers will be subject to market competition. Those units  needing such labourers, except in particular circumstances, will  have to have approval from labour departments at the city's  district or county level prior to recruiting such workers in  designated markets of this kind, and a contract will be required  to be signed between the employer and employee, becoming  effective only after it is testified to and sealed by the market  authorities.</p>

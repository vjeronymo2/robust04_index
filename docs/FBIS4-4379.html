			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kim Yong-sam telephoned U.S. President  Clinton on the morning of 31 March and explained the result of  his visit to Japan and China and discussed ways to resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue.    Following is a report by Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae  [presidential residence]:    [Begin Kim Chin-sok recording] In a telephone conversation  with President Clinton this morning, President Kim revealed that  to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, close cooperation  between the ROK and the United States and establishing a  cooperative system with Japan are important, and that, if  possible, it is necessary to make efforts for China to take part  in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.    President Kim said that as revealed in the summit talks with  President Jiang Zemin, he thinks that China will convey to North  Korea that the ROK will not achieve reunification through the  absorption of North Korea and that it has a firm will for  maintaining peace. President Kim told President Clinton that  cooperation with Russia is also necessary.    President Kim said that in the ROK-China summit talks,  President Jiang Zemin emphasized that China believes that  security on the Korean peninsula is most important, and that to  achieve this, dialogue between the parties concerned is very  important. While denying that some reports are false, President  Kim stressed that the issue of deploying Patriot missiles and  the Team Spirit exercise were not mentioned at all in the  ROK-China summit talks.    In this connection, President Clinton said that he agrees  that it is important to make efforts to resolve the North Korean  nuclear issue by obtaining cooperation from China. President  Clinton said that there is no objection to the fact that the  resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue is the most  desirable. He pointed out that it is difficult to hold dialogue  because North Korea is not fulfilling its promises.    President Clinton said that the U.S. Government thinks that  it must continue to demand that North Korea receive sufficient  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and resume  North-South dialogue. He said that since it is not desirable to  bring about a worst-case crisis regarding the North Korean  nuclear issue, we must deal with this issue prudently and step  by step.    Today's telephone conversation started at 1000 [0100 GMT],  lasting for 33 minutes.    This has been Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae. [end recording]</p>

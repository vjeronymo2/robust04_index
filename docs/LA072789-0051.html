			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MURPHY RETURNS TO POWER IN BRAVES' WIN  </P> <P> It was just a few years ago that Dale Murphy was generally recognized as the  best player in the National League.  </P> <P> He was winning most of the awards, hitting the most home runs and driving in  runs in bunches.  </P> <P> When he hit his first slump in 1986, when he tailed off in most offensive  categories, it wasconsidered a fluke. But Murphy and nobody else could explain  what happened last year when he suffered a power outage.  </P> <P> The Braves tried to trade him this spring, but nobody wanted to take a chance  on the 33-year-old outfielder.  </P> <P> He has continued to struggle this season. He went long spells without an  extra-base hit.  </P> <P> Lately, though, there have been a few occasions when the power is back.  </P> <P> It happened Wednesday night at Atlanta when Murphy hit a three-run home run and  drove in the winning run with a long sacrifice fly as the Braves beat the San  Francisco Giants, 5-4.  </P> <P> The home run, Murphy's ninth, sailed well over the fence in left and wiped out  a three-run deficit. Before he hit the home run, Murphy was only two for 30  lifetime against Scott Garrelts of the Giants.  </P> <P> "I'm just trying to get more of a line-drive swing the last week or so," said  Murphy, who is hitting .240. "If I hit a home run, that's fine, but I really  haven't been hitting any so rather than try for them I figured I'd try to hit  line drives and see what happens."  </P> <P> With the Houston Astros beating the Dodgers, the Giants' lead in the National  League West dropped to two games. Even after Murphy's home run, the Giants went  into the eighth with a 4-3 lead and sent bullpen ace Steve Bedrosian to the  mound.  </P> <P> Bedrosian started by walking Jody Davis. A passed ball and a bunt single put  runners on first and third. Jeff Treadway singled in the tying run, and Murphy  hit the long fly to send in the decisive run.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 3, New York 2 -- While the Mets may be trying to make a deal for  pitcher Frank Viola of the Minnesota Twins, they are trying to stay within  striking distance of first place.  </P> <P> But the fifth-place Pirates aren't making it easy. Pittsburgh starter John  Smiley gave up only three hits and drove in a run at New York to improve his  lifetime record against the Mets to 6-1. Two of the hits were home runs by  Kevin Elster and Mark Carreon. Carreon's was his third pinch home run of the  season.  </P> <P> The Met fans took out their anger on catcher Gary Carter, booing him in his  first appearance in the starting lineup since he went on the disabled list May  12. Carter was 0 for 3.  </P> <P> San Diego 5, Cincinnati 3 -- The Reds' longest losing streak since 1966 reached  10 when an infield hit by Luis Salazar in the eighth inning at Cincinnati broke  a 3-3 tie.  </P> <P> In 1966, the Reds lost 11 in a row.  </P> <P> The Reds, bothered by injuries and playing without their entire starting  outfield, aren't getting the bounces, either. Just before Salazar broke the  tie, Mike Pagliarulo hit a bloop single to put runners on first and third.  </P> <P> Dennis Rasmussen allowed three hits over 6 1/3 innings before yielding to Mark  Grant (4-1), who got the victory, pitching 1 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> The Reds had tied the score, 3-3, in the seventh by loading the bases against  Rasmussen on Scotti Madison's double, a fielder's choice and a walk with one  out. Mariano Duncan grounded to third, but Pagliarulo's throw home failed to  get Duncan.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, Montreal 3 -- The Expos were in an ideal position to improve  their lead in the East to 4 1/2 games at Montreal.  </P> <P> They had a 3-2 lead behind Zane Smith, who had pitched well in relief, and  needed to get only three more outs.  </P> <P> It was the beginning of the end to the six-game winning streak when third  baseman Tim Wallach fumbled Bob Dernier's grounder. Von Hayes doubled to put  runners on second and third and bring bullpen ace Tim Burke to the rescue.  Burke had been successful on 21 of his 27 opportunities for a save.  </P> <P> Not this time. He retired two batters, but with a two-strike count and two out,  Randy Ready lashed a two-run single and the Phillies ended their six-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> St. Louis 2, Chicago 0 -- Vince Coleman, out several days because of a sore  leg, came back withall his speed in this game at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Coleman drove in both Cardinal runs and stole three bases to keep the Cubs from  closing in on Montreal. He has 50 steals and has not been thrown out all year.  </P> <P> Jose DeLeon limited the Cubs to two hits in eight innings, then Ken Dayley and  Todd Worrell closed out the Cubs in the ninth.  </P> <P> Rick Sutcliffe (10-9) did manage to end Jose Oquendo's hitting streak at 23  games.

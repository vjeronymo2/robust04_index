			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Man to keep Clinton's name in lights: Jurek Martin analyses the choice of Mr Warren Christopher as US secretary of state MR Zbigniew Brzezinski's line on the international conference circuit has been that President-elect Bill Clinton had the choice of two sorts of people as his secretary of state - someone known for process, or for ideas. On the hypothetical short list of President Carter's former national security adviser, only one man seemed to combine both attributes - Mr Warren Christopher, duly anointed by Mr Clinton on Tuesday. On the other hand, Mr Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defence in the Reagan administration and as hawkish as Mr Brzezinski, disagrees. While full of compliments about Congressman Les Aspin at the defence department, Mr James Woolsey at the CIA and even Mrs Madeleine Albright as ambassador to the United Nations, he finds Mr Christopher's elevation 'puzzling'. Partly this is because Mr Christopher served as number two to Mr Cyrus Vance in the Carter state department ('not notably successful in foreign policy', in Mr Perle's partisan view) and partly because the 'prince of darkness'-turned-novelist confesses he has no idea what Mr Christopher's world view is. Somebody has to be the source of policy ideas in the government, he adds. There can be a bitchiness among foreign policy experts exceeded only by academics and economists, but Mr Perle has something of a point. Mr Christopher, like Mr Vance, is the quintessential public servant who does whatever job is handed to him, amply demonstrated by his efforts to secure the release of US hostages in Tehran in 1980-81 and by his investigation of the Los Angeles riots earlier this year. But he has never considered it necessary to emblazon his thoughts in learned journals or on the conference circuit. But Mr Perle might be missing a larger point. This is that the next US government will be the Clinton administration, with the president's name in lights and in every corner of policy, domestic and foreign. He wants the best advice - and is assembling an administration of diverse talents to secure it - but he is not about to abdicate broad policy areas to anyone. Mr Clinton has studied past presidencies with great care. He knows he beat Mr George Bush because his opponent neglected the domestic economy. He senses that one reason for Mr Carter's troubles was that he allowed competing fiefdoms to run riot in foreign policy. He believes President Reagan was a success because he had clear policy goals and the gift of being able to communicate them. Thus the Clinton team comprises those who know both the workings of Washington and the country at large. He announced his economic and social policy advisers first because of the symbolism of that act. He can tolerate different points of view because he intends to be not only the arbiter between them, but the principal communicator of whatever emerges. The task might appear to be superhuman, even to a young president to whom policy is mother's milk. Already the press is full of doom-laden articles arguing that the world is so volatile that Mr Clinton's promised 'laser beam' focus on the domestic side is misguided, and, alternatively, that he, like every other president, is bound to find Moscow more fascinating than Los Angeles and will inevitably leave things undone at home. Mr Clinton does concede that he comes to the office with no record in the international arena. He once said, in the flush of campaigning, that in a fast changing world experience was not necessarily the greatest qualification. Nobody disputes that he is the fastest of studiers, quicker even than Mr Carter, who was no slouch. But even he lacks institutional memory and that, in sum, is what Mr Christopher, Mr Aspin, Mrs Albright, Mr Woolsey, and Messrs Anthony Lake and Sandy Berger at the national security council, have been brought in to provide. It matters less that all but Mr Aspin served in the Carter administration than that they all know, certainly including Mr Aspin, where the foreign bodies are buried. In sum, it looks very collegiate and very experienced, which is precisely what Mr Clinton, indisputably president of the college but lacking the formal experience, needs.</p>

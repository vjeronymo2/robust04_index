			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Twelve in accord on minimum VAT rates EC FINANCE ministers last night formally agreed to bring in legally binding minimum rates of value added tax and excise duties across the Community, ending four years of negotiation. Britain, which holds the EC presidency, and the European Commission hailed the long-awaited agreement as a large step towards the establishment of an efficient barrier-free European market after January 1 1993. Ministers came close to a formal accord in July, when they agreed in principle to fix a legally binding minimum EC-wide VAT rate of 15 per cent until 1996 and minimum duties on a range of other products including tobacco, alcohol and heating oils. But the package of eight directives had been held up since then by some member states' objections to specific parts of the deal. The agreement will leave VAT rates unchanged in most EC countries. In Britain it is 17.5 per cent. But without an accord, EC members might have been tempted to keep border controls as security against unilateral changes in VAT rates by neighbouring states, aimed at attracting cross-border shoppers. Unanimous agreement on the package was in the balance until late last night, as Britain and Spain argued for three hours about the tax treatment of sherry in the UK. Spain was unhappy about differing excise duties applied to Spanish and British sherry. The UK product has a lower alcohol content and consequently a lower duty. But Britain last night agreed to narrow the differential between the two products from 43 per cent to 25 per cent by 1996.</p>

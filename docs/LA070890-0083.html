			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN;  </P> <P> HALFWAY TO SUCCESS, HALFWAY TO OBLIVION  </P> <P> At the All-Star break of a lockout season, these are the keys to the kingdom:  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE WEST  </P> <P> With all of their other assets, the Oakland Athletics still seem to need a  physically sound Jose Canseco. The A's were 8-9 and scored three or fewer runs  10 times when Canseco was out of the lineup in June.  </P> <P> His absence accentuates a lack of productivity by the designated hitters, but  with him, the A's could wrap up a third consecutive division title by  mid-August, because they play 17 of their first 20 games after the break and 26  of their first 33 at home, where they are 21-14.  </P> <P> A return to form by Mike Moore could make it easy. A 19-game winner last year,  Moore is 7-7 and has been unable to get his fastball much above 80 m.p.h. for  most of the first half.  </P> <P> The Chicago White Sox have held on doggedly, but only catcher Carlton Fisk is  accustomed to pennant pressure, and one wonders how many times Manager Jeff  Torborg can juggle his bullpen mirrors before they crack.  </P> <P> White Sox relief pitchers made a numbing 193 appearances through 75 games,  averaging 3 2/3 innings a game while working 36% of the staff's total. The  relievers' 20-8 record, parlayed with Bobby Thigpen's 26 saves, reflects the  bullpen's importance to Torborg, but a yield of seven or more runs three times  in the last week of the first half may be a more relevant statistic now.  </P> <P> Probable Finish: 1 -- Oakland, 2 -- Seattle, 3 -- Chicago, 4 -- Kansas City, 5  -- Minnesota, 6 -- Texas, 7 -- Angels.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST  </P> <P> New England title hopes hinge primarily on the ability of Roger Clemens, who is  12-4; Mike Boddicker, 11-4; and Greg Harris, 6-3, to remain injury-free. Boston  has tried six other starters in the fourth and fifth spots in the rotation and  they are a combined 5-10.  </P> <P> Rumors persist that the Red Sox are willing to trade Mike Greenwell, who has  not hit a home run on the road in nearly a year and hit his only two homers of  this year on April 27, to the Atlanta Braves for a young pitcher; but, barring  a trade, the Boston staff consists primarily of the three starters and closer  Jeff Reardon, sidelined twice in the first half because of injuries and used  five times in one recent six-game span by Manager Joe Morgan, prompting the  ESPN analyst of the same name to tell his audience, "It wasn't me folks."  </P> <P> Morgan's managing aside -- the truth is, the Red Sox only thought about asking  American League President Bobby Brown to extend their manager's recent  suspension -- the Red Sox will enter the second half believing they can  dominate their Eastern rivals, against whom they are 25-12, and dominate anyone  at home, where they are 28-13 with 40 games remaining in Fenway Park.  </P> <P> Toronto, by contrast, has only 32 games left at home and 44 on the road. A team  that leads the league in scoring, the Blue Jays should also boast the deepest  and best starting staff, but their performance has been enigmatic.  </P> <P> At various times in the first half, the Blue Jays lost six of eight, nine of 10  and six in a row, the starters compiling a 5.91 earned-run average in those  spells. Then there were surges of five consecutive victories, 10 of 11, seven  of nine and eight of 10, when the ERA was 3.25.  </P> <P> If Dave Stieb, Todd Stottlemyre, David Wells, Jimmy Key and John Cerutti ever  maintain one of those rolls -- as they have the ability to do -- the race could  be reversed in a hurry.  </P> <P> Probable Finish: 1 -- Toronto, 2 -- Boston, 3 -- Milwaukee, 4 -- Cleveland, 5  -- Detroit, 6 -- Baltimore, 7 -- New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST  </P> <P> There doesn't seem to be any way the Cincinnati Reds can blow it. Although Eric  Davis, who missed 22 first-half games with injuries, has yet to find his  groove, the regular lineup includes six players with 28 or more runs batted in,  six with batting averages of .280 or higher and three with 20 or more stolen  bases.  </P> <P> They have depth on the bench and in the bullpen. And with a 22-10 home record,  they get 49 of their final 83 games there. The one question is the depth of the  rotation. Jose Rijo is again sidelined because of a shoulder injury, and  replacement Scott Scudder has been hit hard. Rick Mahler has been mediocre  since replacing the traded Ron Robinson.  </P> <P> However, Jack Armstrong and Tom Browning are a combined 19-8, and Danny Jackson  has permitted only six earned runs in the 24 2/3 innings of his last four  starts, the struggle to recover from his arm injury of 1989 apparently behind  him.  </P> <P> The Reds have several other factors going for them, specifically the  underachieving San Diego Padres, the mediocre Dodgers and the defending  champion San Francisco Giants, who post the best lineup among these alleged  contenders but are still trying to cope with pitching injuries.  </P> <P> If the basically rookie duo of John Burkett and Trevor Wilson, who had 12 of  the Giants' 41 victories entering the final weekend of the first half, can  continue to stabilize the riddled rotation, and sophomore Jeff Brantley can  provide the consistent relief that Steve Bedrosian hasn't provided, San  Francisco might still be a threat, but it's a tall order.  </P> <P> Probable Finish: 1 -- Cincinnati, 2 -- San Francisco, 3 -- Dodgers, 4 -- San  Diego, 5 -- Atlanta, 6 -- Houston.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE EAST  </P> <P> The New York Mets' ongoing roll under new Manager Bud Harrelson tends to cloud  the fact that the Pittsburgh Pirates' lineup is just as formidable and,  position by position, maybe superior.  </P> <P> What separates the two is the proven quality and quantity of the Mets'  rotation. Who do you like: Dwight Gooden, Frank Viola, David Cone, Sid  Fernandez and Bob Ojeda; or Neal Heaton, John Smiley, Doug Drabek, Bob Walk and  Walt Terrell? Fernandez has missed two recent starts because of a shoulder  problem, but Ron Darling, while unhappy with his uncertain role, has stepped in  to pitch effectively.  </P> <P> That edge gives the Mets a better chance to sustain a streak or stop a slump,  but the Pirates have an edge of their own. They are 23-10 at home and play 48  of their 81 second-half games there.  </P> <P> The Mets must play 47 of their last 85 on the road, where they were 17-17  entering Saturday night's game at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Probable Finish: 1 -- New York, 2 -- Pittsburgh, 3 -- Montreal, 4 -- Chicago, 5  -- Philadelphia, 6 -- St. Louis.  </P> <P> At some point in the next few days, weeks or months, Angel owner Gene Autry  will place a call to Whitey Herzog, who resigned Friday as manager of the St.  Louis Cardinals. Autry has long been an admirer of Herzog's.  </P> <P> Reached Friday, shortly after Herzog announced his resignation, Autry said: "I  think a lot of Whitey. He's a fine man and fine manager. I will probably touch  base with him at some point, but I'm not going to call until he has had a  chance to sit back and get a hold on his emotions."  </P> <P> The hiring of Herzog in a field or developmental capacity would be a wise move  by the Angels. Autry once had him under contract, but let him slip away.  </P> <P> Herzog coached for the Angels in 1974, during the great Bobby Winkles  experiment, when then-General Manager Harry Dalton hired Winkles directly off  the Arizona State campus.  </P> <P> When Winkles was fired during the season, Herzog served briefly as interim  manager before the hiring of Dick Williams. At the end of that season, Herzog  left to become manager of the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> "I probably should have hired Whitey as manager instead of Williams," Autry  said Friday. "That's probably one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.  Williams came in and didn't do any better than Winkles had. Whitey went on to  become one of the best managers in baseball."  </P> <P> Autry insisted that he isn't thinking of a change in his managerial or  front-office ranks, but merely voicing respect for Herzog.  </P> <P> "Our hitters have gone cold right now," he said, "but Doug Rader is doing a  good job. I can't fault the manager for our position."  </P></p>

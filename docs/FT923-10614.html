			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: IBM steps up job cuts plans INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday said at least 32,000 people would take part in its voluntary workforce reduction programmes this year, above its earlier estimates of about 20,000 job cuts, increasing the cost of the programmes by about Dollars 1.2bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York. IBM, which last year reported its first annual loss of Dollars 2.8bn after charges on sales of Dollars 64.8bn, said it would recoup these costs over the next 18 months through ongoing savings. The company also indicated that changes were afoot at its personal computer division. In response to reports that its PC business would be turned into a wholly-owned subsidiary, IBM said it had been working to sharpen the focus of its PC operations since December, 'and you will continue to see us change'. IBM would not comment about specific changes, but it has been working towards increasing the autonomy and accountability of its business units since December when it announced a broad restructuring of its worldwide operations.</p>

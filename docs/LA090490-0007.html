			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE'RE GUARDING MORE THAN CHEAP GAS;  </P> <P> IRAQ: SADDAM HUSSEIN MAY NOT BE HITLER, BUT HE IS AN IMPRESSIVE TROUBLEMAKER  WHO NEEDS TO BE CHECKED.  </P> <P> If lucky, the world can usually count on a policeman or two: powers whose  values and interests predispose them to make sacrifices to uphold rudimentary  rules of civility. Marauders, bullies, thieves and plunderers ready to abuse  those rules are never in short supply. In Winston Churchill's vivid image, they  move constantly through our common household, trying the doors to see whether  they're locked.  </P> <P> The Korean parallel to the present confrontation with Iraq may yet prove to be  the right one. It was the first decision of the Cold War period to take up  arms, as this is the first after it. These decisions to intervene when less  than national survival is at stake are inevitably shots in the dark, more the  product of hunch than analysis, uncertain in result.  </P> <P> It is a sober intuition about the balance of power that prompts American  intervention in the Persian Gulf. Unfortunately, President Bush, who is not a  man of eloquence, has not explained it very well. But the unprecedented  unanimity of nations, reflected in the resolutions of the U.N. Security  Council, shows that far more than "cheap gas" is at issue.  </P> <P> Hussein of Iraq may be no monster of Hitler dimensions. But he is an impressive  troublemaker who needs to be checked. His recent career shows it. After the  Shah's fall in Iran, he scrapped a solemn treaty and tried to grab the  Shatt-al-Arab waterway. That cost the blood of millions. Earlier, he had tried  to develop a nuclear bomb with which to threaten Israel (and others too, no  doubt). And but for the boldness of Menachem Begin, who bombed out his nuclear  plant, he might have succeeded. What powers of blackmail Saddam Hussein would  now wield if that enterprise had succeeded one can only imagine.  </P> <P> More recently, he tried to import huge "pipeline" segments that were in fact  the sections of a long-range artillery piece of sinister size. Some neighbor,  or perhaps the Kurds, would have felt its wrath. In that he was thwarted by  British customs. ("If it was a pipeline," an informed friend told me in London  recently, "it was the first rifled pipeline in history.")  </P> <P> Balked in all these adventures, Hussein's new goal was to pillage Kuwait and  grab control of a substantial part of the world's oil reserves. No doubt it  would delight him to force Americans to pay more for gas. But that would only  be the cream on the vast power that oil blackmail would make available. That is  what such bullies and megalomaniacs seek; and the only deterrent they recognize  is cold steel.  </P> <P> Playing world policeman gambles with the American public's isolationist  instincts. But a stitch in time can save nine. When he moved to check North  Korean aggression in June, 1950, Harry Truman and his advisers assumed,  incorrectly, that it was orchestrated by Stalin as part of a global strategy.  Still, timely action then reduced the odds of nuclear war later.  </P> <P> As Gilbert and Sullivan told us, "The policeman's lot is not an 'appy one." It  is merely necessary.  </P></p>

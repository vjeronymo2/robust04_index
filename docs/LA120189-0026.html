			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS CATCH DIVISION II RIVERSIDE  </P> <P> Coach Jim Brandenburg talked with pride Thursday of what his San Diego State  basketball team had accomplished in the final five minutes of a 67-61 comeback  victory over UC Riverside.  </P> <P> He had to. Anything else in the game might have been beyond words.  </P> <P> The Aztecs (2-2) had to rally past the NCAA Division II Highlanders (2-1) by  scoring 16 of the final 18 points in nonconference home opener in front of  1,931 at the San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "I was really concerned if we were going to get a wake-up call," Brandenburg  said. "We didn't get started until the five-minute mark.  </P> <P> "But I was really pleased with what our players did then. It was the first time  we played like a team. The bench was up shouting, everyone was in the game."  </P> <P> Until then, the Aztecs appeared to be in serious danger of losing to a  non-Division I team for the first time in 10 seasons. They trailed, 38-33, at  the half and were behind by as much as 10 in the second half. And Riverside was  missing its leading scorer -- senior forward Chris Ceballos -- who broke a  finger on his shooting hand in practice last week.  </P> <P> With Ceballos out, guards Reggie Howard and Mike Ritter tried to make up for  his absence by scoring from the outside. The pair split 28 points, 18 coming on  three-point shots.  </P> <P> The Aztecs trailed, 58-48, with 7:57 to play but came back to win by scoring 13  points in a row after Riverside took a 59-51 with 5:52 left. The streak gave  SDSU a 64-59 lead with 1:52 remaining, the go-ahead points coming on a  17-footer by guard Rodney Jones that made it 61-59 with 3:05 left.  </P> <P> It was the first SDSU lead since the first six minutes of the game.  </P> <P> Offensive inefficiency was again at the root of the Aztecs' problems, but their  strong shooting from the free-throw line (23 of 29) helped keep them in the  game.  </P> <P> The Aztecs were led by junior forward Shawn Jamison's 13 points.  </P></p>

Meng Jianzhu, deputy mayor and head of the leading group,  attended the meeting and spoke.    According to figures, the municipality made remarkable  progress in cracking down on smuggling last year. Over 1,500  violations involving smuggling and selling of contraband goods  were uncovered last year in the Shanghai area. The goods  involved in those violations were estimated at 334 million yuan.  The focus of Shanghai's anti-smuggling work this year will be  on the investigation of major cases, with special emphasis on  cracking down on smuggling by enterprises and establishments  through cargo transport channels, and organized smuggling and  blackmarketing. We should, in particular, strike at the  ringleaders, principal offenders, and habitual criminals. Cases  of gross violations that involve huge amounts of illicit goods,  the use of violence to resist antismuggling efforts,  collaboration from within and without, law- breaking by  law-enforcement personnel, and pose a great harm to society must  be dealt with promptly and severely.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GERMANI TROUPE HAS A WAY TO GO  </P> <P> Since Al Germani began creating dances one year ago, the fledgling  choreographer has accumulated a sum total of seven pieces -- two of which are  still considered works-in-progress. Last weekend, Germani packaged them all for  public display at City College.  </P> <P> Germani was not on stage when the six-member troupe that bears his name  performed its first major concert, but his presence was felt in almost every  other way. The artistic director was credited in the program for sound track  arrangement and costume concept, as well as all the choreography.  </P> <P> Not even Germani is ready to declare the company professional. The dancers and  their head honcho are too short on experience and know-how to aspire to those  heights. And there were no telltale signs of a bright future in this  seven-piece potpourri. But Al Germani Dance Company showed plenty of  determination as it gave its all at Friday's opening performance, and the  audience was more than ready to meet it halfway.  </P> <P> Germani's choreography mixed modern movement, ballet and jazz jargon without  stretching the limits of any single element or breaking new ground with the  hybrid form. Emotion, not motion, is the driving force behind his expressionist  style, and almost all of his work relied heavily on dark psychological themes.  In fact, for one group piece -- the introduction to a work-in-progress -- the  choreographer kept his dancers in a stationary position throughout.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, many of the dances were allowed to wallow in the murky excesses  of melodrama, aided and abetted by program notes that proclaimed them to be "a  reflective statement mirroring that which lies within us," or "a frustrative  attempt to impact our own inherent oppressiveness."  </P> <P> Like all too many novice choreographers, Germani seemed unable to resist the  temptation to explain obvious symbols and to hammer home his points with  endless repetitions of overworked images.  </P> <P> For "Chairworks," the program notes reminded us that the chairs were a  "metaphor for that which holds us back." Then Germani proceeded to take his  chair-borne dancers through their paces with numbing predictability. A little  lighter touch would serve him and the dancers (who threw themselves into its  taxing demands with a passion), a lot better.  </P> <P> With no male dancers to work with, the messages about relationships are  obviously skewed, but that didn't stop Germani. In "Opp," a series of dramatic  encounters and desperate solos, he dressed half of the troupe's women in shirts  and ties to set up his battle of the sexes.  </P> <P> Germani set this opus on oppression against a hodgepodge of gun blasts,  drumbeats and other jarring sound patterns, but the dance never came together  as an organic whole. The lighting design (which Germani obviously had a hand in  as well), was another example of theatrical overkill.  </P> <P> In "Pas de Blues," a work that is still evolving, he paired Tina Buerkle and  Marni Respicio, then let each take the limelight for a solo section. This piece  showed more potential, and the dancers -- decked out in leather jackets and  rumpled jeans -- were at their best in its gritty designs.  </P> <P> "Soma" (shown in an unfinished state at last summer's Dance X-Change concert),  was included on this program, its focus expanded to four dancers. Buerkle was  enigmatic as the ballerina, and she had competent support from the shadowy  figures around her. But subtlety was not Germani's strong suit here either.  </P> <P> Although the choreographer calls "Flop" "a glimpse of an escape to artistry,"  there was little real artistry or musicality in what was seen on Friday's  program. And its fast-paced dance patterns called attention to the technical  deficiencies in the dancers.  </P> <P> The jazz-based "Tux" (with spoken text by Germani), put the whole cast in black  bowler hats and set them against a red-lit backdrop for an Alwin Nikolais-style  theater piece. It had its moments, but still needs work to keep it from  fragmenting.  </P> <P> The concert sagged badly under the weight of extensive pauses as the small band  of dancers made hurried costume changes, since almost every piece on the  program called for four or more performers.  </P> <P> Perhaps, with more experience, Germani will find his choreographic stride. He  has only just begun to approach dance from the vantage point of a designer. But  for now, his work looks derivative, redundant, and often self-indulgent.  </P></p>

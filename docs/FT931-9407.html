			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Property: For and against - Gerald Cadogan examines a bill, passed by MPs this week, that could change the face of central London IS THE Housing and Urban Development bill fair? Yes, and needed badly, say the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association (LEA) and Dudley Fishburn, the MP for Kensington who has headed the battle for reform. They say leaseholders pay for their houses many times over - in premiums, ground rents, management charges, repairs and maintenance - and, at the end, are left with an out-of-date lease while the landowner gets the rise in value. London's large estate-owners, who do not wish their holdings broken up, disagree. They say they have looked after the estates for centuries and claim it is unfair for the law to intervene in a contract into which willing partners have entered freely. The estates are unique, long-term family investments. In 1677, Sir Thomas Grosvenor married 12-year-old Mary Davies, heiress to the manor of Ebury which stretched from the river Thames to Oxford Street. Some 300 acres of it, in Mayfair and Belgravia, are still owned by the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate Holdings. (The Pimlico section was sold in 1950, one reason being the embarrassment of the then duke when cited as landlord in many brothel-keeping cases). Its asset value of Pounds 3.7bn made it equivalent last year to the eighth-largest quoted UK company, says the LEA's report on The Great London Estates. The Cadogan estate stems from the marriage in 1717 of Charles Cadogan to the daughter of Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum, who had bought the manor of Chelsea in 1712. Other estates include Portman, Bedford, Howard de Walden, the Church Commissioners, Phillimore, Eyre, Ilchester, the Crown and Henry Smith's Charity, the trustees of which bought 84 acres in Kensington, west London, soon after he died in 1628 'for the use of the poor captives being slaves under the Turkish pirates' and for his poor relations. Boom time came in the late 18th and 19th centuries as London spread into the surrounding villages and farmland. The landowners gave speculative builders like James Burton and Thomas Cubitt leases to put up houses, but did not relinquish the land. So the system began. The builders paid for the houses. Their clients bought and maintained them and paid ground rent to the estate, which took them back after 99 years when the leases ran out. The bias towards the families that owned the ground was tolerable while property values stayed stable, as they did until the early 1960s. But the price explosion changed the game. Reversions had great value. Leases of 50-60 years let the landowner (as in Monopoly) pass 'Go' and collect twice as often, and ground rents turned 'modern' and expensive. The old were affected worst; they have dreaded outliving their leases and being thrown on to the street. Joan South, campaign co-ordinator of the LEA, claims the estates have inflexible attitudes which are conditioned by the great security they have had and by the conservative training of their surveyors. She adds that, with less complacency and more consideration by the estates matters would never have polarised. Diminishing leases are not such a problem. Research by the Consumers' Association and the Joseph Rowntree Trust found that 97 per cent of flat leases had an unexpired term over 60 years (the crucial factor for lending by building societies) and two-thirds had more than 90 years. On the Cadogan estate, long leases for flats were rare until the 1965 Rent Act controlling rents severely hurt the market. Lord Chelsea - son of Lord Cadogan - and Stuart Corbyn, chief executive of the Cadogan estate, note that, under present rules, people tend to enfranchise when they are thinking of selling on. Lord Chelsea says: 'Enfranchisement gives a number of lessees now a chance to benefit but does nothing to solve the housing problem.' While the rules on price imply willing buyers and sellers, he says: 'We are not willing sellers.' He says London will suffer. 'The planning laws do not go so far as we do. There will be more plastic windows and a satellite dish on every building. This is the end of the family estate.' The bill will be a piecemeal end to an impasse of attitudes, but the legislation was in the Tory election manifesto - a new form of privatisation to share out the spoils from the property boom. One thing is certain: applying it will be a bonanza for lawyers and surveyors. Next week: The look of London; the bill and the market; flatholders unite.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Driving rains hit Houston Intense rains of up to two inches an hour shut down much of Houston yesterday as the death toll reached seven in flash flooding across south-eastern Texas, Reuter reports from Houston. The whole region was under a flood warning after up to 20 inches of rain inundated parts of the area over 36 hours. Driving rains lasted through the night with weather forecasters saying there was no relief in view from a Gulf of Mexico moisture system stalled over the area. Many major roads were impassable because of stretches of high water. Oil refineries remained open in Houston's vast refining and petrochemical complex.</p>

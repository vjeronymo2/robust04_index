			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Warning over contracting out THE GOVERNMENT could face retrospective claims from tens of thousands of public service workers who experienced a deterioration in pay and conditions when their jobs were contracted out to the private sector. Mr Jack Dromey, a national secretary of the TGWU general union, told the union's conference yesterday that hundreds of test cases were being prepared and would go to court if the government rejected a general settlement. The issue has arisen because of the European Community's Tupe legislation which protects the pay and conditions of workers in many cases of job transfer. Although Tupe has been part of British law since 1981, it is only recently that the government has acknowledged that its provisions can apply to contracting out. Mr Dromey says that up to 25,000 workers in local and central government and the National Health Service had their pay reduced before it was realised that they were protected by Tupe and that the government should now pay up. The compensation sums involved are estimated to be in the tens of millions of pounds and Mr Dromey said that the government faced the prospect of spending more than that in legal fees if it did not agree a settlement. He added: 'The government has a choice over Tupe - an expensive decade of chaos or a settlement.'</p>

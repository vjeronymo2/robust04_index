			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gain in Sears A DIVIDEND cut, deepening losses and huge restructuring costs at Sears had the seemingly contradictory result of sending the stores group's shares sharply forward in brisk turnover. Sears cut its interim dividend from 1.525p to 1p after reporting a pre-tax interim loss of Pounds 8.8m. It took a provision of Pounds 32.2m for rationalisation of its shoe subsidiary and an Pounds 84m extraordinary charge following its withdrawal, announced last week, from menswear retailing. However, with the bad news well signposted, the results were already in the share price, while the dividend cut at least removed uncertainty surrounding the dividend policy. Analysts also reported a positive post-results meeting. 'Sears has bitten the bullet and the market can now look at the potential for recovery of the company,' said Ms Kimlan Cooke at County NatWest, who yesterday moved from a sell to a hold on the stock. 'But the shares do not look cheap and Sears has some way to go before it is out of the woods.' Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort, brokers to the company, was more bullish. 'While the dividend cut was not as large as some had wanted, the issue is now resolved. Investors can now focus on the underlying business and the prospects for growth.' Sears shares climbed 8 to 80p, with turnover of 24m making it the heaviest traded stock of the day. Banks sold Bearish noises from County NatWest put substantial pressure on a banks sector that has recently outperformed the wider market. 'The sector was at a 10-year relative high and included too much in the way of recovery hopes built into it,' said Mr John Aitken, banks analyst at County. He targeted the whole sector as ripe for profit-taking but picked out current earnings forecasts for Lloyds and TSB as especially liable to revision. Mr Aitken warned that Lloyds exposure to the Maxwell empire could be greater than previously thought. On TSB he said his current year profits estimate could be as much as 30 per cent too high, implying a potential downgrade from Pounds 220m to Pounds 150m. He cited Hill Samuel's property lending book as a cause for concern as well as TSB's ordinary banking bad debts. Mr Aitken's caution on Barclays largely reflected doubts about an upturn in the property market. County's bearish views on Lloyds triggered a 21 slide in the shares which closed at 431p after turnover of 2.6m. Barclays lost 11 to 351p on 4.2m traded. TSB were barely changed at 133p. Fisons, the troubled chemicals, group was one of the Footsie stocks spoken of as a potential takeover target, the shares edging up 3 to 187p, on good turnover of 4.4m shares. After several uncomfortable sessions, chiefly at the hands of US investors, pharmaceutical stocks rebounded as some UK brokers decided the retreat had been overdone. Glaxo jumped 18 to 764p, SmithKline 19 to 492p and Wellcome 11 to 920p. More downgrades of ICI yesterday, following on from Monday, continued to undermine the shares. They closed 16 off at 1129p. Enterprise Oil shares, heavily supported by US investors over the past couple of weeks ahead of news of Monday's ADR listing in New York, maintained their strong performance to close a further 14 higher at 426p on relatively high turnover of 1.9m. Lasmo also performed well, edging up 2 to 162p on 2.8m. Burmah Castrol, on the other hand, were upset by news that Strauss Turnbull had removed the stock from its buy list, rating it no more than a 'hold'. Strauss said it would not discourage profit taking at the current level. BP mirrored the overall market mood, slipping 4 to 213 1/2 p on 8.3m traded, and was also affected by suggestions that investors were switching out of the stock and into Shell, which hardened to 539p on good turnover of 5.4m. Utilities made good progress at the outset but relinquished much of their early gains as the session wore on. British Gas settled 2 better at 245p on 8.7m. In the electricity distribution stocks Midland held on to a gain of 7 at 405p, while the water stocks showed Thames 9 firmer at 451p. The power generators staged a useful revival, still boosted by hopes that a favourable new five-year deal with British Coal will be revealed in the near future. PowerGen closed 8 1/2 up at 286p and National Power rose 6 to 275p. Supermarket group Kwik Save surrendered 12 to 672p after Cazenove was reported to have crossed 1.5m shares at 660p. Northern Foods was the subject of 'take profits' advice from BZW, among others. The shares lost 4 to 167p. Airtours moved ahead 8 to 237p as Hoare Govett recommended the tour group, arguing that the shares have the potential to go to 280p. Rival Owners Abroad added 4 to 60p. In the other industrial materials sector, English China Clays lost 19 to 425p, after BZW advised investors to take profits. The four worst performers in the London market all came from the building areas. Hepworth plunged 40, or 14 per cent to 243p, damaged by suggestions that the company's own broker, James Capel, had chopped its current year profits estimate to around Pounds 44m. Meyer International fell 21, or 9.5 per cent, to 200p, Heywood Williams 15, or 8 per cent, to 164p, and Tarmac 5 1/2 , or 6.8 per cent, to 75p. Redland, due to announce interims tomorrow, recovered strongly after a bout of heavy selling early in the session, and closed only 3 off at 358p, having been as low of 346p. Shares in British Steel shed 3 to 58p, after Smith New Court lowered its current year profits forecast from a profit of Pounds 25m to a loss of Pounds 50m. The broker said it expects the company to make no profits the following year. Mr Ian Lowe at Smith said: 'We do not accept that British Steel has derived any mid-term advantage from the recent devaluation and indeed in the longer term it maybe a disadvantage.' Turnover reached 7.7m. Strong two way business in British Aerospace of 5m left the shares 2 better at 118p. The company yesterday held a meeting with analysts in an attempt to steady nerves after last week's disappointing results. Mr Clive Forestier-Walker at Charter House Tilney said: 'It was a reassuring meeting but it still leaves prospects about the future uncertain.' TI Group ended 11 lighter at 290p on the weaker US dollar and nervousness about the levels of provisions at its Dowty Group subsidiary, due to be announced tomorrow.

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: Out of tune on Broadway - The parlous state of new musicals It has been a beastly year for new musicals on Broadway. Only two of the four shows nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award even stayed running until awards' time - Walt Disney Theatrical Productions' stage version of the animated feature Beauty and the Beast and Stephen Sondheim's Passion, itself a kind of beauty and the beast story in reverse. If Passion's sweep of the Tonys - it picked up four awards, including Best Musical, at last month's ceremony, to Beauty's one - represented some sort of victory of high art over big business, it proved to be short lived. The day after the ceremony, Beauty set an all-time Broadway box-office record for single day ticket sales. Punters were apparently drawn in by a clip from the production and a commercial shown during the national television broadcast of the awards. Passion's business, by comparison, was only average. The two productions continue to battle it out for audiences, but the real contest between them - dire efforts both - is which of them is less suited for the Broadway stage. With extensive rewriting and a completely new production, Passion might make a passable chamber opera, but its more likely fate is some back corner of Sondheim's desk. With this project, Sondheim seems to have abandoned completely the qualities that make his best work - Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Company - so splendid. Gone are the soaring melodies, the super-smart lyrics, the wry wit, the wrenching moments of self-awareness for characters and audiences alike. Humourless, arid, and musically unmemorable, Passion is the antithesis of entertainment, at once overblown and undercooked, portentous and insubstantial. Not to mention confusing. Based on Fosca, an obscure 19th century Italian novel by Ignio Tarchetti - which was also the source of the obscure 1981 film, Passione d'Amore - Passion tells the story of an Italian army captain, Giorgio, who is forced to leaves his beautiful mistress Clara when he is stationed to a remote outpost. The local colonel's unattractive, sickly cousin, Fosca, falls in love with him, and although he is initially dismissive of her, he eventually comes to return her love, dismissing his relationship with Clara as insincere. The plot turns on Giorgio's change of heart, but nothing in the musical lets us know why he would suddenly fall for a woman he has previously found so repulsive. What Sondheim and librettist/director James Lapine seem to be aiming for is an atmosphere of melodrama in which logic is less important than the characters' heightened experience. But since the characters neither compel on their own nor carry any historical or metaphorical significance, we search for emotional truth as some kind of grounding for this story, and find none. Early on, for example, it is dangled before us that Fosca and Giorgio share a love of books, but we wait in vain for scenes in which that, or some other, common ground is explored. Passion's most potentially interesting character is Fosca, but from her first appearance - descending on an upstage staircase behind a transparent scrim - it is clear that the musical is going to treat her as an object of curiosity rather than allow us into her complex psychology. We are given no reason to care about her, so that when Fosca throws herself at Giorgio's feet and begs for his love, it is so embarrassing we are forced to look away. The element that could hold everything together - the music - is hindered by the work's oddly halfhearted form. The subject matter seems to lend itself to a sung-through format, but Sondheim and Lapine have laced the music through with passages of spoken dialogue. Though lacking in identifiable songs, Sondheim's score has lovely, melodic passages; but just as the music begins to charge the atmosphere, the stilted dialogue sends the tone plummeting into the banal. Lapine's stately, dispassionate production worsens matters. One would expect a story of fervent love to have an equally torrid pace, but except for the aptly erotic first scene, in which Giorgio and Clara writhe naked in bed together and sing of their love, everything about the production moves at a monotonous glide. Jane Greenwood's nicely wrought costumes place us specifically in the late 19th century, but Adrianne Lobel's expressionistic sets of sliding, mottled walls strand us somewhere in contemporary design limbo. What sparks do fly in Passion are largely thanks to Donna Murphy's hugely committed, beautifully sung performance as Fosca, for which she won the best actress Tony. Jere Shea as Giorgio sings well but his acting is very bland, only adding to the character's - and the musical's - inscrutability. As for Beauty and the Beast, where it really belongs is on screen: the sublime animated feature instantly earned classic status among the Disney oeuvre when it was released in 1992. Where this stage version belongs is in a theme park; gaudy and ham-fisted, it systematically manhandles everything that made the screen version so memorable. In place of Disney's lavish animation, ponderous and unattractive sets heave hydraulically across the stage; instead of magical special effects, a dry ice machine puffs faux fog and firecrackers fizz; for the film's delightful enchanted characters we have third-rate performers sporting padded and molded outfits, declaiming Howard Ashman's piquant lyrics with the delicacy of elephants on parade. And yet, amid this debacle, the core of the Beauty story - the taming of the Beast (Terrence V. Mann, convincing even under a mountain of makeup) by the lovely, bookish Belle (the winning newcomer Susan Egan) - still charms. The inclusion of a few key scenes of character development, in which Belle and the Beast find common ground by reading stories together - the very sort of scenes, down to the subject matter, that Passion lacks - adds a level of human interest to the story that shines through Beauty and the Beast's relentless gaudiness. Walt Disney superior to Stephen Sondheim on story structure? So goes this Broadway season.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: For richer, but surely not for poorer (2) Sir, Your readers would do well to compare the naive complacency of Michael Prowse's article (April 5) with a much more realistic analysis of what has actually happened in America to jobs and security in an article Why fascism is the wave of the future, by Edward Luttwak (London Review of Books, April 7). The writer is director of geo-economics at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Luttwak's prognosis for the US and European economies is grim, especially in the growing insecurity over jobs. He says: 'Thus neither the moderate right nor the moderate left even recognises, let alone offers any solution for the central problem of our days: the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working people, from industrial workers and white-collar clerks to medium-high managers.' Instead of the all too easy jibes at the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Prowse should take on board Edward Luttwak's analysis and try and suggest a solution.

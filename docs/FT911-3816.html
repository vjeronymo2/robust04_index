			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: High margins lift Mobil 78% in first quarter UNUSUALLY high refining margins in Europe and the Pacific Rim helped boost Mobil Corp's first-quarter earnings by 78 per cent. North America's second biggest integrated oil company lifted net earnings to Dollars 710m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, from Dollars 400m, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. The 1990 figure included a Dollars 28m tax charge from a prior period. Sales climbed by 10 per cent to Dollars 16.6bn. The improved earnings were due largely to the strong performance of several international businesses. Income from marketing and refining soared four-fold to Dollars 442m, with non-US operations contributing Dollars 342m, compared with Dollars 81m a year earlier. Mobil ascribed the wide international refining margins to a shortage of capacity. Earnings were especially strong in Singapore and in Australia, where Mobil has acquired Exxon's refining and marketing operations. Natural gas output outside the US rose to record levels, due partly to the cold winter in Europe. On the other hand, North American exploration and production earnings were hit by the unremitting fall in natural gas prices caused by warm weather, weak demand and competition from alternative liquid fuels. Crude oil prices were about level with a year ago, but some Dollars 10 a barrel below the fourth-quarter average. Mr Allen Murray, the chairman, said that although refining margins have recently narrowed from the peaks earlier this year, 'they should continue to support good earnings, although below first-quarter levels'. He noted, however, that earnings from petrochemicals have recently come under pressure.</p>

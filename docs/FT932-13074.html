			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Dramatic passions - Malcolm Rutherford reviews 'Don't Fool with Love' UNLESS I have missed it, there is no English equivalent of Alfred de Musset's On ne badine pas avec l'amour. Here is real romantic drama, full of pulsating passions and pulsating breasts. The English might go in for that sort of thing in novels, but not on stage. Yet the great surprise of the Cheek by Jowl production at the Donmar Warehouse is that it works. Declan Donnellan's English version is not significantly different from an old, yellowing version I picked up in the local library, except in one respect. The earlier translation was called No Trifling with Love. Donnellan has switched to the sharper Don't Fool with Love. Thus he catches the mixture of the reckless and the imperative that is at the heart of the play. The piece is close to Musset's life. He was the lover of George Sand, who abandoned him first for his Italian doctor, then for Chopin. Rather like Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, the genders have been mixed up in the telling. There may a bit of George Sand in the heroine Camille, but there seems to be even more of her in the male lover Perdican. Anyway, what you have is an ultimately tragic affair between two capricious people. There is also a wholly innocent victim in the country girl Rosette whom Perdican woos when he is too proud to stick to Camille. It is Rosette who dies in the end. Donnellan directs himself. Not once does he go over the top. The lovers are young and fresh. They speak their lines as if they are feeling the emotions for the first time. Camille, played by Maria Miles, is only 18 and about to enter a nunnery. Inevitably she reminds one of Heloise in the famous story. What strikes most, however, is her commanding presence throughout. She, too, is proud. Perdican, played by Michael Sheen, is an experienced lover, but in the physical not the romantic sense of the term. At times Sheen fairly bubbles with enthusiasm and a sense of wonder that he can be experiencing such feelings, yet the pride never leaves him. Rosette kills herself (or maybe just dies) behind the altar while she hears him swearing his love to Camille in the oratory. The marriage will not take place. The romance is not all. There is some rather jolly knockabout in the chateau of Perdican's father, the baron. A drunken tutor and the local priest compete for baronial attention, a share of the wine and a place in the pecking order at table. That is the light relief. It contributes to a splendid whole. The baron is a thoroughly self-confident figure played by Colin McFarlane who plainly has no idea of the passions that are seething around him. Don't Fool with Love is performed on a plain round stage designed by Nick Ormerod. There are no accessories; none are needed. The set looks much bigger than it is, which is how it should be. Mistakenly, I think, the piece is preceded by The Blind Men, a 20 minute work by the Belgian writer Michel de Ghelderode (1898-1962). It concerns three blind men trying to walk from Flanders to Rome and going round in circles. There is no comment to make except that it is very well acted. Musset can stand on his own. Donmar Warehouse until May 15. (071) 867 1150</p>

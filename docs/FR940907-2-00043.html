The modification means that the M.A. Norden Company, Inc. may apply for a section 404 permit to discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States in order to construct an access road across the section 404(c) prohibited site. EPA concludes that these proposed activities will not result in unacceptable adverse effects under section 404(c).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The modification is effective August 29, 1994, upon signature of EPA's Assistant Administrator for Water.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Specific details are available from Paul Minkin (EPA) at (202) 260&hyph;1901. Copies of the modification are available through the EPA Wetlands Hotline at (800) 832&hyph;7828.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to prohibit or restrict the use of portions of waters of the United States for discharging dredged or fill material. In October, 1992, M.A. Norden Company, Inc. petitioned EPA to modify its 1984 section 404(c) Final Determination concerning the Norden site to enable it to construct a road across the site to access adjacent uplands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA announced Norden Company's request for modification of the Norden Final Determination and requested public comment in the May 13, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 25050). EPA formally notified the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters (Corps Headquarters) of the Norden Company petition and requested any comments on the Norden Company proposal. EPA also mailed copies of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice to other parties believed to be interested in the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received no comments from the public in response to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Corps Headquarters responded in a July 1, 1994, letter to EPA and indicated that they had no comment at this time so that they might maintain their ability to make an objective and independent decision on a permit application from Norden Company, should EPA modify their Final Determination. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alabama Field Office (FWS), submitted comments in a June 7, 1994, letter. While neither supporting nor objecting to reconsideration of the Final Determination, they indicated that there may be less environmentally damaging alternatives to the proposed road fill and that these alternatives should be fully explored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA carefully reviewed Norden Company's proposal, comments submitted by Corps Headquarters and FWS, and the existing Norden section 404(c) record. Based on this review, EPA concluded that environmental impacts associated with the proposed road construction would not result in unacceptable adverse effects to the Norden 404(c) area. In reaching this decision, EPA considered that the impacts of the current Norden Company proposal are significantly less than those of the original proposal which precipitated the section 404(c) action. The original Final Determination noted that the Norden site was a ``productive wetland, typical of the area, that contributes organic material to the fish and shellfish communities of the Mobile Bay estuary, provides valuable habitat for wildlife, and acts as a pollutant filtering mechanism which helps to reduce degradation of water quality in the adjacent open water system.'' The originally proposed 25 acres of impacts to waters of the United States have been reduced through the modification of the project so that approximately 1.5 acres will be impacted. In addition, the project will be constructed in such a way as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for downstream transport of detritus and continued connection to the Mobile Bay estuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Norden Company has made a prima facie showing that there are no practicable alternatives which are less environmentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damaging. Alternate routes which would avoid the wetlands do not seem to be practicable based on the information available. If the Final Determination is modified, the project must still go through the Corps' permit process, where the issue of practicable, less damaging alternatives will receive thorough investigation. Under the circumstances, the theoretical possibility of alternatives does not make the limited impacts of the revised project unacceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, EPA has concluded that it is appropriate to modify the original June 15, 1984, Final Determination to allow M.A. Norden Company, Inc. to seek authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States associated with the construction of the road described in the Norden Company's submissions to EPA on October 5, 1992, and August 5, 1993, and summarized above. Prior to any discharge activities, however, the project must be authorized pursuant to applicable permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert Perciasepe,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Administrator for Water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21999 Filed 9&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

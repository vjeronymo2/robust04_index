			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ibstock Johnsen Pounds 27.6m in the red - Despite signs of recovery no return to profitability is foreseen until 1994 IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, the UK's third largest brick maker, barely broke even a the trading level in the year to last December and said it was unlikely to return to profitability until 1994. But reinforcing reports that building activity is picking up in the UK, Mr Colin Hope, Ibstock Johnsen's chairman, said demand for bricks had risen sharply in the first three months of the year. Ibstock Johnsen was reporting operating profits before exceptional items of Pounds 382,000, down from Pounds 10.1m, on sales down 3 per cent at Pounds 277m. As forewarned, the group made a Pounds 28.6m exceptional provision to cover the cost of reorganisation, which will include the closure of four brick plants over the next 18 months. A profit of Pounds 10.6m became a loss of Pounds 27.6m at the pre-tax level. Losses per share came out at 9.89p, against earnings of 2.58p last time, and the group has cut its final dividend to 0.5p (3.75p), giving a total for the year of 1p, down from 6p. The brick industry had become only marginally profitable, according to Mr Ian Maclellan, managing director. The group would this year be focusing on generating cash by destocking, selling surplus assets and cutting capital expenditure. 'The provisions will be sufficient to get our businesses in the US and the UK back to a profitable position but we are, to some extent, delving in the unknown,' said Mr Hope. He said there would be little benefit until 1994. Trading in UK building products was hardest hit, with profits of Pounds 9.79m falling to Pounds 2.74m. In the US, a Pounds 683,000 loss grew to Pounds 1.64m and in continental Europe profits slipped from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.12m. The forest product trading loss also increased - from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 2.83m. Mr Hope said that at 'current world prices, the business is unlikely to be profitable in the short term'. The chairman said he was confident of the economic recovery in the UK but was less sure of the return to growth in the US. At the end of December, net debt rose to Pounds 45m and gearing climbed to 19 per cent - after a Pounds 15m write-down in the value of reserves to take account of the reduced value of clay reserves which will no longer be exploited after the imminent closures. COMMENT If recent estimates of the speed of recovery in house building are to be believed, six months' supply of bricks held in the UK could already be falling. Taken with the lower depreciation charge, after yesterday's asset write-downs, profits should start to come back for the group this year even if brick makers are not able to make price rises stick with the housebuilders. But Ibstock Johnsen has badly underperformed the sector because of recession in another of its markets - pulp. For that market to turn, further capacity will need to go, and that will take time. However, one advantage of recessions in each of its markets - house building, bricks and pulp - is that the bounce, when it comes, could be sharp. Investors should not, however, hold their breath. This year profits should be only marginally higher. In 1994, however, pre-tax profits could jump to Pounds 8.8m, or 2.8p of earnings.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Kabul battle brings death to civilians An artillery barrage and air raids swept opponents of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani from their last main position in Kabul yesterday, but the opposition retaliated with bombing strikes on a western city, writes Reuter from Kabul. Officials and hospitals reported at least 28 dead and more than 210 injured, most of them civilians, in two days of fierce battles in the capital, Kabul, and the western city of Herat. President Rabbani's fighters launched a relentless artillery and rocket bombardment on bases of ex-communist Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum on Tapae Maranjan mountain. Sporadic artillery fire continued to hit areas still controlled by Dostum and Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami forces on the southern and eastern outskirts. Dostum retaliated, and two jets from his bases in northern Afghanistan dropped eight bombs on the centre of Herat, 630 km west of Kabul. 'All targets and casualties were civilians,' a UN official said. Rabbani's government decided to launch its assault after reports that Hekmatyar and his allies were preparing a similar offensive in the run-up to the scheduled expiry of Rabbani's term in office tomorrow.</p>

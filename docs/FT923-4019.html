'I am better than I have been for five years,' Sir Ian told Observer. He stressed that ageism is illegal in the US. MacGregor's old pals in the City are puzzled why he keeps soldiering on. One merchant banker said that MacGregor's work ethic was a bit like the malaria bug. It never goes away. But Nicky Wilson, boss of the Scottish NUM, was less kind.

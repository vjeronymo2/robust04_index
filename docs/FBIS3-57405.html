			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] An extended meeting of the Lithuanian Procuracy  Collegium was held today. It discussed the legal situation in  Lithuania in 1993 and the Procuracy's future work. [passage  omitted]    Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas made some remarks  at  the meeting. In his opinion, the investigation in the cases of  corruption and in other cases which cause great anxiety to the  people are being excessively delayed and thus unnecessary  tension is preserved in society. [passage omitted] The  president urged the officials to take all the necessary steps  envisaged in the law to ensure that the cases of corruption and  other cases are not delayed.    The President again explained his motives for rejecting the  law on the declaration of income and property. According to  Algirdas Brazauskas, there are no doubts about the necessity of  such a law, but a system of its practical implementation should  be created. The president stressed that the law must defend the  interests of the state but not (?persecute) certain groups of  people. In the opinion of Algirdas Brazauskas, a corrected law  on the declaration of income and property should be implemented  in several stages. At the beginning, high-ranking officials  should be the first to declare their property -- the president,  members of the Seimas and government. In the future, all  residents of the country should declare their income.    Algirdas Brazauskas stressed the importance of cooperation  of  all law-and-order institutions in combating criminals and in  maintaining state law and order. [passage omitted]</p>

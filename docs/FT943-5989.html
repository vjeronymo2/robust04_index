			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Lib Dems set out plans on low pay A regional minimum wage and the introduction of a low-pay commission were yesterday proposed by the Liberal Democrats as options to bridge the gulf between the low paid and high wage earners. The package of proposals outlined in a discussion paper, Working for Change, will be put to the party's conference in Brighton next month. The two options are: Establishing a regional minimum hourly rate of pay across the whole economy; A low-pay commission to investigate any industrial sector or company in which it believed there was exploitation due to low pay. The commission would recommend solutions such as a minimum hourly rate in a particular sector or company. The party is also proposing converting social security benefits to the long-term unemployed into vouchers payable to employers taking them on.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINGERING SCENT;  </P> <P> OBSESSION ADS WERE VOTED MOST MEMORABLE.  </P> <P> Calvin Klein has come out smelling like a rose, again. At least his provocative  print advertising campaign for Obsession perfume sure has.  </P> <P> When 24,000 consumers were recently asked to name the most memorable print  advertisements of the past year, more of them remembered Calvin Klein's  sensuous ads than any others. It was the fourth year in a row that Calvin Klein  -- which also advertises underwear and jeans -- was ranked No. 1 in the annual  survey conducted by the New York research firm Video Storyboard Tests.  </P> <P> The Obsession campaign has long walked the fine line between artistic nudity  and pornography. Many of the ads show models nude or semi-nude, with portions  of their bodies hidden. Both male and female nudes appear in the ads -- often  in the same photograph. While some religious organizations have strongly  objected to the ads -- forcing several publications to pull them -- the  campaign has helped to make Calvin Klein one of the most familiar names in  fashion.  </P> <P> The No. 2 ranking went to Revlon, for print ads that featured celebrities such  as Liza Minelli and singer Debbie Gibson. The Marlboro man slipped slightly in  the saddle, to the No. 3 spot.  </P> <P> Calvin Klein finished far ahead of the rest of the pack. "Calvin Klein is one  of the few companies whose print advertising is actually more memorable than  its television advertising," said Dave Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard  and editor of the newsletter Commercial Break, which published the survey  results. "Keep in mind, Calvin Klein spends far less on print advertising than  anyone else in the top 10."  </P> <P> Indeed, Calvin Klein -- which designs its own ads -- spent a comparatively  paltry $4.4 million last year on print advertising compared to second-place  Revlon, which spent $49.8 million, and third-place Marlboro, which spent $88  million, according to the New York research firm LNA/Media Records.  </P> <P> So what does this say about the state of print advertising? "It says that sex  still sells," said Candace Port, managing editor of the trade publication  Inside Print. "There's a lot of talk out there about print ads getting back to  more of a family style, but the titillating approach still works."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, fashion magnate Calvin Klein refuses to discuss his ads. He declined  to comment through a company spokesman. "He feels that if he talks about our  advertising it can lose its effectiveness," said Paul Wilmot, senior vice  president of public relations at New York-based Calvin Klein Inc. "But I'll say  one thing: Calvin is not a proponent of scientific research. He simply goes  with what he likes."  </P> <P> And what he likes, the public apparently remembers, too. In the written survey  by Video Storyboard, one Tampa, Fla., respondent explained that he liked the  Obsession campaign because "it is erotic and poetic at the same time."  </P> <P> Calvin Klein aside, all is not poetic for print advertising these days.  Although $14.3 billion was spent on the medium last year, experts say that  growth has slowed in recent years. In February, the car maker Nissan stunned  print advertising executives when it announced that it was going to divert the  money it had planned to spend on print advertising to television commercials.  </P> <P> "Print is only worth using if you can segment your market," said Vadehra.  "Television can give you 20 million households. To reach that many in print,  you'd have a lot of waste, a lot of duplication, and you'd spend an incredible  amount of money."  </P> <P> Of course, some advertisers, such as cigarette makers, have little choice but  to use print. After all, they can't advertise on TV or radio. And perhaps one  of the most unusual print advertisements introduced in 1988 was the comic image  that Camel cigarettes gave its trademark camel "Old Joe," on the brand's 75th  anniversary. The company says that the cartoon-like "New Joe" was introduced to  improve sales in its key market, men ages 21 to 34. New Joe -- often placed in  swashbuckling situations, such as saving a woman from a sinking ship --  resembles the television character Alf.  </P> <P> Some opponents of smoking have criticized the camel's clear appeal to young  children, but R. J. Reynolds Tobacco insists that he is not for kids. "We took  extra pains in test-marketing to make sure that he appealed to adults, not  children," said Maura Payne, the company's manager of external communications.  </P> <P> Besides Camel, four other print advertisers broke into the top 10 last year --  Revlon, Estee Lauder, DeBeer's diamonds and the fragrance Elizabeth Taylor's  Passion. Vadehra said the Passion perfume prints ads are popular mostly because  Elizabeth Taylor appears in them. One consumer in Schenectady, N. Y., in  responding to the survey, said Elizabeth Taylor's looks alone are "worth the  price of the perfume."  </P> <P> Not everyone faired as well as Liz. Guess Jeans, for example, which was ranked  No. 5 in 1987, failed even to finish in the top 40 in the 1988 survey. A  spokesman for Guess refused to comment.  </P> <P> And the Marlboro Man, who was the nation's top-ranked print advertising image  for nearly 25 years, continues to slip slightly. Four years ago, Calvin Klein  replaced the Marlboro Man in the top slot. And in 1988, he also fell behind the  Revlon ad campaign. "I'd say it's an honor for any campaign to rank in the top  three for this long," said Steve Weiss, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A.,  the maker of Marlboro. "We expect to stay there well into the future."  </P> <P> Despite the billions of advertising dollars spent by liquor manufacturers, no  liquor campaign made the top 10 and only one made the top 50. Absolut, the  vodka maker that runs inventive print ads every year around Christmas time,  placed 45th among all print advertisers.  </P> <P> "One would have thought that with nowhere else to go but print, liquor  advertising would make a big splash," Vadehra said. "The truth, however, is  more sobering."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP 10 PRINT ADS OF 1988  </P> <P> Based on survey of 24,000 readers  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:1.56IN:3.10IN:3.76IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rank  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rank  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Brand  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Agency  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Spending  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Calvin Klein  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> CRK Advertising  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4.4 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revlon  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 50th Floor Workshop;  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49.8 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> HHCC;Y&amp;R  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marlboro  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Leo Burnett  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 88.0 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Maybelline  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> DDB Needham  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.3 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  *  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Camel  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> McCann Erickson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.5 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> J.

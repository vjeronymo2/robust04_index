			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Taxman says there are dogs and dogs Household dogs must continue to pay value added tax on their food, but greyhounds can now get their nourishment tax-free, Customs &amp; Excise said yesterday. The department has laid down strict guidelines which will allow greyhound owners to buy feed specifically designed for racing dogs free of VAT. The decision follows a ruling by the VAT Tribunal which rejected Customs' argument that greyhound feed should be treated in the same way as pet food and be subject to VAT at the standard rate. Customs has now agreed that greyhound feed - like most food for humans  - will be zero-rated because greyhounds are working animals. However, to qualify it must be 'a complete feed providing all the required elements for a balanced diet for a dog'. The same circular from Customs yesterday made a number of related rulings on animals and VAT, some of them surprisingly exotic. Purchase of ostriches, which was previously VAT-free, will now be standard-rated. Customs said it maintained its position that while grass seed is zero-rated because it is used as animal feed, pre-germinated seeds were designed for commercial purposes and should be subject to VAT. However, it said that because pre-germinated grass seed was widely zero-rated within the industry at present, it would allow the practice of exemption to continue 'for the time being'.</p>

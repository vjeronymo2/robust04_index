			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: TRENDY GRILL ON THE PARK  TAKES CARE WITH ITS CUISINE;  </P> <P> * THE GRILL ON THE PARK, 901 FIFTH AVE., SAN DIEGO, 231-0055. LUNCH AND DINNER  DAILY. CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED. DINNER FOR TWO, INCLUDING A GLASS OF WINE EACH,  TAX AND TIP, ABOUT $35 TO $70  </P> <P> It is said that a new broom sweeps clean. At the restaurant space in the Horton  Park Plaza Hotel, the new broom wielded by The Grill on the Park has quite  nearly obliterated any evidence of its predecessor, the Fifth Avenue Bistro.  </P> <P> The owners of the landmark building at Fifth Avenue and E Street, built early  in this century as the city's first skyscraper, expended a considerable sum in  restoring the period elegance of the two-story banking hall. Their mistake was  to install an uninspired menu and a so-so kitchen staff, with the result that  the Bistro survived less than two years.  </P> <P> All new. All beautiful. All gone. The extravagance of the restaurant industry  sometimes takes your breath away.  </P> <P> In the summer of 1989, Colorado restaurateurs Howard and Barbara Gunther and  Stephanie and Michael Dietrich leased this Gaslamp Quarter space for a  companion restaurant to their Aspen eatery, which is called The Inn on the  Park.  </P> <P> Out went the elaborate, costly draperies that hung the length of the two-story  windows. The original mosaic tile floor has been replaced by a new floor of  patterned wood. The bar at the entry was yanked out and replaced by a gleaming  exhibition kitchen; the new bar is on the mezzanine, which, just as in the days  of the Bistro, is where you want to sit.  </P> <P> The mezzanine, although redecorated, retains a certain sense of sophistication,  while the harshly redone ground floor room has all the charm of a school  cafeteria.  </P> <P> The Grill on the Park attempts a rather sleek, ultra-contemporary appearance.  The success of this is, at best, mixed. But there is a sort of hilarious appeal  to the waiters' black uniforms, which are brightened by multihued neckties of a  pattern so wild that they seem salvaged from the psychedelic '60s.  </P> <P> The menu definitely is contemporary, which is to say that it offers currently  popular categories of foods -- pizzas, pastas, grilled fish, fowl and meats --  and emphasizes sharp, definite flavors. It is an agreeable menu, if not  particularly innovative, and the kitchen generally turns in an excellent  performance.  </P> <P> Much homage is paid to trendiness. The very first listing seems a sort of  nouvelle-California-Creole-Southwest cuisine combination, and you can't get  much trendier than a stew of those mixed styles -- in this case a spicy black  bean soup filled out with smoked pork and New Orleans-style andouille sausage.  For that final gesture that adds a little je ne sais quoi of novelty, a  spoonful of cilantro-spiked sour cream garnishes the soup.  </P> <P> The proprietors, evidently accustomed to satisfying appetites honed on the  Aspen ski slopes, serve portions considerably larger than the San Diego norm.  This makes the thought of a starter questionable -- the entrees really are  enormous -- but one that works well on a shared basis is the fried onion loaf.  This rectangular block of batter-crisped rings is served, a la Tony Roma's rib  restaurants, with a pitcher of barbecue sauce, and is equally happy as an  auxiliary vegetable with the entrees.  </P> <P> Among other choices are tempura-fried zucchini slices with what the menu calls  "buttermilk herb dipping sauce" (in its ingredients, this sounds suspiciously  like "ranch" dressing); deviled lamb ribs with jalapeno pepper jelly; a skewer  of mesquite-grilled steak chunks and shrimp served with a spicy, Thai-style  peanut sauce, and Southwestern-nouvelle style crab cakes crusted with blue  cornmeal and dressed with a chili-corn butter sauce.  </P> <P> The display kitchen includes the requisite wood-burning oven, and the pizzas  that emerge from it are, in fact, quite superior -- the thin, finely textured  crusts delicious with their seasoning of olive oil and mixed fresh herbs. The  choice includes a pie topped with barbecued chicken and cilantro, and a  Mexican-style version with rock shrimp, salsa, sour cream and avocado, but the  most elegant is the pizza dressed with roasted garlic puree, goat cheese and  sun-dried tomatoes. This combination may be this era's culinary equivalent of  the pet rock, but it is undeniably irresistible.  </P> <P> The pasta list is somewhat more restrained (there is, however, angel hair pasta  with something called "Cajun chicken"), and the likeliest sounding choice might  be the lasagna stuffed with Maine lobster, cheese, mushrooms and spinach.  </P> <P> The kitchen does seem to take great care with the cooking of the entrees. One  fish special, a filet of Norwegian salmon, was bedded on sauteed spinach,  crusted with four types of peppercorns and sauced with a pale puree of yellow  tomatoes and roasted garlic. It showed considerable imagination and had been  treated with finesse; the beautifully moist fish flaked at the merest nudge of  the fork.  </P> <P> The herbed, roasted chicken seemed almost to crackle on the plate, its skin a  dark shade that promised a fine, crisp finish; the flesh, meanwhile, remained  nicely juicy. A whole bird was served, not an enormous specimen but still  sufficient for two diners, although it was served for just one; half of it went  home for later consumption.  </P> <P> The barbecued baby back ribs (listed by the menu as "famous") were good, if  unexceptional, a comment that also could be made about the grilled, center-cut  pork chops in a mustard-horseradish sauce. Other entree choices include a  Yucatan-style chicken breast marinated in spiced fruit juices; a 1-pound veal  chop and a simple New York sirloin with sauteed mushrooms. All of these are  accompanied by a hillock of the day's vegetable (on one occasion, quite  respectable green beans amandine) and a choice of sliced tomatoes, french fries  or the city's largest stuffed baked potatoes. These spuds are creamy and  well-seasoned, but utterly daunting in size.  </P> <P> Perhaps because of the menu's generally spicy tone, the dessert list takes a  very basic approach and limits itself to sundaes, a fruit plate and a low-slung  creme brulee garnished with a side of mixed berries.  </P></p>

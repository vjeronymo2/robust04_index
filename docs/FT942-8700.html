			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fall in prep boarders due to parental preference Sir, While John Authers is correct that cost is a major factor in the decline in numbers of boarders at independent schools, reported by ISIS last month ('Sums don't add up', May 13), another equally important factor is the increasing reluctance of parents to send their children (particularly in the seven-to-13 age group) to boarding schools. This accounts for the small rise in day pupils and the large drop in boarder numbers revealed by the ISIS report. Furthermore, there is a shortage, certainly in London, of independent day schools with good facilities. The small increase in day pupils may therefore be a function of supply rather than lack of demand. A drop in fees by boarding preparatory schools and a substantial improvement in the economy will then not halt the decline in the number of children attending boarding preparatory schools.

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Sound of music in the City THOSE who either live or work in the city might like to know that a large new shop entirely devoted to selling serious, high-quality music recordings has just opened. Music lovers who regularly visit the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank will probably already have come across Farringdons shops in the Festival Hall. Farringdon's also has branches in High Holborn and one in Cheapside which is closing down and has already stopped selling classical music. The City shop is its latest venture. Now that quaffing champagne in the lunch-hour is seriously demode (let alone too expensive) the ardent music-lover, of which the City seems to have an extremely large number, will be able to spend a more sober, less- fattening, lunch-hour listening to music in one or other of the store's 'listening posts'. Besides the recordings of classical music, Farringdons Records will be organising a whole host of music-related activities. This week there was Julian Lloyd-Webber in conversation with music critic Andrew Stewart. On Thursday 19th November Franz Welser-Most will talk with Martin Kettle of The Guardian. Other lunch-times will feature music played by students from the Guildhall School of Music. The new store is at 64-72 Leadenhall Market, London EC3V 1LT.</p>

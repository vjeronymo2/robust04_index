			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CLEMENS SUSPENDED FOR 5 GAMES IN '91;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: AMERICAN LEAGUE PENALIZES THE RED SOX PITCHER FOR HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE  PLAYOFFS. HE ALSO IS FINED $10,000.  </P> <P> Roger Clemens was suspended for the first five games of next season and fined  $10,000 today for behavior which led to the Boston pitcher's ejection from the  last game of the American League playoffs.  </P> <P> The penalty announced by AL President Bobby Brown will force the Red Sox star  to miss one start.  </P> <P> It comes a week after he earned a $125,000 bonus provided in his contract for  finishing second in the AL Cy Young Award voting.  </P> <P> Although Clemens can appeal, Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said: "Dr.  Brown's statement and subsequent fine and suspension of Roger Clemens speaks  for itself. Although we are not in agreement with the severity of the league's  action, we are satisfied that the issue has been addressed."  </P> <P> Clemens was ejected by plate umpire Terry Cooney in the second inning of  Oakland's 3-1 victory that completed the A's four-game sweep Oct. 10.  </P> <P> In his announcement, Brown cited Clemens for making "significant physical  contact with an umpire (Jim Evans), for threatening umpire Cooney, for verbally  abusing umpire Cooney with personal obscenities and for not leaving the dugout  immediately after the ejection."  </P> <P> Clemens was not immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> Last season, Clemens led the league for the second time in earned-run average  with a 1.93 mark. He was 21-6.  </P> <P> The altercation occurred after Clemens walked Willie Randolph. Cooney and  Clemens got into a shouting match, and Clemens, trying to get closer to Cooney,  bumped Evans.  </P> <P> Clemens at the time denied directing any profanity at Cooney, but Oakland  pitcher Dave Stewart said he had done exactly that.  </P></p>

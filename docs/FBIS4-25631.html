			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Having been affected by the Chientao [Qiandao] Lake  incident, the follow-up consultations between the private  intermediary organs of Taiwan and the mainland and high-level  talks between the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF) and the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS) have  been postponed. However, to demonstrate the basic stand of  fulfilling relevant agreements and to hold consultations as soon  as possible to resolve various issues arising from exchanges  between the two sides of the strait, senior officials of the SEF  and the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] recently decided that  following the holding of a mainland affairs work conference in  July and after coordinating the resumption of the follow-up  working-level consultations, the SEF would be authorized to  invite the mainland's Tang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei], executive vice  chairman of the ARATS, to visit Taiwan for the second round of  the Chiao [Jen-ho]-Tang talks.    As for the specific date for the second round of the  Chiao-Tang talks, Kao Kung-lien, spokesman for and vice chairman  of the MAC, and Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary  general of the SEF, said recently in separate statements that  the second Chiao-Tang talks could take place in August.    There is great concern, however, on whether the MAC will  still persist in adopting a set of interlocking stratagems in  authorizing the SEF to invite Tang Shu-pei to Taiwan for the  second round of Chiao-Tang talks according to the relevant  stipulations. In particular, the success or failure of the  upcoming talks and whether the two sides can establish a common  understanding will directly affect the plan for whether the  second round of the Ku-Wang [Ku Chen-fu-Wang Daohan] talks can  take place this year.</p>

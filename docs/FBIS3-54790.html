The last two years were not  simple for our people. During this period we have experienced  such events that will not be forgotten by the people for a long  time. The past year, despite economic difficulties, has firmly  established the position of peace in the republic and allowed  the safeguarding of the integrity of our Motherland and the  restoral of law and order.    Our people began peaceful constructive labor, tackling the  issues of industrial production. Unfortunately, so far we have  many difficult problems, similar to those that all of the  peoples of the former Soviet Union are currently facing.    All of us feel for ourselves the consequences of breaking  the  economic ties between the states of the former Soviet Union  republics. Prices of food, consumer goods, and fuel have  sharply risen. The financial system is in crisis. I have felt  the pain of the people during numerous meetings with the workers  of the different branches of the national economy, war and labor  veterans, and intellectuals.    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the government of  the  republic have been persistently looking for ways to resolve  these problems in the course of 1993. It was not (?easy) and  that is for a number of objective reasons. The leadership of  the republic has inherited a ruined economy after the 16th  session of the Supreme Soviet. The 18th session of the Supreme  Soviet, which was convened recently, has adopted a number of  laws and decisions that are laying a firm foundation in the  development of our national economy.    Next year we intend to change the basic principles of our  policy. We intend to direct the main force to [word indistinct]  construction of agriculture and other branches connected with  the well-being of the people.    In the new year we will undertake a number of measures to  promote the stabilization of the situation in connection with  ensuring the rights of citizens. We will carry on a ruthless  struggle against speculators, criminals, and mafia groups.    The other problem is the repatriation of refugees. We will  do everything to bring home those compatriots who had to flee  the republic. In the course of the visit of Mr. Borhanoddin  Rabbani, the head of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, to our  republic, along with the solution of other important problems,  we have concluded an agreement on refugees together with the  representatives of the Commissioner of the United Nations.    Dear compatriots, my big wish in the new year is that all  citizens of free Tajikistan will be busy in working hand in hand  to improve services and utilities in the Motherland and to treat  each other kindly. The draft of the new constitution of the  republic will be submitted to the public referendum no later  than 1994 to provide an opportunity to the people to determine  the kind of future -- presidential or parliament. The election  of the new parliament and the head of state will take place in  autumn. Let the people elect freely the form of the government  and its head.    Dear compatriots, all our achievements and the authority of  the republic is the result of the friendship and merit of those  peoples who are living in Tajikistan. During the difficult days  of the past year, the Russians, Uzbeks, Kyrgyzs, Turkmens, and  the representatives of other peoples selflessly worked together  with their Tajik brothers and sisters to restore the economy and  [word indistinct] of the Motherland.    The fraternity and friendship of the peoples of Tajikistan  is  the foundation of the young sovereign state of Tajikistan on  which we will build the future. The international spirit of the  Tajik people was also displayed in that during the comparatively  short historical period of time it was recognized [words  indistinct] countries. On the eve of the new year I would like  to express sincere gratitude to (?United Nations) organizations  and heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States for their  disinterested assistance and support.    Sovereign Tajikistan must go through a new stage of  development in the new year. In connection with this, I  confidently address the people who have great experience -- war  and labor veterans, peaceful women, careful mothers, and  glorious youth -- let us in the new year, shoulder to shoulder,  by joint efforts take our republic out of the difficult social  and economic situation.    Popular wisdom says that when there is an order and mutual  respect in the family then one can achieve all kinds of success.  Let the new year of 1994 be for all of us a year of well-being,  happiness, peace, and prosperity.</p>

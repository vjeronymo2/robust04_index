			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Leonid Kravchuk was on the election trail in  Odessa.    [Correspondent Sergey Barabanov] Ten days are left before  the  Ukrainian presidential elections. Observers note a significant  growth in the popularity of the current President Leonid  Kravchuk. During his one-day visit to Odessa today, he paid most  attention to the economy problem, but also dwelt in some detail  on the prospects for the political integration of CIS countries.    [Begin Kravchuk recording] Yes, the time will come, yes,  there will be integration, yes, there may be political elements  in the integration. But if this is begun today, then it would  strain the situation to the limit -- both in Russia and outside  Russia. I think that certain gentlemen are making haste in  putting forward new formulas today. We have to use the  potential of the CIS. [end recording]    [Barabanov] As is well-known, Kravchuk's main opponent,  Leonid Kuchma, holds a different opinion on that point. What  the people of Ukraine think we will find out on 26 June.</p>

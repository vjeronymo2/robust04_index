			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL HEAT RISING IN 3RD, 7TH DISTRICTS;  </P> <P> CHALLENGERS PIN HOPES ON FORCING CITY COUNCIL VETERANS INTO RUNOFFS  </P> <P> Al Dib is a 55-year-old father of eight who sold his produce business and put  $11,000 of his own money into his campaign to unseat veteran Los Angeles City  Councilman Ernani Bernardi.  </P> <P> "Believe me, I would never have run again if I didn't think I had a chance of  winning," said Dib, who is making his fourth try for political office. He  pledges that, if elected, he will drive around the San Fernando Valley's 7th  District, assisting police in capturing drug dealers.  </P> <P> Paul M. McKellips, a political newcomer opposing City Councilwoman Joy Picus,  recently met privately with the 12-year incumbent.  </P> <P> "I had never met her," he said. "I told her my biggest reason for running is I  don't think any public official should stay in office for more than eight  years. She seemed to understand my position. She was very friendly."  </P> <P> Dib and McKellips are among 11 active challengers to Bernardi and Picus in the  most competitive Valley races leading up to the April 11 municipal election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Braude Unopposed  </P> <P> Councilmen Mike Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky, whose Westside districts were extended  into the Valley in the 1986 realignment of council district boundaries, are  favored to win reelection. Councilman Marvin Braude, who also represents part  of the Valley, is unopposed.  </P> <P> Candidates gained a spot on the ballot by collecting the signatures of 500  voters and paying a $300 filing fee or, to avoid paying the fee, gathering  1,000 signatures.  </P> <P> So far, the contests have been relatively quiet. But the pace is expected to  pick up considerably as a barrage of campaign mailers begin hitting homes.  </P> <P> In the hottest Valley race, Bernardi faces six active challengers. They contend  that the 77-year-old lawmaker is not well-known to voters in his largely new  district, carved out by the City Council in the 1986 reapportionment.  </P> <P> The district takes in Arleta, Pacoima and Sylmar and parts of Lake View  Terrace, Mission Hills, Panorama City, Sepulveda, North Hollywood, Sun Valley  and Van Nuys.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Want to Force Runoff  </P> <P> The challengers hope to pull in enough votes to force the 28-year incumbent  into a runoff. A candidate must get more than 50% of the vote to win the April  election. Otherwise, the top two vote-getters will meet in June.  </P> <P> Lyle Hall, a 49-year-old Los Angeles firefighter and former president of the  firefighters union, appears to be Bernardi's most formidable opponent. He is  supported by organized labor in a district with substantial union membership.  </P> <P> Other candidates are Jules S. Bagneris III, 28, president of the Lake View  Terrace Home Owners Assn.; Irene Tovar, 50, former head of the Hispanic Caucus  of the state Democratic Party; Dib, past president of the Arleta Chamber of  Commerce; Barry Gribs, 50, a drug therapy intern, and James Braun, 29, office  manager for a construction company. Richard Yanez withdrew from the race and  endorsed Hall, but his name will still appear on the ballot.  </P> <P> Hall has attacked Bernardi for missing 29 of 135 council meetings between Feb.  1, 1988, and Jan. 31, 1989, to tie for the worst attendance record. Bernardi  was afflicted with a virus and was hospitalized after falling and hitting his  head. His wife was also ill, causing him to miss additional meetings.  </P> <P> "Ernie has been on the City Council for 28 years and, during the last 18  months, his illnesses have made him a part-time councilman," Hall said in a  campaign mailer sent to voters last week. "We need a councilman who will work  full time for all of us." Bernardi replied that he is fully recovered and has  resumed his busy schedule.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drug Center Backed  </P> <P> Hall supports opening of the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation in  Lake View Terrace. The proposed facility is opposed by Bernardi and many of the  area's residents who fear that it will bring crime to the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Bagneris, who was 8 months old when Bernardi was first elected in 1961,  contends that the district needs a younger, more energetic councilman with  fresh ideas. His name is pronounced Bon-er-eese, but even Bagneris has begun  calling himself Bag-ner-is during the campaign because everyone else does. "Why  fight?" he sighed.  </P> <P> Bagneris, the son of a politically active minister from Pacoima, said he  decided to run for office after attending a rally for 1968 presidential  candidate Hubert H. Humphrey. He said Humphrey was seated next to him in a  church pew and when the vice president got up to speak, he mentioned the  7-year-old Bagneris by name.  </P> <P> "My eyes lit up," Bagneris said. "It was then that I decided that I wanted to  go into politics because politicians wanted to help people and they could make  a difference."  </P> <P> Bagneris, who is also a minister but works as a stockbroker, has preached that  Bernardi exhibits a "lack of leadership, timidity, powerlessness that is not  going to address our needs." He also says the councilman has been unable to  close the Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace. Nearby homeowners  complain about noise, odor and traffic congestion from the dump.  </P> <P> "The residents around Mission Canyon Landfill had an effective and vociferous  voice in the City Council, and they were able to close down that dump,"  Bagneris said, referring to a now-closed dump in Sepulveda Pass. "If we had  such a voice in the City Council, we would be able to do the same thing."  </P> <P> Bagneris has also blamed Bernardi for the poor condition of the 1,437-acre  Hansen Dam recreation area, site of a once-popular lake that is now a stagnant  pond.  </P> <P> "I see no reason why the residents of the 7th District should not be able to  enjoy the same type of quality facilities as those enjoyed by the residents of  the area surrounding the Sepulveda Basin" in Encino.  </P> <P> Bernardi replied: "Challengers have a knack of making everything seem so simple  and easy to resolve."  </P> <P> On Lopez Canyon, Bernardi said he has sought to open landfills in other areas  of the city but has been unsuccessful because of opposition from other council  members who do not want the political headache of dumps in their districts. On  Hansen Dam, Bernardi said the city is working on a plan to improve the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little League Team  </P> <P> Dib said he deserves to be elected because of his years of community service,  ranging from donating food to poor families in Pacoima to sponsoring a Little  League team in Sylmar.  </P> <P> "I paid my dues in the area," he said.  </P> <P> "Do you think your quality of life is as good as it is in Sherman Oaks, in  Northridge, in Encino?" Dib asked at a recent candidates forum. "If you do, you  should reelect Ernani Bernardi." Dib has promised, if elected, to push for  building a monorail line from Sylmar to downtown.  </P> <P> Tovar said she decided to run because Bernardi opposed the redistricting.  </P> <P> "He has never really wanted to represent this district," she said. Bernardi  said he merely opposed the political maneuvering that led to the remapping.  </P> <P> Tovar has advocated reassigning more police from lower-crime areas to the  northeast Valley. "Don't be deceived," she said. "We can have more police  without more taxes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Makes It Even Worse'  </P> <P> Gribs has said at candidate forums that throwing gang members in jail is not  the way to reduce crime.  </P> <P> "These gang members are from dysfunctional, alcoholic families," he said. "The  first thing you do when you arrest these gang members and put them in jail is  reinforce the feelings that they are not worthy of anything, that they are no  good. . . . This makes it even worse.  </P> <P> "What I propose is that we build or change the jails into locked treatment  centers where we could keep them secure but treat them in a more loving,  positive way. This would build their self-esteem." He supports opening of the  Nancy Reagan Center.  </P> <P> Braun has pledged that, if elected, he would seek a halt to all building in the  district until new development plans can be prepared for each community.  </P> <P> He has contended that Bernardi has become ineffective. "He has been a maverick  for so long now" that he cannot obtain the support of his colleagues for  programs that benefit the district, Braun said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3rd District Challengers  </P> <P> In the West Valley's 3rd District, Picus, 58, faces five challengers led by  Peter Ireland, 43, an aide to County Supervisor Deane Dana, and Jeanne Nemo,  60, a Republican activist backed by County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. The  others are Morton Diamond, 57, a hot dog vendor; McKellips, 30, a businessman,  and Ron Rich, 40, an auto dealer.  </P> <P> The district extends roughly from Balboa Boulevard to the western city limits  between Roscoe Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway. It includes Canoga Park,  Reseda, Tarzana, Warner Center, West Hills, Woodland Hills and west Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Ireland works for a pro-development supervisor. But he has campaigned on a  slow-growth platform.  </P> <P> "In the four years I have lived in my neighborhood, I have seen it get  dramatically worse," he said.  </P> <P> "We've got to pull back and take a strong, hard look at what the planning  options are before we allow more to take place," he said. He advocates a halt  to construction of any new large apartment and condominium complexes in  single-family residential neighborhoods until development plans for each  community can be reviewed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Scale Back Warner Center'  </P> <P> "I'm afraid we're going to have to scale back Warner Center," he added.  </P> <P> Picus responded: "We, in the West Valley, enjoy one of the lowest growth rates  in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Ireland opposes a Picus-backed study of building of a light-rail line along  Chandler and Victory boulevards. Instead, he favors construction of a  light-rail line along Southern Pacific railroad tracks running diagonally  across the Valley from Burbank to Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Ireland is also against development of an arts park in the Sepulveda Basin.  Picus supports the proposal.  </P> <P> Nemo, a former teacher who sells real estate, ran against Picus in 1985 and  finished second in a field of five with 21% of the vote. Picus won with 56%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lack of Leadership'  </P> <P> Nemo has accused Picus of "a total lack of leadership on any major issue" and  said she flip-flops on development issues, "depending on what group she is  talking to at the moment."  </P> <P> Nemo supports construction of a rail line on or along the Ventura Freeway. She  said she would consider establishing a rubbish collection fee on single-family  homes to raise money for additional police.  </P> <P> "We are about the only major city that subsidizes trash collection," she said.  "I think it is time that we started charging for that if that is the only way  we can raise money to hire sufficient number of police."  </P> <P> Picus supports a plan to increase the police force from the 7,677 officers to  10,000 by 1993, but has not proposed a way to pay for the additional officers.  However, she said she would need to "look at all the options" before  considering a rubbish-collection charge.  </P> <P> Nemo supports development of an arts park in the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Care for Homeless  </P> <P> McKellips has made caring for the homeless a major theme of his campaign.  </P> <P> "I lived on the streets of Skid Row for two days," he said. "And I guarantee  you there's not adequate housing."  </P> <P> "We need to stop all development for a year," McKellips said. However, he said  he supports the controversial office development proposed for the Warner Ridge,  a hilly, 22-acre site at the eastern edge of Woodland Hills, because planning  for the project has been under way for a long time.  </P> <P> "I'd rather have 3,000 jobs on those 22 acres rather than 15 to 20 $800,000  homes overlooking warehouse rooftops and air-conditioning units," he said.  Picus said she favors construction of single-family homes on the property.  </P> <P> McKellips supports the Chandler-Victory route for a light-rail line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Failed to Settle Problem  </P> <P> Rich said he decided to oppose Picus after the councilwoman failed to settle a  problem that he was having with the Department of Water and Power.  </P> <P> "I went into her office in downtown Los Angeles and they told me they were  still looking at it," he said. "As I was walking down the hall, I bumped into  someone and told him about my problem." The someone was Councilman Richard  Alatorre, who resolved the problem in 48 hours, Rich said. Alatorre, however,  has endorsed Picus.  </P> <P> "I really wasn't going to run," Rich said. "My wife said, 'If you think you can  make some changes, just do it.' "  </P> <P> Asked how his position on light rail differs from Picus', Rich said: "If she is  supporting it, I'm not." He supports the use of diamond lanes on freeways, but  only if new lanes are built.  </P> <P> Rich also supports the Warner Ridge office development, conceding that "I'll  probably lose a lot of votes" as a result.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arts Tax Criticized  </P> <P> Rich said he doesn't oppose building of an arts park in the Sepulveda Basin as  long as no public money is spent. He criticized the City Council for approving  a 1% tax on private development to pay for the arts.  </P> <P> "You got crime and gangs and everything, and here they are worried about arts,"  Rich said. "They don't have their priorities straight."  </P> <P> Diamond said he decided to run after listening to his customers complain as  they bought hot dogs.  </P> <P> "You get to learn a lot selling hot dogs on the street listening to people," he  said.  </P> <P> Diamond said he opposes building of a light-rail line or a subway anywhere in  earthquake-prone Los Angeles. "What we need are mini-buses running throughout  the Valley." He said that if elected, he would push for free bus service for  senior citizens.  </P> <P> "All my funds come from people on the street," he said. "I'm not supported by  any developers."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Amy Pyle contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BERNARDI'S OPPONENTS JULES S.

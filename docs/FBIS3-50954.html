On 6 January he met with leaders from the  Union of Railroad Workers of the Republic of Mexico [STFRM] and  told them that economic competitiveness, improved trade  procedures, and increasingly efficient services would be  inconceivable without the railroad industry. He emphasized that  the railroad sector must play a very important role in  turn-of-the-century Mexico. Colosio pledged to promote a new  phase of regional development in Mexico in which the railroad  will be fundamental.    The presidential candidate asserted that Mexico will become  stronger as its regions become more closely integrated, thereby  increasing and improving trade. Colosio described the railroad  workers as heirs of the tradition, effort, and tenacity to  promote Mexico's growth.    The STFRM's national leader Antonio Castellanos Tovar spoke  on the union's behalf.</p>

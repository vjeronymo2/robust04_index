			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (11): House calls may end - Meter men become an endangered species ELECTRONIC meters combined with modern communications technology could transform the relationship between electricity suppliers and their customers. Two-way communications enable the supplier to read the meter remotely whenever it wants, without needing to visit the premises. And more significantly, they enable the consumer automatically to buy electricity from competing suppliers at the most advantageous price. The UK electricity industry and meter manufacturers have been experimenting with remote meter reading on a relatively small scale for more than 10 years. But there was no impetus to introduce the technology nationwide - until last January when Offer, the Office of Electricity Regulation, published a consultation paper on electronic metering. It says the industry should have 'a framework of modern metering and communications' in place by 1998, the date by which the UK's 22m households will be free to choose between alternative suppliers. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, has become an enthusiastic advocate of modern metering, in the face of widespread doubt and scepticism inside the industry. The electricity companies are frightened by the cost of giving every home an electronic meter and communications links, estimated at well over Pounds 1bn. They doubt whether many domestic consumers actually want such sophisticated service. And they fear confusion if incompatible systems are set up, using different methods of communication. However the companies know that in the face of the regulator's enthusiasm, they have to respond positively to the Offer paper. The Electricity Association is expected to submit a response on behalf of the industry next month. Three alternative ways of communicating between electronic meter and electricity supplier have been developed: Radio signalling is already used on a large scale in the UK as a one-way communication system to households on the Economy 7 tariff. The electricity companies send coded messages via BBC long-wave broadcasts to small receivers fitted beside the meters. The signals (which are inaudible on an ordinary radio set) activate switches to alter the tariff on a multi-rate meter or turn selected appliances such as electric heaters on and off. This system cannot be used for remote meter reading or two-way communications. However mobile radio systems have been developed in the US to read meters: vans equipped with short-range transmitters and receivers tour the streets, sending signals to nearby houses; the signals activate a transmitter in the meter, which sends its reading in code back to the van. Telephone is the simplest technology for communicating between consumer and supplier. Equipment is available to connect an electronic meter to the household phone line. The electricity supplier can then interrogate the meter automatically to receive a reading or change the tariff. But disagreements between telephone companies and the electricity utilities over pricing and technical arrangements have delayed the introduction of telephone-based meter communications in the US and UK. Mains-borne signalling sends messages down the electricity mains themselves. Its supreme advantage from the industry's point of view is that it uses its own infrastructure and does not depend on telephone companies or broadcasters. The problem is that the flow of electricity creates such a lot of interference, particularly at peak periods, that the signals may fail to get through. However Thorn EMI in the UK and General Electric in the US have committed considerable technical resources to make mains-borne signalling more reliable. As the Offer paper on metering points out, 'it is unlikely to be economic for one customer to choose a mains-borne signalling system and a neighbouring customer a radio teleswitch system'. In practice, the regional electricity companies will have to choose the technology for each area. But that does not mean the whole country need choose the same system, Offer says. 'One system may be more suited to more or less densely populated areas and in the longer term some comparison between systems will be helpful.'</p>

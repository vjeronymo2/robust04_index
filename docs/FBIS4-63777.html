			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has taken the  decision to strip journalists from the Ostankino Television and  Radio Company working on Ukrainian territory of their  accreditation. The ministry accuses these journalists of  provocative reporting of events in Odessa, Crimea, and also  eastern Ukraine. Evidently, according to their logic,  everything has started because of journalists and has nothing to  do with politicians.</p>

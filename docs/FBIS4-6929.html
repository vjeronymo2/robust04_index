			<p>CSO     [Text] The domestic market for batteries is expected to  reach 480 billion yen in fiscal year 1993, including 200 billion  yen for nonrechargeable batteries and 280 billion yen for  rechargeable batteries inclusive of automotive batteries. Future  demand for rechargeable batteries is expected to grow 2.5-fold  by the early 2000's to an annual sales rate of 700 billion yen  primarily because of lithium ion batteries to be shipped to  information communications markets.    According to Sanyo Electric, the reason why the electrical  equipment makers have positioned lithium ion batteries as "equal  to a second liquid-crystal device" and have launched full-scale  mass production is not only that growth in sales is expected,  but because such batteries are a key device in controlling the  operation of portable computer terminals playing a critical role  in multimedia systems. Already, advances have been made in the  miniaturization, reduction in weight and adaptation of cordless  versions of electrical equipment such as cellular phones, and  the usable time in settings such as outdoors before recharge of  such batteries determines the success or failure of marketing  efforts.    Overseas makers are still in the development stage for  lithium ion batteries and since supply sources for such  batteries is expected to be limited to Japanese companies for  the foreseeable future, reports indicate inquiries for possible  future orders are increasing at such companies as Sony from  companies engaged in the development of multimedia hardware such  as IBM and Apple Computer. In response, various domestic firms  are expected to strategically position lithium ion batteries on  a level paralleling liquid crystal displays and devote resources  to the development of high-capacity, next-generation batteries.    It takes one to two years for office automation and  communications equipment makers to reach a decision on new  equipment application of new types of sample power sources  furnished by battery suppliers. The decision for Sanyo  Electric's announcement, in the face of plans by Sony and AT  Battery to expand production capacity and announcements by  Matsushita Electrical Industries and Nippon Battery to produce  lithium ion batteries, was based on the judgment that failure to  make an announcement in fiscal year 1994 would make it  impossible for Sanyo to compete effectively for market share in  the area of portable computer terminals used in multimedia  systems.    Sanyo Electric President Yasuaki Takano states, "Sanyo will  aggressively invest in the expansion of its lithium ion battery  operations in order to strengthen its position as a top maker of  batteries such as the nickel cadmium type."    Lithium ion batteries have been considered the  high-capacity,  next-generation battery, but the industry is positioning fiscal  year 1994 as the "first year of commercialization" and has  embarked on development and production competitions to win  customers.</p>

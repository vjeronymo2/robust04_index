It also arrested students of Kyongbuk National University by  invoking the "National Security Law", charging them with  "posting an article sympathizing with the North's demand".    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: The fact that the  Kim Yong-sam group makes patriotic students a target of ruthless  suppression shows that they are now seeking in a more  undisguised way dependence on outside forces, not national  independence, and North-South confrontation, not national unity,  and fascist rule, not democracy.    Nowadays the Kim Yong-sam group is invoking the "National  Security Law" quite often, charging students with connection  with the North. This reveals once again its wicked intention to  follow the road of confrontation with the North to its dying  breath.    The puppets' grumble about "violent demonstrations" of  students is a ridiculous jargon reminding one of a thief crying  "stop thief!" Students have staged peaceful demonstrations  urging the refusal of "parliamentary ratification" and  renegotiation regarding the rice market opening, enraged at the  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's flunkeyist treachery in selling off  the rice market. It is a duplication of the method employed by  the military fascists of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" to  brand them as "rioters".    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's fascist suppression will  result in digging its own grave.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qiu Xiaohua (6926 2556 5478), deputy director of </F> the [PRC] State Statistical Bureau: "Why the Economy Is Cooling  Off But Price Rises Are Still High"]    [Text] Since the beginning of the second half of 1993,  accompanying the gradual putting into place relevant measures by  the government to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control, China's economy has begun to cool down and increases in  production, investment, and consumption have slowed each month.  The financial order, which for a time was chaotic, has gradually  taken a turn for the better; the problems of breaking rules and  regulations on discounts and loans, disorder in raising funds,  and disorder in setting up financial organizations are being  corrected, and initial success has been achieved in their  correction; and there has been a large increase in savings  deposits. At the same time, consumer market prices have  continued to rise. The averages for August were: in China as a  whole, retail prices rose more than 11 percent, and the cost of  living broke a 13 percent increase. This situation has caused  concern and anxiety in all quarters. In this regard I will only  give some of my own views, and I welcome the readers' criticisms  and comments.    1. Market price increases continue to be high mainly  because of the delayed reaction to the previous period of the  trend for high economic growth, the relaxation in the currency  supply policy, and the vigorous measures for price reform.    Prices are the "barometer" of the state of macroeconomic  operations, and an economic boom and price rise go together, but  there is often a delayed effect. A practical analysis of China's  economy shows that this delay is generally about a half year's  time in the entire economic cycle. When observing the current  price situation, one must look back at the economic growth  situation over the past several years. Beginning in the fourth  quarter of 1988, China's economy was brought under control and  consolidated, and the pace of development was clearly slowed.  Later the retrenchment dynamic became flexible, and in 1991 a  recovery-type growth began (in that year the gross domestic  product [GDP] was 3.9 percent higher than that of the year  before, a rise of 8 percent). In 1992 the growth accelerated (in  that year the GDP was 13.2 percent higher than that of the year  before). And the trend of market prices is basically for a state  of acceleration to prevail, and this state began in the last  half of 1992: from July to December the retail prices were on  average 5.8 percent higher than in the same period of the year  before, and were 9 percentage points higher than in the first  half of the year; the December rise was 6.8 percent, 2.6  percentage points higher than in June. With the spring breeze  accompanying Deng Xiaoping's tour of the south, in the second  half of 1992 China's economy got on the track of sustained  high-speed growth (since July in that year the growth of  industrial production has exceeded 20 percent). Correspondingly,  beginning in 1993, China's market prices rose markedely: in  January they went up 8.4 percent, in March 10.2 percent, in May  12.5 percent, and in the intervening months there was a rise of  about 2 percentage points. Because in the first half of this  year the growth of China's economy was still in an accelerated  state, starting in the second half of the year there was a  further rise in market prices, 14.9 percent in July and 15.1  percent in August. This shows that price rises often accompany a  high-speed growth of the economy and become a state of  acceleration.    Prices are a manifestation of inflation, and they often rise  following a relaxation in the money supply. In the initial  period of development and consolidation, because a policy of  strictly controlling the money supply was adopted, money in the  narrow sense -- currency and demand deposits (M1) --gradually  dropped from more than 30 percent in July 1988 to under 10  percent before June 1990. In the same period, the rise in market  prices dropped month by month, from 26.7 percent in December  1988 and 27 percent at the beginning of 1989 to 6.4 percent in  December 1989. In 1990-91, because a reasonable growth in the  money supply was maintained, the market price rise was basically  maintained at under 3 percent; in the period of high-speed  growth during the economic recovery, the M1 was affected by the  fairly relaxed monetary policy and a situation of accelerated  growth clearly appeared. In June 1992 the rise exceeded 30  percent, and in March 1993 it broke through the 40 percent  level. Against this background, an accelerated rise in market  prices in the second half of 1992 was inevitable, and it is no  wonder that current market price increases remains high.    An increase in China's market prices often occurs following  the appearance of price reform measures. Because prior to reform  the old economic system excluded the market's role, and strict  administrative controls were imposed on prices, serious  irrationalities were created in China's price administrative  mechanisms and price relations. Particularly since the nineties  began, almost every year reform has taken big strides and  charged through several barriers in succession. By the end of  1992 the prices of 90 percent of the consumer goods, of 80  percent of the means of production, and of more than 90 percent  of import-export commodities were being basically regulated by  the market. Under the dynamic of such a major reform, the  general level of market prices was bound to increase; this is a  "necessary cost" of price reform that is difficult to avoid.  According to estimates, in 1992, of increases of retail prices  as a whole, about 70 percent of it was the effect of policy-type  price regulation, and in the first eight months of 1993 about  half of the price rise was related to price reform.    From this we can see that at present the market price  increase is not falling back in synchronization with the cooling  off of the economy. It is not the case that the current  macroeconomic regulation and control policy is not playing its  role, but rather it is the total effect of the previous period  of high economic growth, generous money supply, and major price  reform. This is basically a normal phenomenon, and there is no  need for excessive anxiety about it. Of course, as a  macroeconomic regulator and controller, there is a necessity for  China to obtain and maintain a rational rate of growth in the  economy and in the money supply. Mastering the dynamic of  appropriate price reform is an important condition for ensuring  that the rise in market prices can be lowered to a point that it  can be regulated and controlled in order to further perfect the  scientific nature of macroeconomic regulation and control.    2. Supply and demand on the consumer goods market are  basically in balance, but the rise in market prices is still  fairly high, mainly because of the elasticity in consumption and  the differences in the consumption mix, causing differences in  commodity price rises.    Based on a relevant investigation, at present on the Chinese  mainland's consumer goods market, commodities for which supply  is greater than demand or for which supply and demand are in  basic balance account for 91.6 percent, and commodities for  which supply does not meet demand account for only 8.4 percent.  What people think is strange is: why is there no reduction in  the trend for market prices to rise, and why does the rise  remain high? As an individual I think that the main reason for  the appearance of this contrasting phenomenon is: On the one  hand, from an overall view, although for most commodities supply  and demand are not in balance, people's elasticity in the  consumption of different commodities is different. If there is a  lot of elasticity in this consumption, frequently after a price  rise the amount of consumption will fall, thereby restraining  price rises; if there is little elasticity in this consumption,  often after a price rise it will be difficult to have a major  change in the amount of consumption, and thus it will be  difficult to restrain price rises. Now, on China's consumer  goods market, most of the price rises are often in commodities  and labor services for which there is fairly little elasticity,  e.g., grain, nonstaple foodstuffs, fuel, rent, tuition,  transportation fees, etc. Since the beginning of this year, the  rise has been very high: in China as a whole, from January to  August, compared to the same period of last year, the price of  grain rose 26.3 percent, the price of fuel rose 39.4 percent,  the price of nonstaple foodstuffs rose ll.3 percent, and the  price of service items rose 28.6 percent. For these commodities  and services, which have little elasticity, people in daily life  often have difficulty in finding suitable substitutes; once the  state releases controls on the prices on these commodities or  raises the standards for collecting fees, the law of consumption  cannot play a role. Moreover, of these commodities and  services, a considerable part of them are not in a state of  basic balance between supply and demand, and some of them are  adversely affected by the natural environment. As for  commodities for which there is a lot of elasticity in  consumption, their price rises are not high. For example, the  price rises on clothing and on daily-use, cultural and  entertainment electromechanical commodities are basically less  than 10 percent, and the prices on some of them are moving  downward. On the other hand, influenced by the rasing of the  people's income level, consumption is tending toward fine  quality, high grade, and the new and original, and a fairly big  change has occurred in its structure. Even looking at the total  output, we see that at present in China there does not yet  existthe contradiction of a shortage of consumer goods, but  there are still many unsuitabilities between the production  structure and the consumption structure. Frequently for  commodities that satisfy marketing needs, the situation in  supply and demand tends to be tight and price changes are fairly  big. In particular, under conditions in which market rules and  regulations are not sound and the market order is not  standardized, abnormal phenomena, such as price rises in  disguised form and arbitrary price prices, will often appear,  thus raising the general level of price rises on consumer goods.  Many people feel that the price rises which remain high in the  current market is a case of some people in a high income bracket  with a tendency for high consumption spurring increases of  prices of new products, high-grade and fine-quality commodities,  and commodities of new and original design; and that the rises  in the prices of general traditional goods of dependable quality  are not high, and that there even has to be a dependency on  price cuts to promote sales.    Moreover, the high rises in the price of consumer goods  since  the beginning of this year are related to costs. The  concentrated manifestation of this is in the rise in the price  of advanced products, the rise in the cost of funds and foreign  exchange, and the rise in the cost of labor. Since the beginning  of this year, the prices of raw materials and energy purchased  by enterprises have risen more than 30 percent compared to those  of the same period of last year; labor wages have risen more  than 20 percent, the prices of funds have risen more than 10  percent, and the prices of foreign exchange have gone up more  than 20 percent. These factors for price increases are bound to  push up costs, and thereby spur a rise in the ex-factory prices  of industrial goods of more than 20 percent, which is bound to  be passed on to the retail prices. It is estimated that the  cost-push factor has become one of the most important factors in  market price rises, particularly for the prices of the means of  agricultural production (which have risen 13.5 percent in the  past eight months).    Of course the current high price rises on the market are to  a  certain extent also related to the fairly brisk demand by the  people (in the past eight months the volume of commodity retail  sales grew 22.5 percent). In the first half of the year, for a  while there appeared on the domestic market a situation in whcih  there was a race to buy commodities in order to protect their  value, and the situation on the agricultural market was also  better than it was in the year before, with a rise in prices  exceeding 10 percent. What needs to be pointed out is that,  since the beginning of this year, the renminbi has been  devalued, and the cost of imports has risen markedly, also, from  another side, pushing up domestic prices.    3. The pressure of latent inflation has abated, and the  consumption psychology of the people is basically stable, but  the current pattern of market price rises will be maintained for  a certain time. If a problem does not appear in currency  control, it is estimated that, beginning in the second quarter  of next year, the increase in market prices will certainly fall  back.    The central government has taken measures to strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control with a rectification of the  financial order as the breakthrough point. These measures are  manifested in the beginning of the cooling off of the overheated  economy (from July to Augsut respectively the industrial rate  fell back 5.1 and 1.7 percentage points, and the investment  growth fell back 5.4 and 13.2 percentage points). The chaotic  financial order has been rectified, and the trend in the  financial situation is toward stability (from June to August the  urban and rural people newly added 109.9 billion yuan to their  savings deposits, thereby greatly allieviating the pressure of  currency put into circulation). The prices of the means of  production are tending to fall amid a stable situation, and the  adjusted market foreign exchange prices are basically stable.  All of these things will certainly have a positive effect on the  market price situation in the next year. From a look at the M1  growth trend, we see that the more than 40 percent growth for a  time at the beginning of the year fell back to 19.7 percent by  the end of August. This growth was lower than normal, showing  that the latent pressure of inflation has begun to abate. If  this level of growth can be sustained for more than a quarter,  it is bound after half a year to produce a restraining force on  market prices, the rise in prices will fall back, gradually  returning to a range within 10 percent that can be regulated and  controlled.    However, in view of the problems in the first and second  seasons that have been discussed, it will be difficult within a  short time to effect fundamental changes, and the economy will  suffer the inertia effect of high-speed growth and of the rises  in investment still tending to be on the high side. In addition,  the fourth quarter is usually the one in which the effect of  currency circultion and financial expenditure is at its peak,  and it is estimated that the present more than 10 percent rise  in prices will continue for several months. For the year as a  whole, the rise in the cost of living could range between 14 and  15 percent, of which the rise in cities could be near 20  percent. Therefore, macroeconomic regulation and control must  make a point of preventing two tendencies: the first is  excessive pessimism and the other is excessive optimism. A  cautious, positive attitude should be taken, and regulation and  control should be scientifically mastered, striving both to  control inflation and to successfully attain the goal of  maintaining a fairly rapid growth in the economy.    4. The key to controlling excessively high price rises  lies in maintaining a basic balance in total supply and demand  and in promoting the optimizing of the structure.    From a look at the macroeconomic regulation and control  measures to be taken in the next stage, we see that it will be  impossible to completely eradicate inflation and that this will  also not be necessary; the point of effort should be one that  all sides can bear. Therefore, the dynamic should be to keep the  rise in market prices below 10 percent, and the key to this is  to enhance the management of the money supply policy and to make  strict checks on the currency. At the same time as this, we  must, on the basis of maintaining a basic balance in total  supply and demand, augment the structural regulatory dynamic,  and truly achieve a big development of the bottleneck industries  and a rational regulation of the deposit structure. For this  reason, we must reform the capital investment system, get a  tight grip on setting up investment markets for basic industries  and the infrastructure, and establish mechanisms that can  circulate the assets of state-owned enterprises, further  loosening and rectifying, and encouraging the forces of all  sides to advance in unison. Now, first, we must continue to get  a good grip on managing investments in fixed assets, and stop or  postpone projects for which there is neither capital nor  markets. Second, while putting a stop to evil practices, we must  "open the front gate," step up the pace of implementing the  "funds tray" in the plans, increase the effective supply, in  particular support the procurement of agricultural and sideline  products, and keep the promise not to just make a show. Third,  we must get a good grip on building a unified market in China,  devise sound market rules and regulations, break through  regional blockheads, and promote the unblocked circulation of  resources. Fourth, we must strengthen the legal system, stricly  punish all acts that violate law and discipline, particularly  cracking down on passing off the fake and inferior as genuine  and superior and on driving up prices, and reducing the various  kinds of noneconomic factors that cause inflation. Fundamentally  speaking, we must prevent the appearance of tangible inflation,  and, with dependence on the constant furthering of reform, form  management systems and operation mechanisms that meet the needs  of the market economy, switching the extensive business style of  high input, high consumption, and high speed to the track of  depending on technology, fine quality, and low consumption for  success, and striving to improve China's economic competiveness  and truly developing the economy rapidly and well.</p>

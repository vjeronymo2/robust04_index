			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ambitious cable plan from Time Warner TIME WARNER, the US media group, has announced plans to build in Orlando, Florida, the most ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and communications network yet attempted in the US on a commercial basis. The company, which runs the second-largest cable television business in the US, said it would eventually integrate this new operation, which it calls a 'full service network,' into its other cable markets across America. The move is an important step in the battle over which industry - cable television or local telephone companies - will be the main conduit providing multi-media services to the home. Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said that the move 'clearly establishes cable's technology as the primary pathway for information and entertainment'. Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said the full service network being introduced in Orlando would allow consumers to call up movies on demand, as well as interactive games and video shopping. It would also give access to distance learning. The company has also applied for an experimental licence to test personal communications services - a kind of mobile telephone system, similar to cellular telephony - in the Orlando area and also planned to offer customers access to long-distance telephone service providers. This is a direct threat to local telephone companies, which derive a large proportion of their revenues from access charges to link local customers to long-distance telecommunications groups. Orlando is one of Time Warner's main cable television markets, with some 500,000 subscribers. The service will operate initially in an area with some 4,000 residential customers.</p>

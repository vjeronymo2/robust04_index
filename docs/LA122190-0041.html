			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / CD CORNER: BLASTS FROM THE PAST, VIETNAM-STYLE  </P> <P> "It's one-o-eight (in the morning)," the voice says at the beginning of K-tel's  new "Rock Radio Vietnam" album. "Welcome into a Wednesday from Saigon. Army  specialist Jim Amross . . . going to shake up your soul with Delaney, Bonnie  and Friends."  </P> <P> After playing the record "Shake Your Soul," Amross returns with an  announcement: "It's more than just a piece of paper. . . . It's more than ink  and a few pictures. It's a newspaper. . . . It's word from the States. Share  the Stars and Stripes with your buddies. . . . Pass it on if you get a copy."  </P> <P> Is the album another nostalgia re-creation?  </P> <P> Not this time.  </P> <P> "Rock Radio Vietnam" is taken from the tape of an actual 1970 Armed Forces  Radio broadcast by Amross, one of the network's disc jockeys in Vietnam at the  time.  </P> <P> The broadcast includes 10 songs -- from Aretha Franklin's "Don't Play That  Song" and Free's "All Right Now" to Hotlegs' "Neanderthal Man" -- and various  public-service announcements. Among the latter: an anti-drug message, a  reminder of the deadline for sending Christmas gifts back to the States and  information about absentee ballots.  </P> <P> "There were several nostalgia collections geared to the Vietnam era when the  film 'Good Morning Vietnam' came out a few years ago, but they were basically  just songs from the era," said Steve Wilson, manager of product development for  K-tel.  </P> <P> "So, we were intrigued when a Vietnam veteran, Rick Thompson, came to us with a  reel-to-reel tape of an actual broadcast. It seemed to work on several levels  -- the music was interesting and it also captured a moment in history."  </P> <P> K-tel then obtained clearances from Amross, who now does radio and television  commercials in the Midwest, and the record companies whose songs were featured  during the broadcast.  </P> <P> Because the sound quality of the music on the tape was uneven, K-tel went back  to the original recording company masters of the songs to give the compact disc  a cleaner sound. Two of the tracks -- Freda Payne's "Deeper and Deeper" and  Chairman of the Board's "Everything's Tuesday" -- are reportedly appearing on  CD for the first time in the United States.  </P> <P> Wilson said that the K-tel marketing campaign will concentrate heavily on  magazines directed at Vietnam veterans.  </P> <P> "There was some concern at first about whether Vietnam veterans would want to  be reminded of those days -- whether the music would bring back bad memories,"  he said. "But we spoke with some veterans and they said they remember the music  and broadcasts fondly because the music always represented a touch of home."  </P> <P> IN THE STORES: Albums recently released on CD for the first time or recently  added to a label's budget series include the Cowboy Junkies' "Whites Off Earth  Now!!" (the group's first Canadian album), "The Best of the Bonzo Dog Band"  (the satirical outfit's first CD collection), David Bowie's "David Bowie at the  Tower Philadelphia" (one bonus track) and Bowie's "Diamond Dogs" (two bonus  tracks), the Grateful Dead's "Reckoning," and Tom Waits' "Closing Time" and  "Heart Attack and Vine."  </P></p>

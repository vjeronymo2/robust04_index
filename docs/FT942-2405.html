			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Railtrack policy on costs attacked Railtrack, the company which owns the rail network's track, signals and stations, has been accused of making it unduly expensive for companies to buy a stake in the network. Central Railway Group, which wants to create a freight link between the Midlands and the Channel tunnel, says Railtrack is demanding that companies proposing projects reimburse it for any costs it incurs in case a scheme does not go ahead. Mr Andrew Gritten, chairman of Central Railway, said Railtrack expected these costs to be paid in stages as talks proceeded. He also said that Railtrack expected to carry out expensive evaluations of proposals which were put to it with little regard for the costs this imposed on companies trying to break into the railway industry. Central Railway, which has plans for a 180-mile freight line large enough to carry trucks on flatbed rail wagons, said it was happy to work to standards set by Railtrack but for Railtrack to duplicate the work of its consultants was wasteful. Railtrack denied it was putting barriers in the way of smaller companies. It said: 'We act as consultants for them and are happy to do their research. Their costs will be in proportion to the size of the railway they want to run. It is natural that the costs of the research should be born by them and included in their start-up costs.' Central Railway said it was prepared to reach an agreement with Railtrack over the payment of costs but was concerned at the approach being taken by Railtrack. 'They need to get into deal-making, not consultancy,' Mr Gritten said. The company is attempting to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m from investors to obtain parliamentary approval for its proposal although the final cost of building the line could be Pounds 3bn.</p>

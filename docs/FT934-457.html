			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Music to suit all tastes - Christmas Eve Above all today there is music: for traditionalists and those who still truly enjoy Christmas, Radio 4 provides its live relay, as ever, of The Festival Of Nine Lessons And Carols from King's College, Cambridge on Radio 4 at 3pm. (Incidentally, for those who regularly inquire 'Why can't you buy a radio recorder to tape programmes while you are out?' the answer is that you can: Argos sell a good cheap version, and there are more expensive sets elsewhere.) There is an entirely different 60-minute television programme offering Carols From King's on BBC2 at 6pm with 13 Christmas songs and just four readings. For lovers of the rock/soul/Tamla sound, Channel 4 offers an hour each of Tina Turner and Diana Ross: Tina Turner, What's Love Live (9pm) recorded in California during her US tour this summer; and Diana Ross, The Lady Sings recorded in a nightclub setting in New York (11.05pm). Given the way the divas are now being marketed, it will be interesting to see how the ratings for Turner and Ross compare with BBC2's The Sorceress, with Kiri Te Kanawa, (9.30pm). The popular New Zealander sings seven Handel arias. The South Bank Show offers an excessive 90 minutes on Cliff Richard, saying that 'for the first time he has allowed a documentary crew into his life with unlimited access' (10.20pm, ITV); and for middle-aged ravers still proud of their virtuosity in the last dance craze that was actually taught, C4 provides the same astonishing amount of time for Twist (7pm).</p>

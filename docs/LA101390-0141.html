			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MASTER CHORALE AT ANOTHER CROSSROADS;  </P> <P> MUSIC: AS THE CHORUS OPENS ITS 27TH SEASON, THE SEARCH NARROWS FOR A  REPLACEMENT FOR MUSIC DIRECTOR JOHN CURRIE.  </P> <P> The 27th season of the Los Angeles Master Chorale opens tonight with  Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. A challenging monument to hope and transcendence,  shot through with fears and intimations of war, Beethoven's Mass will be sung  tonight in a world on the brink of battle -- and by a chorus at a crossroads.  </P> <P> The season will be John Currie's last as music director. The beleaguered Scot  gives every indication of departing without explaining his abrupt decision last  year not to seek renewal of his five-year term.  </P> <P> But if past developments remain opaque, sources close to the Chorale have cast  some light on the future. The search, they say, for Currie's replacement is now  focused on four men: locally based William Hall and Paul Salamunovich, the  familiar Helmuth Rilling and a relatively unfamiliar Simon Halsey.  </P> <P> Of the reputed short list, Halsey, the 32-year-old chorus master for the City  of Birmingham Symphony, is probably the most unexpected name.  </P> <P> "He comes with the strong recommendation of Simon Rattle," reports John Binkley  from Halsey's London management, confirming that Halsey is a prospective music  director. "I think it was on Rattle's recommendation that they (the Master  Chorale) investigated him."  </P> <P> In addition to his work with Rattle's City of Birmingham Symphony, the  Cambridge-trained Halsey is also chorus master for the much-recorded Academy of  Ancient Music, and artistic director of the annual Salisbury Festival. Son of  well-known choral director Louis Halsey and a composer, he is also the founder  and director of the City of Birmingham Touring Opera, with which he is  currently rehearsing a two-night reduction of the "Ring" cycle.  </P> <P> Rilling, the music director of the Gaechinger Kantorei in Stuttgart and  artistic director of the Oregon Bach Festival, is thoroughly familiar to Los  Angeles audiences and has conducted the Master Chorale before. It seems  unlikely that either Rilling or Halsey would be willing to abandon their  established enterprises for the full-time residence here that has been at least  the nominal norm, but Marshall Rutter, president of the Master Chorale board,  suggests that solutions to the difficulty could be found.  </P> <P> None of that would be a problem for Hall or Salamunovich, logical choices for  consideration whose prominent and wide-ranging careers are locally based.  Salamunovich is music director at St. Charles Borromeo in North Hollywood and a  professor at Loyola Marymount University; Hall is the music director of the  Master Chorale of Orange County and professor at Chapman College.  </P> <P> Rutter also said the music director search would be different this time: no  guest stints/auditions. Currie's unexpected ascension to the post in 1985 came  in the midst of a relatively public screening. It involved potential candidates  -- including Hall and Salamunovich, but not Currie -- in a series of guest  conductor/audition performances. Although similar processes have served local  orchestras such as the Long Beach Symphony well -- generating tremendous  audience interest in the ensemble -- the Master Chorale directors decided  against such an approach this time around.  </P> <P> "We considered whether that (the Long Beach Symphony search) would be a good  model for us," Rutter said. "But if you have prominent people, it's kind of  demeaning to them, and we are also eager to work as quickly as possible."  </P> <P> Rutter hopes that they will have somebody installed by next season, but does  not regard that as a deadline.  </P> <P> "We have good candidates and we're pleased with the progress," he said,  declining to confirm or deny any potential candidates. "It would be premature  to say anything further." The lesson from the previous search, with the late  and unforeseen introduction of Currie, is that the process is never closed.  </P> <P> The search for new artistic leadership takes place as the Chorale enters the  first season in a long-range plan, developed and presented to the Music Center  over a year ago. As projected, the season has expanded slightly, from eight to  nine performances in the Chorale's own series, with the addition of another  subscription concert. Subscription sales, however, are down, where the plan is  predicated on growth.  </P> <P> "We're down in our subscriptions a little bit this year," Rutter said. "I don't  know how to account for that. . . . They're definitely below our long-range  plan."  </P> <P> The organization seems fiscally healthy, however. For the 1988-89 season, it  posted an $86,000 surplus, which slashed the accumulated deficit by half.  </P> <P> Its musical health will be quickly established tonight, in the performance of  sublime hurdles of the Missa Solemnis. It has already been applauded this  season in Music Center Opera performances of "Fidelio" and "Idomeneo."  </P> <P> The other operas this season, "Nixon in China" and "Orfeo ed Euridice,"  employed a Los Angeles Music Center Opera Chorus, separately contracted through  the opera company. The name may have been changed, but many of the faces were  familiar, as the new chorus relied heavily on Master Chorale singers.  </P> <P> "Because of scheduling conflicts in the rehearsal period, the Opera Assn. felt  it wasn't possible for us to provide the chorus for all the productions,"  Rutter explained.  </P> <P> The solo quartet tonight is headed by soprano Carolann Page, Pat Nixon from  "Nixon in China." The other soloists are Scottish mezzo Christine Cairns, a  frequent guest with the Master Chorale and Los Angeles Philharmonic; tenor  Agostino Castagnola, a member of the Chorale for the last four seasons, and  baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore, a Covent Garden singer making his West Coast  debut.  </P> <P> The Master Chorale's own season in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion -- in addition  to performances with Music Center Opera and the Philharmonic -- consists of a  Scottish program with Jean Redpath, Nov. 18; a Christmas program alternating  with "Messiah" sing-alongs Dec. 8, 9, 15, 16; a Haydn-Britten pairing Feb. 2;  the West Coast premiere of Stephen Paulus' "Voices" on a March 2 program at  which the Chorale will collect canned goods for the disadvantaged, and a Mozart  program April 21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> One year ago the Master Chorale placed a want ad for a music director. The move  was ordered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as part of the  labor-certification process to enable Scottish music director John Currie, then  starting his fourth year with the organization, to obtain permanent resident  status and keep his job. A month later, Currie made a surprise announcement  that he would not seek renewal of his five-year contract. The search for his  replacement has been on since.  </P></p>

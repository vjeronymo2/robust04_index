			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Wrong curriculum for 21st century Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Apple-pie curriculum', September 11) describes his ideal curriculum for British children today as including proficiency in English, 'an acquaintance with the Bible and Shakespeare and the best of modern literature. A little science, a smidgen of history and a dip into French, German or another European language'. And he claims, presumably correctly, that this is what the national curriculum will achieve. Is this a curriculum suitable for preparing British children for the 21st century, from an economic, political or cultural perspective? For Britain to reverse its economic decline, our education must include basic science and technology as central subjects, more important than the Bible or Shakespeare. A little science is not enough. If Britain is to participate fully in European governance and our children are to participate fully in its economic opportunities, every child should leave school fluent in another European language. A 'dip' into a foreign language - which is what most English children enjoy now - will leave us and them at an increasing disadvantage in all European matters. Ideally every child should have some of their schooling in another European country. In our multi-ethnic society, the exclusive focus on the Bible and Shakespeare is offensive to the non-Christian majority and makes no attempt to educate our children to be tolerant and inclusive in their religious and cultural attitudes. Joe Rogaly (and apparently the government's) curriculum is an attempt to turn the clock back to the 19th century in cultural terms - and then our under-emphasis on technology and its low prestige was the forerunner of our present economic decay. His curriculum is ideally suited for a life spent on the desert island of Desert Island Discs, when the only occupation available is to read the Bible and Shakespeare: is this the environment we expect in the 21st century?

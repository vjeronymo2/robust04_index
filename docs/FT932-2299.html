			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Science minister pressed on research spending DOUBTS ABOUT whether Mr William Waldegrave, the science minister, has the political clout to ensure that money saved through cuts in military research and development is switched to civil projects were expressed from both sides of the Commons yesterday. Mr Waldegrave, in opening a debate on the recently published white paper on government expenditure on science and technology, called for the redoubling of efforts to ensure that the money was spent 'properly and where it really matters'. To that end he announced that a new council for science and technology would be established by the end of October. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow science minister, said the Office of Public Service and Science headed by Mr Waldegrave was not 'strong enough' to effectively co-ordinate the science spending of all government departments. She emphasised that other departments remained responsible for 60 per cent of government spending on science and technology - including 40 per cent by the Ministry of Defence. Sir Giles Shaw, the Conservative chairman of the Commons science and technology committee, agreed that the biggest problem facing Mr Waldegrave was how to deal with the MoD. He said: 'Savings made in defence research and development must be transferred to the civil side.' Sir Giles also pressed for more spending by the Department of Trade and Industry on civil research and development, and greater efforts to secure the support of shareholders and the City for such expenditure. Mr Robert Jackson, the former junior science minister who played a role in producing the white paper on science spending, said the paper had been a 'missed opportunity' to cut spending on defence research and development. Too much scarce scientific talent and 'brain power' had been absorbed into defence work, he said, instead of being diverted into more economically useful civilian projects. Mr Lewis Moonie, shadow junior science spokesman, suggested that civil research and development could be expanded by giving companies 'tax credits' to finance specific projects.</p>

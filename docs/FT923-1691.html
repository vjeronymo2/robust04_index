			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Letter: Concern raised by executive share option proposals Sir, Although the consultative approach to share schemes taken by the National Association of Pension Funds ('Stock option schemes queried', September 16) is welcome there are a number of points of principle which may cause concern. The use of share price as a measure to determine whether an option is exercisable is, by its nature, volatile. For companies which are at, or close to, the threshold for success, the option may be exercisable on Wednesday, barred on Thursday and exercisable again on Friday. The option benefit is itself dependent on share price. To make access to that benefit dependent on share price performance as well seems to imply that it is acceptable to make really big money on the roulette wheel of the market, but not just big money. The executive option introduced the concept of executive reward related to shareholder gain. To date, executive options have not always satisfied executives and have often been seen by shareholders as failing to deliver the intended shareholding benefits, but they will ensure that any gain enjoyed by executives is matched by a rise in the value of shareholders' investment over that period. Moreover, companies sensitive to the transitory nature of executive shareholding have developed innovative approaches to encouraging and reinforcing shareholding by executives. It is unfortunate the NAPF has not broadened the debate by supporting such initiatives. Carol Arrowsmith, managing director, New Bridge Street Consultants, 2 Tallis Street, London EC4Y 0BJ</p>

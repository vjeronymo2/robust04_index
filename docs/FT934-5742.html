			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Business takes the long view: Colony's companies still place faith in investment Hong Kong's business community last night shrugged off the apparent breakdown in Anglo-Chinese talks about the colony's political future. Governor Chris Patten has few allies among Hong Kong's Chinese and expatriate businesses. Many feel that he is attempting to do too much, too late in Britain's administration of Hong Kong. Managers of some of the colony's largest companies said their view of Hong Kong as a place to invest would not be affected even if China stood by its threat to overturn the results of the colony's 1995 elections when it assumes sovereignty on July 1 1997. According to one senior British businessman: 'It is not that there would be rioting and upheaval if they did that. Hong Kong people are quite pragmatic. There may be a lot of words and shouting but they know there's nothing to be gained. No one will come to rescue them from the Motherland (China).' However, not all business people think that the current Anglo-Chinese fight over Hong Kong is wasted. One leading Chinese businessman praised Mr Patten for bringing the issue of Hong Kong's political development in to the open. 'It is better for Hong Kong if we get this settled once and for all now,' he said. 'It would be worse for us if this debate took place after 1997. 'The extent to which Hong Kong can maintain its independence will depend on how Hong Kong people act, not on what the British do,' he said. Most businessmen believe that Hong Kong can have a good relationship with China only if it works with Beijing rather than confront it. However they are confident that China will not damage Hong Kong's economy in reprisal for what Mr Patten has done. Traders in Hong Kong's volatile stock market believe that the market has already substantially discounted failure in the talks and Mr Patten putting his proposals to the colony's legislature. The market will be focusing on what the Chinese government says if Mr Patten does take unilateral action. Here the key will be the nature of threats, if any, Beijing makes about the economy. 'The market is likely to suffer increased selling pressure but I don't think investors will be too pessimistic at this stage,' said Mr Simon Lam of Mansion House Securities. 'Even if a first-stage agreement cannot be reached it does not mean that there will be no talks in the future, so I don't think the market will correct very substantially,' he said. Indeed analysts said a correction was long overdue after the strong gains of the past few months. The Hang Seng index edged higher last week, gaining just 10.48 points over the week to 9,274.42 on Friday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mirko Galic: "New Division of Interest"] </F>   [Text] Have the Russians come to Bosnia to protect their  "Orthodox brothers"? If we judge only by the three raised  fingers [symbol of Eastern Orthodoxy, used by Serbian  nationalists, and displayed by Russian troops arriving in  Bosnia-Herzegovina], we could be wrong. It is true that the  Russian soldiers could not help their hearts (or perhaps they  could not help the slivovits either, if they made a stop or two  on the way) and that they too -- surprised, probably, by the  people applauding them -- gave vent to their religion. However,  Yeltsin is not a religious convert but a statesman who,  regardless of the occasional caricatures with which he is  described in the West, has the old reflex of his predecessors.  Is the greater-Russian opposition pushing him toward imperial  waters? Or the military leadership? Or has he himself found  this way to put Russia back into world politics again?  Yeltsin's egg is difficult to separate from the Russian chicken.    The return of Russia -- provided that it is "neither  temporary nor accidental," as the best French "Kremlinologists"  prove -- is radically changing political relations in Europe  (and the world). Some strategists are jumping the gun in  declaring "a new era of bipolarity," just like the one before  the Berlin Wall came down. It is still better to wait: Can  Russia, if it is not able to follow its imperial pretensions  economically, be a "world factor" in some other way apar from by  threatening a global conflict one more time? The latest  experience from Bosnia induced Paris LE MONDE to speak about  "the taste of the Cold War." Fortunately, only "the taste," for  the present leaders in Moscow are far too dependent on Western  connections to take the ultimate risk.    After the "tragic helplessness" throughout "Yugoslav  crisis,"  Europe can do nothing but admit that it was given a three-year  free play by the United States to stop the war on its territory,  but could not do it. It remained a "political dwarf," as it  does not have the means (the army) to realize its ambitions.  Gradually, persuaded by Europe (or France) among other things,  the United States is getting back into Europe, but as the only  superpower, not just as an ally. Has it, as a tugboat, following  the logic of the "old situation," pulled Russia along as well?  A couple of years ago, when Moscow was disoriented, the United  States would probably not have managed to pull it along, at  least not so fast and efficiently. The way the "Russian  phoenix" is rising from the ashes (according to Mrs. D'Encausse,  the first to predict the collapse of the former empire) shows  that it has the strength, or thinks that it has. Anyhow, Russia  is here to save its friends, but also to protect its interests.    Does that create a new concept of European balance? One  concept disintegrated with the fall of the Berlin Wall. How to  build another one, without making it "a new Yalta"? Can one  determine the borders of interest of "a new West" and "a new  East" in the Balkans, for example, since we are talking about  "Russian interests"?    Russia's entry onto the Bosnian scene is, in the eyes of  many, to do with creating a new balance. Perhaps with creating  a new division (of interests) as well.</p>

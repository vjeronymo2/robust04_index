			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] According to the 26 March Lisbon weekly  EXPRESSO, the results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll conducted  nationwide between 21 and 23 March among 485 regularly  participating individuals showed that the Socialist Party (PS)  is now in first place in voter preference. The PS rose 4.1  percent since the previous month and now stands at 37.9 percent,  while the Social Democratic Party (PSD) lost 1.7 percentage  points, to drop to 34.1 percent. Drops were also registered by  the Communist Party (PCP), which now stands at 5.3 percent, and  the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS), whose popularity is  4.6 percent. PS leader Antonio Guterres also recovered lost  ground, going from 31 percent last month to the present 34  percent, with Prime Minister Cavaco Silva standing at 33 percent.    Only 9 percent of the Portuguese consider themselves  "somewhat" or "not nationalistic," the results of an  EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll (no further details) published in the  26 March EXPRESSO revealed. On a scale of 1 to 5, 23 percent  said they are "highly nationalistic," 20 percent consider  themselves "quite nationalistic," and 36 percent are "moderately  nationalistic." At a time when the nationalism-versus-federalism  question is in heated debate, the Portuguese failed to perceive  the essential contradiction of the fact that 51 percent of the  respondents agreed with future Portuguese integration in a  "United States of Europe," compared to 27 percent who objected  to it and 22 percent who had no opinion.</p>

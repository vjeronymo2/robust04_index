			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trieste Citizens Want Border </F> Treaties Unchanged"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- Citizens in Trieste, the  Italian city near the frontier with Slovenia, believe that any  renegotiation of the border treaty with that country would be  "impractical," according to a poll carried out by the SWG  [Integrated Research Services] agency.    Raising the issue of alterations to the Osimo treaty, which  in 1975 put an end to border haggling between Italy and  Yugoslavia, would be "impractical" according to 65.7 percent of  Trieste citizens polled by SWG.    Italians from other areas were not so sure, however, with  just 44.6 percent of those questioned agreeing with Trieste.  Over 56 percent of ethnic Italians living across the Slovene  border were against any changes.    Asked whether discussing changes to the treaty was  "desirable", negative answers came from 55.4 percent of Trieste  citizens, 42 percent of Italians, and 34.1 percent of Italians  in the Istrian peninsula.    Should the treaty come up for debate, as some areas in the  National Alliance, part of the governing coalition, have  suggested, 34.1 percent of Italians across the border would like  to see greater safeguards for the Italian minority there  introduced, while just 7.6 percent said that the border itself  should be changed.    Of those questioned in the former Yugoslavia, 39.8 percent  said that the best solution for the Italian minority there would  be "full administrative autonomy within Slovenia and Croatia".    Seven hundred Italians and 250 people in Istria were  questioned for the poll.</p>

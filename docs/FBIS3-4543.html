			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] A MATICHON correspondent reports from Nan  Province that news about the movements of Lao rightist Generals  Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun at the Thai-Lao border in Nan  Province has created concern among local businessmen. They  feared a negative impact on the economy of the province if the  government fails to handle this problem effectively. Thailand  is cooperating with Laos to open a permanent border point for  trade in Ban Huai Kon, Thung Chang District, Nan Province. If  the matter is not cleared up, Laos will be suspicious of  Thailand, and this will delay the project.    According to a report from the provincial office, a Thai  delegation led by Nan Governor Prawit Sisophon held a meeting  with Lao officials of Sianghon-Hongsa special zone on 21-22  February. An agreement was reached saying both sides will  instruct officials to strictly check activities of the  anti-Vientiane movements. They agreed to exchange information  on a monthly basis so the authorities concerned could check the  problem in time.    The report indicates that authorities of both sides agreed  to  step up control at border trading points. Each Lao national  seeking treatment at hospitals in Thung Chang District and Song  Khwae Subdistrict in Nan will not be allowed to have more than  two persons accompanying him into Thailand. Hospital  authorities must report admissions to their superiors in order  to prevent cases of illegal entry. [passage omitted]</p>

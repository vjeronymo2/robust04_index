			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Tenneco in restructure charge of Dollars 920m TENNECO, the US conglomerate, yesterday announced a Dollars 920m pre-tax restructuring charge at its troubled JI Case farm and construction equipment business, together with an issue of common stock which could raise more than Dollars 1.1bn. The company filed a registration statement for an issue of 23.5m new shares, co-led by First Boston and Lazard Freres, and said the proceeds would be used to repay debt. Tenneco estimated the Case restructuring, to be carried out over three years, would require Dollars 550m in cash, though this would be reduced by any money it realised while implementing the programme. The company's shares dipped after the announcement but recovered to close at Dollars 47 3/4 , down Dollars  3/8 , at the close in New York. Case, a leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment, has been a thorn in Tenneco's side for several years, suffering from weak markets and strong global competition. It went through a major restructuring in 1991, involving Dollars 461m of charges for job cuts, plant closures and product line rationalisations. Mr Mike Walsh, chairman of Tenneco, said yesterday that while these actions had helped its performance, 'the farm and construction equipment market continued to deteriorate and we determined that major structural and strategic changes were necessary'. Case is to focus more on core product lines, where it is a market leader or could become one, including medium to large agricultural equipment and light to medium construction equipment. The restructuring includes Dollars 441m of cost for rationalising production, Dollars 161m for consolidating and resizing production capacity, Dollars 126m for discontinuing or replacing unprofitable products, Dollars 91m for selling re-tail stores and shaking up the parts distribution network and Dollars 101m for associated costs.</p>

Zvyahilskyy; date not given: "The Business of Both Prime  Minister and Deputy"]    [Text] On Tuesday, acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Ye.L.  Zvyahilskyy reported to the electorate of Kiyevskiy Rayon in  Donetsk on his deputy activity in the Supreme Council.    The deputy counts to his credit dozens of problems resolved  with his assistance in the rayon and the city--from deliveries  of crushed stone for road repair to the construction of housing,  new trolley buses, and the beginning of actual construction on  the metro.    Zvyahilskyy considers one of the main results of his  activity  in the position of acting prime minister to be surmounting the  energy crisis in Ukraine. The preconditions have been  established for price stabilization of products. "This averted  a new price hike in January. For this they call me a suppressor  of reforms." Inflation in January and February ran at 20  percent. In March it is expected to reach 30 percent.  Zvyahilskyy stated that not a single state has managed without  administrative measures. He points out the establishment of  relations with CIS countries as one of his achievements of  merit. A number of positive shifts are seen as a consequence of  this--from the opening in Moscow of the Ukraine bank to the  production of drugs and medicines. Ukraine will have its own  insulin. Anticancer medicinal preparations will be produced in  Lugansk Oblast.    After presenting a half-hour report, Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy  responded to questions from Donetsk citizens.    [Question] Will there be new price increases?    [Zvyahilskyy] Today the government is undertaking all  measures to see to it that prices not only do not increase but  actually begin to be systematically reduced. The Zaporozhye  "Tavriya" is incredibly priced. If "trade mark-up of up to 50  percent" appears in writing, they establish it at exactly 50  percent. Now there will be a trade mark-up of up to 10 percent.  The plant will decide this. The government will lower excise  taxes in response.    [Question] How do you assess the way banks are operating?    [Zvyahilskyy] Almost all Ukrainian banks are commercial  banks, with the exception of one established for hard currency  transactions. A few days ago I signed a document according to  which all plants will conduct hard currency transactions through  this bank. There will be a scandal, of course. Commercial  banks have destroyed the financial system. It was recently  discovered that the salaries of certain bank managers comes to  187-185 million a month. A resolution was adopted to make  salaries over 6 million subject to tax at 90 percent. The  Ministry of Internal Affairs is now monitoring time frames for  payment processing.    [Question] How do you view commercial drugstores?    [Zvyahilskyy] That is not business--selling drugs and  medicines to the populace for currency. Investments in medical  industrial equipment and joint enterprises for the production of  medicines was one of the first questions to be discussed in  meetings with the ambassadors of foreign states. In 1995-1996  we will have a complete industrial base. But it is impossible  to shut down the drug stores right now since there is no market  saturation with respect to medicines.    [Question] Will the hryvnya be introduced, and when?    [Zvyahilskyy] A plant has already been built in Ukraine for  producing money. On Friday (i.e., today--Ye.D.) I will attend  the ribbon-cutting ceremony along with Kravchuk and Plyushch. I  have seen the new hryvnya. The hryvnya we have is better than  the one from Canada. Its security features are even better.  When? Let us say, this will happen Thursday, but in what...    [Question] The salaries of medical personnel and teachers  are low. There is no money for pay or meals in the military  units.    [Zvyahilskyy] Some 1.5 trillion [rubles] has already gone  into pension payments for military pensioners. Five hundred  billion--to grants for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 100  billion--to border troops. When the economy gets adjusted a bit  more, the question of salaries for medical personnel and  teachers will be examined in the Supreme Council. Their  salaries should be on the level of the average in industry.  Today for mine workers at mines that are meeting quotas it is 4  million, for metallurgists--3 million, energy industry  workers--3.5 million karbovantsy. This is not very much, of  course. The state does not have such salaries for doctors and  teachers. There is simply nowhere to get the money.    [Question] How do you assess Kravchuk's purchase of a  "bungalow" in Switzerland when our people are impoverished?    [Zvyahilskyy] I have not been to Switzerland and have not  seen this "bungalow." But I do know Kravchuk. I talk with him.  He is a versatile politician.    [Question] What do you have to say about corruption in the  upper echelons of power, including in your government?    [Zvyahilskyy] I have not noticed any violations at present  on the part of deputy prime ministers or ministers. Also, my  personal signature alone does not suffice for any document. The  endorsements of all deputy prime ministers and legal counsel  must appear. I do not permit deputy prime ministers to go  abroad. There is a great deal to do at home.    [Question] Why do we see the highest prices for products in  Donetsk and in the oblast?    [Zvyahilskyy] We must get involved in prices and price  formation. I was in Kirovskiy on 8 March (in connection with a  mine accident). I made a special trip to the store and found  that butter was being sold there for 83,000. I asked--where did  they come up with such a price? It turns out they got the  butter through the canteen, with a mark-up. But butter is just  sitting at the warehouses today--tens of thousands of tonnes,  because people will not take it at that price. Lower the  price--I said. The price of butter should be 50,000-55,000. I  talked with V.V. Rybak by phone and asked him how things were  going. He said he had just returned from the oblast executive  committee where they decided to raise the price of bread  one-and-a-half times. So I asked Minister of Agriculture  Demyanov to see me. We looked into it and took this question  off the agenda.    [Question] How do you view a federative land structuring of  Ukraine?    [Zvyahilskyy] I support independence. I am in favor of a  bilingual system. There need not be any coercion over language.    [Question] Will there be a liberalization of prices?    [Zvyahilskyy] All the problems of the economy in Ukraine  stem from three factors. Liberalization of prices, oil  products, and the export of metals--which is taking place  outside state control. I am therefore today an opponent of  price liberalization.    [Question] When will children's footwear appear in the  stores?    [Zvyahilskyy] We will have children's footwear. We have a  mighty shoe industry, with new equipment. But 16 million hides  were exported out of Ukraine last year. What do you use to make  shoes? The Donetsk shoe factory must produce children's footwear.    [Question] What is your income and how well off is your  family?    [Zvyahilskyy] I have been working all my life, 37 years. I  spent 26 of these years as top manager in the mines. That must  mean something. Today my income is on the order of 4 million a  month. My wife is on pension. Our children live independently.  I am a rich man, for your information.    [Question] Will there be indexation of deposits of the  population?    [Zvyahilskyy] There is no money for this. Ukraine needs 70  trillion in order to fully implement indexation. We can do this  in phases, by age: 85-80, then 80-75, and so on down to 60.  That will do it. I had a conversation with Kravchuk on this  topic. We hope the United States Congress will provide--in  addition to that $700 million you are aware of--more credits for  1994-1996, for 10 years. Perhaps we will allot a portion of that  for indexation.</p>

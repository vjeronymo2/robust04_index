			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Goodyear confident of record quarter GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber's second-quarter net income is expected to be at the high end of analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 1.40 per share, according to Mr Stanley Gault, the group's chief executive, Reuter reports from Ohio. Mr Gault added that the US group stood a good chance of posting record sales for the quarter and first half. 'We are going to be in that range, and hopefully we are going to be at the upper end of it,' he said in an interview. The group's previous second-quarter sales record was Dollars 2.87bn in 1990. It also set a first-half sales record in that year of Dollars 5.56bn. In last year's second quarter, net income amounted Dollars 22.5m or Dollars 0.38 a share on sales of Dollars 2.79bn. Mr Gault said he expected the gains to continue. 'We are having an excellent year,' he added. Asset sales and improved sales of replacement tyres were the reasons for the strong quarter.</p>

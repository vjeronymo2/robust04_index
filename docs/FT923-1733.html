			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Teachers 'undervalued' THE government must start valuing teachers if its reforms are to improve education, the Rev Dominic Milroy, chairman of the Headmasters' Conference - which represents 233 private schools - said yesterday. 'There has been an unfortunate tendency down the years for teachers to get a lot of stick,' he said at the opening of the organisation's annual conference in Bruges. 'There appears to be a tendency in the public mind, and even for the government, to lump teachers together as a profession which doesn't deserve the same respect as the medical, legal or financial professions.' Mr Milroy attacked the view of Mr John Patten, education secretary, that parents always knew better than teachers and educationalists. He also warned against the dangers of the 'exam league table mentality' and pressing ahead with performance-related pay for teachers.</p>

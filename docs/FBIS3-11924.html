At his meeting with Lacalle, Kalvoda mainly discussed  economy  and trade.    Lacalle said that Uruguay counted on commercial and  political  aid by the Czech Republic, Stanislav Hlavacek, Czech Ambassador  to Uruguay, told CTK after the meeting. He said that Lacalle  had expressed his hope that the signing of a Czech-Uruguayan  trade agreement, scheduled for this summer, might contribute to  the development of relations between the two countries. The  signing of a cultural agreement is also expected, Hlavacek said.    Torello informed Kalvoda on principles of the independent  Uruguayan justice system introduced after the abolition of the  Justice Ministry at the beginning of the 1980s. He said the  former ministry was strongly influenced by the executive power,  while the present Court of Justice is fully independent of both  the president and parliament, Hlavacek said.    He said that the discussion between Kalvoda and Ramirez  focused on the Uruguayan Constitution.    Today Kalvoda and other members of the Czech delegation are  to attend the inauguration ceremony of Irena Mayer, honorary  consul of the Czech Republic in Maldonado.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Announcer: We have already reported  that a briefing for Ukrainian and foreign journalists was held  at the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry on 21 December. This  briefing was attended by my colleague, esteemed Andriy Chyrva.    Chyrva: [passage omitted: introductory remarks]  You may be aware by now of the situation where some of the mass  media, in particular REUTERS and the Voice of America, reported  yesterday that Ukraine had taken 17 SS-24 intercontinental  ballistic missiles off combat alert. This issue, naturally  being of great interest to journalists, they wanted to hear the  confirmation of that fact from Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister  Borys Tarasyuk, who took part in the briefing.    I would like to say that this issue is quite complex and I  would like to be precise and quote precisely what Borys Tarasyuk  said.    Announcer: Please do.    Chyrva: He said that the early deactivation  program did not only cover the SS-19 missile systems. This was  due to the complexity of these installations, consisting of not  only missiles, but nuclear warheads subject to guaranteed  maintenance terms of their own. Thus, what it concerns is not  separate types of missile systems, but exactly those where the  term of guaranteed maintenance is running out, that are being  taken off combat alert or are subject to the early deactivation  program. This, as it were, is what Mr. Tarasyuk officially  stated.    Announcer: So this is the first report that  somewhat contravenes the one carried, in particular, by the  REUTERS agency. It adds quite essentially to the accuracy [of  what is at issue] too, in my view. That is to say, what  concerns is that only those ballistic missiles are at issue that  have already become lifeless, as it were, or not combat ready.  Is that so?    Chyrva: Yes, of course. Tarasyuk said that work  was under way in Ukraine to carry out the so-called deactivation  of missile systems. In essence, it is to remove the warheads  and store them in Ukraine at a considerable distance from the  missile sites. This is what, in my view, the issue is.    The second important issue, raised by Borys Tarasyuk, was  that of the participation of the Ukrainian delegation at the  consultative meeting with representatives of Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] member countries.  [passage omitted: Chyrva reporting on Tarasyuk's account of  government measures to control the export of strategic materials]    Chyrva: Another interesting issue: Mr. Tarasyuk  produced quite a large folder or file containing materials on  the list of commodities and technologies prohibited from being  transferred or traded to Ukraine by Cocom member countries. You  know that this issue was very sensitive for us at the time of  the Cold War and there were restrictions -- and very extensively  so too -- that were in the way of our trade with the West, and  that between the West and ourselves. That is why this whole  issue now -- and Mr. Tarasyuk spoke about it -- should be raised  and somehow agreed so that our relations in trade and economic  relations with the West could, after all, develop properly and  so that we could trade, including trade in high technologies and  dual-purpose technologies. [passage omitted: announcer  reiterating the above]    Chyrva: What I would also like to mention in  conclusion is that (?the last) question asked, that of course  concerns and interests everybody, was on arms trade, i.e.  whether Ukraine trades in weapons.    Announcer: Which weapons?    Chyrva: I mean conventional weapons, I do not mean  nuclear weapons but conventional weapons. So Mr. Tarasyuk said  that on the issue of arms trade Ukraine proceeded from existing  principles, and was governed by those bans on trade with those  countries in respect of which there were relevant United Nations  Security Council sanctions. We all know, and our foreign  listeners may know, that these are such countries as the  Republic of Yugoslavia, Libya, the Republic of South Africa, and  Iraq. These are those countries where we [word indistinct]. As  for that, I have already said that it is strictly governed by  existing principles. As for where and whom arms [are being  sold], it was not (?discussed). [passage omitted: announcer  contemplating on Ukraine's stance on arms trade]</p>

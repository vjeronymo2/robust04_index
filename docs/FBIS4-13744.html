			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadeem Qadir] </F>   [Text] Khagrachari, Bangladesh, April 21 (AFP) -- A fragile  truce threatens to collapse in this rugged district as  Bangladesh troops and Buddhist rebels trade charges of violating  a ceasefire signed last year to end a dragging bush war.    "The army is still carrying out combing operations," said  tribal leader Kisha (eds: one name) and cited an incident on  April 12 when soldiers allegedly beat tribals indiscriminately  in this frontier district bordering India.    "This shows a lack of sincerity" on the part of the troops,  Kisha added.    A Bangladeshi army officer here confirmed that operations to  flush out the outlawed guerrillas were continuing, but denied  allegations that soldiers were using repressive measures to  combat tribal insurgency here.    "If we know that insurgents have taken position in a  village,  you do not expect us to sit tight," the army officer added.    On ceasefire violations, the officer said: "We do not fire  unless we are fired upon -- we maintain that strictly."    He asserted that it was the rebels who violated the  ceasefire  frequently in three districts of Bangladesh's Chittagong hill  tracts.    Both Kisha and the officer, however, said insurgency-related  violence in the sprawling tracts ebbed since the first ceasefire  offered by the rebels became effective last year and was  extended several times.    Government troops have been fighting Shanti Bahini (Peace  Brigade) Buddhist rebels in the frontier hill districts of  Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban for the past 19 years.    The bush war has, by an official count, left more than 2,500  people dead, many of them killed in rebel ambushes and riots  with Moslem settlers. The unofficial toll is widely believed to  be much higher.    The Bahini, which claims to have 3,000 guerrillas on its  rolls, have allegedly set up bases in adjoining Tripura state in  India where some 56,000 tribespeople, mostly from the Buddhist  Chakma tribe, have taken shelter.    The question of repatriation of the Chakmas to the tracts  here remains embroiled in controversy with New Delhi demanding  guarantees of safety for the homeless returnees.    Bangladesh army sources said during the year-long ceasefire  the Bahini rebels were responsible for 60 violations. The rebels  say the soldiers broke the ceasefire 54 times since last May.    "(Armed) activities have reduced a lot, but not zeroed... In  recent days there has been no deaths in military-rebel  engagements," the army officer said.    This pictureseque valley-town, situated 1,300 feet (394  metres) above sea level, could have been a holiday resort. But  the dragging insurgency has discourged western or local tourists  from visiting the region.    Security forces patrol the town as well as nearby villages.  Troops with machineguns are positioned in secured towers atop  hills here.    Residents say life has become easier since the ceasefire,  which is due to end on May 15, came into effect.    "We still feel scared and people are careful not to be out  of  homes after evening," said Anup Chakma, a tribesman.    Other residents agreed that the fragile ceasefire had given  everyone a respite from the regular gunbattles and bloodletting  in this remote zone of Bangladesh.</p>

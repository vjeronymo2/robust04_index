			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: QMH action group demand A GROUP of shareholders in Queens Moat Houses yesterday wrote to the chief executive of the heavily-indebted hotels company demanding copies of the controversial property valuations which show a difference of some Pounds 500m in its assets. The letter comes just five days before the extraordinary meeting which was called when the company's net assets had fallen to less than half the called-up share capital. It is widely expected, however, that the EGM will be adjourned until the annual meeting on November 29. QMH recently announced a loss of Pounds 1.04bn, the second largest deficit in UK corporate history, and is in talks with bankers over refinancing its Pounds 1.18bn debt. Mr Denis Woodhams, the former hotel manager who launched the QMH shareholder action group earlier this month, said yesterday that he was hoping to force an adjournment of the AGM until the valuations had been examined by independent bodies. 'If we get enough support to vote against the 1992 accounts, it has to be adjourned,' Mr Woodhams said. Mr Woodhams wrote to Mr Andrew Coppel, the recently-appointed chief executive, on behalf of the action group requesting copies of the valuations by Weatherall Green and Smith and Jones Lang Wooton. He also requested details of any properties identified for disposal by the new management. QMH refused to comment on whether it would comply with Mr Woodhams' requests. However, it is thought unlikely the information will be made available. Mr Coppel said yesterday he shared the action group's concerns to protect shareholders. 'We are acting in all shareholders' interests, large and small, in trying to achieve a recovery of this group. To that extent our interests are aligned,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta has said the  military truce declared by the Nicaraguan Government, via the  Army, does not mean there will be a dialogue with the 3-80  Northern Front rebels. Minister Mendieta has said talks with  the rearmed 3-80 Northern Front rebels will only be possible  once they have laid down their weapons and joined civilian life.    [Begin recording] [Mendieta] We believe the government has  been making big efforts in many areas. The government has  clearly stated it will not negotiate with armed sectors. All  talks with [word indistinct] only after they have disarmed.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] the 3-80 rebels  must disarm prior to talks with the government?    [Mendieta] Once they decide to disarm, and once they begin  to  disarm, then we will begin a process of dialogue with them, but  this will not be a negotiation. We believe an institutional  response must prevail in this case, and we are willing to  implement immediately the social plans in that area. Those  social plans will benefit all the peasants in that area. [end  recording]</p>

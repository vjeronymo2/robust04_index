			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian carrier may be saved COMPASS Airlines, the grounded Australian domestic airline, has a 50 per cent chance of flying again, Mr Ian Ferrier, the provisional liquidator, said yesterday. Compass stopped flying on December 20 after it was unable to pay fees of about ADollars 400,000 (USDollars 303,000) to the Australian Civil Aviation Authority. The airline lost control of its five leased aircraft when the owners began actions for repossession. Mr Ferrier said he hoped to avoid liquidating the airline, which has debts of ADollars 45.2m as a going concern, but added that it would owe ADollars 171.2m if it failed to return to the skies. He said the federal government had agreed to support a business plan under which ADollars 35m of Compass's debts would be converted to equity, and the airline would be provided with a standby credit facility of ADollars 10m. The business plan provides for an increase of up to 7 per cent in average fares, a greater effort to attract full-fare business customers, and more efficient operations. Mr Ferrier said there was a good chance that a large investor could be found that would inject fresh equity into Compass before February 4, when the Federal Court is expected to decide whether the airline can be saved. Mr Ferrier said the government had undertaken to give serious consideration to any proposed investment in Compass by a foreign airline. He refused to say whether any foreign airlines had expressed interest. Compass had talks with Air New Zealand shortly after ceasing operations, but it is thought to have decided against rescuing the airline. Mr Bryan Grey, the founder and chief executive of Compass, has agreed to stand down while the company is restructured by the liquidator. Attempts by Mr Grey to find a significant investor for Compass appear to have failed.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices After five or six weeks of hectic trading and rapidly rising prices the black pepper market has entered a quiteter period, reports Man Producten. Prices started to decline and buyers withdrew from the market, but we consider quite a normal development and there are indications that prices are stabilising already. Offers from origins remained limited to a small number of profit-takers only. Black faq spot Europe traded yesterday at USDollars 2,550 a tonne and in the US Market the ASTA grade was at 1.30 cents a pound, 5 cents lower than last week. White pepper prices were only marginally lower but the activity was equally reduced. Muntok white spot Europe ended Dollars 3,400 a tonne.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling attracts buyers THE POUND put on a strong performance yesterday in European currency markets, in spite of the uncertainty hanging over the UK government and a mixed batch of econ-omic figures, writes Stephanie Flanders. Sterling made rapid gains against the D-Mark in the morning's trading, reaching DM2.5750, before slipping during the afternoon to close at DM2.5650, still a pfennig higher on the day. At first glance, the pound's strength was surprising, when the possibility of a government defeat over the Maastricht treaty tomorrow and subdued monetary growth figures might have sent the currency in the other direction. Analysts, however, said sterling was being driven higher by the sense that it was a better investment opportunity than other currencies. The ERM currencies were yesterday again focused on the future prospects for German interest rate cuts, while the yen - still overshadowed by Japan's current political vacuum - suffered further losses yesterday due to a larger than expected fall in the country's leading indicators. In continental Europe, the French franc lost ground once again against the D-Mark, finishing in London at FFr3.417, a centime below Monday's FFr3.407. The Italian lira suffered even more against the D-Mark, ending at L935.3, down L8.5 from Monday's finish of L926.8. Although the yen continues to be sidelined by events in Europe, the Japanese currency fell yesterday when the country's index of leading indicators dropped from 63.6 to just 30. As a result, the yen declined to Y164.12 against sterling during the afternoon, down from a previous close of Y162.5. It later recovered to end at Y162.8. With the outlook cloudy for Japan and the core European currencies so unattractive, Britain's generally encouraging economic figures of recent weeks continue to attract dealers to sterling, argue many analysts. 'The sterling exchange rate is determined by the UK markets, not British politics,' said Mr Christian Dunis of Chemical Bank in London. 'Compared to what is driving most currency movements, House of Commons votes are somewhat esoteric.' For most of the day the dollar conspicuously failed to gain from tensions in the ERM. But the chairman of the Federal Reserve's comments to congress, indicating that the next move in US rates will be up rather than down, took the American currency higher in afternoon trading. The dollar finished at DM1.7090, up from DM1.7055. But in New York it closed at DM1.6997. The American unit also recovered against sterling, having fallen as low as Dollars 1.51 in the early afternoon. At the end of trading in London, the dollar stood at Dollars 1.5015 to the pound, a little below the previous Dollars 1.4985. In New York it retreated to end at Dollars 1.5105.</p>

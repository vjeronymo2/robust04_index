			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Greek Government will send Greece's reply on The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to UN special  mediator Cyrus Vance in the next few days, Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias said. He made the remark this morning shortly  before leaving for Washington where he will attend the signing  at the White House tomorrow of an agreement on the  Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papoulias is  going to Washington as president of the European Union's [EU]  General Affairs Council.    Answering correspondents' questions, the foreign minister  said that the reply to Vance will be sent through diplomatic  channels and described the Vance ideas as a good start. To  another question, Papoulias said he would meet in Washington  with Hans Van Den Broek, EU commissioner in charge of foreign  affairs, who, as the Greek foreign minister noted, submitted a  document to the EU to which the Greek side has replied.    Asked by correspondents what the Greek position would be if  the Turks sent troops to Bosnia, Papoulias stressed that the  Greek position was outlined in a communique issued by the  President's Office. Asked if Turkey is sending blue helmet  troops to Bosnia, the foreign minister said: A decision was  made on the party leaders' level. According to the communique  from the President's Office, Greece insists on its basic  position that no Balkan force should become involved. We  persist in attempting to avert such a thing and in persuading  those who want to send the Turks that this would complicate the  Balkan situation.</p>

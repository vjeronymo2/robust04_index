			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Put yourself in the picture - Computing Several times over the last year or two a customer has put a page from a PC magazine under my nose and asked: 'Why can't I have pictures like that on my computer?' The advertisement in question usually shows a screen from a personnel records database, and among all the lines of text describing the employee's address, national insurance number, salary and so on, there is a picture of the employee - usually a sultry brunette. Not only are managers interested in storing pictures of their staff on computer, especially sultry brunettes, but if they could hold pictures of their products that might be even more useful. An instantly-available picture on a computer screen could be invaluable for a salesman demonstrating a range of products, for an order clerk taking a customer order, or for anyone needing just to check what the product looks like. Pictures on a computer system mean graphics - and graphics mean Windows 3.1. Unfortunately, apart from a few cheap systems at the bottom end of the market, nobody writes stock control packages under Windows. They write them under fast, secure environments such as DOS and Unix, which do not lend themselves to graphics. Technical problems have made the idea impractical. Graphics files are enormous, with a single picture occupying several hundred kilobytes of disk. It would take an age to load the picture from disk into memory. And moving files of this size from one PC to another would bring your whole network grinding to a halt. Recently I have seen a product which solves these problems - DOSview. This provides excellent quality pictures and works with your existing stock program written under Dos, Unix, Novell or whatever. There is no need to reprogram the existing stock system, which continues to work just as before. You simply run DOSview alongside it. DOSview has been developed by Thinkware / JSS, a jewellery manufacturer and distributor which is now marketing it. Using DOSView you first take a photograph of the product and store the image on file. Thinkware use either a video camera or a scanner directly linked to the computer. The operator slides the piece of jewellery under the video camera, which then photographs it, transmits it to the computer and stores it as a 300k standard graphics (Tiff) file. DOSview then automatically compresses the Tiff file, reducing it from 300k to 8k, with only a marginal loss of picture quality. So DOSview has solved the first problem. It enables you to build up a database of pictures, each of which is a manageable size. Displaying the picture is simplicity itself. Suppose you are running your stock control package and want to see a picture of stock item number 123456. Simply highlight the number 123456 and press an F key. DOSview looks through its database, and displays a picture of item 123456 in a window on the screen. You can zoom to display the picture over the full screen. You can show pictures of several items at once and even in full-screen mode the quality is good. DOSview runs under Windows. It links to your existing stock package by saving the number 123456 to the Windows clipboard as a graphics image, and comparing this image with the list of part numbers in its own database of pictures. No other link is required. The beauty of this approach is that it bypasses a host of technical problems: no need to interface with proprietary file formats, the curse of accounting software; and no problems integrating Windows-based graphics with other text-oriented operating systems. I spoke to two users of DOSview. Both were enthusiastic. One runs a 15-user Unix system. He said DOSview had taken half a day to install and has worked perfectly since. The other had teething troubles but said this was partly because he had bought some of the equipment himself. DOSview is an assembly of equipment made by different manufacturers. A start-up package of a software, video camera, a beefy 486/66mhz 200mb PC to run the graphics and interface cards costs about Pounds 5,000. If you buy all the parts from Thinkware it takes responsibility if anything goes wrong. Several software suppliers have expressed an interest in DOSview. First off the blocks is SBS, whose Exchequer accounts package I have praised before (tel: 0202-298008). They will offer a DOSview link in their new order processing package due out in February. Other potential users are companies that have a stock or personnel system and want to upgrade it to store images. To date, the only options available have been time-consuming, complicated and expensive. Thinkware has provided a pioneering product which is cheap, ingenious, elegant - and works.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- During the official  visit by Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik to Kiev on 20  April, the heads of the military departments of Ukraine and  Estonia signed an agreement on military cooperation between the  defense ministries of the two countries. At a joint news  conference by the defense ministers that took place on the same  day, it was emphasized that Estonia and Ukraine have common  views--in particular, as far as international security is  concerned. According to Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy,  Ukraine's defense minister, a special commission will be set up  to work out the possibility of handing conventional armaments,  subject to reduction, to the Estonian side under barter  conditions. In Kannik's opinion, the granting of special status  to Russia in the "Partnership for Peace" program--if it joins  the program--is out of the question. Tallinn and Moscow cannot  find a common approach on settling the issue of withdrawing  Russian troops from the Estonian territory.    Radetskyy told journalists that he maintains regular ties  with Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and  intends to begin negotiations with him on 21 April in Sevastopol  concerning the final solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue,  negotiations that will last until 23 April approximately. The  head of the Ukrainian military department pointed out that  Ukraine would propose that Russia take the main base of the  Russian Black Sea Fleet--which Sevastopol would probably remain  as--for a term of five years. "However, such a proposal will  need to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament after it is  coordinated with the Russian side," said Radetskyy.    Radetskyy also informed journalists that social issues will  be a priority at the Black Sea Fleet negotiations. "On 20 April,  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk reaffirmed the fact that the  economic security of Ukrainian naval sailors and those officers  and warrant officers who would like to transfer from the Black  Sea Fleet to the Naval Forces of Ukraine would be the same," the  Ukrainian defense minister assured.</p>

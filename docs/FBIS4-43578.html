			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xavier Ventura: "Pujol Confirms That CiU Will </F> Not Alter Support for Government Despite PSOE's Defeat"]    [Excerpt] Jordi Pujol stated yesterday evening that CiU  [Convergence and Union] will not alter its support for the  government despite the poor results achieved by the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], as long as there is a program  understanding on autonomy and economic policy, and emphasized  that the victory in Catalonia represents "endorsement" of the  policy that CiU has carried out in Spain over the past 12 months.    The nationalist coalition's first victory over the Catalan  Socialists in elections other than autonomous community  elections confirms, according to Jordi Pujol, the "upward trend"  that CiU experienced in the last general election, within the  line of the coalition's "systematic and gradual" growth since  the beginning of the eighties. This growth, the Democratic  Convergence of Catalonia chairman continued, is more significant  since the turnout was not what Pujol had wanted, having turned  much of his campaign into a moral appeal to the Catalan people  to vote.    Jordi Pujol was emphatic in asserting that unless the  political circumstances in Spain change -- that is, if the PSOE  stands fast and is not affected by this defeat, or the People's  Party does not succeed in eroding its work -- Felipe Gonzalez is  assured of CiU's support, since "our availability for the  state's stability depends not on the European election results  but on the government's continuing with a policy that will make  it possible to tackle the country's problems with a chance of  success." In this connection, Pujol reiterated that the  economic policy is crucial if CiU is to continue its support for  the government, although he pointed out that changes in autonomy  policy are also necessary.    The CiU leader said that the coalition will not use the  PSOE's defeat -- of which he said that it was "a very serious  warning" to the government -- in order to "introduce" elements  that would hamper relations between CiU and the Socialists,  since the proposals that the Catalan nationalists will continue  to make will be of "general interest." Despite this, Jordi  Pujol emphasized on several occasions that these results could  affect Spanish politics and hence have repercussions on CiU's  stance, although he pointed out that this depends not on CiU  itself but on the government's continuing to retain the majority  that it needs for its activity: "Felipe Gonzalez has 176  deputies after these elections; the same as he had yesterday and  the same as he will have tomorrow," and so there will be no  changes in Spanish politics unless "internal forces" in the  Socialist Party or external to it change the current situation,  since "stability depends on the PSOE and the People's Party --  not on us." Pujol also deemed a government confidence motion  "neither necessary nor desirable," pointing out that the current  legislative term is much more effective than the previous one  with respect to the struggle against the economic crisis in  Spain.

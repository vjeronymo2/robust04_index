			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Time Products clocks up 22% advance to Pounds 9.3m WHEN THE chairman of Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution group, talks about the luxury end of his market he really does mean luxury. Some of the watches which Mr Marcus Margulies' group handles sell for several hundred thousand pounds each. Although Time Products also owns the mass-market Sekonda brand of watches, it is on the top end of the market that the group is becoming more focused. Yesterday Time Products reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.3m for the year to January 31, even although overall sales dipped from Pounds 51.1m to Pounds 49.6m. About Pounds 1.3m of the profits increase was non-recurring, comprising property profits and a released provision. Earnings per share rose to 12.6p (9.74p). A final dividend of 5.2p makes a 7.95p (7.5p) total. Mr Margulies said: 'The group's strategy in recent years has been to concentrate increasingly on the distribution of luxury branded goods both in the UK and overseas. This policy has been successfully implemented, with a growing proportion of turnover being in very high quality markets.' Time Products has exclusive agencies for several luxury watch brands - such as Blancpain, Longines and Vacheron Constantin. In March the group paid Pounds 2m for a 5 per cent stake in Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker which specialises in highly technical and luxurious pieces. The group recently moved into a new product area with the Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) acquisition of the business of Judith Leiber, an American who designs luxury designer handbags. Mr Margulies said of Judith Leiber: 'Its products have not been actively marketed outside North America and I am confident that there is a substantial potential for developing the brand on a worldwide basis. 'The name has also been largely unexploited on merchandise other than handbags and, in time, this will offer considerable scope for broadening the product range.' These most recent investments came together when Time Products was awarded the North American agency for Audemars Piguet, having distributed its watches in the UK for a number of years. A luxury watch showroom is now being developed at the premises of Judith Leiber in New York. The group said effects of recession were keenly felt in the distribution of its mainstream product lines. The Sekonda brand - which accounts for about 12 per cent of all UK watch sales - suffered from problems within the retail volume jewellery industry, in spite of a successful advertising campaign. Longines, which sells watches in the Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,000 bracket, maintained turnover. Last year Time Products closed Remex, its Hong Kong-based watch movement manufacturing operation. Yesterday's figures included an extraordinary profit of Pounds 1.2m, because the closure provision of Pounds 6.5m taken at the start of the period proved too pessimistic. Mr Margulies' family controls 20 per cent of the company.</p>

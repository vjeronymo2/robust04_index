			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: EDP beats recession with 29% advance to Pounds 2.41m ELECTRONIC DATA Processing, the expanding Milton Keynes-based computing services company, is reaping the benefit of its decision to focus on software at the expense of hardware with interim profits well up on City expectations. Despite a near-14 per cent fall to Pounds 7.47m in revenues for the half year to March 31, profits before tax rose 29 per cent, from Pounds 1.87m to Pounds 2.41m. EDP has emerged as one of a small band of computing services companies which has not only managed to raise sales and profits through the recession but seems set to continue its growth. Mr James Warhurst, analyst with Henry Cooke Lumsden, EDP's broker, anticipates profits of Pounds 5.2m this year and Pounds 6.2m next. Last year profits totalled Pounds 4.08m. Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 18.83p (14.69p) and an interim dividend of 2p (1.75p) is declared. The company has cash balances of Pounds 11.3m and is actively seeking to acquire software companies with products compatible with its own range. However, an agreement earlier this year to buy Applied Computer Systems, a Manchester-based private software house, has been abandoned. Mr Richard Jowitt, managing director, said he had been dissatisfied with the representation of ACS' assets. EDP's principal products are the Mentor line of supermini computer systems and Merchant, a software product developed for the wholesale distribution industry. Services revenues, representing maintenance contracts and software licence fees, were now more than Pounds 8m a year or more than 50 per cent of revenues. Mr Jowitt said the company would later this year release a software product aimed at environmental management which he expected to make a considerable contribution to revenues and profits. Trading conditions remained depressed, he added, but he expected to maintain a healthy position in the second half.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report: from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] The opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] held an extraordinary meeting of the Central Executive  Committee this morning to discuss how to deal with a  no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet which has been  submitted by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to  the Diet. During the meeting, a group of legislators led by  Chairman Murayama asserted that the SDPJ should submit its own  no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet in line with a  party decision that if the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en  masse, the SDPJ will demand the dissolution of the House of  Representatives and the holding of general elections, while a  group of legislators led by Secretary General Kubo claimed that  the SDPJ should vote against the no-confidence motion or abstain  from the vote, noting the importance of the SDPJ maintaining its  relationship with the coalition government. In this way, the two  groups split over handling the coalition government and as a  result, the SDPJ was unable to shape a consensus at the meeting.    SDPJ legislators held a meeting shortly after Prime Minister  Hata announced that his cabinet would resign en masse. During  the meeting, Secretary General Kubo said: As a result, the Hata  cabinet will voluntarily resign en masse as the SDPJ has  demanded. I intend to do my best to form a new coalition  government.    His remarks indicate that the climate has now been created  wherein the SDPJ can resume talks with the ruling coalition  parties about the SDPJ's return to the coalition government.    Chairman Murayama, however, said: Each political party and  each parliamentary group will make moves, and it is important  for the SDPJ to adopt perfect policies. I will do everything I  can to meet the party's expectations of me. In this way,  Chairman Murayama did not refer to the SDPJ's return to the  ruling coalition.    Democracy, the largest group in the SDPJ, has decided to  urge  the SDPJ leadership to return the party to the ruling coalition  after concluding that the conditions for the SDPJ to return to  the ruling coalition have been met.    Chairman Murayama will soon hold a news conference in the  Diet building to make clear the SDPJ's policy on the formation  of the next government.</p>

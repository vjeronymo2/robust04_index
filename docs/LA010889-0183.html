			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURTESY STILL EXISTS ON FREEWAYS  </P> <P> I had an experience I would like to share about a gentleman truck driver of a  double rig. I was coming on Interstate 5 going north, in San Clemente at  Avenida Palizada, trucks in the third and fourth lanes. This kind driver held  back, turned on his lights to give me the go-ahead signal and granted me entry,  courtesy of the road.  </P> <P> I noted the big red "S" for Safeway and have written the president of this  company. We hear and experience the rude truckers. Thank you kind driver. Wish  there were more like you.  </P> <P> MARY W. SCHLEIGER  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

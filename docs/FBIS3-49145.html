Where there was once a screen, there is now  an altar in front of which Walesa kneels each morning at 7:30  for Mass and Holy Communion. Then he goes back up the dark  marble staircase covered by a fake Persian carpet leading  directly to his office and to Poland's difficult problems.  Today these problems consist primarily in the success of the  right-wing nationalist extremists in the Russian elections.  This election result has created real concern among the former  communist countries of Europe, anxious to receive formal  protection from NATO against Russia's new expansionism. To date  Clinton has only offered the former satellite countries and  Balkan states a vague "peace alliance" plan that does not  satisfy their safety requirements when faced with the  developments in Moscow. On the other hand, many people in  Washington maintain that extending firm guarantees to these  countries could mean destabilizing Yeltsin at this difficult  time and strengthening the nationalistic tendencies, or else  they are simply contrary to expanding U.S. commitment in Europe.  All these problems will be discussed and decided upon in  Brussels at a 10 January NATO meeting that is acquiring  considerable importance for the future of the former communist  Europe. Lech Walesa is convinced that the future of his country  is being decided upon to some extent.    [Gawronksi] Mr. President, do the election results in Russia  worry you?    [Walesa] Yes, but what worries me primarily is the inertia  of  Europe, its lack of insight, its imperviousnesss to the  warnings, to the threats, that were and are more and more in the  air. For some time I have been saying that it is in your  interests, not ours, to expand the European Community, and that  NATO should be expanded toward the East. Let me explain: There  were two opposing blocs, one was the Soviet Union, which has  been temporarily dissolved, and the other, the West, which is  not getting bigger. What remains is a vacuum and politics does  not tolerate vacuums. If Europe and NATO were to decide to  gradually expand toward the former communist countries in Europe  in the short term, six months at the most, then the field of  confrontation would become smaller. Otherwise, we are back to  square one: Russia will take the initiative, it will exert  economic pressure upon us and other countries that are more  important than Poland, such as Ukraine; we will have to give in  to compromises, and the former Soviet bloc will be reformed,  even if it is no longer a Soviet bloc, and this will lead to  confrontation again. Russia already has unreliable politicians  who are attempting to bribe NATO and the rest of the world! Now  my question is: Why did we dissolve the Soviet Union, Comecon  [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the Warsaw Pact. To  remain alone and abandoned on a desert island? So, if Europe  does not wake up, we will be back to square one in five or six  years' time and this frightens me; because I don't know if  there will be another person capable of creating a new  Solidarity to set things right again.    [Gawronski] What should Europe do?    [Walesa] Follow the example of Clinton, who opened up to  Mexico with the NAFTA accord regardless of the country's level  of development: He realized it was in his interest to do so.  And it is in Europe's interests to extend itself toward the  East, encourage reforms, and invest. I have a theory: The cost  of reforms is in proportion to the distance of those that are  inspire them [sentence as published]. So you must start with  Poland and the other East European countries and then go on to  Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. We in  Warsaw are giving a warning cry. We find ourselves in a 1939  situation: People thought that the Germans wanted only Danzig,  but they changed their minds when the Germans reached Paris.    [Gawronski] You were alluding to Poland's entry into NATO.  But one of the problems is opposition by Russia. When Yeltsin  was in Warsaw some months ago, he seemed to agree, you succeeded  in persuading him, but when he returned to Moscow, he changed  his mind. Why?    [Walesa] He was certainly influenced by his military, but I  am sure he would not have changed his mind if the West had not  been so lazy and inactive. In my meeting with Yeltsin I threw a  ball into the West's court. When Yeltsin saw that the West  failed to pick it up, that it did not want to play ball, that it  was not interested in expanding toward the East, why should he  have committed himself? Therefore I believe the West is to  blame, not Yeltsin.    [Gawronski] But this bloc you forecast would be rather  heterogeneous given the recent elections: Over to the far right  in Russia, and with the former communists in power in Poland.    [Walesa] You people in the West judge everything according  to  your views and forget that we have not had political parties or  democratic pluralism for 50 years. The former communists won in  Poland not because they were communists but because they were  more active and more well-prepared, more accustomed to managing  power, than the others. They are ready to change their  membership card from red to green, and then to blue and yellow  and. The real question is: Will they be capable of  accomplishing what they have promised? I doubt so, and I think  that the parties that identify primarily with the principles  that were once those of Solidarity will have the time to prepare  themselves, acquire experience, and then chase out the  post-communists in the next elections.    [Gawronski] So, though you are worried about the results of  the Russian elections, one could say that you are not concerned  about the Polish ones?    [Walesa] Look, I think this is be an unavoidable experience  and it is better to experience it now than in 10 years' time. I  repeat, those who won are better prepared. They were the only  ones who could be better prepared, because they held the  monopoly of power in the past and presented themselves united.  They moved in a single bloc while the others argued. I would  have preferred to deal with others, but I think that neither  myself, nor my children will ever see the communists in power in  Poland. For the time being we must use them for what they are,  to reach our objectives, reconstruction, reforms, while keeping  them under control, naturally, to make sure that they do not  invert their course and to be sure that they respect pluralism,  liberty, and democracy. Before, communism was inevitable, now it  can be used even for our purposes.    [Gawronski] And what about those who have been defeated,  including yourself, how have they reacted to the victory of the  former communists?    [Walesa] Now one can see that I was right when I said not to  come down too heavily on the communists, not to dig up their  past, because they would only take their revenge later. I  opposed putting the left under too much pressure. Instead I  helped it, to prevent it doing the same thing again if the  opportunity arose.    [Gawronski] The pope, who has always been a reference point  for you, has said that there is a basis of truth in communism.    [Walesa] Much can be said about the past, but one must  recognize the fact that they were times of greater social  equilibrium, without such bitter differences in the standard of  living. Today there are people who are nostalgic for this past.  But we must not be: We must decide. The change will be slow  and difficult, but there is no going back.    [Gawronski] What political system would you like for your  country?    [Walesa] I do not like capitalism but nothing better has  been invented yet. I would like a humane capitalism, that takes  account of the poor, the sick, the destitute, but that also lets  the rich live in peace.    [Gawronski] Let us talk about yourself a little. The  popularity polls are not very good. Are you worried?    [Walesa] I am certainly no Miss Poland and neither am I the  primate of Poland, who has no political responsibility, which is  why, among other things, he no longer appeals to the people.  But I think that nobody has done for this country more than I  have done. I am working for Poland and nobody can accuse me of  having made mistakes. As for the polls, they are biased and are  not important.    [Gawronski] Now you are a little alone here in Belweder  palace. Do you ever finding yourself thinking with nostalgia  about the times of Solidarity, your old friends Michnik,  Geremek, Mazowiecki, Kuron, and all the people that you have  almost no contacts with any more?    [Walesa] Certainly, I would like to be 18 or 20, but that is  impossible; I would like to go back to the times when everything  was simple: One was either for or against communism. But after  our victory we did well to split, otherwise today there would be  a Solidarity party, a Solidarity parliament, Solidarity laws.  In practice we would have reconstructed a monopoly of power  under another name. We would have ended up enjoying the taste  of power. We would have ended up with an Italian model, with an  elite looking after its own interests only, without any links  with the grass roots, and in the end the grass-roots would have  risen against us.    [Gawronski] What concerns you about your country?    [Walesa] Certainly not the communists. In all my life I have  met only one real Communist, and that was not even in Warsaw  among the authorities, but in Danzig at the Lenin shipyards,  where a worker was such a Communist that they expelled him from  the party. As for the rest, I have faith and hope. An  intelligent Jew once said to me: "Don't worry when things are  going badly, they can only get better." We find ourselves  precisely in such a situation.</p>

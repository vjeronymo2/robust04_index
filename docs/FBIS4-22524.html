			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Shelkovnikov, chairman of </F> "Rosaeronavigatsiya" [Russian State Commission for Airspace Use  and Air Traffic Control], by V. Karpiy: "We Are Prepared for an  Open Dialogue"]    [Text] I am certain it is not necessary to introduce  V. Shelkovnikov, the chairman of the Commission for Air Traffic  Control [ATC], to most of our readers, because his name has  appeared very often in the pages of VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT  throughout the newspaper's history. Some will remember him as  the chief of the TsUVD [Air Traffic Control Central  Administration], as the chief of the GlavUVD MGA [ATC chief of  the Ministry of Civil Aviation], or as the president of the  International Aviation Safety Fund. Friends will recall that,  aside from the 27 years he has worked in the ATC Service, there  were years spent in polar aviation, in the Nothern Civil  Aviation Administration, and in supervising the group testing  the first automated system--"Start." Generally speaking, he has  served in all the positions, right up to chief of a zone center,  and then the Main Center... And now he is in air traffic control  once again. And this is how we began our interview.    [Karpiy] Valeriy Georgiyevich, 4 years ago you left the  civil  aviation ATC Service which you headed for more than 6 years, and  then suddenly 6 months ago you returned. What compelled you to  make such an important decision in both cases?    [Shelkovnikov] There were several reasons why I left the  position as head of such a large service as ATC, but I will tell  you about the principal one. In 1989, when it had already become  completely clear that the coming years would bring very big  changes to the country's civil aviation, I realized that I had  no right to take part in this process without knowledge of the  principles and standards of the world aviation community, from  which we had been very carefully sealed off for a long time.  Especially taking thousands of people with me... Then the idea  developed of forming an independent public organization--the  Aviation Safety Fund of the USSR, which has now become  international. I was named its president, and in my 5 years of  work there I went through an excellent "academy" of civil  aviation, where I learned a great deal. For that reason, I began  looking at a number of things which one would think were obvious  through entirely different eyes.    But I returned to the ATC Service in June 1993. Frankly  speaking, this return was also very unexpected for me. The fact  is that when I worked in the FAB [Aviation Safety Fund] I had  occasion to work with controllers and meet with the heads of  services as before. It is still a mystery to me why they decided  to ask the prime minister to appoint me as president [sic] of  "Gosaeronavigatsiya."    [Karpiy] How did you feel when you learned of this request?    [Shelkovnikov] If I had known where I was going, I would  have  been a little more conceited person, and I probably would have  considered this very flattering. But...it is clear that each of  us has to bear his own cross.    [Karpiy] You said that you knew where you were going. Six  months had passed since then. Didn't you have to modify your  views on the state of affairs in the ATC Service and the  processes which were and are under way in it?    [Shelkovnikov] Practically none. Extremely complex  processes,  which are painful at times, are under way in our service and in  civil aviation as a whole. I realize that they are unavoidable.  Previously, all aviation operations were under the Ministry of  Civil Aviation. Today, in line with the government's concept of  air transport development, which I consider correct, airports  are detached, airlines are being formed, and the ATC Service is  defining its place in this process. But because it was built up  and developed as a unified organism for decades, it is not so  simple to divide it into parts, and painlessly as well.    [Karpiy] And the ATC Service, I think, is affected more than  others. The things that it is being blamed for, including the  charge that it is almost paralyzing air traffic...    [Shelkovnikov] The wage rates and fees? All the expenditures  on air traffic control will make up 6.8 percent of civil  aviation's overall expenditures in 1994. Is this a big or a  small amount? But who has tried to understand whether this is a  great organization, whether it has been maintained and is being  modernized in good time? I do not think many will answer with  knowledge of the matter.    [Karpiy] But tell us...    [Shelkovnikov] Today, the coordination and planning of  airspace use and air traffic control in the Russian Federation  is being handled by centers of the Unified ATC System and ATC  departmental organs. So Russia's YeS UVD [Unified ATC System]  has 142 centers; one of them is the main center, eight are zonal  centers, 70 are regional centers, and 63 are auxiliary air route  centers.    We are responsible for flight safety on every one of the  239,903 kilometers of airways in Russia. As of 1 June last year,  more than 2,500 pieces of basic electronic equipment, more than  17,000 units of communications equipment, and so forth were  being operated in our services. Impressive?!    And all this should function without interruption, smoothly,  and absolutely reliably, for if something happens, a crew in  flight will be deaf and blind. But after all, our service has  very expensive equipment which requires heightened attention by  many thousands of persons with the highest qualifications.    Multiply what I have told you by the confusion in the  economy, the inflation, the nonpayments, the severe price  increases for every part, assembly, and unit, for what we need  to keep mobilized, trained, disciplined, and highly intelligent  people in the service when there is almost an "individual hunt"  for each one of them by commercial structures and while you are  faced with something which very remotely resembles a budget  which would keep the service "afloat."    And besides all this, there are the lives of millions of  persons for whom the controllers bear responsibility. So you be  the judge--whether 6.8 percent is a large or a small amount. And  I have only raised the edge of the curtain we work behind. Add  here the support for especially important flights, use of the  airspace by the VVS [Air Forces], Naval Aviation, specialized  aviation, general aviation, and departmental airplanes and  helicopters.    [Karpiy] The ruble and the dollar are considered to be of  primary importance today. You mentioned the "hunt" for aviation  specialists by commercial structures, where the earnings are  higher and the work is a little easier. Have you received offers  from the commercial interests as well?    [Shelkovnikov] Yes, they have made offers. But inasmuch as I  am here, I do not think it necessary to explain what I chose.  Moreover, after returning, I was both glad and proud of my  comrades--a great many first-class specialists and managers of  services had remained on the job and did not change their work,  which they had chosen as a career. Although they have had to  stand the siege and are still besieged from various sides,  including from their own families at times. And this is under  conditions in which it is becoming harder and harder to work.    [Karpiy] Why? Didn't you list all the factors--inflation,  nonpayments?    [Shelkovnikov] No, not all of them. The main problem is the  equipment we are using, which has been worn out by a factor of  42 percent on average. And this means that it is deteriorating  more and more each day and requires more and more attention and  expenditures of labor and finances. Unless this process is  brought under control, 82 percent of the equipment will be worn  out in 5 years. We cannot permit this--after all, we bear the  responsibility not only for our fellow countrymen and our  airways--foreign airlines are also flying here. And since they  bear responsibility for our fellow citizens when they fly in  foreign airspace, we are just as responsible, under  international laws, to ensure safe passage by foreign aircraft  over our territory.    But how do we do this when there is equipment somewhere in  the North which was sent by the Americans under Lend-Lease  during World War II? If all the automated airway ATC systems  date from the periods of their development--1971 to 1980? I  could continue this list for an extended period, but it is clear  that this problem cannot be solved without major capital  investments. And without this, the principal task cannot be  performed--the reason why the ATC Service was formed--provision  for flight safety. Unfortunately, this is the opinion that  exists in the country: "These are your problems, so you resolve  them."    This an extremely incorrect approach. During my work in the  FAB I had occasion to study this matter thoroughly in various  other states, and only where the society--the people--consider  it to be their direct responsibility to provide for flight  safety is it equal to the occasion. After all, it is not for  nothing that one of the first truths in the "ICAO [International  Civil Aviation Organization] Aviation Accident Prevention  Manual" states:    "If in your opinion the cost of safety is too high, it means  you know what an aviation accident is."    The world aviation community and all civilized peoples are  contributing immeasurably more to flight safety than we are.  Sooner or later there will be a critical change in the public  consciousness here, but we must not pay for this change in  blood. But we are paying, you know--the latest tragedy in  Irkutsk is an example of that.    [Karpiy] But you are aware of the country's budget  situation,  and how many holes there are in it.    [Shelkovnikov] And that is the reason we are looking,  looking, and looking to see where we can save the airlines'  money.    Straightening the routes. What is this? It is saving fuel  and  the service life of aircraft. Jointly with the Genshtab [General  Staff], we are planning to save 5 billion rubles per year in  this operation alone. This is an unlimited field for activity,  and we have asked the airlines to send their suggestions.  Altogether, 15 have responded.    But after all, pilots all over the world are flying where it  is not prohibited, unlike here, where we fly only where it is  has been authorized.    I am certain if we succeed in making the best possible use  of  airspace, we will eliminate the fuel crisis in aviation.    One more example: at present only 5.8 percent of Russia's  airspace, a very small amount, is open for international  flights. The route from Europe to Asia is over Russia, and the  more airways we open, the more profit we will receive from air  navigation fees. Foreign airlines are waiting for these routes,  they are prepared to pay us and prepared to invest money in the  ground equipment for these airways--if only the length of time  their aircraft spend in the air is reduced. But in carrying out  this work we are running into dozens of obstacles and we have to  prove the obvious truths to many departments.    [Karpiy] But does the opposite happen?    [Shelkovnikov] It happens, but not often. Valeriy  Mikhaylovich Zubov, a doctor of economic sciences and head of  administration for Krasnoyarsak Kray, asked us to "open"  airspace equivalent in area to five Frances over the kray's  territory. We fulfilled his request, and a government decree was  issued on 10 November 1993 "opening" 28 sections of  international airways over Krasnoyarsk. He stated in addition:  "I realize that the controllers have no money..." and he is  undertaking the organization...of a joint-stock company whose  responsibility would be to equip the airways and train people.  This person understands that if aviation is the only  transportation for most of the people in the kray, who should be  concerned about aviation if not the local authorities?!    [Karpiy] Valeriy Georgiyevich, you cited quite a few  problems  whose importance is indisputable. All the same, aren't there  sore points which require priority attention from you personally?    [Shelkovnikov] The Moscow AUVD [Automated ATC] Center. Some  15 years have passed since it was put into operation. The roof  has not been maintained here, the displays have begun breaking  down... But after all, the Moscow Zone is one of the most  saturated in the world. We are now concentrating our efforts  here to rectify the situation.    We have a big problem with the Rostov "Strela" system. This  is in the south of Russia, the exit to the Black Sea. It has  been 12 years since it was built and it has completely exhausted  its service life. But how can we close this zone, where aviation  is being rapidly developed now? Stavropol, Anapa, Sochi,  Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, and Mineralnyye Vody have become  international airports and "Strela" is the "step" to them. We  are looking for the means to get out of this very difficult  impasse.    Kaliningrad. One of the independent states has undertaken  the  control of air traffic in space belonging to Russia without its  consent here. This took place 2 years ago, and now the situation  must be rectified and this area must be modernized.    There is no end of work in the Far North and the Far Eastern  region.    [Karpiy] Where you had to limit traffic density, which  resulted in a heated response everywhere?    [Shelkovnikov] Yes. This followed a near miss by two Boeing  747's on opposite headings in the Khabarovsk Zone. One of them  belonged to the Japanese All Nippon Airline, and the other to  British Airways. They moved apart in direct proximity to each  other. According to the scientists' conclusion, the risk of a  collision was three times greater than what is acceptable.  Tragedy was avoided only because collision avoidance equipment  was available on both aircraft. The crew of the British Airways  aircraft received the command "To the right and up," and the  Japanese aircraft received the command "To the right and down."  A stressful situation for the crews and passengers were  injured...    The causes? Our first impression was that a person, the  controller, was at fault. When we investigated more thoroughly,  we realized that we were not looking for the guilty person  there. Organizational flaws--this is what nearly led to a  disaster. The cutback in personnel and the absence of an  operator put an excessive load on the controller. He did not  receive the command from Tokyo and did not expect the two  aircraft to be heading toward each other. There was no radar  control or relay transmitter. Economizing on the means needed to  provide for normal communications--these are the main  "culprits." It is good that the commission included  psychologists, who demonstrated that a person was physically not  in a position to resolve the situation. Well, there were quite a  few claims made against the Far Eastern Region management, of  course.    This time, they managed...    [Karpiy] But what if they hadn't? You will forgive this  cruel  question.    [Shelkovnikov] There would have been three national  tragedies--in Russia, in Britain, and in Japan, since dozens of  people would have perished.    And if we add to this that the British Airways aircraft was  insured for $1.2 billion and the Japanese aircraft was insured  for $1 billion, who would have paid this money? Russia has no  insurance for the risk of collision, while Singapore, New  Zealand, and Great Britain have such insurance coverage even  when an ATC system much more reliable than ours is available.    [Karpiy] So we must be insured...    [Shelkovnikov] We also need amounts much higher than in  those  countries I mentioned. The worse the system, the greater the  risk of collision, and hence the higher the insurance rates. It  is a vicious circle.    [Karpiy] And you caught it from our press...    [Shelkovnikov] At the scientists' recommendation, we chose  the lesser of two evils before completing modernization of these  sections, that is, before March: we have limited the density of  air traffic. Incidentally, we are not the first to take such a  step; this is a normal practice throughout the world. The lives  of innocent persons cannot be risked under any conditions. Even  if we have to incur financial losses.    [Karpiy] As far as I know, you sent a commission to  Khabarovsk which was almost equivalent in composition and powers  to those that the government assigns for catastrophes.    [Shelkovnikov] During my 3 years with the Aviation Safety  Fund, I managed to size up the conceptual approaches to disaster  prevention which exist in the world. They are very simple.    The first truth is that the persons at the top must concern  themselves with safety and not delegate this part of the work to  anyone. No matter whether it is the president of a country, the  head of an administration, the president of an airline, the  commander of a crew... Because safety is a most sacred thing.    The second truth. If there has been some violation in one  field of human activity or another, we should thank God that a  disaster did not occur. And the incident should be investigated  as if there had been a catastrophe.    There has been a dangerous convergence of aircraft... It can  be "farmed out" to local aviation authorities. Will they  investigate it objectively? Will they have enough resources,  knowledge, and experience? I don't know.    But if there had been a disaster, a government commission  and  hundreds of people would have been involved. So thank God there  was no disaster, and do everything possible right here, with the  fresh tracks, to find all the causes which nearly led to a  disaster and exert every effort to ensure that there is no  recurrence on a larger scale. And psychologists must be on the  commission. Often only a specialist in the area of human  psychology is in a position to determine why a controller, a  pilot, or an engineer acted in one way or another.    It is not difficult for an administrator. He quickly finds  the guilty party and states: You have violated such and such a  paragraph, such and such a point..." And that is all. But where  is the guarantee that someone else, perhaps even more  experienced, will not make the same mistake?! The aviation world  has abandoned searches for a guilty party--there are numerous  other services for this. The aviation world looks for the  reasons for errors and ways of preventing them. And it is  putting a large amount of funds into this work. Because there is  nothing minor in aviation, and what is at first glance a most  insignificant near miss may result in an avalanche of events  leading to a catastrophe.    Do you remember what went on here quite recently, just 10 or  12 years ago?    [Karpiy] When even the term "flight safety" was not used and  they spoke about "the quality of flights?"    [Shelkovnikov] Absolutely correct. If there were a disaster,  you know, they quickly looked for the guilty parties and issued  an order on two or three pages, as a rule, even with a "secret"  classification--and that was all!    And here we have come to the third truth. Throughout the  world, when there has been an accident and the cause has been  found, a very powerful propaganda machine is put into action. We  read in the ICAO document: a highly effective means of  preventing aviation accidents (AP) is the publication of  information bulletins on the cirucmstances and causes of  accidents and incidents and a graphic illustration of the events.    If a pilot has learned from the mistakes of others and the  incidents in which they were involved, there would be less...    Until we reach the point where I can purchase a book on a  catastrophe at any kiosk (in the United States, for example) and  carefully study at home everything related to it and what led to  it, we will incur losses. Our specialists have nothing to study.  There are no aviation newspapers or magazines for the general  reader as well as the specialist. In America you can buy and  inquire about the huge volumes published by the Bureau of  Accident Investigation. And there you will find information  about what took place, and why and where it took place, as well  as recommendations on how to avoid a tragedy. And the airlines  buy these materials, they study them, and they learn from  others' mistakes.    There is propaganda for you! But here? As far as I am aware,  your only newspaper in the world's largest aviation  power--VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT--is barely remaining "afloat."    [Karpiy] If not worse...    [Shelkovnikov] So what kind of preventive measures and  propaganda on aviation accident prevention can we speak about if  we have no means of influencing the minds, the feelings, and the  conscience of a person who works in a very complex field such as  civil aviation?! There are many questions.    [Karpiy] Yes, you are right, there are many questions. I  would like to learn your point of view in more detail on a  critical problem such as air navigation fees; on participation  in accident investigation by associations of controllers,  pilots, and other public professional organizations; on your  attitude with respect to controllers' strikes; with respect to  the disintegration of the former union's unified airspace; and  about the prestige of the controllers' profession. Moreover, I  am certain that not only we journalists, but your allies and  opponents, are prepared to take part in a discussion of these  and other problems related to the activity of  "Rosaeronavigatsiya."    [Shelkovnikov] We are prepared for an open dialogue with  everyone for whom aviation and everything associated with it has  become their life's work.    [Karpiy] Thank you for the interview.</p>

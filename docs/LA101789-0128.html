			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSTANG CLUB BACKER TELLS JURY OF SHOOTING THAT BLINDED HIM  </P> <P> Mustang Club investor C. William Carroll, blinded in a shooting two years ago,  used hand motions Monday to describe to jurors in a rare Orange County  racketeering trial how both his assailants held him down before firing three  bullets into his head.  </P> <P> This morning, Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. is expected to take jurors  to the loading dock of the courthouse in Santa Ana so that Carroll can  demonstrate what happened in the same rented Honda in which the shooting  occurred.  </P> <P> Carroll, 57, dabbing his watering eyes with a handkerchief, identified Joseph  Angelo Grosso, now on trial, as the man who drove him and Los Angeles racketeer  Michael Anthony Rizzitello into an empty Costa Mesa parking garage on May 1,  1987. Carroll claims that Grosso then held down his leg while Rizzitello,  seated directly behind him in the back seat, grabbed him around the neck and  shot him. Rizzitello's trial is scheduled to follow Grosso's.  </P> <P> Prosecutors claim that Rizzitello, 62, wanted to take control of the Mustang, a  topless bar on Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana, which has since closed. But  Carroll, prosecutors contend, was viewed as uncooperative and had to be  eliminated. Grosso, 46, prosecutors say, used his connections to Carroll to  help set up the assault.  </P> <P> The Grosso/Rizzitello trials have drawn much interest from law enforcement  officials in the region because of Rizzitello's longtime connections to the  leading organized crime family in Los Angeles. Rizzitello has a long history of  racketeering and fraud convictions, but he has long been under investigation as  a possible top enforcer for the mob family.  </P> <P> Although Monday was the first day of testimony in the prosecution's case  against Grosso, it was Grosso's attorney, William Yacobozzi Jr., who in opening  statements dominated most of the day with bold accusations that at the time of  the shooting, Carroll, himself, was involved in everything from drugs to loan  sharking to murder.  </P> <P> Carroll is attempting to get back at Grosso, the lawyer contends, because  Grosso was an FBI informant and was feeding some of Carroll's crime admissions  to investigators. Part of Yacobozzi's attack strategy is to convince jurors  that Carroll is a suspect in "two to five murders," including the New Year's  Day, 1987, shooting death of Jimmy Casino, manager of the Mustang bar. Casino,  prosecutors claim, had borrowed more than $300,000 from Carroll to open the  Mustang in the early 1980s, and the Mustang corporation still owed Carroll  $140,000.  </P> <P> "Did you have anything to do with the murder of Jimmy Casino," Yacobozzi asked  Carroll during cross-examination.  </P> <P> Jurors turned their eyes to Carroll for his reaction. Carroll, clutching at his  handkerchief, appeared unruffled by the question, and answered slowly:  "Absolutely, unequivocally, no."  </P> <P> Carroll waited 1 1/2 years after the shooting before telling authorities who  had wounded him. But Carroll explained Monday that he wanted to wait until  after resolution of a fraud case pending against him. He ended up pleading no  contest to a misdemeanor in that case and received no time in jail.  </P> <P> "I thought that if I spent even one day in the County Jail, I probably would  not come out alive," he said, explaining that he feared Rizzitello would have  him killed in the jail.  </P></p>

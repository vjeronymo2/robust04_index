			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / More institutions use voting rights INSTITUTIONAL shareholders are far more likely to vote on corporate matters than they were two years ago. A survey by the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, an umbrella organisation of leading shareholder groups, found that voting rights were exercised on average by 34 per cent of the largest institutional holdings in 20 of the largest companies in Britain. The corresponding figure in 1990 was an estimated 20 per cent. The survey examined the 20 largest institutional shareholdings in each of the 20 companies. Mr Julian Potter, secretary-general to the committee, said the increased propensity to vote might reflect the growing view among shareholders that they were the owners of the companies they invest in.</p>

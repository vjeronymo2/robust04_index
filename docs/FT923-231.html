			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (33): Business Ps and Qs THE COMPLETE BOOK OF BUSINESS ETIQUETTE: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO GETTING AHEAD IN BUSINESS by Lynne Brennan and David Block Piatkus Books Pounds 8.99, 185 pages IN THE American Wild West of the last century, you had to park your shooting irons before entering a saloon; before gaining admission to the restaurant in the London Ritz, the customer is nowadays invited to park his mobile telephone. And I am told that the food is not too bad either. This little gem of information comes my way from The Complete Book of Business Etiquette, a compact guide of all the essentials needed to get on in business. For example, we are told that uncultivated behaviour at business meetings exposes 'who is garrulous, but ill-informed; who is well-informed but a poor communicator; who is dynamic but emotionally driven; who has integrity and who may be treacherous.' Don't we all know someone in at least one of those camps? But do not gossip about them within the company, since that, too, is not etiquette. It can also be downright harmful, since when gossip and rumour are malicious and destructive, they can harm careers, business relationships, even the company itself. So, no malicious gossip, and no other contraventions of corporate or individual business etiquette. For example, no firm handshaking of Japanese businessmen, and certainly no slapping on the back. Master the art of Japanese bowing - which is not too easy, since there are said to be 26 combinations of depth and quality of bows. On the other hand, firm handshakes are very much the thing in the Arab business world and, after a long period of acquaintance can even develop into a warm embrace and kisses on the cheeks. But we warned: non-Arab women must not be touched under any circumstances. All in all, says the wide-ranging guide, good business etiquette is of enormous importance in business today; it will help your company to win and keep its customers and will also help to win promotion and personal success. Not a bad promise for a practical book costing less than the strawberries and cream at Wimbledon.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Mrs T still arouses voters' passions IT'S a funny old world. Nearly five years ago, on May 15, 1987, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - mistress of all she surveyed - proclaimed the triumph of popular capitalism to euphoric Scottish Tories in Perth in her first salvo of the general election campaign. Yesterday the former prime minister started her contribution to the current contest by pressing the flesh in a dowdy pedestrian precinct at the opposite end of Britain. It was a poignant illustration of the fickleness of power. In her 1987 speech the tone was characteristically martial and moralistic. Socialism was in retreat. Labour had 'lost its grip on reality'. There was a strong moral case for reducing taxation. Yesterday, far from the perils of Labour's 1987 'iceberg-manifesto' - with one-tenth of its socialism visible and nine-tenths below the surface - the outgoing MP for Finchley spent a tranquil afternoon crossing the Solent. Among the few convictions she voiced was her belief in the policies of her 'excellent' successor. 'They were my policies first,' she said, alighting at Cowes. The purpose of yesterday's south-coast visit was to lend support to Mr Christopher Chope and Mr Barry Field, MPs for Southampton Itchen and the Isle of Wight respectively, and faithful bearers of the Thatcherite standard. Neither constituency is exactly marginal - both MPs have the luxury of 6,000-plus majorities - but neither is traditional Tory territory. Mr Chope defeated Mr Richard Mitchell, the Labour defector to the SDP, in 1983. Mr Field upset the Liberals four years later, winning the seat in the slow-paced holiday and retirement island. It was curious, then, that Mrs Thatcher came dressed predominantly in black. One could only conclude it was in deference to Mr Field's profession - the family firm is big in crematoria - rather than a prediction of the result on April 9. As she emerged from the offices of the Southern Evening Echo, flanked by a beaming Mr Chope, a hearty cheer went up from the 150-strong crowd of shoppers milling around. There was hissing, too - and the contrasting reactions continued as she proceeded, at the centre of a frantic media scrum, in the general direction of Ratner's. '"What about the poll tax?' shouted some. Others yelled: 'Maggie, we love you.' Clearly Mrs T had lost none of her ability to arouse both adoration and deep antipathy. She-who-must-be-obeyed still has the power to inflict mortal damage on Mr John Major's campaign by lifting a finger out of line, as his advisers well know. That was the sub-text to the gift of flowers to her from the prime minister this week. Conservative Central Office will be mightily relieved when her campaign  - started Friday the 13th - ends with a transatlantic flight on April Fool's Day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 8 (AFP) -- Talks on the deployment of  a peacekeeping force for the separatist Georgian region of  Abkhazia have been postponed until next Tuesday [12 April], UN  spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said.    The talks, scheduled to have started Friday, follow a  ceasefire signed Monday by Georgia and Abkhazian separatists  which allows for multinational peacekeeping force to be sent to  the breakaway republic in northwest Georgia.    The meeting, to be headed by Butrus-Ghali's special  representative Eduard Brunner, is to deal only with military  aspects of the agreement such as the number and deployment of  the maximum 2,500 troops.    The trickier question of Abkhazia's status will be discussed  in Geneva on April 19 at a meeting of the two sides, Russian and  UN facilitators and members of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, the spokeswoman said.    Last week's ceasefire agreement aimed to help the return of  some 250,000 Georgian civilians who have fled the area in more  than a year of war, and holds out the possibility of  far-reaching autonomy for Abkhazia within Georgia.    Talks on the return of refugees began Friday in Sochi in  Russia, presided over by Russia and the UN High Commission for  Refugees [UNHCR], Gastaut said.    On Thursday, the two sides accused each other of violating  the ceasefire which had been signed in the presence of UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev.</p>

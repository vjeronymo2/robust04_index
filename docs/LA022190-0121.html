			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NEXT, THE WORLD: During an otherwise routine meeting in Anaheim Tuesday of the  Walt Disney Co. (D5), Italian language Disney comics were displayed, as were  possible Mickey Mouse magazines in Russian, Polish and Hungarian. . . .  Shareholders also heard Miss Piggy singing "Some Day My Prince Will Come" in  French for a Christmas special on European TV. . . . That happy tune wasn't  being sung at the park, however, by performers in Disneyland's Golden Horseshoe  Revue, who are out of work, at least for now (F2).

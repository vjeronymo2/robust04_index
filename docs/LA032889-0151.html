			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> SHELBY HOMERS IN 13TH AS DODGERS BEAT METS  </P> <P> It wasn't as dramatic as Kirk Gibson's 12th-inning, game-winning home run in  Game 4 of last year's National League championship series, but John Shelby will  take it.  </P> <P> Shelby hit a two-run homer with one out in the bottom of the 13th inning Monday  to give the Dodgers a 5-3 exhibition victory over the new York Mets.  </P> <P> It was Shelby's second homer of the spring and his second hit of the game.  </P> <P> It hasn't been a good spring for Shelby, whose batting average had dipped to  .174. But he said he has been more concerned with working on his timing and  batting stroke than hitting for average.  </P> <P> "It was nice to get this homer, but the spring hasn't been frustrating for me  at all," Shelby said. "I'm down here in a position where I can work on some  things and that's what I've been doing.  </P> <P> "In the past, I've had to fight for a job every spring. Now I have a job and  I'm in a situation where I can work on things and I'm taking advantage of it.  </P> <P> "The work I've been doing may not show up in the statistics, but I'm not  worrying about that right now. It's going to pay off during the regular  season."  </P> <P> Shelby's homer came off Jack Savage (0-2) after a single by Chris Gwynn.  </P> <P> Rookie left-hander Mike Munoz, who blanded the Mets on one hit over the final  two innings, was the winner.  </P> <P> Gwynn went 3 for 6 to lead the Dodgers' 12-hit attack, while rookie outfielder  Mark Griffin had three hits in his first spring start.  </P> <P> Eddie Murray had two hits.  </P> <P> Gregg Jeffries and Mackey Sasser had two hits each for the Mets, who had only  eight hits off five Dodger pitchers.  </P> <P> David Cone was the Mets' starter, and he pitched six strong innings, allowing  the Dodgers two runs on six hits while walking three and striking out four.  </P> <P> Dodger rookie Ramon Martinez allowed the Mets two runs in his five innings on  the mound, giving up three hits and striking out one.  </P> <P> In a split-squad game Monday at West Palm Beach, Mike Davis had a two-run homer  and a double in a 10-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves.  </P> <P> The Braves had 17 hits, including four each by Jeff Treadway and Andres Thomas.  </P> <P> Treadway, acquired for a reported $50,000 Saturday from the Cincinnati Reds, is  now 5 of 6 for the Braves.  </P> <P> Treadway, a second baseman, had an RBI single in a five-run fourth inning off  loser William Brennan (0-1) as the Braves sent 10 men to the plate and had six  consecutive singles.  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson, who came up with a sore right shoulder following his second spring  game Sunday, participated in a limited workout Monday.  </P> <P> Gibson did not swing a bat, but ran and shagged fly balls. He was re-examined  by team physician Dr. Frank Jobe, who said he still believes the injury is not  serious.  </P> <P> The Dodgers announced they have traded minor league catcher Gilberto Reyes to  Montreal in order to retain the rights to right-hander Brian Fischer.  </P> <P> The Dodgers had selected Fischer off Montreal's triple-A roster in the major  league draft last December. If Fischer had not made the opening-day roster, the  Dodgers would have had to offer him back to Montreal for half the drafting  price of $50,000.  </P></p>

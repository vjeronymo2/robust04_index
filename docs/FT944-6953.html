			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Travel: On the Cherokee trail - by llama - Mark Hodson spends a night haunted by the Indian spirits and ghosts of America's past 'Hold on to your llamas,' said Laura, 'and whatever happens, don't let them eat the rhododendron leaves.' We grabbed the reins and set off on a trail into the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. There were 13 of us, including two guides, and six llamas each carrying 100lb of food and camping equipment. We would be sleeping out for just one night, but this was America so no one thought it strange that we had packed tables, chairs, inflatable mattresses, a few bottles of chardonnay and enough food to feed a small village. Up close, our porters were surprisingly handsome. They had soft fluffy coats, large doleful eyes and, contrary to expectations, they neither spat nor had fearful breath. In fact, llamas like to check humans for bad breath. Each animal walked up to us in turn and took a quick sniff before deciding we were friendly and harmless. For reasons that were never explained to me, llama trekking is taking off across the US and there are 50 or 60 specialist tour groups from Washington state down to Georgia. Our hosts on this trip were Laura and Mark Moser, a young couple who live on a small farm in Swannanoa, North Carolina, where they breed llamas with the loving devotion of a Doctor Dolittle. The animals behaved impeccably in every department but one. None could resist the lure of the overhanging rhododendron blooms which dangled enticingly from their branches, plump and white like forbidden fruit. We were not being cruel by denying them the chance to nibble, for rhododendrons are toxic to llamas and just a few mouthfuls can kill. As we ambled through the forest, over carpets of moss and through glittering mountain streams, the animals would make sudden, darting lunges at the poison leaves and we had to tug hard at their reins. Our group was a random mix of mid-America. There was a lady from Indiana, a couple from Michigan, a young family from Charlotte, North Carolina, and a couple from upstate New York who had brought their teenage daughter for her graduation present. The children fell for the llamas immediately. An eight-year-old girl called Barney took charge of Cherokee, the smallest, and was so indulgent with him that he managed to grab a big mouthful of rhododendrons. Laura spotted the lapse and chased him through a brook to yank the leaves out of his mouth. 'I had to massage his gums to make him let go of it,' she explained. 'They like that.' Llamas tend to be docile and calm, even a little aloof, but each of our animals had a distinct personality. Buckshot was a burly 400-pounder and a natural leader, Jakarta grumbled constantly with a running commentary of sighs and grunts. Lancelot, the eldest at nine years, was getting short-tempered and listless as he edged towards retirement. All were male: the presence of females can cause the animals to squabble or show off. We tramped in single file beside high waterfalls and through thick fern. Mark pointed out honey locust and cherry trees, tulip poplar and doghobble. If we ran out of food there was always wild yam and Canadian hemlock which we could flavour with sweet shrub leaves. When our feet grew tired we could boil down the bark of the dogwood tree, which Confederate troops discovered during the Civil War had pain-killing properties similar to those of aspirin. Every half hour or so we halted for 'potty stops'. When one llama decided to relieve himself, the one behind would get the same idea starting a chain reaction. We set up camp in a clearing on a ridge with views of the dense forest below and, after pitching our tents, found we were just yards from an Indian burial ground where some two dozen unmarked graves were arranged in a rough square. Once, all this had been Cherokee land. In the 1830s the tribe was driven west to Oklahoma on what became known as the Trail of Tears. It was a shameful episode in America's history and people in North Carolina still hang their heads a little when they speak of it. Around 500 Cherokee resisted the move and holed out in the mountains until 1840, when the government allotted them a 56,000-acre reservation near the Tennessee line. Some say Indian spirits still haunt these hills. I had been on the reservation the previous day and it was a grim sight. The main settlement was a tatty strip of cheap motels, souvenir shops and 'bar-b-q' shacks. At the Honest Injun Trading Shop, tourists bought plastic tomahawks and Cherokee toilet-roll holders made in Taiwan. There was a tattoo parlour, a tumbledown clapboard house with a sign advertising 'FISHING PERMITS, PIG SKINS,' and half a dozen teepees by the roadside where for Dollars 5 you could pose for a photograph with a tribal member in full head-dress and face paint. The Indians call this 'chiefing', their contempt fuelled by the traditional belief that a camera can steal your soul. Along the road, poverty could be seen through every broken shutter pane. Outside the tourist season, almost half the 7,500 population is registered unemployed and the only serious money comes from two bingo halls on the reservation. All forms of gaming are outlawed in North Carolina and most surrounding states. When a Dollars 100,000 jackpot game is held on the reservation, coaches pour in from across the south-east as far away as Florida and Alabama. Some people come just to stare at the natives. Good ol' boys with farmers' tans and baseball caps cruise by in 1970s Chevvies and customised Pontiacs, flicking cigarettes out of their car windows. This is redneck country now. Billy Graham lives just down the road and bumper stickers declare allegiance to family values. Up on the ridge, darkness had fallen. The llamas had settled down for the night. We built a campfire and Mark and Laura cooked kebabs, wild rice and squash stuffed with peppers and mozzarella. We talked, as Americans invariably do at meal times, of food: jambalaya, grits and pig-in-a-blanket, the southerners' poetic name for sausage rolls. The conversation stopped dead when a barn owl screeched from a treetop and maybe one or two minds turned to the Indians buried nearby. If their spirits still haunted these parts, what would they make of us? What were these white folk doing here with their zip-up teepees and Andean pack animals? Had they driven thousands of people from this land to use it only for this? In the morning I woke early to find my tent flooded. The sleeping bag was damp and my shoes were soaked through. The rain gods had spoken. Mark Hodson travelled as a guest of American Airlines (Tel: 0345-789789) which flies daily direct from Gatwick to Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. Laura and Mark Moser are at 450 Old Buckeye Cue Road, Swannanoa, NC 28778 (Tel: 010 704 299 7155).</p>

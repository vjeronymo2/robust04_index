Gold bullion accounted for 129,639 kilograms of the imports,  followed by 1,858 kilograms of gold coins, the spokesman said.    In 1992, he noted, Taiwan imported 174,603 kilograms of  bullion and 2,813 kilograms of gold coin.    The World Gold Council attributed the decreasing imports to  declining prices in international markets, which in turn  affected people's willingness to hold gold, the spokesman said.    The Geneva-based World Gold Council was established in 1986  to promote global trade in gold investment and ornaments as well  as in industrial usage.    The Taiwan Liaison Office was set up in 1992, bringing the  number of council offices to around 20, the spokesman said.</p>

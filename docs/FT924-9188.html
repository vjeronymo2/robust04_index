			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Tisco blames drop on steep devaluation TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest private-sector company, yesterday reported a sharp fall in half-year net profits to Rs502.2m (Dollars 17.6m) from Rs1.04bn, despite a 28 per cent rise in sales. Mr Russi Mody, chairman, attributed the poor results to 'steep cost escalations outside the company's control' and the impact of the sharp devaluation of the rupee. Sales advanced to Rs15.37bn from a revised Rs12bn for the same period of 1991, despite the recession in the Indian steel industry. The news of lower profits depressed company's share price 14 per cent to Rs266 a share, and was part of the reason for the fall in the Indian stock market yesterday. Mr Modi said inflation had meant higher labour costs and substantial increases in railway freight, power and petroleum prices. Imported raw materials had become more costly due to the 22 per cent devaluation of the rupee. Mr Modi, did not give any full-year projections. The group plans a Rs30bn expansion and diversification programme, to be completed by 1994, to raise production capacity from 2m tonnes to over 2.7m tonnes. It also plans to commission two power plants, thermal and diesel-operated, to augment inadequate power supply. Tisco's performance in the coming years will depend on its ability to maintain supplies of raw materials like iron ore and coal from captive sources, and capacity utilisation. With the decontrol of steel since January this year, the company will be better placed to choose the most profitable product mix.</p>

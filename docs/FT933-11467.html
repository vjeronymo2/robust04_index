			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries Sir Patrick Sheehy's lot is not a happy one. With Philip Morris playing merry havoc in the US cigarette market, the Bishopsgate bomb blowing a Pounds 24m hole in Eagle Star's profits, and the cumulative losses from mortgage indemnity insurance climbing towards Pounds 1bn, BAT has suffered its fair share of setbacks. Great though these concerns may be, however, they still represent relatively minor pinpricks in BAT's thick corporate hide. Sir Patrick's greater grouse must be that the stock market steadfastly refuses to ascribe a 'fair' value to BAT's underlying cash stream. The wave of negative sentiment has largely obscured the marked cyclical upswing in BAT's insurance business. Despite the recent bounce, BAT's shares have still underperformed the market by 12 per cent since the start of the year, while the composite insurance sector has outperformed by 6 per cent. Despite praiseworthy efforts to release shareholder value, BAT remains a stock market anomaly. Applying a pure tobacco company multiple to the earnings BAT derives from tobacco suggests its insurance interests are seriously undervalued. The reverse exercise of valuing BAT's insurance businesses, however, implies its tobacco interests are almost thrown in for free. A minority flotation of BAT's tobacco businesses would surely represent one means of realising additional value. Yet it seems doubtful BAT would take the step without external stimulus. Sir James Goldsmith, where are you now?</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Spain heads European performance tables GOVERNMENT bond markets continued to post positive returns in October, as European bond markets benefited from the Bundesbank's cut in key interest rates. According to JP Morgan's government bond index, Spain was the strongest performer in local currency terms, posting returns of 3.3 per cent over October. Spanish 10-year bond yields reached a historic low of 8.43 per cent, following a cut of 75 basis points in the Bank of Spain's repo rate over the course of the month. German bunds offered gains of a relatively modest 1.58 per cent, while the US Treasury market came bottom of the league table with returns of 0.32 per cent. For the year to date, Spain and Italy are each offering around 28 per cent. For unhedged US dollar-based investors, the appreciation of the dollar against most currencies, with the exception of the Australian and Canadian dollars, held down returns. The Australian bond market posted the strongest returns for an unhedged US dollar based investor, with 5.39 per cent in October. The Australian market performed even better for sterling-based investors, according to Kemper Investment Management's government bond market index, which shows a 6.05 per cent return in sterling for October. SIXTY per cent of UK company treasurers believe sterling's suspension from the European exchange rate mechanism is favourable for their companies, according to a survey of 70 treasurers by Record Treasury Management, which advises on currency risk. Only 10 per cent consider sterling's exit from the ERM unfavourable, compared with 25 per cent in last year's survey. However, 69 per cent would support rejoining in a different structure, either using 'wide' bands (45 per cent) or as a move to a single currency (25 per cent). An overwhelming 96 per cent oppose controls to curb currency speculation.</p>

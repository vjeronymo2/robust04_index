			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Russia clouds reform path The first day of the summit between the Russian and US leaders produced some pro-reform rhetoric and a commitment from President Boris Yeltsin to confirm Mr Anatoly Chubais as a deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, pronounced his president, and himself, pleased: 'Reform is going right ahead: there was unanimity of opinion on this,' he said after talks yesterday with Mr Yeltsin, and separately with Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance. Sources in the reformist camp say, however, that the reappointment of Mr Chubais was the fruit of an appeal from the Russia's Choice group, led by Mr Gaidar, to Mr Yeltsin to increase the number of radicals in the cabinet - without which Russia's Choice would refuse to participate in government at all. Still unknown is the future of Mr Fyodorov, who has said he will not serve either with some of the more conservative members of the present cabinet or with Mr Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman. Further, Mr Chubais's programme of privatisation does not directly impinge on the drive to hold down inflation, restrict credits and attack the budget deficit - the central macroeconomic issues which are most in contention between the radicals and the conservatives. Thus the day's good news for President Clinton and his team - in the form of assurances of continued reform from Mr Yeltsin - must be balanced by the questions which remain open. First, what will the cabinet's programme and policies be? It has as yet no budget for the first quarter of this year - and is faced with the terrible problem of accommodating at least Rbs6,000bn estimated to be the spending which should have been committed at the end of last year but was delayed or cut in order to get last year's deficit down to under 10 per cent. If, as the US leaders claimed yesterday, there was a 'unanimity' on the need for reforms, these decisions cannot again be finessed - but are very hard to square with the announced intention of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, in his speech to the State Duma on Tuesday to avoid future shocks. Second, what will the west's assistance consist of? Mr Bentsen and his senior officials have made it clear both that they expect the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to be the lead agencies in providing support to the Russians. US officials want them, especially the Fund, to be less fussy and much more active in getting funds into Russia. 'The issue,' said one official, 'is not less conditionality on the part of the Fund, but less passivity.' This line is now the accepted one within the Group of Seven. Mr Bentsen made the point obliquely yesterday, when he showered praise on Russian success in stabilisation - the budget deficit down from 20 per cent of GNP at the end of 1991 to 9 per cent at the end of 1993, inflation down from 30 per cent to 12 per cent a month last year, wages up three times in real (dollar) terms. 'When the president heard this,' said Mr Bentsen, 'he said, 'this message must get out'' By which he meant: this message must be accepted by the Fund and the Bank. However, the Fund and the Bank made it perfectly clear in their joint note published last week that they believe they cannot lend because the Russian government has been unable to deliver on reform.</p>

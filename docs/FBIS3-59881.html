			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arye Qizal: "IDF (Israel Defense Forces) 2000: </F> Taking No Chance"]    [Text] This is the situation: at least until the end of  1994, the IDF [Israel Defnse Forces] will pay the price of the  peace. More reserve duty, more attacks, more current security  duty. Only at the end of 1994, they hope in the military, will  it be possible to begin to enjoy a few of the fruits of the  peace. Less reserve duty, fewer attacks, less current security  duty. More training for war.    The IDF work plan for the coming year, on the preparation of  which they are now busy, is based on the assumption that the  spirit of the agreement of principles--and the emphasis is on  spirit--will only blow in the territories a year from now. Until  then, the refusal organizations and the opponents of the  agreement will heat up the region.    The goals of the work plan are not much different from those  of the past year. The combat reservists will serve more. The  noncombatants will serve less. What can be done, this year, as  well, the fighting part of the military will continue to bear  the burden. The length of the girls' service will be reduced,  millions of shekels will be cut from the current expenditures.  Procurement of advanced weapons will continue. The scout units  will go into a lower gear. Their objectives may change.    The pull-out from Gaza and Jericho and the new deployment in  the territories, which will be completed in a few months, will  cost money. The new regular soldiers will be directed to duty in  the territories, to replace the reservists. The armored corps  will be equipped with Merkava 3 tanks, the Air Force will  receive the F-15E and the F-16, whose purchase Prime Minister  Yitzhak Rabin agreed to this week in the United States. The  artillery corps will improve the 155-mm cannons, the corps'  workhorse. The IDF training plan will proceed slowly. If the  situation in the territories is a good surprise, it will be  possible to direct units to orderly training.    A senior person in the defense establishment explained this  week: "The agreement with the PLO will not allow the IDF to get  smaller, to close units, and to reduce the burden of reserve  duty in the territories. The months that passed since the  signing can be instructive on the extent to which, at this  stage, we are talking about illusions. The field has its own  rhythm. There are attacks and there were attacks, and there is a  need for deterrence. If everything "ticks" as in the agreement,  and the PLO takes matters in hand--things will change towards  the end of 1994, or at least then we will be able to experience  a tendency to change.    "Only then, at the end of the year, will we be able to see,  for the first time since 1987, a decline in the need to allocate  so many forces to tiring and wasteful current security duty. But  those are hopes. The need to defend the Jewish settlements in  the territories and the need to redeploy army points will  require money, resources, and, especially, days of reserve duty.  And everything is at the expense of the training program, which  suffered during the years of the intifadah."    The agreement of principles, the Taba talks, and the Cairo  talks led the Planning Branch in the General Staff to work on a  new multiyear work plan.    Aside from the regular annual work plans, Mirkam, a  multiyear  plan that reaches to 1998, is being implemented in the IDF. The  plan talks about a reduction in forces, about raising quality,  and about equipping with modern fighting systems in the armor,  on the sea, and in the air. Mirkam is a smaller, more efficient,  and higher quality military.    And what is after 1998? Please meet: "Tarash 2000," the new  multiyear plan. In the Planning Branch, headed by Major General  'Uzi Dayan, they have already begun to discuss "Mirkam's" heir.  The plan is meant to foresee the changes that will ensue from  the agreement with the PLO and the future agreements with Syria  and Lebanon.    In the IDF they were frightened this week by the publication  in HA'ARETZ of the name of the plan. In the high ranks they  feared political interpretations. The military was already burnt  by the involvement in "drawer plans" for a withdrawal from the  Golan and changes in the border with Jordan. Each time that the  issue arose, the IDF denied it: "We are planning for withdrawal?  No way!"    A senior officer explained this week: "There is still no  talk  about a new multiyear plan, rather only the determination of  preliminary principles for planning. Only in the course of 1994  will the men of the Planning Branch sit down for real work, and  that, too, is conditional on an evaluation of the situation that  will obtain at the time. Diplomatic changes will be included in  the new plan, but we have not yet begun to plan anything and  there are still no basic assumptions. There is no point in  building interpretations."    With or without commentary, Tarash 2000 will deal with the  Israeli concept of security, with the structure of the military  force, with its size, with the relation between air force and  ground forces, with various combat scenarios, with development  plans, and with procurement. The plan will attempt to prevent a  situation of signing of procurement contracts with entities for  whose wares there may be no need in a few years. The plan will  try to envisage the changes in the region on the basis of what  is expected "to be closed" at the negotiations table. For the  first time in years, the leaders of the military will have to  examine the manner of handling long-range threats, including  nuclear ones, and to propose updated situation evaluations.  Every arm, as is customary, will try to present "its" threats as  the central ones.    A senior officer related to the emphases of the plan: "We  will have to provide answers on the subject of manpower. The IDF  will have to examine the possibility of returning to a regular  training plan, which will lead to a serious reduction of the  burden of reserve duty. It will be necessary to determine the  character and the organization of IDF civilian employees. The  work will be based, among other things, on a report that was  written by a committee headed by Major General (Res.) Herzl  Shafir. The committee recommends that consideration be given to  a reduction of four months in the compulsory service of males."    In the IDF they estimated this week that in the course of  1994 the issue of a reduction of compulsory service will come up  again for discussion. In the military they already know the  story. As the idea comes up, so it will go down. "This is  already a regular ceremony. There is nothing new in it," said  the senior officer, "It is not realistic to cut the compulsory  service when tasks are added, when there is a new deployment,  without us having knowledge of what will happen in the  territories, and without it being clear to us what will be the  effect of the withdrawal from Gaza and from Jericho on internal  security."    In the event that Jordan and Syria join the diplomatic  circle, they estimate in the Planning Branch that it will be  possible to reduce the IDF order of battle. The terror in the  territories will die down, and it will perhaps be possible to  improve dramatically the training framework--to allocate  resources to a new armor training program and an investment in  training installations.    A senior armor officer estimates how the peace will affect  the black berets: "The moment that the armor will not sit on the  Heights and in the Valley, we will be pressed into two  areas--the Tze'elim installation and an additional area in the  south. We must plan how we will sit with so much armor in such a  space. I would have preferred that already a year ago they had  dealt with that."    "Diplomatic agreements will allow us to carry out a  revolution in the simulation installations and to divert to  training the money that is today directed to current security.  It is a tremendous opportunity to put the armor through a  process of modernization in society, in which the army will  become less and less popular. In any event, in the next seven  years it will not be possible to cut significantly the armor  order of battle, certainly not the regular forces."    "Even if we arrive at agreements, we will need a strong  regular armored force. On the subject of the reserves, it will  be possible to take risks and to cut. The Yom Kippur War taught  us that if we had one more regular tank brigade--the Syrians  would not have been able to break through."    Maj. Gen. (Res.) Uri Or, the chairman of the Knesset Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee, also thinks that in the coming  years the IDF will not become smaller. Or: "Up to the year 2000,  there cannot be any significant change in the size of the  military. Only one change is required: the replacement of old  weapons with new ones. At the same time, we will reduce the  burden of reserve duty, we will train more, and we will carry  out a revolution in maintenance."    Or estimates that it will be possible to cut the compulsory  service a bit. "I foresee that approaching the year 2000 the  question will again arise whether we need a popular army or an  economic army. The IDF will want the possibility of drafting  only the best. The public will resist."    Or does not envisage a decline in the defense budget, rather  a significant decline in its share of the national product. "If  the agreements prove themselves, we will be able to weigh the  threats and to assume that in the coming circle they will  decline and therefore it will be necessary to give greater  weight to the air arm."    Former air force commander Maj. Gen. (Res.) Avihu Ben-Nun  holds that the IDF will have to continue to invest in the skies.  Ben-Nun scatters illusions about the contraction of the  military. "Our deterrent force must remain for many years. The  Middle Eastern reality is fluid. We have seen how things can  change overnight in the nearby states. The component of the  threat and the component of the deterrence are intertwined in  our reality. If the borders change--the need for deterrence will  only grow."    "If Israel will not have a real deterrent," he warns, "we  can  find ourselves in a war. Iraq and Iran had a peace agreement,  and Saddam opened a lightning war. A deterrent force is strong  and quality air power."    Ben-Nun argues that one should not denigrate the quantity of  air power: "If you have a lot of strikers and forwards--you need  a lot of goalkeepers. We must take into account a scenario of  "war within peace" against a crystallized and aggressive  coalition. It may seem far-off, but in another 10 or 15  years--or less--it could be real. Our quality must be in the  area of the platforms--in advanced aircraft, in helicopters, in  weapons, in guided and precision ordnance, in electronic  countermeasures--that will ensure technical superiority.    "The physical performance of the airplanes, such as range,  will be a minor component of quality. The complementary  components must be radars and sophisticated weapons. The Air  Force must receive more, because it is the most flexible, and  with a relatively small force can arrive at big achievements. In  the Air Force it is possible to use quality. In other arms,  quantity is necessary."    Colonel (Res.) Dr. Ze'ev Eytan, a researcher in the Center  for Strategic Studies, holds that "the army of peace" must  continue to be strong. He seeks to warn against euphoria and  proposes to expect with worry the instability of Arab regimes.  "All of those who are talking about Iran and about Iraq as  central threats in the year 2000 forget the danger of  instability in the confrontation states. I do not foresee a  possibility of reducing the military significantly, unless  astounding democracies arise in the region. I foresee that the  IDF will be able to go over to a defensive strategy, and to  continue to operate with offensive tactics. The IDF will have to  take into account the possibility of striking a preventive blow  and afterwards passing the attack over to the enemy's territory.  This approach is especially correct if the borders change to our  disadvantage."</p>

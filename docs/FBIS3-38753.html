			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the recessionary year of 1993 west  German industry had to reduce its output by an annual average of  7 percent compared with 1992. As the FRG Economics Ministry  announced on Wednesday [2 February] by presenting the December  results, according to preliminary calculations, output increased  slightly by 0.5 percent in price and seasonally adjusted terms  during the last month of 1993 compared with the previous month.  However, the Federal Statistical Office expects this result to  be "corrected downward." Nevertheless, the ministry stresses  that "all the main groups of the producing industry" with the  exception of electricity and gas supply are affected by the  (currently existing) increase in output; this is most marked in  the construction sector with an increase of 5 percent following  unusually cold weather in November.    At the beginning of January, the ministry reported a decline  in overall industrial output by 2 percent in November compared  with October 1993. According to the two-month comparison of  November/December over September/October 1993, which does not  show so many oscillations, net industrial output declined by  only 1 percent. Only the electricity and gas suppliers were  able to raise their output by 1.5 percent, while construction  output went down by 3.5 percent. This two-month comparison  shows that processing industry output was down by 1 percent.  This primarily affected investment goods, at minus 1.5 percent,  as well as essential and nonessential foods and beverages, minus  2 percent. Compared with the November/December 1992 period,  west German industrial output went down by a total of 2.9  percent.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |November and December 1993/November a-|  |                                      |nd December 1992 (change in percent)  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Producing industry overall            |- 2.9                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Processing industry                   |- 2.9                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |-- basic materials and producer goods |+ 3.7                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |-- investment goods                   |- 6.5                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |-- consumer goods                     |- 3.5                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |-- essential and nonessential foods a-|+ 0.1                                 |  |nd beverages                          |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mining                                |- 7.2                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Electricity and Gas Supply            |+ 3.4                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction Sector                   |- 8.0                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

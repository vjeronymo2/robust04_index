			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Currencies to remain under strain THE EUROPEAN Exchange Rate Mechanism should now live at least another week, if in a slimmer and weaker form. But the severe monetary strains within Europe, which the French referendum campaign has highlighted, will not go away and may intensify over the coming weeks and months. Europe's finance ministers may have breathed a sigh of relief as early reports suggested a narrow vote in favour of the treaty. The initial reaction in the currency markets was muted, following the first exit poll, suggesting that traders did not intend to test the resolve of the French government to hold its parity with the D-Mark, at least for now. A No vote would mean even greater turmoil during the course of today. Two conclusions can be already be drawn from the events of the past week: the era of the hard ERM involving almost all of Europe's currencies is over; and a two-speed monetary regime is likely to persist for some months. Two devaluations and two departures from the system over the past week have broken the realignment taboo which has reigned since Italy realigned in January of 1990. The events of the last week have demonstrated that when the markets want a a weak currency to devalue there is little that the national monetary authorities can do except acquiesce. So it is far too early to tell whether or not there will be more realignments within the ERM over the next few weeks. The peseta and the Irish punt, along with the franc, remained near the bottom of their trading bands at the end of last week. Dealers may yet decide that Spain, like Italy and the UK last week, will not be able to sustain its current high interest rate policy without a much larger devaluation. Both Italy and the UK appear to have decided they are better off outside the ERM, at least for the time being, after the bruising and expensive events of the last week. Both countries made it clear over the weekend that they would not re-enter the system until German interest rates have fallen further. But the great uncertainty is whether the ERM can survive at all as anything more than a northern European greater D-Mark zone. What matters most is the stability of the link between the franc and the D-Mark. A No vote would almost certainly have meant a run on the franc and probably a French devaluation or even withdrawal from the system. An emphatic Yes vote might have meant a more rapid move to north European monetary union. But last night's marginal result resolves nothing. The closeness of the French vote, and the uncertainty over whether the Maastricht ratification process can be completed, make it doubtful whether the ERM will now evolve into monetary union, at least for the foreseeable future. Will the French elite be able, and the public willing, to tolerate more of the same policy of high interest rates, high unemployment and slow growth now that the goal of monetary union appears to have gone? And would the increasingly friendless, but now more powerful, Bundesbank be willing to support the franc if it does now come under pressure within the ERM, something it was not willing to do for the lira or sterling last week?</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WIKE FOLLOWED THE GENERAL PLAN  </P> <P> On Jan. 16, in a spate of political demagoguery, the Rancho Palos Verdes City  Council, led by pro-overdevelopers Jacki Bacharach, Mel Hughes and Doug  Hinchliffe, removed Luella Wike from the Rancho Palos Verdes Planning  Commission.  </P> <P> Luella consistently adhered to the General Plan and tried to preserve the  Rancho Palos Verdes ambience to the maximum extent possible.  </P> <P> In fact, would you believe that the reason Bacharach said she voted against  Luella was because Luella was "overzealous"! Yes, indeed, Luella was  overzealous. She insisted on researching and studying the proposed development  projects. She wanted input from staff, she was responsive to the City Council.  </P> <P> As if this one action were not bad enough, the (council) appointed Robert E.  McNulty as chairman of the Planning Commission. Should we remind the residents  that Mr. McNulty was thoroughly discredited in the last election? Out of a  field of eight candidates, Mr. McNulty came in seventh! In fact, two of the  "new" commissioners, McNulty and Peter Van Hagen, consistently voted against  the residents and violated the principles of "Save Our Coastline" during their  prior terms as commissioners.  </P> <P> We do not want to sound like a Cassandra, with doom and gloom, but frankly,  fellow residents of Rancho Palos Verdes, our time for a beautiful, semi-rural  atmosphere in our city is fast running out. Welcome to Santa Monica!  </P> <P> AUDREY CARLAN  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

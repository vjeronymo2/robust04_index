			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Arts: 'The Big Picnic' in a battlefield - Theatre Bill Bryden's latest epic extravaganza, The Big Picnic, concerns a bunch of Scotsmen fighting in the First World War. It has several visual wow effects, of which the main one is that the audience moves (part of it is moved on a vast galley lined with seats) from the 'Glasgow' end of the huge Harland &amp; Wolff Engine Shed (in Govan, Glasgow), to the 'trench' area in the middle (real trenches dug amid six or more feet of surrounding earth and mud), and so into the final waste land of the battlefield itself, pitted and baked. And it is accompanied by music of several kinds. There are no great surprises for those of us who have heard even a little about the Great War. We are taken through the horror of innocent young men being killed or transformed by warfare; and we see famous events such as Germans and British exchanging cigarettes and playing football on Christmas Day, and also the Angel of Mons. Some of these incidents are presented sharply enough to prompt me and other audience members to laughter or tears. But elsewhere to yawns. For The Big Picnic keeps us in the Shed for almost four hours. And it is woefully underscripted. (Bryden himself is author and director.) It is astounding how often ordinary sentences or phrases are repeated to no good purpose. 'That was the devil's work,' says Hughie Frizell ponderously, 'the devil's work, 'cos it was murder, murder.' 'You always know,' says Norrie Beaton lugubriously, 'you always know.' Pause. 'You always know.' Thin, thin. Thin. Also slow, slow. Slow. And heavily amplified, so that voices usually emanate from nowhere near the actors and a heavy echo follows every utterance. The next problem is John Tams's music. I do not care to hear scenes of death and battle in the Great War accompanied by sub-Elton John songs, and I think blasts of electric guitar and drumming are a cheap way to suggest gunfire. There is some visual excitement in the way this muzak is played, high above the action, by a group of musicians and singers on a galley which also moves from end to end of the action. The vocalists sing mainly slow folksy numbers in folksy style (ie flat), but the worst element is the percussion, which adds an appalling monotony to everything it joins. Much better are the songs, dances and music played and performed by the performers. In general, the performances are fine, and would be much better if encouraged to move at twice the speed. Jimmy Logan is Colours, who turns this bunch of volunteers into soldiers; Iain MacColl is the dour Gus Adams, who becomes the toughest fighter of them all; Stuart Bowman plays the half-reluctant young warrior Russell Enoch; Derek Riddell is the more mercurial Norrie Beaton. Morag Hood and Juliet Cadzow lead the female contingent in a variety of roles. Oh, yes, the Angel of Mons. After Angels in America I have grown so used to seeing angels that I feel like Joan of Arc. This one, however, is the worst to date. With deep red hair, she hangs, usually upside down, from the musicians' gallery - a cumbersome sensational effect trundled out for the same symbolic effect time and time again. Her most spectacular effect is to pick up a corpse and to bear him in her arms, as she hangs in the air, until she passes out of sight. You just watch and pray she never drops the poor blighter. Show me a group of bright young Scotsmen going to their deaths, show me them sharing cigarettes with the enemy on Christmas Day, and I blink back tears as fast as the next person. Travel me from the Glasgow Docks to the uneven terrain of the battlefields and trenches and I too am astounded. (William Dudley's design is altogether the evening's highlight.) But there is an awkward mix of sentimentality and sensationalism about all this. We watch these young Scotsmen face the prospect of their possible deaths - and then, ghoulishly, we zoom along to see, from ringside seats, whether they indeed live or die. Meanwhile drums and cymbals thwack out a 4/4 beat in the air above our heads. At the Harland &amp; Wolff Engine Shed, Govan, Glasgow, until October 30.</p>

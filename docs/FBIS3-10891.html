The  increase annoyed President Itamar Franco, who demanded that  measures be taken. Before learning that he had been dismissed,  Gastao asserted that the rate hikes had been suggested by Jose  Milton Dallari, special Finance Ministry adviser on pricing  policies.    Franco demanded that it be determined who was responsible  for  the increase. From that point on, those responsible for pricing  policy in the Finance Ministry and in the Mines and Energy  Ministry tried to dodge responsibility. Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso himself began to absolve his advisers  of blame. He asserted: "Neither I nor Dallari authorized this  increase. The reasons for it should be sought in the Mines and  Energy Ministry."    Yesterday Fernando Henrique said the price adjustment was  "unacceptable": "Rates were increased without my approval.  Someone is going to have to pay for this, because it goes  against the stabilization plan."    According to Cardoso, an agreement between the Finance  Ministry, the DNAEE, and the public energy contractors estimated  that the increase should be based on the average increases of  the past four months, which would have been approximately 38  percent. According to the minister's estimates, electric power  rates accumulated a real increase of 8.6 percent last October.    Stepanenko refused to comment on the reasons that compelled  him to dismiss Gastao. He said: "I made the decision in  exercise of my authority, and do not wish to discuss it."  Stepanenko is now trying to figure out what to do with the  increase: He can either cancel it, or compensate for it in the  next adjustment.    Gastao defended himself: "The initial order was to transform  rates into URV's [real value units]. But we then received a  counter order not to do so, and to continue using the parametric  formula. That order came from Dallari." The parametric formula  takes into account the operational costs of each of the  enterprises of this sector.    Israel Vargas stood up for his director: "Gastao was in  constant contact with the Finance Ministry. The minister and I  were probably duped in our good faith by factors beyond our  control."</p>

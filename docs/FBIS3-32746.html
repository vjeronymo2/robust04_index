			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Midday" newscast] </F>   [Text] Andres Pastrana Arango, presidential candidate for  the New Democratic Force Party, assured today that President  Cesar Gaviria and his advisers were very strict in their  interpretation of the Constitution with regard to sovereignty.  He recommended, however, that the president meet with the  Foreign Relations Commission. Here is what Andres Pastrana  Arango said:    [Begin Pastrana recording] The president, for whom I have  all  due respect, should have met with the foreign relations advisory  commission to clear up the situation. In my opinion, it still  is not too late, because if international treaties currently in  force are used as an argument, the honorable members of that  body can offer ideas on how to avoid personal traumas as well as  call off the process at the commission to investigate charges.  [end recording]    I have not given my opinion at the last minute [words  indistinct] Pastrana Arango said, recalling that at the given  time he had spoken out on the issue.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: OMV expects to end year in profit OMV, the Austrian oil group which the government is planning to merge with the Verbundgesellschaft utility, expects to make a positive operating profit this year. The company said it would make operating losses of around Sch500m (Dollars 47.2m) for the first half of 1992 but would end the year with a significantly positive result. Wolfgang Ruttensdorfer, finance director, said half-year figures were not yet available but he expected OMV's second-quarter performance to match the first when an operating loss of Sch247m was incurred. Richard Schenz, interim company chairman, said he expected the company's performance to improve in the second half. OMV's energy operations, suffering from bad oil refining profit margins, had poor results in April and May. But there was a significant improvement in profitability in in June.</p>

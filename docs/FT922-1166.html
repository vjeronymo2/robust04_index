			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Samsung applies to join vehicle producers SAMSUNG, South Korea's largest conglomerate, yesterday applied for government permission to become the country's sixth vehicle manufacturer. Samsung Heavy Industries, the group's shipbuilding unit, plans to produce construction vehicles, such as concrete mixers and dump trucks, in technical co-operation with Nissan Diesel of Japan. Samsung's entry into the vehicle sector is being opposed by the nation's five automotive companies, Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia, Asia and Ssangyong. They suspect that Samsung wants to move eventually into the nation's already crowded passenger car industry, although Samsung denies it has any such intention. The government has 20 days to rule on Samsung's application to import truck technology from Nissan. Two previous attempts by Samsung to enter the vehicle industry were blocked by the government. But officials indicated yesterday that Samsung will be allowed to proceed this time. Samsung will spend Won72bn (Dollars 90m) on the project, which will include the construction of a factory near its shipbuilding yards in Changwon. Production will begin in 1994 with 1,200 trucks, rising to 3,360 vehicles by 1997. Samsung will export more than 40 per cent of its trucks. It said the manufacture of construction vehicles was an extension of its production of other construction equipment.</p>

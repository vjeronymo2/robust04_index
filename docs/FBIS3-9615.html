The heaviest attacks were recorded on the Teslic front,  where  Moslem infantry troops attacked from several directions.  Bosnian Serb troops managed to halt all attacks and forced the  Moslems to retreat, the command of the First Krajina Corps said.    Moslem forces used infantry arms, anti-aircraft guns and  grenade launchers to attack Serb positions in the north-eastern  part of the Teslic battlefield. They attacked villages and the  town of Teslic with mortars. One civilian was wounded in a  shell explosion in Jasenica, and three civilians were wounded in  Teslic. Early in the morning on Sunday, Moslem units used  mortars to attack Serb positions surrounding the villages of  Lukici and Sekulici, eight kilometers to the west of Brcko in  northern Bosnia, Banja Luka Army sources said.</p>

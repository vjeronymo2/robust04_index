			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel rights take-up totals two-thirds in UK Eurotunnel yesterday announced that only two-thirds of the UK tranche of its Pounds 858m rights issue was taken up, significantly lower than for the 1990 issue. However, the brokers SG Warburg succeeded in placing out the Pounds 70.6m rump of the registered share issue to institutions at a small premium to the 265p rights price, releasing the underwriters from their obligations. The underwriters are not entirely off the hook. The announcement of take-up on the primarily French-owned bearer rights shares will not be made until July 7. In addition, the French stock exchange authorities yesterday officially launched an investigation into possible market manipulation by the underwriters. This follows accusations by Mr Christian Cambier, the French head of an association of small Eurotunnel shareholders, that underwriters may have sold short ahead of the pricing of the issue, in an attempt to depress the share price and limit their risk. Nevertheless, the placement of the rump of the UK issue was good news for the banks behind the exercise, primarily Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and Swiss Bank Corporation. The 26.6m rights units that were not taken up were placed out at 269.46p (net of costs) to 'a wide range of mainly UK institutions'. Unitholders who did not take up their rights will be paid the 4.46p premium to the rights price. Take-up of the 241.5m bearer rights shares, listed in Paris, is expected to be significantly higher. Around 45 per cent of the entire issue of bearer rights was traded this week, and buyers would be almost certain to exercise their rights, as under the French system, they do not receive the proceeds from any subsequent placement. French bankers suggested a take-up of more than 90 per cent was achievable, which would bring the average take-up to a more respectable 84 per cent. The 1990 rights issue was 84 per cent subscribed in the UK, with a 98 per cent take-up in France, but small shareholders were then given travel incentives. Mr Rory MacNamara, corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, Eurotunnel's advisers, said: 'By Eurotunnel standards, it was an encouraging response. Eurotunnel, at least in the UK, is more of a retail stock, and you would expect a lower take-up.' The placement of the rump was helped by a bounce in Eurotunnel's share price to a high of 300p yesterday, although it closed 1p lower at 278p. The management has put its own money behind its assertions of confidence in the shares. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman, bought 10,000 warrants yesterday. Both the company's chairmen have now invested in Eurotunnel stock in the past three days. Their combined investment of Pounds 28,500, however, will provide little more than moral support for the shares.</p>

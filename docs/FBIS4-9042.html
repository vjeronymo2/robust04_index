			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/4/1994 -- The main danger  threatening Romania is not coming from outside, but rather from  inside, subversion being one of its forms, Ion Mircea Pascu,  secretary of state in charge of defense and international  relations of the Romanian Ministry of Defense, told a news  conference Friday, 15 April. Subversive acts can be 'canvassed'  in many ways, he said, by those who pursue such aims. Romania  does not exclude extraneous danger, although this is less  poignant at the moment. He said Romania's option is for  integration in the European structures, and that the Partnership  for Peace is one step towards that goal. Romania's ultimate  target in its strive for integration is the forging of a  European security system comprising all the actors on the  European political stage, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine,  the United States, and Canada, inclusively.    Related to the problems the Romanian Army is confronted  with,  the secretary of state said its endowment and equipment shall be  done as the budget allocation permits. Although modest, this  provides for certain growths which will enable the army to  upgrade medical assistance and housing conditions for the  military.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Part one of "nonbroadcast portion" of interview with </F> Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government, ANPP, by reporters Julio Batista and  Rosa Maria Godoy on the "I Have An Opinion" program, on 10  January in Havana -- recorded]    [Text] [Godoy] All during this interview you have stressed  base-level work, the work of the People's Government in the  municipalities, provinces, and People's Councils which are  currently the newest body of government. I want to know your  opinion on the present development of the People's Councils in  Cuba in terms of problem solving at each locality, each province.    [Alarcon] I believe the People's Councils in general are  attaining highly positive results. They also are becoming a  path, a strategy -- that of the people's participation; the  people's participation in the search for solutions to their own  problems; the people's participation in the real and full  exercise of the government which can only be achieved at the  base level.    I believe that many and diverse initiatives and experiences  exist, depending on the place, the nature of the situation, and  the characteristics of the region. It is more evident each day  that the People's Council is an effective instrument of  government from the base, of control over the administration,  resources, and the entire effort which the nation has to  conduct. It also is an effective tool to stimulate the insertion  of the people into the activities of the people's government,  the activities of the nation and government of our country. I am  not saying that we have reached the final alternative. We are  making progress. We have to insist that the People's Councils  have to conduct all their activities keeping this essential  strategy in mind. Their essential strategy is to channel the  people's initiatives, channel the masses's work from the base in  order to exert a positive control on the entire society; also,  to stimulate, develop, and strengthen all the creative potential  of our people toward the solution of the problems we confront  today.    [Batista] However, does a People's Council at the base have  the conditions to undertake these responsibilities, these tasks  we are saying they have to pursue?    [Alarcon] Through the people. If we were to see the People's  Councils work as the endeavor of its presidents, we would be  asking too much from those comrades. The People's Council  president is nothing more than a district delegate elected by  other delegates as their president. In Havana itself, I have  seen several experiences during progress report meetings in  which I have participated where the neighbors, many times at the  suggestion of the president of the People's Council, have  established work committees or groups; neighbors who form a  health committee, an education committee, a committee to oversee  food or services issues, etc.    In other words, the president of the People's Council has  the  support, the real participation of voters, of citizens who help  in performing these tasks. It would be impossible for a single  person to truly discharge these responsibilities. He has a basic  responsibility, that of guiding, that of exerting his authority  as an elected official of the voters, and of the delegates as  president of the People's Council. In the measure that he  manages to insert the people, the neighbors on a daily, real,  and practical basis, he can fulfill these tasks. No one knows  all the things we might yet do, in the measure that the people  truly undertake this method of government as their own.    This is something we have to understand. It is very new: the  true conduit of democracy. Democracy is the authority of the  people. True democracy is that which promotes, in the measure  possible, more and more each day, the direct participation of  the people in their government. We can do this, first of all,  because we have a social system based on equity, human  solidarity, and human fraternity. These are the goals and  ethical ideals of our social system -- a society free of  exploitation, free of the rule of a minority over the majority  of the people. Therefore, we have the social base to develop  these forms of participation in the management of the society.  This is not achieved overnight.    Earlier, we discussed financial issues. These are complex  and difficult issues but in the measure that we progress and  study, we can manage and understand these problems better. There  are many other things that can be done on the basis of this  essential principle. This is not a case of the people and the  government working apart, not a case of the people and the state  working apart. Our system, not by chance, is called a people's  government. It will have authority and be powerful and effective  in the measure it is truly of the people. It is of the people  due to its political character, due to what it seeks, because it  works for the benefit of the people. However, we have to make it  more of the people through the real participation of the people  in the system.    [Batista] Regarding your answer, I wanted to express my  opinion because there are truly many people who believe that the  people's government, as an institution, does not solve many  problems at the base. Therefore, perhaps all this has to do with  the mechanisms, or problems with resources, or, at times, a  matter of method, or that the government mechanisms are not  understood in terms of public health or education. This is why I  was asking this type of question regarding the operations,  mechanisms, solutions, resources, and possibilities of the  government in each region to solve and confront the problems.    [Alarcon] There are problems in our national reality that do  not have solutions today, for example, everything related to  material resources. However, there is another dimension to this  problem, that which sees the people on one side and their  representatives on the other. This has to do with the concept we  have of progress report meetings. There was a period in which,  to a certain measure -- I do not want to generalize, it was not  the same everywhere -- it was an occasion for the voters to make  their suggestions, to express their complaints to the delegate  and then wait for an answer from that delegate. On more than one  occasion, when ones analyses a good part of the problems brought  up at the base, you realize that the problems do not relate to  efforts the delegates have to make at higher levels, but to  issues that can be solved by the people themselves. This is a  right of the people -- that of organizing and acting, of taking  their initiatives and channelling their collective efforts.    The role of the delegates ought to be that of directing the  pertinent effort to solve everything possible at that level. We  have to abandon that passive attitude, that view of the voters  as passive objects. We have to see the voter as the subject, the  main subject of our system of government. When you see  yourselves in that manner, when we see ourselves collectively in  that manner, we find that some of the issues brought to the  delegates to be solved by them, can be solved or improved by us.  I am not saying that is the case in every instance. Of course,  there are daily problems we all face related to the shortages of  resources. However, how many difficulties are born in our minds,  how many limitations have to do with our passivity, our refusal  to be creative.    This is a system whose main goal ought to be the development  of the creative potential of the masses. It is a system which  deep down is based on something Fidel has said many times, about  turning the trust in the people, in their values, pride, and  will into a concrete political and daily phenomenon. This is the  essence of the work of the people's government at the base, and  from the base up through the entire system.    [Batista] What also happens is that I have seen government  bodies that do not give any support or help to the municipal  delegates. I believe this affects the prestige of that  individual and the possibilities for the people to trust him,  because one is trusted in the measure that one solves or gives  appropriate answers. Otherwise, what one says is not believed.    [Alarcon] That is true. Unfortunately, this is one reality  our delegates have to confront, particularly in certain places.  I would say this exists more so in big cities than in small  communities. This is why we see such rich experiences in certain  People's Councils which are not attained in places where the  delegates confront more complex situations. I also believe that  this is part of the necessary struggle that the entire system  must confront, not only the delegate and the base. This is why  the People's Council becomes a support system for that delegate.  A higher level, the municipal assembly, must also play an active  role, and so does the National Assembly. However, the people  must also do so.    The delegate might find perhaps misunderstanding,  bureaucratic red tape, inertia, or lack of care, but those  people must know that the delegate is truly working for the  people.    [Batista] Alarcon, there have also been cases of delegates  who have been dismissed by the voters for shortcomings or poor  performance?    [Alarcon] I believe so. I know of some cases in which,  perhaps due to shortcomings or other criteria, the delegate also  believes he is not up to the task and asks to be replaced. There  have been changes in the people's government at the base. I know  of some even at the municipal level. I believe we should see  this as a very healthy sign, a very natural thing which should  not be seen in critical terms or as chaos. I believe is it only  natural. They are representatives of the people, people from  among the people, and it might happen that sometimes their  possibilities become exhausted or they reach the limit of their  capabilities. The people must exert their right to elect another  individual. I believe this is one of the virtues of our system.  Much is said abroad about great democratic systems where the  people have the worst opinion of a an elected deputy and yet  have to wait four or six years to elect another demagogue.    This is why it is so important that several principles be  fully implemented in our system: close ties between the voter  and those elected -- provincial and base- level delegates; and  periodic progress reports. The essential part of both mechanisms  is to make people feel increasingly they are part of the system,  rather than feeling foreign to it. The system is not foreign to  the people. On the contrary, the people are an integral part of  the people's government system.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM FOR INFORMANTS  </P> <P> So, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Thompson defends offering preferential  treatment to jail informants.  </P> <P> Informant Cisneros was granted an early release after giving his (perjured)  testimony -- despite the fierce objections of his therapist and probation  officer. Upon his release, Cisneros committed several brutal rapes. Deputy  Dist. Atty. Kay calls this a "small, teeny little offshoot" of the informant  program.  </P> <P> I wonder if Kay (or the other attorneys and judges agreeing to the plea  bargains) would agree that this was a "teeny" price to pay if his mother,  sister, wife, or daughter were one of Cisneros' brutal rape victims.  </P> <P> Somehow, I don't think so.  </P> <P> DEBRA J. REED  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

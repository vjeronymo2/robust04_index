Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday,  Karadzic  said that such a meeting involving the presidents of Russia, the  United States, France, Britain and Germany should be well  prepared and put an end to the war in Bosnia not only through  reaching an accord between the warring factions but also through  signing an international treaty. "When new borders are set, we  might need the guarantees of five great powers. We would  welcome such international treaty," Karadzic said.    Speaking about the role of the Russian peace-keeping  contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic said "We do not  expect that Russian `blue helmets' will support only the Serbs.  It will be enough if they take an objective stand and will be  able to defend our people."    He said he wanted the Russian contingent to be bigger. There  are fears that NATO countries may overstep the competence of the  U.N. mandate and start acting within the framework of the  military organisation of the North Atlantic Alliance. Russian  soldiers will be always following the tasks set by the U.N. and  will never overstep their mandate, Karadzic stressed.    He described the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a tragic  event which had been long sought by Germany. Now that this has  happened, it is necessary to set new borders and reach a  settlement which would lead to durable peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Karadzic said Bosnian Serbs own 64 per cent of the territory  of Bosnia-Herzegovina but whey control 72 per cent. He said the  Serbs are ready to hand over these eight per cent to the  rightful owner. He said they are ready to go even below the  point of 64 per cent and swap territories for the sake of peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    After the news conference, Karadzic left Moscow.    Meanwhile, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic called on  Bosnian Serbs to join the Croatian-Moslem talks on the  establishment of Bosnian federation.    The announcement was made after his talks with French  Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe. Granic said Croatia shares France's  position calling for reaching a peace agreement between all  three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He noted that the  Croatian side offers Bosnian Serbs to join the new federation on  the same terms as the two other concerned sides, and expressed  the hope that the Serbs will take part in the talks on this  issue.    He stressed that Zagreb stands for normalising relations  with  Belgrade. But this can become possible only if Serbs leave the  territory they are holding in Croatia as envisaged by the  Washington agreements.</p>

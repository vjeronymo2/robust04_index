			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak talked to  reporters this morning at Government House about the problem of  robberies by Cambodian soldiers.    He said that he agrees with the Army commander about  implementing strong measures against the Cambodian robbers.  Regarding preventive measures, all sides must coordinate with  each other to make them work. These include those in the  government administrative circle -- the Interior Ministry and  the unit in charge of national security; and the military with  the major tasks of preventing violations of sovereignty -- the  Royal Thai Army and the Royal Thai Navy. In the case of serious  incidents, the Royal Thai Air Force should also lend a hand.    In any case, the defense minister agrees with the idea of  implementing extremely decisive actions against the bandits in  the future. The reason is that many Thais have been killed and  wounded. At the same time coordination has begun with the  National Defense Ministry of Cambodia and the Cambodian side  pledged to try to prevent such incidents from occurring.    Meanwhile, a group of armed Cambodian bandits held three  Thai  officials of the Thapthim Sayam project and demanded ransom.  Following coordination between Thai authorities and Cambodian  representatives, the Thai side agreed to pay 120,000 baht in  exchange for the release of the hostages. [passage omitted]</p>

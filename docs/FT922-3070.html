			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Eye-opener leaves management in tatters - Paul Abrahams examines the background to Fisons' surprise profits warning FISONS, the former fertilisers group, is back in the mire. A profit warning yesterday sent shares in the Ipswich-based pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group tumbling. In a statement, Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, warned that profits for the first six months were likely to be less than half of last year's total of Pounds 95.2m. Excuses were coming thick and fast yesterday, but analysts have become increasingly disinclined to believe them. In March Mr Egan said he was confident most of the group's difficulties lay behind it. After only four months the credibility of the new management is in tatters. The company's future independence is increasingly in doubt. The profits fall may have been a nasty surprise, admits Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, but the reasons for the shortfall are not new. On the revenue side the company continues to suffer from the US withdrawal in 1989 of Opticrom, its eye treatment, and in 1990 of Imferon, a blood product. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked for the withdrawals following quality control concerns. Both products remain off the market. FDA officials visited the offending site in April. In spite of massive investments by Fisons they failed to clear the drug and made further observations about Opticrom's manufacturing processes. Opticrom is now unlikely to be relicensed in time for the US rag-weed season which starts in August. Six to eight weeks will be needed to feed the product through the distribution channels. As for Imferon, Mr Scroggs has hired external consultants to decide whether it is worth the Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m necessary to upgrade production to FDA standards. Meanwhile, the company admitted yesterday that other products had also been hit because of manufacturing difficulties. 'The new technical management are determined not to continue production at plants which fail to manufacture at the best possible standards. We want to make sure that none of our products have any further regulatory problems. This has had an effect on sales during May and June,' says Mr Scroggs. As a result, both Tilade, an asthma drug, and Opticrom have been in short supply outside the US, he admits. UK distributors have complained recently that Tilade is virtually impossible to find. Norton Healthcare, a subsidiary of Ivax of the US, launched a generic version of Intal this month costing 20 per cent less. The group says its new product is selling exceptionally well. Meanwhile, Fisons' volume short-fall has coincided with an increase in costs associated with fixing the quality control issues, says Mr Scroggs. In addition, the scientific equipment division, where Mr Scroggs made his reputation before he was appointed chief executive in April, is also suffering from a shortfall in sales. However, Mr Scroggs insists the division is not in trouble and has genuinely good prospects. Fisons's management is desperately in need of good news. Last month the company announced it wanted to sell its horticultural and consumer health businesses. Analysts fear the present difficulties may undermine the price Fisons can generate for the businesses. Previous estimates valued them at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. Mr Scroggs denies he is in a hurry to sell the divisions, insisting the company is financially strong and not short of cash. There is no need for fire-sales, he argues. He says the confidential memoranda describing the divisions will be published by the first week in July and negotiations should then start with a number of companies that have already signed confidentiality agreements. Mr Scroggs says these groups are serious and not 'tire-kickers.' If good news fails to materialise and the share price falls low enough, some analysts believe the group could be vulnerable to a takeover. However, contested takeovers in the pharmaceuticals industry are virtually unknown because so much of their value is dependent upon employees who might be alienated in a messy contested bid. A friendly takeover is more likely, especially as few companies are likely to want to acquire a business like Fisons without knowing the full extent of its difficulties. However, Mr Egan has publicly said he is not interested in such a deal. Given that a hostile bid is unlikely and a friendly one publicly rejected, shareholders must be wondering how the company extricates itself from its present predicament. The full extent of the sales shortfall is still unclear from the statement. Opticrom had sales of only Dollars 40m (Pounds 22m) before it was withdrawn. Questions must be asked whether it is worth the effort of bringing the product back to market. Given that none of the board have any experience in pharmaceuticals it is far from clear whether it has the expertise to judge the issue. One thing is clear, the relaunch of Opticrom will be the most expensive in pharmaceuticals history.</p>

The poll was conducted by "Radar  Eastridge," a research and public relations firm, which secured  a permit from the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics  [CAMS]. The permit, numbered 1315/1993, was published in the  Official Gazette on 6 December 1993.    The U.S. poll, conducted over three months, covered a sample  of 8,000 citizens. The Egyptian and foreign researchers focused  on poor neighborhoods, especially in al-Jizah and Asyut  Governorates, in contravention of a CAMS decision stipulating  that the survey be confined to a sample of 300 citizens in Cairo  Governorate, distributed as follows: Some 230 from Heliopolis,  al-Zaytun, al-Alf Maskan, Hada'iq al-Qubbah, al-Shurabiyah,  al-Minyal, Madinat Nasr, Shubra, al-Dhahir, and al-'Abbasiyah  and 70 citizens from al-Jizah Governorate, specifically from the  areas of al-Muhandisin, al-Duqqi, Mit 'Uqbah, and the Pyramids.    The CAMS decision stressed that the citizens be told the  survey is confidential and that data be gathered in accordance  with an approved form prepared for this purpose. It also  stipulated that only Egyptian researchers may gather the data  and banned the participation of foreigners. The CAMS decision  also stipulated that it receive two copies of the field study on  completion before its handover to the quarter that commissioned  it. CAMS would then hand the survey to that quarter.    Radar Eastridge did not abide by the CAMS conditions and did  not secure the necessary permits from the security and  administrative departments. It sent the poll result to Gallup  to analyze it. Gallup is a private commercial firm selling its  surveys to whoever pays the right price. Most of its contracts  are with the CIA. The Gallup Institute recently conducted an  opinion poll in Israel on the Jewish youth view and stance on  the Gaza-Jericho Agreement.    AL-'ARABI has learned that a team of experts from Tel Aviv  University's (Shilwah) Center is analyzing the results of  another opinion poll conducted in the Governorates of Cairo,  al-Jizah, and Alexandria. This poll was conducted by the  Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and based on a sample of  Egyptians, most notably intellectuals, politicians, and  scientists. The poll focused on upcoming expected developments  in light of the role of the political Islam current and the  strength of the Nasirite current in Egypt.    In early January, the Israeli Academic Center received three  researchers from the Truman Institute on Peace Research, which  is affiliated with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. This is  within the framework of comprehensive research by a team of 30  researchers from the institute who will study the "impact of  Islam on African policies." The Truman Institute's African  Research Unit is planning to conduct a new study on the "radical  Islamic current groups" and those that are most likely to reach  power. The study will begin in June when a new team of  researchers will arrive to conduct an opinion poll with the  assistance of the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo, which has  close links with the Israeli intelligence service Mosad.</p>

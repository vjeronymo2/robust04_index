			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By A. Yakovlev and V. Gorobets; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Yakovlev] Russian-Latvian talks, overshadowed by  the illegal arrest of two Russian generals, began this morning  and carried on late into the evening. The Latvian delegation  agreed to Russia's proposed date for the withdrawal of troops --  31 August this year. The only fundamental issue on which it has  hitherto not been possible to agree is the Skrunda missile  attack early-warning station. It is necessary to define the  status of this strategic installation, needed to ensure Russia's  national security, and establish the possibility of  international supervision, something on which the Latvian side  is insisting. The opinion is being aired that the station might  operate as a civil installation. Military experts believe that  the Skrunda radar does not represent an environmental danger nor  does it pose a threat as a target on Latvian territory.  Agreement is being hampered by the impossibility of putting up  a similar structure on Russian territory in a short period and  the internal situation in Latvia, which dictates that  politicians should seek the immediate withdrawal of all troops  and the elimination of Russian installations on its territory.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Peruvian guerrilla chief captured: Police raids in the capital net leaders of hardline Shining Path MR Abimael Guzman Reynoso, leader of Peru's hardline Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrilla group, has been captured in Lima. Police raids on two houses in prosperous suburbs netted Mr Guzman, 57, and half a dozen key members of Sendero's powerful central committee. Sendero has waged 12 years of political warfare, which has claimed more than 25,000 Peruvian lives and cost the impoverished nation some Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.1bn), roughly equivalent to its total foreign debt. Analysts estimate Sendero's fighting strength to be in the region of 5,000, but militants and committed supporters may total another 100,000. It is too early to predict whether the capture of Mr Guzman will prove a crushing blow to Sendero. The life of Mr Guzman  - 'Presidente Gonzalo' or 'the fourth sword of the revolution' to his followers  - had assumed almost mythical qualities. A philosophy professor in the impoverished central Andean town of Ayacucho in the 1960s, he built up Sendero initially among university students and peasants. Its blend of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism overlaid with traditional Andean culture and beliefs captured support among the marginalised. Since Sendero emerged into the national arena in 1980, burning ballot boxes in the village of Chuschi in Ayacucho province, it has aimed at overthrowing what it perceives as a corrupt and inept state. In the past two years the violence which had previously been concentrated in the more remote areas of Peru has come to the capital. Sendero infiltrated many popular organisations in Lima, assassinating any local leader who resisted. In July a wave of car bombs rocked its commercial and residential zones. Until now there had been only scant glimpses of Mr Guzman. He was detained in 1979, accused of helping organise a general strike, but was released. In 1988 he gave to Sendero's newspaper a 40,000-word interview constituting the most coherent available exposition of 'Gonzalo thought'. Less than two years ago a videotape captured in a police raid gave Peruvians a rare treat  - Mr Guzman was filmed drinking and dancing to the music of Zorba the Greek with close collaborators, all dressed in Chinese-style uniform tunics. Mr Guzman's capture late on Saturday night was attributed to five months of patient observation by Dincote, Peru's counter-terrorist police. His arrest, along with high-level members of his organisation, will boost the morale of the security forces who have, particularly in the past four months, been targeted with a vehemence unusual even for Sendero.</p>

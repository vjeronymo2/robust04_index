			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Kessler: "Hefty Increases; No Matter Who </F> Wins the Bundestag Elections--A Rude Awakening Awaits the  Germans: Higher Taxes Are Due"]    [Text] Joachim Gruenewald, parliamentary state secretary in  the Federal Finance Ministry, had ventured too far out on a  limb. His announcement that, following a successful election,  the Federal Government would eliminate significant portions of  the trade tax in 1996 left a bad taste in the Chancellor's  mouth. All discussions concerning taxes, thus Helmut Kohl  directed, regardless whether they dealt with increases or  decreases, were "taboo for the time being." Not until June may  Finance Minister Theo Waigel announce the basic features of the  future taxation policy of the black-yellow coalition.    The chancellor's injunction comes too late. The debate on  taxes is already in full swing--and it is as chaotic as it ever  was. Rhineland-Palatinate Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle,  for instance, who has aspirations to a higher office, is  demanding that the corporate tax reform take place in 1995  already. His party boss, Klaus Kinkel, on the other hand,  considers the room for maneuver for short-term tax decreases to  be "extremely limited."    For his part, Wolfgang Schaeuble, the leader of the CDU  [Christian Democratic Union] caucus in the Bundestag, again has  his sights set on persons with higher incomes. Helmut Kohl's  right-hand man sees further room for movement in the assets and  estate taxes (see WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE 17/1994).    The confused discussion concerning the future tax policy of  the coalition does not bode well for the postelection period.    The six leading economic research institutes have figured  out  in the their spring report that the Federal Government, the  laender, the municipalities, and the Trust Agency, will incur  debts this year to the tune of 200 billion German marks [DM],  more than 6 percent of the total German GNP. Only if the economy  grows at a faster rate in the coming years than expected will  Waigel reach his goal of lowering the new indebtedness of the  Federal Government to under DM40 billion by 1997. In the  meantime, he and his colleagues in the laender and  municipalities will once again reach deeply into the pockets of  the taxpayers. In 1995, that much is already certain today, the  tax burden will rise to the record level of 45 percent.    It is not even clear if the already passed 7.5-percent  solidarity tax will suffice to bring the horrendous deficits  back to a tolerable level. The number of unemployed in Germany  as a whole, the finance policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU  [Christian Social Union] caucus, Hansgeorg Hauser, conjectures,  has to drop well "below 3 million." Hauser: "If not, things are  going to get tight."    Against this background, it is small solace that the Social  Democrats, as well, have little to offer. How Oskar Lafontaine,  the candidate for finance minister in Rudolf Scharping's shadow  cabinet, plans to plug up the gaps in the revenue receipts  remains his secret for the time being.    Scharping and his men must, after all, also come up with an  answer to the question as to how they envision the future  taxation system after the elections. For it is then that the  Germans will be facing a revolution in the tax law. By 1996, the  Federal Constitutional Court has decided, the government, be it  black-red, social-liberal, or red-green, must exempt from  taxation the minimum subsistence level of circa DM11,555 for  single persons and DM23,111 for married persons. The costs of  this measure: circa DM40 billion.    And because the justices in Karlsruhe have gotten so nicely  warmed up [are on a roll], the supreme German body of justice  will probably topple another pillar of taxation by the end of  the year: The specification in effect to date of the so-called  standard values used for determining the worth of private and  corporate assets, real estate, and single-family homes.    Because the standard values for tax purposes comprise only  between 10 and 21 percent of the actual sales values, jurists  consider this method of calculation unconstitutional. The  wealth-based taxes collected are of five different types:    --Property taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM10.8  billion);    --Trade taxes (revenues collected: DM41.4 billion);    --Assets taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM6.8 billion);    --Estate and gift taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM3.1  billion).    For property taxes alone, there is a gap of approximately  DM65 billion between the actual and the tax value. Quite a shock  to property owners: The owner of a single-family house worth  circa DM500,000 would, instead of DM700, suddenly have to pay  DM5,400 per year in property taxes.    There is material enough here for a fundamental reform of  the  German tax law, which has meanwhile become arcane. But precisely  now, at a time when the governing parties in Bonn are presented  with an opportunity to thin out the jungle, they "fail to  display an all-in-all convincing concept," as the fiscal  researchers of the Rhenish-Westphalian Institute for Economic  Research (RWI) note with polite restraint in their latest study.  To be sure, representatives of the Christian-liberal coalition,  such as Schaeuble, Waigel, and Kinkel, never grow tired of  emphasizing that "tax increases after the elections are out of  the question." Secretly, however, they have long since had their  eye on surcharges on the tax on petroleum products and the  value-added tax. Waigel wants to plug the DM8 billion fiscal  hole with revenues coming from a reform of the railroad system.  Schaeuble is looking for ways to finance the tax exemption of  the minimum subsistence level.    When there is an emergency, the politicians will grasp at  any  straw to save themselves. The warning of the German Bundesbank  in its latest report, namely that the "further increasing tax  burden" is becoming "the critical factor with respect to the  operating location conditions for the German economy," is being  ignored in the same way as the admonition by the six economic  institutes in their latest spring [1994] report to gradually  decrease the solidarity tax from 1996 on.    Germany, the institutes demand, must drastically scale back  its high taxation rates. As recently as 1990, according to an  RWI study, the FRG, with a tax "bite" of 37 percent, occupied  the "middle ground" among the OECD countries. Three years later,  the picture has changed completely. While the United States and  Japan take an average of only about 30 percent of incomes from  their citizens, the FRG has now reached the same level as the  traditionally high-taxation countries Netherlands, Sweden, and  Norway.    Instead of submitting a convincing plan for bringing the tax  burden of 45 percent, which is unprecedented in the history of  the FRG, back to a normal level, the coalition is tinkering  around aimlessly with individual measures.    For example: Income taxes. Since no one among the Christian  Democrats and liberals knows where the DM40 billion are to come  from that the Constitutional Court's minimum subsistence level  resolution costs, Waigel's civil servants are resorting to  deceptive packaging tactics. And so, for example, the finance  minister wants to grant the tax exemption up to the minimum  subsistence level only to the lower income groups. This,  officials in his ministry have figured out, would result in a  loss to the public coffers of "only" DM4 billion.    Whether or not this is constitutional is questionable. If  the  finance minister establishes income limits for the granting of  the tax-free minimum subsistence level, tax expert Professor  Joachim Lang of Cologne fears, he will be violating the  "uniformity of taxation" prescribed by the Basic Law. There  would then be variable tax rate progressions, depending on the  levels of income.    However, Waigel's solution is controversial not only in a  juristic but also in an economic sense. If the tax-free minimum  subsistence income benefited only the lower income groups, hefty  fault-lines in the tax rate structure would result--with a tax  rate limit of more than 100 percent.    Already now, Waigel has crafted a special taxation rate for  recipients of incomes up to DM11,555 per year which leads to  dubious results. To be sure, as the decision of the  Constitutional Court prescribes for the transition period up to  1996, persons with low incomes do, in fact, not have to pay any  taxes. At the same time, however, the tax offices, in  calculating the amount of these persons' taxes, no longer use  the taxable income as the basis, as in the past, but the total  earnings, which closely follow the criteria used for making  welfare payments. The fatal consequence: Whoever earns more will  be taxed in accordance with the traditional tax tables--with the  result that by going above this limit he has less in his pocket  after taxes than before. "Very annoying," says CDU/CSU spokesman  for fiscal matters, Hansgeorg Hauser.    Now the price is being paid for the fact that the Kohl  government did not raise taxes during the time of the  unification boom. Then it would have been able, following the  elections, to couple the tax computation reform that is being  demanded with a general tax decrease. But the opportunity was  missed. Kohl's tax policy experts are faced with the dilemma of  either tightening the progression again or collecting the  missing revenues elsewhere.    Therefore, regardless who governs after the 16th of October,  the Germans will have to prepare themselves for new tax hikes.  Already firmly planned by the current coalition--all denials  notwithstanding--are higher taxes on petroleum products and a  higher value-added tax. "If we are to reduce income taxes  perceptibly," says Hermann Rind (FDP [Free Democratic Party]),  the chairman of the finance committee in the Bundestag, in  defense of tax plans to that end, "we must speak openly about  such reflections."    Lower taxes on earned incomes and investments, higher taxes  on consumption--that would indeed strengthen the much invoked  growth forces of the economy. But currently it does not look as  if that will happen. It may well be that, with the tills empty,  the tax burden on incomes will decline hardly at all, but the  treasury will help itself generously to increased taxes on  gasoline and a higher value-added tax.    How little the finance policy experts concerned themselves  with economic interrelationships in the process is illustrated  by the discussion of the assets tax. It is the unanimous opinion  of almost all economists that this tax is completely  superfluous, one which burdens economic savings in no less than  three different ways by taking away from corporate assets, stock  holdings, and incomes from property. For this reason, thus the  pronouncements by economic policy experts of the coalition all  over the country, this tax must be done away with as soon as  possible. In actuality, the Christian Democrats and the liberals  raised the tax allowances and doubled the rates only just last  year. And Schaeuble does not want to rule out further increases.    The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are pinning their  hopes entirely on growth. Their supposed miracle drug: An  employment pact between the state, the collective bargaining  partners, and the Bundesbank. In the event of an SPD victory in  the election, the labor unions are then to content themselves  with moderate wage increases.    In return, Lafontaine plans to lighten the tax burden of  employees and investing enterprises, and the Bundesbank is to  reward the restraint shown by the collective bargaining partners  with low interest rates. If the economy grows strongly in the  way that it has in the United States, thus the hope of the  opposition party, the fiscal problems will automatically lose  some of their acuteness.    If the complicated SPD calculation does not work out, the  Social Democrats must either go back to the long-standing tactic  of tightening the tax screws again, or the public finances will  go out of control. Events of the most recent past have shown,  however, that the Bundesbank is allergic to growing budget  deficits.    And that will not change for the foreseeable future. In the  persons of Hans Tietmeyer and Johann Gaddum, the monetary  institute in Frankfurt is headed by no less than two CDU  politicians.</p>

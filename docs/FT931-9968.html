			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Last week's accelerating decline in Australian wool prices went further this week, with a new low point for the present selling season reached on every day. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator was 457 cents a kg. on February 10, 31 cents or 6% lower than a week before. The lowest point reached in the previous 1991-92 season was 434 cents a kg. These are seriously uneconomic prices for most growers and some are withdrawing their wool at reserve prices of their own, or withdrawing it immediately prior to the auction.</p>

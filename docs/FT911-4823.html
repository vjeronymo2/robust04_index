			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: US telecom group slides UNITED Telecommunications, the US long-distance telephone company, unveiled a sharp decline in first-quarter earnings yesterday, while Pacific Telesis, the West Coast regional telephone company, saw first-quarter earnings rise modestly. UT's income fell to Dollars 84m, or 38 cents per share, from Dollars 108m, or 51 cents, in the same period a year ago. Revenues were ahead to Dollars 2.2bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars 2bn a year ago. Operating profit at Sprint, the long distance division, was Dollars 52m on revenues of Dollars 1.3bn for the quarter, against Dollars 51m on revenues of Dollars 1.3bn in the preceding quarter. Sprint's increased traffic volumes were offset principally by a decline from strong fourth-quarter data systems sales, and by some decrease in the average rate per minute of long distance usage in the first quarter, the company said. At Pacific Telesis, first-quarter income rose 1.5 per cent to Dollars 266m, from Dollars 262m in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share were 68 cents, up 4.6 per cent from 65 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.41bn, compared with Dollars 2.37bn in the first quarter of 1990. Pacific Bell, its principle telephone subsidiary , reported net income for the quarter of Dollars 245m, up slightly from Dollars 242m in the first quarter of 1990. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.16bn, compared with Dollars 2.12bn in 1990.</p>

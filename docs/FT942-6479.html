			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Yen's rise hits Japan's shipbuilders Japan's shipbuilders and heavy industrial companies, which reported their first drop in annual profits for three years, are in a double bind. Their worse-than-expected performance reflects the erosion of their proportionately high foreign earnings by the yen's rise, plus the continued decline in capital investment by customers in Japan. Pre-tax profits declines, ranging from 15.3 per cent at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to 0.8 per cent at Hitachi Zosen, underline how the shipbuilding divisions face another round of cost cuts if they are to become competitive with low-cost South Korean yards. In most cases, however, shipbuilding margins were last year close to the previous year's. This was because Japanese yards were working towards the end of the orders made up to two years ago, before the international plunge in ship prices and demand. Ishikawa-Harima Heavy, for example, reports that its order backlog has dwindled from a peak of 2.44m deadweight tonnes in 1991, to 1.27m dwt last year. Recent orders, taken at prices up to 20 per cent below those two years ago, will show through in earnings next year and the year after, indicating that 'shipbuilding profits will be terrible', forecast Mr Matthew Ruddock, transport machinery analyst at James Capel Pacific. Already, Sasebo, the smallest of the group, has admitted that costs are higher than the contract price for four of the nine vessels on its order books. This is likely to be true of other builders. Among these are MHI, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which are working on a joint contract for seven liquefied natural gas carriers for Qatar, at an estimated Y26bn (Dollars 248.9m) per vessel, well below break-even at current exchange rates. All this implies that the most diversified heavy industrial groups will do best in the coming years. Many of them increased their dependence on shipbuilding in the late 1980s - to take advantage of a rise in demand  - but are now having to retrench because of Japanese yards failure to compete. MHI, for example, has reduced its dependence on shipbuilding and steel structures to 18 per cent of sales, so that power systems now represents its biggest sector, at 27.4 per cent. IHI derived a mere 19 per cent of its Y862.9bn turnover from shipbuilding last year, even after a 27 per cent jump in shipbuilding and offshore sales to Y165.4bn. Sasebo, by contrast, looks badly exposed, with 70 per cent of sales derived from shipbuilding.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Pre-tax                        Sales     Change     profit    Change                        (Ybn)      (%)       (Ybn)      (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mitsubishi Heavy       2,435     -2.3      119.20     -15.3 Kawasaki Heavy           956     +0.2       20.40      -9.9 Ishikawa-Harima          863     +7.1       24.60      -3.6 Hitachi Zosen            403    +12.4       22.06     +26.3 Sumitomo Heavy           288     -4.9        2.26     +16.3 Sasebo Heavy              64    +13.3        6.19      -4.9  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

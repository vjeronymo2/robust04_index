			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second and final installment of an exclusive interview with </F> Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz by MILLIYET correspondent Nur  Batur in Baghdad; date not given]    [Text] [Batur] Do you regard the embargo as a measure to  oppose the Iraqi administration?    ['Aziz] It is an insult not only to the Iraqi administration  but also the Iraqi people. The UN officials wish to distribute  foodstuffs and pharmaceutical drugs in Iraq even though they  know that foodstuffs are already being distributed in our  country. They just wish to impose that condition.    [Batur] How has the Saddam administration been able to  remain  on its feet despite the pressure to which it has been subjected  for so many years?    ['Aziz] This shows the healthy relations between the Iraqi  people and administration. Otherwise, no administration would  have survived that pressure. The CIA has drawn up plans and  designs against the administration. However, the government has  remained on its feet... [ellipsis as published]    [Batur] Has the CIA tried to have Saddam Husayn ousted?    ['Aziz] That has been disclosed by the U.S. officials  themselves. It is not an Iraqi claim. They supported the  opposition groups in Iraq with $30-$40 million. However, they  got nothing from it.    [Batur] Do you think a democratic process could be a way out  for Iraq?    ['Aziz] We have our own standards of democratization. We  cannot adopt liberal standards similar to those in the United  States and Western Europe. Iraq existed for thousands of years  before the United States appeared in the international arena.  It decides for itself what it wishes to do. It has decided to  keep its present administration.    [Batur] Will Iraq not disintegrate if the present state of  affairs is allowed to continue?    ['Aziz] No, it will not. It was said in 1990, 1991, and 1992  that the disintegration of Iraq was only a matter of minutes  away. Predictions were made that our country would break up  within six months and the administration would be ousted.  However, it has not disintegrated, nor will it. We have  remained on our feet for 6,000 years.    [Batur] Is it true that an effort is being made to establish  a Kurdish State in northern Iraq? The framework of that state  will be established in due time...    ['Aziz] No, I do not think so. There is no potential for the  establishment of a Kurdish state. The present state of affairs  is an artificial situation created by the United States. We  reached an agreement with the Kurdish leaders in 1991. They  were ready to sign it.    [Batur] Was it only Democratic Party Leader of Kurdistan  Mas'ud Barzani who was ready? Was Patriotic Union of Kurdistan  Leader Jalal Talabani also prepared to sign it?    ['Aziz] Barzani was prepared to do so. However, Talabani  changes his mind every two hours. Barzani said that he needed a  few weeks to secure the support of the people. He was  immediately summoned to Washington and London. The U.S. and  British Administrations instructed him not to sign that  agreement. Actually, the agreement was a democratic accord. It  would have served both sides' interests. However, Washington  and London obstructed it.    [Batur] Was it the objective of establishing a Kurdish State  that caused the failure of that agreement?    ['Aziz] No, it was not. However, they were convinced that  the agreement would strengthen the Saddam Administration. That  is why they blocked it. Nevertheless, they did not support the  establishment of a Kurdish State. The Kurds were used in the  past, and they are still being used. They were used as a trump  card to weaken the Iraqi Government in the 1970's. The U.S.  officials are again using the Kurdish problem card against the  Iraqi administration at the present time.    [Batur] The Kurds continue to fear Baghdad...    ['Aziz] Why are they afraid?    [Batur] Well, they were attacked in the past.    ['Aziz] Why should they be attacked--that is, unless they  attack the Iraqi administration first? Several factions in the  political parties headed by Talabani and Barzani cooperated with  Iran and were attacked for that reason. They opposed Iraq when  the United States and its Western allies were at war with our  country. They are receiving material aid from Washington and  London to use against their own people right now. However, the  majority of the Kurdish people do not support the Kurdish  leaders' policies.</p>

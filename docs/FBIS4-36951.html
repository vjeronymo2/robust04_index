			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali left  Amman [for Washington] this afternoon to join his Majesty King  Husayn.    In a press statement at Queen Alia Airport prior to his  departure, Dr. al-Majali said that the summit due to be held  between His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton  is important. He added that during this summit, the two leaders  will discuss the means of promoting and enhancing Jordanian-U.S.  ties, regional developments, and international issues. Dr.  al-Majali went on to say: They will also discuss the most  recent developments in the peace process, particularly those  relating to the Jordanian track of negotiations, as well as the  negotiations on the other tracks, especially the Syrian and  Lebanese tracks of negotiations, because we believe that the  negotiations on these tracks should see progress. Jordan's firm  position underscores the need for a comprehensive solution. He  noted that the progress made on one track is also good for the  other tracks of negotiations.    On inter-Arab coordination at this phase, the prime minister  said: The concept of coordination is not being seriously  observed. The level of inter-Arab coordination has not risen to  the desired levels. He indicated that coordination among the  Arab sides engaged in the peace process has continued to take  place whenever there is an opportunity to do so. He added that  whenever new developments occur, the other parties are informed  of this. He noted that this is done constantly.    With regard to the issue of al-'Aqabah, Dr. al-Majali said  that the Jordanian Government is about to sign a deal in this  regard with Lloyds Register. He noted that there is a minor  problem hampering this, and that this minor problem is about to  be resolved.    The prime minister was seen off at the airport by Deputy  Prime Minister Dhuqan al-Hindawi, several cabinet ministers, the  chief of Public Security, and several other officials.</p>

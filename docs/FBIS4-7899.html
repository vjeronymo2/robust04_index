			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 6 (CTK) -- Without hesitation,  Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said yesterday that "Russia  has Czech experience to draw on," the Czech daily LIDOVE NOVINY  writes today. He is probably the first Russian politician ever  to have said anything like that, the paper adds.    In short, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus has scored a big  success  in Russia, the paper writes, adding that besides a largely  routine agreement on the support and protection of investments  and a 1994 bilateral trade agreement, Klaus's mission to Russia  is notable for achieving a visible turnabout in the Russian  approach to bilateral relations.    If until now Russia has been accepting Czech payments for  oil  and other raw materials while allowing Czech imports go unpaid  for, this policy has now probably come to an end. The two  countries' finance ministries have until the end of May to draw  up a document which would set out terms for the Russian debt  repayment.    The Czech Republic has at long last been deemed to be a  country with which it pays to have good long-term relations  instead of shortsightedly abusing Czech dependence on oil from  Russia, the paper writes.    In recent years, Russia has acquired a bad image in general,  but especially as regards the economy. The Russian economy is  incredibly inefficient and the limping reform is not expected to  improve noticeably in the years to come.    In view of the lack of recovery factors it comes as no  surprise that quality of goods does not improve. And yet in  some respects Russia has remained an economic superpower, the  paper writes.    Russian trade balance registered a $19.5 billion surplus in  1993 with the balance of payments running even. The country,  therefore, has not run further into debt, the paper says.    Russia's overall foreign debt has attained the $80 billion  mark but even so, its value per head remains lower than, to give  an example, the one for the Czech Republic, not to mention other  former Warsaw Pact countries except Romania.    Russia, then, does not belong to countries hopelessly in  debt  which should or must be allowed some write-offs. Such an  approach would be mistaken both in logic and the assessment of  reality, the paper says.    The lasting quality of what has been achieved, however, is  to  be doubted as it depends on Russia remaining stable. In any  case, the Czech negotiating position will improve markedly once  the Ingolstadt oil pipeline has been built, doing away with the  dependence on its pipeline from Russia.    That said, the Czech Government's fundamental policy should  aim to recapture the Russian market. The partial capitalization  of Russian debt, meaning that Russian firms are sold to Czech  investors, would be a meaningful contribution to that end. The  question is, however, the paper asks, whether Czech companies  are capable yet of such an expansion.    LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, writing on the same theme, says that  during his two days in Moscow, Klaus presented himself as being  on an equal footing with his counterparts and as someone who  does not even shrink from telling unpalatable facts.    Klaus's thoroughly pragmatic or even utilitarian approach  found expression in shifting the emphasis from the past,  exemplified by the Russian debt and the vassal-like attitude of  the former COMECON countries to the Soviet Union, to the future,  ideally conceived as one of standard trade relations between two  countries with equal rights.    In contrast to the former "mutually unprofitable  cooperation"  Klaus proposed "business as usual," the paper says.</p>

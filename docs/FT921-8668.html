			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Clarke revelation a lower priority for analysts MANY STOCKBROKERS' analysts left the meeting without taking in the significance of Lord White's identification of Mr Clarke as his successor, write Charles Leadbeater and Norma Cohen. The implications of Hanson's decision to pay its dividend quarterly, the prospects for acquisitions in continental Europe and the impact of the Beazer acquisition upon the group's balance sheet were of much more immediate concern. Overall, investors said the company had acquitted reasonably professionally. The off-the-cuff announcement of Mr Clarke's position as heir apparent will probably have little bearing upon Hanson's share price in itself, although some fund managers said it reflected poorly on the way the long-planned presentation was conducted. One fund manager explained: 'We were a bit stunned to hear Lord White's announcement. At first we thought he meant the person who was succeeding him as the next speaker.' Mr Charles Pick, from Nomura, commented: 'It is helpful to some extent to know who it is, but it is only half the riddle solved.' The problem is that the disclosure of the identity of Lord White's successor leaves Lord White looking like a lame duck, while also increasing pressure upon Lord Hanson to name the person who will eventually take over as the chairman of the group as a whole. Most investors and analysts remarked that Lord White seemed more subdued and less fit than Lord Hanson.</p>

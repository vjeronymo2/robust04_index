			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Siemens advances 8% on strong domestic market SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday reported a rise of 8 per cent to DM859m (Dollars 521m) in net profits for the first half of its current financial year, with business growing faster at home than abroad. It said activity improved slightly towards the end of the second quarter. But progress was different throughout the group, with standard electrical products feeling the impact of the worldwide economic weakness. Among the best performing sectors were telecommunications and medical technology. The overall east German order inflow was DM1bn higher at DM2.4bn, but this partly reflected the first-time inclusion of Siemens' new subsidiaries there. The domestic market provided the main impetus behind Siemens' turnover and orders, with foreign business relatively flat. Mr Karlheinz Kaske, chief executive, said in March the worldwide economic slowdown did not appear to be ending quickly. Turnover in the first six months ended March 31 rose 8 per cent to DM36bn; while Germany showed 12 per cent increase, foreign sales were only 5 per cent higher.</p>

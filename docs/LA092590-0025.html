			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> IN SEARCH OF THE STEALTH SENATOR  </P> <P> Where was Wadie? That's the question 40th District voters should be asking  themselves about state Sen. Deddeh's attendance record during the past  legislative session -- and the final, crucial week in particular.  </P> <P> A computer analysis shows that Deddeh (D-Bonita) missed 43% of the Senate's  votes, an absentee rate surpassed only by a Los Angeles senator hospitalized  for alcoholism and a heart problem.  </P> <P> Particularly disturbing, however, was Deddeh's decision to miss the last,  hectic week of the session, when landmark oil-spill legislation was passed,  $3.6 billion in bonds were put on the November ballot and a bill requiring  earthquake insurance for state homeowners was finalized. Deddeh spent the week  at home, entertaining relatives in the days before his only son's wedding.  </P> <P> Then he compounded that misjudgment with this remark to a Times reporter: "The  bills that were before us -- nothing was crucial, nothing was important,"  Deddeh said. "As far as I was concerned, if those bills were not passed at all,  the state would probably be better off for it."  </P> <P> Deddeh is dead wrong in that assessment. His statement that he was ready to fly  to Sacramento on a moment's notice, if needed to break a deadlock, is proof.  Moreover, South Bay and San Diego voters didn't elect the 24-year incumbent to  stay home as the Legislature cast more than 800 end-of-session votes. He should  have been in Sacramento attending to statewide and local issues.  </P> <P> The computer tally of Deddeh's votes somewhat exaggerates his absences. For  example, it makes no allowances for conflicting committee meetings that force  legislators to miss some votes. But Deddeh's 43% absence rate is almost three  times the Senate average.  </P> <P> Most of his colleagues in the San Diego delegation achieved considerably better  attendance records.  </P> <P> As Deddeh goes through a reelection campaign this fall, he should explain his  actions to constituents casting their votes this November.  </P></p>

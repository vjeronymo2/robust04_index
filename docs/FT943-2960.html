			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Property: Better luck next time - Simon London on whether banks will fuel the property cycle The boom-to-bust property cycle of the past decade was - like the wider UK economic roller-coaster - fuelled by debt. Bank lending to property companies peaked in May 1991 at Pounds 41bn, or nearly 13 per cent of all commercial lending, which left the industry more highly geared than ever before. The reasons for this debt explosion are complex. The reluctance of pension funds and insurance companies to invest in property meant that equity funding was scarce. The development boom of the late 1980s meant that the industry's thirst for finance was great. Encouraged by the high margins which could be earned in property lending, banks were only too willing to fill the funding gap. Yet the experience of the past four years underlines that excessive reliance on debt makes an already cyclical business truly vicious. As capital values fell there was simply not enough equity in the industry's funding mix to take the strain. Receiverships were the inevitable outcome. The questions, then, are whether banks will be asked to finance the property cycle this time around and whether they will be prepared to do so on terms that companies find acceptable. There is certainly no reason to expect domestic investment institutions to suddenly regain their enthusiasm for property. The recent flow of institutional funds into property looks more like a tactical response to rising asset values than the start of a long-term trend. While overseas institutions have been high-profile investors in UK property throughout the downturn, their interest waxes and wanes. The London Stock Market has already done its bit: property companies have raised almost Pounds 3bn in rights issues and flotations in the past 18 months, which explains why demand for bank finance is currently weak. But this infusion of equity will not last for long. All this suggests that banks will, before long, find property companies queueing for loans. Initially, at least, many of these potential borrowers will not be welcomed with open arms. The overhang of debt remains a problem. By the spring of this year banks had reduced their property lending to Pounds 33.5bn, or 10 per cent of all commercial loans. But many of the biggest lenders still feel over-exposed. Barclays, the most enthusiastic of the clearing banks in lending to property in the late 1980s, had Pounds 6.3bn loans outstanding to UK property and construction companies at the end of its last financial year. That was equivalent to 9 per cent of total UK assets - personal as well as commercial loans. With lending elsewhere in the economy still weak, property loans will clearly have to be rationed if that percentage is going to fall. None of this implies that clearing banks are unwilling to lend to the right customers on the right terms. 'We are active lenders into the sector but in a more selective way, concentrating on relationships where we can do more than provide plain 'vanilla' (no frills) loans,' said Mr Ian Marcus, director at Natwest Markets. Overseas banks - led by the German mortgage banks - took advantage of the clearers' caution to carve valuable niches for themselves. The number of foreign banks in London lending to property companies has increased further over the past year. Lending margins have already narrowed as a result. But there is no sign of margins sliding as banks compete aggressively for business. For the moment, at least, the lessons of recession are still fresh. Bankers now recognise that they need to earn a decent return on capital,' said Mr Mark Burton of United Bank of Kuwait. 'If a bank is taking equity-style risks it should insist on an equity return.' That points to more differential pricing, with riskier property companies paying much higher margins than their more established peers. The cautious attitude of banks towards development finance is also likely to favour the bigger borrowers. While most banks have a blanket ban on funding speculative developments, they are happy to support such schemes through their general-purpose loans to the big quoted property groups. The rise of relationship banking is part of the reason. Big property companies will buy other services, such as corporate finance advice or treasury management products, helping the bank to earn its all-important return on capital. This attitude is in marked contrast to the late 1980s, when banks were happy to back the rise of small, entrepreneurial developers such as Rosehaugh and Stanhope. How long this mood of caution prevails depends on whether the lessons of the slump are enduring. With the benefit of hindsight it is clear that many banks did not understand the risk they were taking. 'A margin of 2 per cent over interbank rates looked terrific back in 1989 because the returns on other types of lending were so low,' said Mr Richard Lovell, head of property at Industrial Bank of Japan. 'But banks lending 80 per cent of value at the peak of the market were providing risk capital as well as senior debt.' One test will be whether loan-to-value ratios of 60-70 per cent - the norm for investment deals struck over the past year - creep higher. Given the highly cyclical nature of the asset it would probably make more sense for loan-to-value ratios to fall as property prices rise. Greater understanding between valuers and bankers would probably help avoid the worst excesses of the last cycle. Valuation Guidance Note 12 - produced earlier this year by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the British Bankers Association - replaces 'open-market valuation' with a forward-looking 'estimated realisation price' (the price that might be achieved if the property was put on the market immediately). More important, the guidance note suggests that the valuer comments on trends which could effect the realisation price - which should surely include an opinion on whether the market is heading for a fall. If that provides banks with timely reminders of where they are in the cycle, the wider property market will surely benefit.</p>

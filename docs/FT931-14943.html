			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: The ENO's car-lot 'Carmen' returns - Opera David Pountney's car-lot Carmen, first seen in 1986, has been revived for a second time by English National Opera. Those who were repelled by it on previous occasions will no doubt stay well clear, but they will deprive themselves of some first-rate performances, not just from Sally Burgess in her return to the title role, but from almost every other member of the cast too. Truth to tell, Pountney's translations of period and place do very little to illuminate the drama, and perhaps only emphasise that the central issues of Carmen are timeless ones. The urban debris of Maria Bjornson's set adds little save a generalised clutter, and for all that modish detail Pountney's production functions very much like a run-of-the mill neo-realist show. It is post-modernism without any teeth, or a meaningful agenda. Perhaps it is just meant as a send-up, but at least it is one that has the tact to recognise those moments in the opera when real emotions come through. Nothing is done to upset Bizet's careful pacing and the musical text seems a correct, uncontentious one. It is the energy of the revival, supervised by David Sulkin, that sustains the evening most effectively. Justin Brown conducts a very serviceable account that may not always be absolutely idiomatic but recognises that there is no space in this show for contemplation. The pace is never allowed to slacken, and the bustling detail that has gone into the chorus work is vividly portrayed; the ENO chorus and the splendid children's groups work very hard indeed. So too do the principals. Burgess's predatory, physical, exciting Carmen is presented with extraordinary vividness, every element of her singing, acting and, crucially speaking, is charged with intensity. She is well matched to Edmund Barham's Don Jose (new to the production). He sings with massive assurance and much style, and visually gives every sense of a hopeless, doomed victim, with no feeling of male superiority here. There is a nicely frumpy Micaela from Cathryn Pope, a splendid tarty pair of gypsies from Ethna Robinson and Maria Moll and a growling, convincing Zuniga from Richard Angas. The party piece, though, is Donald Maxwell's glitter-rock Escamillo, all camp and coiff, and positively poured into his skin-tight trousers. Like all jokes, one suspects, the production itself does not repay repeated scrutiny. But the performances do, and that of Ms Burgess especially, which seems to grow steadily in command and compelling intensity. London Coliseum; performances until February 26. Revival sponsored by Guinness plc</p>

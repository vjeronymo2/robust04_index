			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Council of the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] has accepted the coalition agreement, and it  will propose to the extraordinary delegates assembly, which is  to convene tomorrow, that it should accept the agreement on  principles of joint governing with the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] and on the basic points of the government program. At  the SZDSZ National Council the agreement received 50 votes in  favor and five against. Four people abstained from voting.  Party Chairman Ivan Petoe said that those SZDSZ members who  cast their vote against the coalition agreement objected to the  negotiations with the MSZP in the first place. The SZDSZ  delegates assembly is not going to change the text of the  coalition agreement.</p>

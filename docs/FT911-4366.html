			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / EC catches professional football offside FORGET Paul Gascoigne and any of soccer's other heroes: when Martin Bangemann takes to the field, grown men quake. Bulky Bangemann wears the distinctive blue shirt with 12 yellow stars of the European Commission. With his goal of an open internal market in sight, this fleet-footed right-winger has never seemed shy of tackling the protectionist defence. In Strasbourg yesterday, the commissioner resumed the toughest match of them all: taking on the Union of European Football Associations (Uefa) over the vexed questions of player contracts and discrimination against foreign players. But some members of the European Parliament fear the Commission's star striker may be about to bottle out. So far, it emerged, the scores are about equal. Bangemann has just nudged through a 'gentleman's agreement' with Uefa reinforcing the principle that all professionals are free to leave for another club at the end of their contracts. According to Euro-lawyers, that should mean an end to continental clubs' attempts to extract transfer fees from former players' new clubs. However, it may not end the lucrative market for top players. Commission officials said there would still be a case for the new employer compensating the old for the cost of grooming a young Pele into an international superstar. Still, they described the agreement as the first step towards a standard contract between clubs and professional players. Uefa and the Commission have also exchanged pennants on another deal, under which national associations will have to allow each first division team to field at least three foreigners and two 'acclimatised' foreigners in domestic league matches from the 1992 season onwards. That will be a blow to Germany - Bangemann's home side - which restricts its clubs to two non-nationals each. But as football-mad MEPs are keen to point out, the new Uefa principles are still offside according to the Treaty of Rome's rules on circulation of professionals and non-discrimination. As Brian Simpson, Labour MEP for Cheshire East, notes: 'That means Liverpool could be down to Peter Beardsley and John Barnes in a European match.' Simpson, a qualified referee, wants Bangemann to go further and press for complete non-discrimination. 'I have a British passport and so does Ian Rush (Liverpool's Welsh international): for him to be treated as a foreigner in his own country is absurd.' But Bangemann seems resigned to the fact that when it comes to soccer, most players know how to stretch the rules. 'Professional football is commerce,' he observes.</p>

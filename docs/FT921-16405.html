			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Bush puts blame on Japan and EC for trade row PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday rebuffed Australian farmers demanding an end to US farm subsidies. He declared that the European Community and Japan were mainly to blame for protectionism in world trade. On the first leg of his four-nation Pacific tour, Mr Bush also made clear that he wants Japan to make trade concessions during his talks in Tokyo next week, particularly by opening its market to the hard-hit US automotive industry. Then, early today, while Mr Bush was on a four-hour visit to Melbourne, Australian mounted police charged into a crowd of about 500 demonstrators protesting against his presence. Their banners read: 'Stuff Bush's New World Order'. The president was then leaving Melbourne for Singapore, the next stage of his tour. Mr Bush had earlier faced complaints from more than 3,000 Australian farmers, outside the federal parliament in Canberra, that US subsidies were costing them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. He then delivered a tough trade speech to a joint session of the parliament. The president told members that US subsidies - known as the Export Enhancement Programme (EEP) - were needed to offset an 'avalanche' of subsidised exports by the European Community. The US would not halt the EEP programme of subsidies until the EC had cut its own export subsidies, he said. Asked at a news conference to explain the apparent double standard of refusing to modify US protectionist policies while demanding big concessions from Japan, he replied: 'We've never said we're totally pure.' The EEP programme was the main source of friction in talks in Canberra between Mr Bush and Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, who urged the US to avoid traditional markets for non-subsidised Australian grain. The US programme subsidises the disposal of US grain in world markets. Australia claims this has reduced world grain prices and forced non-subsidised Australian exports out of traditional markets, notably in the Middle East, where US sales have increased since the Gulf War. Mr Bush said the best solution would be an agreement on freer agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) which is expected to conclude shortly. During his news conference with Mr Keating, Mr Bush sounded much like a candidate running for re-election, with one eye on the Republican primaries to come. He attacked the EC and Japan for unfair trade practices, and singled out Japan's trade surplus for renewed criticism. The surplus was costing American jobs and slowing the US recovery, he said.

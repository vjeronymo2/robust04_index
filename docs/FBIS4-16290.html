			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] RIGA, Apr 14, BNS -- The European countries  endorse the present Latvian stance in relations with Russia, the  Baltic nation's President Guntis Ulmanis told reporters Thursday  [14 April] on return from his European trip. During his  three-day journey, Ulmanis met with 16 top level leaders of  Denmark, France and Great Britain and learned that the issue of  relations between Latvia and Russia would be considered in the  European Union's [EU] Political Committee. [passage omitted]    Ulmanis and European politicians discussed a possibility to  create a special foundation to help Russia's military retirees  return to their historic homeland. The foundation could be  sponsored by European countries, the Latvian president said.  Consequently, the return of war pensioners to Russia could be  settled "in a civilized manner," Ulmanis said. The foundation's  resources could also be used to clean the environmental damage  from the Russian-operated radar facility at Skrunda.    The Latvian Cabinet has already set up a working party to  draft the foundation's statutes.    Ulmanis reiterated that the package of withdrawal agreements  would not be signed unless Yeltsin revoked the April 5  directive. In addition, Ulmanis claims that the initialed  agreements should be amended before signature in view of the  setup of the mentioned foundation.    Latvia's people staunchly reject several terms in the  agreements judging by "thousands of letters with many  signatures," Ulmanis noted. The very idea to create the military  personnel repatriation foundation belongs to one of their  authors. Taking into account the interior situation in Latvia  and Russia, Latvia cannot try to begin talks on entirely new  agreements on troop withdrawal, Ulmanis said.    Ulmanis quoted European politicians as praising the  agreement  on Russian troop withdrawal by Aug. 31 as a considerable  achievement of the Latvian diplomacy. The signature of the troop  withdrawal treaty is considered a basic prerequisite for  Latvia's acceptance to the European Union, Ulmanis said.    Foreign Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Martins Virsis,  who accompanied Ulmanis to Europe, said that EU is unlikely to  enroll countries that are unable to settle their relations with  neighbors. Consequently, Latvia has to tackle the key problems  in relations with Russia independently. Ulmanis prognosticated  that Latvia could become EU associated member in 18 months.    During the trip, Ulmanis and European leaders also touched  on  the problems of citizenship in Latvia. EU member states should  not prioritize the applicants' ethnic belonging in  naturalization. The other criteria, like language skills and  residence qualifications, are interior issues of each separate  country.</p>

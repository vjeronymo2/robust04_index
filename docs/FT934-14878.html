			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forte to float airport services side next year FORTE, the hotel and restaurant group, said yesterday that it intended to float its airport services division on the Stock Exchange early next year. Forte had signalled the move last year when it failed to sell the business, along with its Gardner Merchant contract catering division, to the Compass group. Gardner Merchant was sold to its management and a venture capital consortium at the end of last year. Some analysts had expected the division's flotation to take place in a few years' time. The market, however, quickly digested the news of a quicker flotation and Forte's shares closed down 5p at 222 1/2 p. The group said the exact timing of the flotation would depend on stock market conditions next year. The division is expected to be valued at between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m. Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said he would be happy with a price above Pounds 210m and would not want the division to be valued at anything below that. Forte will retain a 25 per stake which Mr Forte described as a medium-term investment. The division, which employs 6,000 people worldwide, has two sectors: flight catering and airport retailing. The catering arm provides 45m in-flight meals a year to 150 airlines. The airport retailing arm is the largest in the UK. The division made trading profits of Pounds 17m on turnover of Pounds 404m in the year to January 31 1993. In the first half of the current year, trading profits were Pounds 12m on turnover of Pounds 208m. Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst with Smith New Court, said that although the planned flotation had been announced some time ago, he still questioned its wisdom. The airline meals business fitted in well with Forte's other catering activities, which include the Welcome Break, Happy Eater and Little Chef roadside restaurant chains. Mr Forte said, however, that the provision of in-flight meals was more of a manufacturing than a catering business. Analysts said the sale would reduce pressure on Forte to accept a low bid for its Harvester restaurant chain, which is up for sale. They said the flotation would also reduce the likelihood of a rights issue. Mr Forte said he did not believe the group needed a rights issue and none was planned. He said some of the flotation proceeds would be used to reduce debt, which stood at Pounds 1.3bn at the end of July. The remainder would be used to expand the remaining hotel and restaurant businesses. Mr Forte said no large acquisition was in prospect.</p>

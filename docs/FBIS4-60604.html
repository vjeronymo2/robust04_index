			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 26, IRNA -- A morning English daily here  Thursday [26 May] commented on the recent decision by the  government to control prices and said that pricing policy might  serve as a "tranquilizer" but it will not ultimately be a cure  or a remedy.    The `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial expressed pessimism over  the new policy which was launched to curb the inordinate price  hikes and ease down the existing economic pressures faced by the  consumers.    The paper referred to the incompatibility with economic  liberalization and with the supply-demand trend, its requirement  to a monitoring body which is in conflict with the policy for  manpower adjustment and its insufficiency for the commodities  whose prices were perpetually undergoing changes as some of the  disadvantages of the policy.    Without a tinge [of] doubt, the paper said, such a policy  will not slash or stabilize the prices. To the contrary, it  will cause a qualitative and quantitative slump in production,  it added.    The article noted in conclusion that the officials should  reduce inflation rates and curb price hikes by "opening up  avenues to promote economy and production and ultimately to  warrant economic prosperity."</p>

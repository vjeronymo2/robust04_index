			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (11): Ruthless self-examination - The contents and importance of the Rexrodt Report THE report published by the German government on 'safeguarding Germany's future as an industrial location' is an attempt to launch a national debate on the country's international competitiveness. It is a report on the high costs of German labour; on the growing burden of the welfare state; on excessive public sector involvement in the economy; on resistance to change and suspicion of high technology; on inflexibility of management as well as of labour; on short working hours and machine running times; and on lack of competition in key areas of the German economy. Some would argue that the entire subject, seized upon by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, as the most important theme in Germany in the coming years, has been dealt with far too negatively. The report fails to highlight the extraordinary strengths of the German economy, its stability, and its capacity to change - slowly but surely. Yet all sides of the political and industrial spectrum now accept that the subject must be urgently discussed. The Rexrodt report seeks to address the issue not merely from an economic standpoint, but also philosophically. On the philosophical side, it calls for a return to old values of thrift, initiative, competitiveness and creativity, combined with solidarity, tolerance and humanity: in short, the values that have underpinned the extraordinary post-war success of Germany's social market economy. 'After more than 45 years of reconstruction and growing prosperity, many of these values do not have the same weight which they once had,' the Rexrodt report says. 'Not least in connection with German unity, it is clear that the readiness for innovation and change has diminished to an extent which presents the economy and society with considerable problems. 'Structural changes are no longer perceived as chances for social and economic advance, as well as for greater prosperity. They are seen as a threat to rights and assets, a threat identified with unemployment and social decline.' The report, presented by Mr Rexrodt to the German parliament in September, spells out a whole range of problems and challenges which contribute to the concern over German competitiveness, and then sets out its own recommendations for reform. At the same time it calls for a national debate on the issues. It sees seven major challenges to be accomplished: to create up to 5m new jobs in both halves of Germany, and thus wipe out the growing level of long-term, structural unemployment; to prevent the inexorable rise in state spending as a proportion of national income, and particularly to limit the rise in social spending; to reverse the trends which leave Germany with the shortest working week, the shortest working life, some of the longest holidays, and the shortest machine-running times in its factories; to invest more state money in research into new technologies, and less as subsidies for uncompetitive old industries; to cut back bureaucracy and red tape, which results in lengthy planning approval times for new projects; to cope with the dramatic changes in population structure, which will see one third of the population over 60 by the year 2030; and to reverse the trend towards purely academic training, instead of technical and vocational training. The environment in which Germany must seek to meet those challenges has also changed markedly. The most dramatic development internally is that of German unification, and ensuring the recovery of the east German economy is clearly the government's highest priority. At the same time it recognises that Germany faces an ever more intense competition for new investment, as the globalisation of world markets makes it possible for manufacturers to base wherever they please. That competition is increased by the need to open the western European market to ensure that the new democracies of the east have a chance to develop. The problems spelt out by the Rexrodt report cover the full range of economic activity. He believes that the state has become involved in too many activities which could be carried out more efficiently by the private sector, and a privatisation programme, both at the federal and at the state level, is an important part of his plans. He singles out the extremely high level not simply of wages, but of personnel ancillary costs in Germany. Ancillary wage costs amount to 84 per cent of direct wages today, thus almost doubling the costs of employing an extra worker. Of those extra costs, 44 per cent are dictated by legal obligations, in particular health, pensions, unemployment and social security, and 56 per cent are various fringe benefits negotiated directly by employers and trade unions, in addition to basic pay packets. He mentions electricity costs for German companies well above the international average; and indirect costs aggravated by red tape, long planning procedures, extremely strict environmental legislation, and building regulations. He also criticises German companies for failing to invest enough in measures to improve productivity and rationalise during the past 10-year growth phase. And he criticises many German companies for a lack of innovation. As far as state spending is concerned, Mr Rexrodt wants to reduce the absolute proportion of GDP spent by the public sector from more than 50 per cent today to the pre-unification level of around 45 per cent. Within that amount, the emphasis should be switched to action which promotes investment, innovation, and employment. He calls for cuts in public sector staffing, especially in east Germany, where remnants of the old communist system remain. He wants new subsidies to be limited, in principle, to a maximum of five years, or to be progressively decreased. And he wants to limit the public sector deficit to less than 3 per cent of GDP by 1996 - in line with the convergence criteria for the future European economic and monetary union. As far as competition is concerned, he is seeking stronger powers for the national cartel authorities to implement EC competition law, as well as the establishment of an EC cartel office in Germany. He wants EC merger control more strictly oriented on the principle of competition. And he wants action against voluntary restraint agreements which violate cartel law. The programme includes further reform of corporate taxation in Germany, to remove disincentives to new investment. This includes further action to dismantle taxes not related to earnings, such as the business capital tax and the so-called operational wealth tax. It supports taxation which encourages environmental protection - like the proposed EC-wide carbon dioxide emission tax - provided it does not increase the overall corporate tax burden. On the employment front, the report calls for strict limitation on social benefits, including stabilisation and if possible reduction in all the contribution rates for health, pensions, unemployment and old age care. It seeks rapid parliamentary approval of the draft law on more flexible working hours, relaxing restrictions on weekend, holiday and shift-working. It proposes legalising private employment agencies for a test period of two years, to compete with the present state monopoly of labour offices. In tackling excessive red tape and regulation, it calls for simplification of the approval process for genetic technology research; simpler planning requirements for new factories; and an overhaul of the complex of administrative procedures companies are required to follow. As for privatisation, it singles out federal government holdings in Lufthansa, airports and seaports as a high priority, and the sale of real estate owned by the state. It calls for speedy implementation of the reform of the Post Office, with the aim of abolishing the telephone service monopoly, and privatising the Deutsche Telekom, postal services, and post bank. It also covers the entire range of promoting research and development, higher education, vocational education, and secondary school education. 'Safeguarding the future of Germany as an industrial location is for politics, the institutions and the people of our country the main task to be resolved in the years that lie before us,' the report concludes. 'When the people in Germany reflect upon their common interests in safeguarding the future of the economy, and act accordingly, Germany will master the challenges of the future.'</p>

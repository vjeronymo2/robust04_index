			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHWEST'S BATTLE OVER TREES AND JOBS  </P> <P> Regarding your article, those of us who live and work in the Northwest would  like to comment. It was silly for your reporter to compare the rain forests of  the Amazon, which are being razed, to the forests of this country which are  scientifically managed and replanted after they are harvested.  </P> <P> Countries like Brazil don't preserve trees in wilderness areas like we do, nor  do they have a sustained yield policy as we do in this country. The Forest  Service is directed by the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 and the  National Forest Management Act of 1976 to manage the federal timberlands for  multiple use and sustained timber harvest.  </P> <P> Private landowners in the United States plant more than 6 million trees daily,  and federal and state governments plant another 900,000 trees daily. As a  nation, we recognize that timber is a unique, renewable resource.  </P> <P> The ecosystem we want to preserve is an interrelationship of working people and  the land that supports them. We have enough tree museums in the 32 million  acres of wilderness already set aside in this country. And many Americans  cannot enjoy these wilderness areas because no roads or motorized vehicles are  allowed in them. The public benefits from Forest Service timber sale programs  because we need the wood products our forests provide us for housing and many  everyday needs.  </P> <P> DAVID and SUZANNE PENEGOR  </P> <P> Eugene, Ore.  </P></p>

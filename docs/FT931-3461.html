			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Observer: Name game One of the puzzles about HSBC Holdings is why no high-powered image consultant has come up with a better handle. It's a funny name for one of the world's top 10 banks. Cast an eye down the list of the world's blue-chip lenders and one has to look a long way before finding a more forgettable name than HSBC Holdings. Apparently, there was once talk about rechristening Honkers and Shankers something rather airy-fairy like Trade Winds or Mercator. But that idea was soon shot down as a bit too racy. If the powers that be can't think up anything else, and given that two of HSBC's main banks are called Midland, it might even be worth renaming the group Midland Bank International . . . after a decent interval, of course.</p>

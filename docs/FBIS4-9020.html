			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 16 (CTK) -- The People's Union of  National and Social Salvation (LUNSZ) led by former high-ranking  Communist Party official Miroslav Stepan, today condemned "NATO  aggressive air strikes and other interference in Yugoslavia" in  a statement given to CTK.    The LUNSZ favors the peaceful settlement and ending of  hostilities in Yugoslavia without external interference, says  the statement. "NATO has no right whatsoever to interfere in the  former Yugoslavia and through its military actions there has  again confirmed its aggressive nature," it adds.    "The experience with NATO's illegal actions in ex-Yugoslavia  confirms the truth of all citizens and organizations which  oppose the Czech Republic's joining NATO which could draw it  into fratricidal wars for foreign interests," LUNSZ members  assert.    The statement says that the LUNSZ supports the position of  Russia which demands that the war conflict in Bosnia be solved  by Yugoslav nations themselves and primarily in a peaceful  manner. The LUNSZ demands that NATO activity be ended "as it  has been promised by NATO when the former Warsaw Pact ceased to  exist."</p>

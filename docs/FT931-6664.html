			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A word from your clutter buddy the best place I know in which to veg out in February. To this end I took walks in the desert, sat by still pools, swung a few tennis rackets, lived on date shakes and was careful not to read anything more irk-making than Joseph Wambaugh or The New York Times. (I tell a lie. I read a bit of Balzac. But in Palm Springs they think that Balzac is a hairdresser, so that was fine by them). Only once did my mobile phone chirrup, and then it was the president, calling from Air Force One. 'Hiya, Michael,' said the president, 'just thought that I'd touch base.' 'Good afternoon, Mr President.' 'Bill will still do,' he said. 'William at a pinch. There is no call for ceremony.' His voice sounded hoarse. 'I heard you were in the Springs, soaking up the rays.' I said: 'We have our problems, too, you know. We're expecting a storm tonight.' 'Get away,' said the president. The reason he was calling, he explained, was to see whether I had any course-setting ideas to help him dodge the 'tax-and-spend' flak caused by his speech to Congress in which he detailed initial remedies for America's woebegone economy. 'I have told my people,' he said, 'that you have a great idea about once in seven months, so what have you got for me? Let me hear your input.' My brain churned into action. I signalled to the pool waiter to bring me - por favor - a grapefruit juice. I said: 'I do have an idea. It comes from reading the Word Watch column in The Atlantic by Anne H Soukhanov. She describes preliminary research into some of the words and phrases being tracked by the editors of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, third edition (Houghton Mifflin). New words and phrases that exhibit sustained use may eventually make their way into the dictionary, says the magazine. 'The phrase that caught my eye was clutter buddy. If you ask me, William, we should go to work on clutter buddy. Your presidency has started well. I admired your speech to Congress. It will be a while, yet, before the dozy columnists at the Post and Times wake to the full potential of your presidency. They are still habituated to the multi-trillion wastrelism and political cowardice of the Reagan-Bush years. But they will stir from their torpor soon. To give them a kick, you should appoint a string of clutter buddies.' There was silence from Air Force One. 'Soukhanov says a clutter buddy is one who supports another person in sorting and discarding accumulated possessions. She says that the anti-clutter movement of the 1990s - thought by some to be a reaction to the acquisitiveness of the '80's - is manifest in clutter clinics; in adult education classes in clutter management, which have produced some 200,000 clutter graduates, and in clutter hot-lines and de-clutter guidebooks. 'According to Soukhanov, people drowning in clutter are advised to start small: to clean a small area, perhaps 12 inches square. Keep it clean. Then go on to another spot. Experts in clutter management also advise that people give themselves frequent rewards along the way. 'This is a big idea, William. An extremely big idea. You could be in the White House for eight years. After that, Hillary Rodham Clinton could be president, followed by Chelsea. We are talking 2016, William. 'But you have got to make your mark in the next few months. Appoint clutter buddies throughout Washington. Every cabinet member must have one. Their powers must be absolute. The reason the planet is suffering so cruelly is that governments everywhere are moving far too slowly. They are sinking in an ocean of intellectual garbage. 'They find themselves trussed and bound like carcasses at a meat show. Their reaction times are pathetic. Where is the vision thing? Poverty. Pollution. Over-population. All these matters are swamping us yet governments are scuttling crab-wise, afraid of their own shadows. 'The solution is simple: bring on the clutter buddies. We need them everywhere. Throw out the garbage]' 'That is great,' said the president. 'Everyone on Air Force One is beholden to you, Michael.' I said: 'Think nothing of it, Bill. God bless America]'</p>

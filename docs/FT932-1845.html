			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Back to real painting - William Packer admires the work of Michael Leonard After the fatuities and empty posturings of the larger portion of the Venice Biennale, it is a relief to return to paint on canvas, properly achieved, and to work that draws directly upon the real and visible world. The apparatchiks and fellow-travellers of the academic avant-garde may find it hard to accept: it may be that never again will anything but the conceptually kite-marked - fauna in formaldehyde (Damien Hirst) or pseudo-profound philosophising (Richard Hamilton) - be allowed to represent us: but true painting goes on, as it always will, honourably, insistently, privately. It was put to me in Venice that for an artist thus to consult his own experience was but self-indulgence. With the world falling apart less than a hundred miles away, was it not ever more the artist's duty to engage with the issues of the day - nationalism, capitalism, Aids or whatever. Pity the poor artist who came in from the incorrect side, but even so the idea was all, the means incidental, the technical quality of the statement irrelevant. The essential question was not: what is this work as art? It was: what is it about? This is the greatest heresy. We no more require to be hectored in our politics or social morality by artists than by actors or singers. In Venice the proof lay all about us, where we could find Tiepolo at his most magisterial while waiting for the boat, and the greatest of Bellini on stepping off. And the point of such art was never the message itself, for the preaching was always to the converted. Rather it lies with what each artist did, technical mastery and the creative, humane imagination resolved into an integral whole. The artist's duty is only to get the work right as he knows it, that we may then test its integrity against our own experience. There is nothing self-indulgent in that. Michael Leonard is unlikely ever to be asked to represent us at Venice, but he is nevertheless one of the most serious and particular painters of the figure that we have. As such he is a member of a band as tiny as it is distinguished and as conspicuously neglected - Euan Uglow and Victor Newsome are others who come to mind, particular differences notwithstanding - whose work owes nothing to expressionism, nothing to immediacy or overt spontaneity of gesture, and everything to the long, unremitting study of the life-figure. Leonard came to painting in his late thirties - he is now 60 - after an early career in graphic design. He had command from the start of a meticulous technique, but at first relied over-much on photographic reference for his imagery, with all the perceptual limitations that follow - the camera never lies, and never tells the whole truth. What makes his work so interesting and convincing now is that he has developed from that position without ever denying or abandoning it. For the photograph has its uses, properly interpreted and understood, and Leonard clearly still makes much use of it. In the organisation of the composition especially, with the interruption of the figure by the frame, and in the close fore-shortening of the space, the influence of the camera is undeniable. In the actual disposition of the figure, too, in poses that if not actually awkward, are certainly unsustainable over an extended period, the photograph again is a necessary aid. And yet how much there is now in evidence that could only have been done before the model. The form is modelled deep into the shadows where only the eye could follow it, and through and across the lit form, close to the picture-plane, flesh and bone are described with a subtlety of surface variation, of tone, colour and texture, that could only have been picked up directly. His single nude bathers, male and female, stoop and twist to dry themselves: the man touches his foot in the classic attitude of the crouching Mercury: the woman in profile reaches up to tie her headscarf. The echo is of Degas, but while the images as images recall the older artist, the quality of the paint itself is that of the young Degas, the surface highly finished, looking to Ingres and the romantic afterglow of neo-classicism. It is a potent and particular brew. My only reservation is with the painting of some of the heads of hair, that would seem to have been painted neither from model nor reference, but made up afterwards, a surprising inconsistency. I end with two last-minute recommendations. The new Giorgio Morandi Museum at Bologna opens in October, which event has been anticipated at the Accademia Italiana, where five choice works from the collection have been on show for some time. This is the final week, next Sunday the final day. Two landscapes, a pot of flowers and two still-lifes cover the career, from the 1930s to the 1950s, of the most refined and exquisite painter of our time, whose 'self-indulgence' in the thing seen, form in space established with the utmost simplicity, touches the heart, telling us more of what it is to believe than any polemic. And Dennis Creffield has returned to painting after his graphic pilgrimage around the great churches of England and France. An extended stay at Petworth saw him installed in the very room and painting from the very window from which Turner took his own view out across the Park. While paying due respect to the distinguished ghost, Creffield made his own way and found his own Petworth, expressionist and idiosyncratic. The paintings of the South End facade, rising like palazzi on the Grand Canal, are especially impressive. Michael Leonard: paintings &amp; drawings; Thomas Gibson Fine Art, 44 Old Bond Street W1, until July 16. Giorgio Morandi: Five paintings from Bologna; Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate SW7, until June 27. Dennis Creffield: paintings of Petworth; Gillian Jason Gallery, 42 Inverness Street NW1, until July 2, then on tour to Petworth, Birmingham, Peterborough, Durham and Brighton: in association with the National Trust's Foundation for Art</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Timex offers 'loyalty' bonus REPLACEMENT workers at the Timex plant in Dundee are being offered a bonus payment of Pounds 7 a day for every day they have worked at the factory provided they stay as long as the company wants them to, James Buxton writes. The plant, the centre of a bitter industrial dispute, is due to close later this year. The payments are being made to ensure that replacement workers stay to complete orders and ensure an orderly rundown of the factory. Timex said yesterday: 'The company recognises that the replacement workforce had expectations of longer employment than Timex has been able to offer them.' Some replacement workers have been at the plant since February and would be entitled to payments of more than Pounds 1,200 on top of their weekly wage of Pounds 135 if the plant stayed open until December. Last week Timex announced that the factory would close within six months. The announcement came after the 343-strong sacked workforce overwhelmingly rejected an offer. Under it 150 of them might be re-engaged on lower pay than they had received before sacked and the rest would receive an ex-gratia redundancy payment.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Fed reopens inquiry into BNL loans THE US Federal Reserve has reopened a formal investigation into the scandal over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta, Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), according to US officials and a senior executive of BNL. The US central bank, concerned about repeated allegations that Rome officials were involved in the Atlanta loans that helped build President Saddam Hussein's war machine, issued a formal subpoena to BNL in December. That subpoena demanded a series of documents relevant to the bank's dealings with Iraq. Investigators from the Fed have been in the Italian capital during the past few weeks, questioning BNL officials. The new investigation was described by one US government official as an attempt 'to finally get to the bottom of the story and find out the degree to which Rome may have been involved in the Iraqi loans'. The Fed's renewed interest in the BNL case was spurred in part by revelations last autumn that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had withheld confidential reports that alleged involvement by BNL in Rome in the Atlanta loans to Iraq. The bank has denied any involvement in the Atlanta loans. Disclosure of the CIA reports came during a court hearing in Atlanta in which the US Justice Department during the Bush administration argued that the Dollars 5bn of Iraqi loans had been organised by Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta manager. Mr Drogoul argued instead that executives in Rome knew about and approved the clandestine loans. His trial has been postponed until next autumn. The reopened Federal Reserve investigation was also triggered by the fact that last December BNL sacked a small number of mid-level executives who worked on the Iraqi loans matter in Rome. Mr Gianmaria Sartoretti, one of the BNL executives to have lost his job, is said by US officials to be considering filing unfair dismissal charges against the bank. In Rome, a new Italian Senate commission investigating the BNL loans scandal is expected to begin its deliberations today. Mr Davide Croff, a senior BNL executive, said the bank had received the subpoena and was co-operating with officials from the US.</p>

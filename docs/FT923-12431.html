			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Books: Mystic seductions of the sage of schlock KAHLIL GIBRAN: HIS LIFE AND WORLD by Jean Gibran and Kahlil Gibran Canongate Press Pounds 17.50, 456 pages IT IS easy to mock: the profits from The Prophet, Kahlil Gibberish, schlock philosopher. But in the 70 years since it was published, The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran's prose-poem, has been a constant bestseller. In the US of prohibition and depression, its mystic counsels were a soothing alternative; in the 1960s it was a counterculture guidebook; in the '80s the message of spiritualism overcoming material success was lapped up by disillusioned Yuppies. 'He sounds like Jesus,' gasped the maid who hid behind a screen to listen to Gibran's dinner party chit-chat. 'Let's not copy the Bible, but we can bear it in mind,' he wrote to The Prophet's editor. Who was the man behind the cult, and why was he so compelling? Forget critical judgment. It does not matter whether you think, as I do, that Gibran's mix of rhapsodic aphorisms and everyday devotions is sentimental mumbo-jumbo, or, like the authors of this new biography, that he is one of the great poets of the 20th century. This account is an off-beat personal drama told by authors - Gibran's nephew and his wife - so at ease with their background that it also grippingly entertains as social history. Here, as if they had walked out of a Henry James novel on to these pages, are the Boston Brahmins, socially glittering, inwardly moralising, worrying, manipulating. Into their charmed circle comes the illiterate Lebanese immigrant staking out a place in 1900s American art and letters. Love of the exotic, decadence, puritanism, sex, paternalism - all determine the subsequent heady relationship that is the story of this book. It begins near the Cedars of Lebanon, where Gibran was born in 1883 into a poor Christian family. In the 1890s, minus his ne'er-do-well father, they emigrated to Boston, where his mother became a peddler on the streets of the Syrian ghetto. Within a decade, three of the five Gibrans were dead of cancer and tuberculosis, leaving Kahlil and a sister. Marked out early as more gifted and beautiful than the rest, Kahlil was noticed by a schoolteacher who sent him to Boston's philanthropist-decadent, Fred Holland Day. Day imitated Oscar Wilde and enjoyed plucking immigrant urchins from the streets, rigging them up in elaborate versions of their national costumes, and photographing them. Given embroidered Arab burnooses and a water-pipe, Kahlil posed as a young sheikh, read Maeterlinck, became a 'pagan' nature-worshipper, had some illustrations published and got invited to Boston drawing rooms. Boston intellectuals were then flocking to private lectures on 'The Karma Yogi', spiritual movements from the Christian Scientists to the Society of Psychical Research were recent Boston inventions and, says his nephew, 'the young Syrian fitted well into the transcendental atmosphere.' Patron number one, a glamorous poetess called Josephine Peabody, 'proclaimed that she would become a Buddha' if she spent much time with him; she was the first of a string of hostess-lover-editor-muses to be held in his thrall. When she married, Gibran replaced her with Mary Haskell, a liberal headmistress whose swashbuckling habits and flirtations with lesbianism were alarming Boston parents. A Yankee Jean Brodie, she was besotted with him for 20 years and even scavenged from her neighbours' cooks in order to fund him. Sought out yet misunderstood, feted yet still the outsider, Gibran first wrote in Arabic. It was the oriental mysticism implicit in the English parables and poems - The Madman, The Forerunner, then The Prophet - which brought him fame as a western mage from the east. Writing at a time of growing disillusion with organised religion he tapped a popular nerve with foreign-sounding biblical cadences pleading for spirituality yet liberalism, a sort of soft drug religion for those who could not stomach hard orthodoxy but wanted mystical highs. But the message seems also to encapsulate pioneering American optimism: 'The whole Prophet is saying just one thing: you are far far greater than you know - and All is well,' Gibran said. Taken up by Knopf, Gibran was relentlessly hyped - one dust cover falsely quoted Rodin calling him 'the William Blake of the 20th century'. This biography, as devoid of critical spirit as almost all commentaries on Gibran, does not attempt to analyse the work; curiously prudish, it ignores, too, most of the rumours of drinking and womanising that surrounded the writer. Do not buy it for answers about an elusive personality, but as a story of survival, assimilation and extraordinary social constellations, and of the making of a cultural phenomenon, it rattles along splendidly.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "All Quarters Show Concern for U.S. Policy </F> Toward China"]    [Text] At a time when Sino-U.S. relations are being  followed with great interest by the international community,  U.S. President Bill Clinton delivered a mild sounding speech the  day before yesterday. He said: There are still weeks for the  United States to make a decision on the question of the renewal  of most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment for China. He promised  he would do his utmost to remove differences between the two  countries. He went on to say: "Our policy is that human rights  are important, but so are the other issues." These remarks seem  to show that there has been some change in the official U.S.  approach toward China. Hence, it is being followed with great  interest by all sides concerned.    As everybody knows, in recent years, the U.S. Government has  endlessly brought pressure to bear on China and interfered in  the latter's internal affairs by using the human rights issue as  a pretext. While visiting China a few days ago, U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher was all the more fierce and  overbearing in a vain attempt to compel China to yield on the  human rights issue. Before that, the U.S. assistant secretary of  state responsible for human rights made contact with a Chinese  criminal released on parole without authorization. This was a  violation of Chinese law. This at least shows that at that  time, the United States lacked sincerity to improve its  relations with China. The Chinese side has denounced the United  States' stand on the human rights issue in stern terms and  expounded China's attitude toward the issue. As a result, Sino-  U.S. negotiations on the human rights issue have reached an  impasse. China has rejected the U.S. threat to revoke MFN  treatment.    Clearly, the human rights demands set by the United States  on  China do not correspond to the reality in China. It is even  more absurd to lump together the so-called human rights issue  and the MFN issue. Chinese leaders have clearly pointed out:  Differences between China and the United States should be  resolved by adhering to the spirit of respecting each other and  seeking common ground while reserving differences and through  consultations on an equal footing. At the same time, the  Chinese also frankly told the Americans that if MFN was revoked,  not just China would be hurt, and the United States would be  hurt more than China. It would lose the huge Chinese market.    The U.S. policy of bringing pressure to bear on China has  met  intense criticism at home and abroad. At a symposium on  relations between the United States and China in Washington on  15 March, eminent American scholars, politicians, and  entrepreneurs urged the Clinton administration one after another  to continue granting MFN to China. Two former U.S. secretaries  of states, Henry Kissinger and Cyrus Vance, opposed linking MFN  and human rights. Most speakers at the symposium agreed: Once  the United States revokes MFN, this will surely invite Chinese  retaliation and lead to a sharp drop in the volume of Sino-U.S.  trade. This will not only seriously hinder economic relations  between the United States and China but will also harm political  relations between the two countries. Using his corporation's  own experience as an example, a representative of the U.S.  Boeing Corporation pointed out: In the coming 15 years, China  will need 800 civilian aircraft, and will thus become the  world's third largest aviation market. At present, U.S.  aircraft makers are in a favorable position. If the United  States revokes China's MFN, European aircraft makers will  certainly replace it. It is quite natural that they are  dissatisfied with current U.S. policy toward China. In the  international community, the U.S. policy of linking human rights  and MFN has also met universal opposition. Moreover, even its  allies have not followed suit. The fact that the Canadian prime  minister announced yesterday that he would visit China soon is  the latest proof.    It can thus be said that it is precisely because U.S. China  policy has run into snags in China, in the United States, and  everywhere in the world that President Clinton delivered his  mild sounding speech on U.S. China policy the day before  yesterday. While welcoming the speech, people will not be so  naive as to believe that Sino-U.S. relations will embark on a  smooth road hereafter. We maintain: First of all, we must  earnestly observe how President Clinton revises his  "presidential executive order" on the issue of renewing China's  MFN and how he handles the issue practically. China sincerely  hopes to establish a normal, friendly, and cooperative  relationship with the United States. However, since it differs  with the latter in ideology and values, China will not expect  too much or cherish unrealistic illusions.</p>

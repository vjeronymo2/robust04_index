			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / CrossRail rejection leaves BR plans in disarray British Rail's ambitious plans for improved transport links in London were in disarray last night after the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project was blocked by a Commons committee. The small private bill committee decided by three votes to one that the proposed tunnel linking Paddington and Liverpool Street main line stations could not be justified. The decision is a severe embarrassment to Mr John Major, who over-ruled earlier claims by Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, that the project was not justified. Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative chairman of the committee, gave no reasons for the decision, which ends months of uncertainty about the project. However, the committee is believed to have been convinced by an engineering consultancy report which said demand would not be enough until 2010. Ministers had become increasingly concerned about the project's prospects during the CrossRail committee hearings, held under the quasi-judicial private bill procedure used for infrastructure projects which could damage property rights. Worries that the project might be blocked mounted as the two Conservative and two Labour MPs on the committee put increasingly sceptical questions to expert witnesses called by BR, Railtrack and London Underground, the joint promoters. Transport department officials are believed to have started talks with the promoters several weeks ago on ways of rescuing the project if the MPs used their judicial powers to stop it. The talks are believed to focus on improving links between the tunnel under London and the proposed Heathrow Express and Channel Tunnel high-speed line services. But a substantial delay is inevitable because the government will be forced to introduce a fresh enabling bill, starting the parliamentary process from scratch. Mr Steven Norris, the minister for transport in London, said the committee's decision was 'a blow'. But he added: 'It is not the end for CrossRail. The project is certainly not dead.' Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of Railtrack, the railway infrastructure company, said it would 'continue to develop the scheme, concentrating on (linking) Heathrow with the heart of London and beyond to East London and Essex'. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said CrossRail needed 'a proper connection' with the Channel tunnel rail link and Heathrow Express. Tower Hamlets borough council, in East London, which led opposition to the project, asked the committee to force the promoters to pay most of its costs. It said the promoters had 'unreasonably' withheld evidence until near the end of the 30-day committee hearing.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia forecasts a higher than expected rise in cereals output RUSSIA MAY enjoy a sharply improved grain harvest this year of between 120m and 125m tonnes, up from 106.8m tonnes last year, the deputy prime minister responsible for agriculture said yesterday. Deputy prime minister Alexander Zaveryukha also confirmed an official estimate of grain imports falling to 16m tonnes from 26m last year. The harvest figure he quoted was higher than the recent estimate of 110m to 114m tonnes which was cited by the federal weather service. It is also much higher than the 94.1m tonnes projected for the Russian Federation by the International Wheat Council in a report published last week. The IWC put 1993 Russian wheat output at 43m tonnes, compared with 46m tonnes last year, and coarse grains output at 51.1m tonnes, compared with 55.6m tonnes.</p>

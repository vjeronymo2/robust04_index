			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CUT SPEAKING, KITTY DUKAKIS TOLD  </P> <P> Kitty Dukakis' doctors have advised her not to discuss her addiction problems  in her public appearances.  </P> <P> "Her therapist and she agree that it is critical that she not be so upfront  about her problems. It appears that her speaking might be over. Or very  limited." The Massachusetts first lady recently returned home from an  alcoholism treatment center and Tuesday night, in one of her first public  appearances since returning home, she joined her husband, Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis, at a ceremony formally forging a sister state relationship between  Massachusetts and the Japanese state of Hokkaido. She also has resumed work on  her memoirs, "Now I Know."  </P></p>

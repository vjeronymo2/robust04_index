The proposed programme,  likely to be introduced in June, will increase the basic  salaries of most government cadres.    The central government postponed a plan to turn its 34  million cadres into civil servants over fears that the move  would fuel inflation. Sources said that Guangzhou was wealthy  enough to proceed with its scheme.    Under the plan, the average take-home pay of government  cadres would be raised to a level "slightly higher than" or "at  least on par" with the amounts paid by enterprises of similar  nature. A source said the basic wage of an average cadre could  be increased to about 600 yuan (HK$532) a month, and a senior  ranking official might receive more than 1,000 yuan a month.    However, critics fear that lower-income groups and  pensioners  will continue to suffer as prices continue to rise. Last year,  the official inflation figure for Guangzhou was 24.1 percent.  The government hoped to contain the figure at 15 percent this  year.    Although city government officials admitted that prices had  jumped 20 to 30 percent since November they claimed that the  increases were still within the limits that the majority of  Guangzhou residents could bear.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa in Dollars 590m refinancing Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, has arranged a Dollars 590m refinancing of its troubled US associate, Home Holdings, as it moves to draw a line under its investment in the group. The debacle is set to cost Trygg about SKr5bn (Dollars 667m), including more than SKr4bn in losses which will hit its 1994 results. Trygg bought into the US company, which is nearly three times its size, in 1991. 'This investment has produced catastrophic economic results for Trygg. The strategy was wrong from the beginning,' said Mr Lars Thunell, Trygg's newly-appointed chief executive. He said Trygg was beginning a new era after 'four lost years' when it ceded Swedish market share and suffered huge losses because of its involvement in Sweden's Gota AB, Svenska Kredit and IC Holding, which all collapsed in 1992. Losses from Home, Gota, Svenska Kredit and IC Holding exceed SKr11bn. A US investor group, comprising Fund American Enterprises Holdings, Trident Partnership and Hellman &amp; Friedman, is investing Dollars 420m in Home to strengthen its balance sheet. The move should should allow Home to regain a competitive rating, after downgradings by three US rating agencies, and strengthen its market position. Trygg is writing off a Dollars 170m loan to Home and giving the US investor group an option to buy 14.5m of its 22.5m shares. As a result ofthe dilutive effect of the deal Trygg's stake in Home will fall to 18 per cent from 64.5 per cent and to as little as 6 per cent if the option is exercised. On Monday the Swedish company announced plans to write down its investment in Home by at least SKr2.8bn. Mr Thunell said Trygg's remaining investment was 'purely financial' and suggested it would probably be sold if an acceptable offer were made. The refinancing is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks. Mr Jack Byrne, chairman of Fund American, will be Home Holdings new chairman. Fund American is a Vermont-based financial services group. Hellman &amp; Friedman is a San Francisco-based merchant bank and Trident Partnership an investment fund organised by J. P. Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan. Home has been hit by its exposure to long-term environmental and professional liability claims and by hefty unrealised losses on its bond portfolio. Its nine-month loss of Dollars 121m was due mainly to Dollars 175m in reserve building.</p>

The paper, quoting what it said were highly reliable  sources,  said the warheads were loaded on a special train that was to  arrive Wednesday in a city in the Caucasus where the weapons  will be transferred to the factory where they were assembled.    A spokesman for the ministry of defense here denied the  report saying "that no nuclear warheads have left the Ukraine  for the moment."    SEGODNYA said that the weapons' transfer comes at a time  when  Russia and the U.S. need to improve relations following tension  between the two stemming from a spy scandal involving a former  top CIA official who has been charged with spying for Moscow.</p>

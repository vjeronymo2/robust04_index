			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Zeneca dented by Pounds 100m charge A Pounds 100m restructuring charge dragged down pre-tax profits at Zeneca, the UK bioscience group, which yesterday reported a 3 per cent fall from Pounds 362m to Pounds 351m during the first half. The exceptional provision was to enable Zeneca to withdraw from the troubled eastern European seeds market, and rationalise sites and cut costs in the agrochemicals and specialities businesses. Mr David Barnes, chief executive, said: 'East Europe is an important agricultural growing area. But sadly the economic infrastructure is in turmoil. There are huge logistical problems in selling seeds, harvesting the product and then distrib-uting it on the international market. That creates an extended credit risk, and export credit has been withdrawn - not just for seeds, but everything. It's just not worth the risk.' The seeds business received most of the provisions - Pounds 51.2m, with agrochemicals and specialities receiving Pounds 37.2m and Pounds 11.9m respectively. Mr John Mayo, finance director, rejected suggestions that Zeneca could be subject to a hostile takeover. On Wednesday, the group's share price rose 13p to 771p on takeover speculation after American Home Products made a Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.5bn) unsolicited bid for American Cyanamid. Mr Alan Pink, chief executive of the agrochemicals and seeds division, said the agrochemicals operations of American Cyanamid, the US group, would make a good fit with Zeneca's. He said a joint venture might generate significant benefits, or that Zeneca might be interested in acquiring the business at a reasonable price. However, he warned: 'We are not ready to enter a bidding race.' Zeneca's turnover rose 3 per cent from Pounds 2.32bn to Pounds 2.38bn. Excluding disposals, underlying volume was up 7 per cent. Operating profits at ongoing businesses rose 17 per cent from Pounds 405m to Pounds 473m. The dividend was increased 2 per cent from 10.5p to 10.75p. Earnings per share fell 22 per cent from 32.7p to 25.4p, the result of the share issue at the time of the demerger from Imperial Chemical Industries last year, and the exceptional restructuring charge.

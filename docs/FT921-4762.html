			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Japan's outlook 'depressed' THE BANK of Japan yesterday dismissed calls to ease monetary policy after its latest survey of business showed the weakest outlook in four years, with profits and capital spending plans declining sharply. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, called for an early release of funds for public works projects in an effort to stimulate the economy. The central bank's quarterly survey of business, known as the Tankan, showed a particularly depressed outlook for manufacturing industries. The index of business conditions dropped 18 points from November to minus five in February - the first dip below zero since November 1987 and the largest quarterly decline since 1975. The sharp deterioration will add fuel to the daily calls from political and business leaders for an early cut in interest rates. The central bank's official discount rate was cut by half a point to 4.5 per cent at the end of December. However, a Bank of Japan official said the bank saw no reason to alter its monetary policy because of the survey and had not revised its view on economic growth. The effects of the last cut in rates were still not fully realised, he said. The bank said inventories had grown more quickly than expected in the last quarter of 1991. Profits in the manufacturing industry, excluding oil refining, were expected to fall 16.4 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31. Details, Page 3</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The cost of peacekeeping MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, should be feeling a good deal happier this week than he was last July. Then his term of office seemed to be turning sour. An Agenda for Peace, the report on conflict prevention and peacekeeping he submitted in June at the Security Council's request, had been either ignored or unofficially rubbished by the council's permanent members. And he himself had got into an unseemly wrangle with the Europeans over the management of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. He complained that the EC had negotiated a handover of heavy weapons to the UN without consulting the UN itself, and accused rich nations of starving the UN of funds, yet expecting it to use a disproportionate share of its resources on conflicts in their own part of the world - at the expense, for example, of Somalia. Since then, the EC and UN peace efforts in Bosnia have merged, under the apparently harmonious co-chairmanship of Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. The UN force there has been increased, with EC member states providing troops at their own expense. A force has also been sent to Somalia to protect the distributors of food. And last week, in the new session of the General Assembly, several of the permanent members had encouraging things to say about Agenda for Peace. Election gimmick President George Bush suggested a special Security Council meeting to discuss the report and 'develop concrete responses'. That was widely seen as an election gimmick, but at least Mr Bush accepted the idea that member states should train military units specially for peacekeeping and humanitarian duties and keep them available on short notice for the secretary-general's use. He also spoke of co-ordinated command and control, multinational training exercises, logistical support, stockpiles of resources, intelligence capabilities and 'adequate, equitable financing'. The last point is a very sore one. Demand for UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) has been expanding rapidly, and the total cost will soon reach Dollars 2.7bn a year. The five permanent members are supposed to pay most of the cost, but the US is currently Dollars 209m in arrears and Russia - whose foreign minister declared his support for Mr Bush's proposals - Dollars 282m. By 'equitable' Mr Bush no doubt meant that others should pay more, though he did say the US would 'review how we fund peacekeeping and explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support'. Think differently 'I do believe,' he added somewhat plaintively, 'that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our security in this new era.' The remark may have been addressed partly to the US Congress. If so, not too much should be expected, given Mr Bush's track record of reaching agreement with that body. Japan is already footing the bill for the Cambodia operation, in addition to paying 12.5 per cent of the UN's regular budget - roughly equivalent to the combined shares of three of the permanent members: Britain, France and China. This fact was recalled yet again in his speech to the Assembly by Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, who suggested 'serious' reform of the Security Council in time for the UN's 50th birthday in 1995. He was joined by his German colleague, Mr Klaus Kinkel, who asserted that debate on Security Council reform was already under way. 'Germany will not take the initiative in this respect,' he said. But 'if a change in the council's membership is actually considered we, too, shall seek a permanent seat'. Such remarks provoke irritation among the existing permanent members, ill masked by an indulgent smile. They tend to respond complacently that it will be very difficult to agree on any new composition of the Security Council, and that Germany and Japan have yet to show themselves up to the responsibility of permanent membership. But Japan has already amended its constitution and begun to contribute to PKOs, while Germany is preparing to do the same. It seems unlikely they will go on increasing their share in the costs of the organisation indefinitely, unless their great power status is recognised.</p>

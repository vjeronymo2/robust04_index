			<p>BFN     [Text] There is every indication that events in and around  Gorazde have entered a decisive stage. As a senior Russian  Foreign Ministry official has reported to Interfax with  reference to information from that city, hand-to-hand combat is  underway there.    For this reason, NATO may decide already on Friday to back  the UN Secretary General's request for massive air strikes on  the Bosnian Serbs. However, such a decision could only escalate  the conflict and give the Serbs freedom of action not only in  Gorazde but elsewhere in Bosnia, the diplomat said.    In his words, NATO's massive air strikes might "seriously  complicate" the position of peacekeepers in Bosnia and  necessitate an evacuation of the Sarajevo-based Russian  peace-keeping battalion.    He declined to say how precisely Russia would respond to  massive air-strikes, if NATO mandated them. "There are a few  options. Let us not spur on events," he noted.    He said that "this time Moscow cannot complain that it has  not been consulted." Contacts with NATO and with Americans are  underway at various levels. It is not ruled out that they will  ultimately lead to a summit with Russia, US, EC, and UN to take  part, on which Moscow has been insisting. It is hardly likely  that efforts to prepare such a summit in just one month's time  will succeed. As for a meeting at the foreign ministers level,  it is not only feasible but necessary, the diplomat said.</p>

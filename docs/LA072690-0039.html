Air Force officials refused to comment, saying the  investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> The sheriff's gang unit was involved because Flax apparently had contact with  gang members, Hunter said. Deputies are trying to determine whether gang  members were involved in the theft or the sale of the military property, he  said.  </P> <P> Flax was charged with receiving stolen property, a felony, because it appears  difficult to prove that he stole the materials, deputies said.  </P></p>

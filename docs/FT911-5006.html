			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Claims for storms check Netherlands insurer STAD Rotterdam, the fifth largest Dutch insurance company, said 1990 net profit was up 8.9 per cent at Fl 79.8m (Dollars 42m), matching the rate of increase in turnover - Fl 2.32bn from Fl 2.13bn. Like other Dutch insurers, Stad Rotterdam's results were held back because it had to pay about Fl 55m for damages due to severe winter storms. This cost Stad Rotterdam a net Fl 8m after allowing for reinsurance, catastrophe coverage and provisions. The company is to increase its 1990 dividend to Fl 1.65 from Fl 1.64 in 1989. Net profit in non-life insurance rose 7.9 per cent to Fl 37.1m and on life insurance by 9.1 per cent to Fl 31.7m. Home mortgage operations posted an 11.6 per cent net rise to Fl 11m. Stad Rotterdam intends to set up a joint venture in banking services with Bank Cantrade, an Amsterdam-based subsidiary of Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>

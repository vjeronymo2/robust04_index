			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is an evergreen tree reaching 10 meters (33 feet) in height, with leathery, alternate, simple leaves about 8.5&hyph;12.5 centimeters (3.5&hyph;5.0 inches) long and 4.5&hyph;5.0 centimeters (1.7&hyph;2 inches) wide. The blades are elliptic with the upper surface dark shiny green and the midvein sunken. The lower surface is pale green with a prominent mid vein and with fine, parallel side veins. The leaf stalks are about 7 millimeters (.25 inch) long. The whitish bisexual flowers are solitary and axillary, 2 centimeters (.8 inch) wide and with a 2.5 centimeter (1 inch) long flower stalk. The cup-shaped calyx is persistent in the fruit, and the corolla contains 12 petals. The aromatic purplish black fruit measures 2 centimeters (.8 inch) in diameter and contains many seeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No observation or collection of the species was made for more than 40 years (Vivaldi et al. 1981). The species was rediscovered some years ago, and is at present known from fewer than 50 individuals in 7 localities of the subtropical wet and the subtropical montane wet forests of northern and eastern Puerto Rico. Three localities are within the Caribbean National Forest and four within the Rio Abajo Commonwealth Forest. All the known sites may be impacted by forest management practices. The Caribbean National Forest was severely impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia haematocarpa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are considered to be critical plants by the Natural Heritage Program of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. They are also considered rare plants by the Center for Plant Conservation (Center for Plant Conservation 1992).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia haematocarpa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> were recommended for Federal listing by the Smithsonian Institution (Ayensu and DeFilipps 1978).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia haematocarpa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> were included among the plants being considered as endangered or threatened by the Service, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of review dated December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480); the November 28, 1983 update (48 FR 53680), the revised notice of September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), and the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice of review. In the 1990 notice, both species were designated as category 1 (species for which the Service has substantial information supporting the appropriateness of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6752), the Service reported the earlier acceptance of the new taxa in the Smithsonian's 1978 book as under petition within the context of section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1982. Beginning in October 1983, and in each October thereafter, the Service made annual findings that listing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia haematocarpa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions of a higher priority, and that additional data on vulnerability and threats were still being gathered. A proposed rule to list  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia haematocarpa, Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and one other species, published on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49960), constituted the final 1-year finding in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal to list  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia haematocarpa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pleodendron macranthum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> also included the proposed listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coccoloba rugosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as threatened. After the proposed rule comment period had closed, the Service received information from a private consulting firm indicating the discovery of additional populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coccoloba rugosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and questioning the appropriateness of protecting the species under the Act. The Service has not been able to fully verify the new population data and will need additional time to conduct further surveys. This will likely take several months and cannot be completed in time for the usual 12-month deadline established by the Act for completing action on a proposed rule. The Act provides for a 6-month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to a final determination on a proposed listing. The Service finds there is substantial disagreement with regard to the population status of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coccoloba rugosa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and, therefore, is extending the deadline for a final decision on this species. A notice to extend the deadline is published in the proposed rule section of today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the September 24, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports of information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate agencies of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Federal agencies, scientific organizations and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting general public comment was published in the ``San Juan Star'' on October 10, 1993. Three letters of comment were received, one supported the listing, the other two provided information but did not indicate either support or opposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

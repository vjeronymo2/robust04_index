			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pierre Suard, chief executive officer of </F> Alcatel-Alsthom, by Caroline Monnot on 18 April, place not  given: "If We Had Expected To Lose Money, We Would Not Have Gone  Ahead"]    [Text] [Monnot] The Koreans have finally chosen the  GEC-Alsthom consortium for the manufacture of their high-speed  train. This was a rather bumpy ride. Is the decision final,  this time?    [Suard] It is, as far as we are concerned! We consider the  decision firm and final. The actual services to be rendered  have been defined, while the legal aspects remain to be  finalized. This will be done in the coming weeks. This is an  extraordinary achievement for French industry! It demonstrates  that France has a number of technologies -- in this case the TGV  [high-speed train], but also telecommunications, nuclear  technologies, satellites -- which place it at the forefront of  ever fiercer international competition. As for the TGV, I must  say that this is a success not only for Alcatel-Alsthom, but  also for the French state and the SNCF [French National Railway  Company] which initiated this technology 30 years ago.    [Monnot] This contract is a real stimulus for the railway  operation of GEC-Alsthom, one of your subsidiaries.    [Suard] Indeed. For GEC-Alsthom and its subcontractors,  this contract represents four years of work for 800 people. The  first segment of the Seoul-Taejon line must be ready in late  1999. The whole line (with its extension to Pusan) must be  ready by 2001.    [Monnot] Last November, Siemens lowered its bid to $2.1  billion. At the time, GEC-Alsthom, whose 1993 bid was $270  million higher, had stated that such a price was unreasonable.  Yet this is the price level at which you closed with Korea.    [Suard] Well, we held a number of negotiations. The  services to be rendered were changed. A larger share of the  equipment will be manufactured in Korea, which means lower  costs. The agreement stipulates that out of the 46 trains to be  supplied to Korea, 12 will be entirely manufactured in France,  while the balance will be assembled in Korea. Roughly speaking,  half of this contract's revenues will flow to Korea, and the  other half to France. In any event, as compared to our bid of  last year, the expected margin remains the same.    [Monnot] You will not lose money at this price level?    [Suard] Of course we will not! Had we expected to, we would  not have gone ahead.    [Monnot] The contract also provides for an integral  technology transfer to Korea.    [Suard] The idea is that, by the time the contract has been  completed, Koreans will be able to manufacture the type of train  we are selling them today. This only relates to current trains,  with today's technology. It does not include the next  generations.    [Monnot] Will you get financial backing from the French  Government?    [Suard] No. There will be no funding from the French  Government. And, I might add, no compensation whatsoever. The  technology to be transferred is already worth a lot. The Korean  component of the contract is to be funded locally. As to the  exported element, it will be funded by banks, including Suez,  which played an integral part in the negotiation.</p>

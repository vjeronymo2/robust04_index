			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Insurance loss cancels Baltica growth BALTICA, the Danish insurance company, has swung into loss for the six months ended June running up a deficit of DKr60m (Dollars 8.734m) compared with a profit of DKr256m a year earlier, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Mr Hans Ejvind Hansen, chief executive, said that a 10 per cent cut in staff is planned for the next two years. Employee numbers have fallen from 3,600 to 3,324 over the past 12 months. Baltica increased earnings from financial investments in the half year to DKr307m from DKr255m, but it made a loss on the insurance account of DKr193m compared with a profit of DKr36m last year. The insurance loss reflected a shortfall of DKr275m on credit reinsurance, a business being discontinued. Premium income was little changed at DKr1.68bn, while claims rose to DKr1.40bn from DKr1.05bn.</p>

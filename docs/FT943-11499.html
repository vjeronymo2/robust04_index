			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kirin finds cheer in demand for Budweiser Kirin Brewery, Japan's largest beer and beverage company, said brisk demand for Budweiser beer, sold under licence from Anheuser-Busch of the US, helped sales and profits for the first half to June. The company said effects of price discounting of beer by leading supermarket chains and increased competition from cheap imported brands had yet to show up in its interim profit figures. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June rose 4 per cent to Y35.9bn (Dollars 366m), on a 1.9 per cent increase in sales to Y628.4bn. After-tax profits climbed 19 per cent to Y17.3bn on a fall in special losses from property sales. For the full year to December, Kirin expects a 13.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y87bn on a 6.2 per cent increase in sales to Y1,430bn.</p>

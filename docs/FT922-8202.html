			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Daiwa Bank may bail out Yanmar Diesel DAIWA Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, is considering a plan to shore up the finances of Yanmar Diesel group, led by the leading Japanese diesel engine maker. The group faces big losses on its securities investments because of the sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market. Yanmar said it had unrealised losses of Y50bn (Dollars 376m) at its two finance subsidiaries. The group has asked Daiwa and other leading commercial banks such as Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo Bank and Fuji Bank, for cheap loans. Bank loans to Yanmar's two affiliates total over Y110bn. The move comes at a time when many Japanese companies, which rushed to invest in the bull market of the late 1980s, are experiencing problems. An increasing number of companies are expected to turn to banks for support. A spate of company rescues is expected to erode bank profit margins. Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo expects city banks' profits to suffer in the next three to four years because of problem loans of up to Y25,000bn. Kleinwort reckons 30 to 50 per cent of such loans may be unrecoverable.</p>

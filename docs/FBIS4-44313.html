			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The European Union has  promised Algeria a loan of 200 million ECUs by the end of the  year, Prime Minister Sifi announced during a Brussels news  conference this morning before his departure for Paris. He also  talked about the daily violence taking place in Algeria:    [Begin Sifi recording] On the domestic front, we are  determined to fight without respite against violence and  terrorism until they are eradicated. Our external security is  closely linked to the security of the Maghreb and the security  of the Mediterranean region. This is why our message should be  as clear as possible. It is in the interests of neither our  neighbors nor our European partners that Algeria remain unstable  for a long time or that a regime contrary to our traditions and  human rights emerges.    Europe knows that and knows that it is in its interests to  see us through. That is why we are in a hurry to reach a new  Algerian-European cooperation agreement that takes into account  the changes that have taken place in our economy and our new  vision of our relations with Europe. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LAWYER CALLS BOESKY 'A PILE OF GARBAGE' IN WALL STREET TRIAL  </P> <P> Convicted swindler Ivan Boesky is "a pile of human garbage" who lied repeatedly  on the witness stand about dealings with former stock speculator John A.  Mulheren Jr., Mulheren's lawyer said today.  </P> <P> In closing arguments in Mulheren's fraud and conspiracy trial, attorney Thomas  Puccio attacked the credibility of Boesky, who testified against Mulheren as  part of a plea deal that settled insider trading charges.  </P> <P> "If there ever was a person to whom the title Prince of Darkness could be  applied," Puccio said, "Ivan Boesky is that man: the king of greed, a person  who stood for nothing except his own ambition, his own greed."  </P> <P> "Boesky, ladies and gentlemen, is a pile of human garbage," he said. "And that  is what the government of the United States had put up to testify against John  Mulheren."  </P> <P> Mulheren, 40, is charged with 30 counts of conspiracy, securities and mail  fraud, and keeping false books and records in connection with allegedly illegal  securities transactions with Boesky in 1985 and 1986.  </P></p>

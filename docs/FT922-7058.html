			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Docklands 'option'for civil servants SENIOR civil servants throughout Whitehall had been informally reminded that any prospective departmental moves should take account of the 'attractive options' that might be on offer in Docklands, Downing Street said yesterday. In line for a move to Docklands are the departments of the environment and transport, whose Marsham Street offices in Westminster are due to be demolished next year. Ministers continue to emphasise that any move to Docklands would have to be made on value for money grounds and not as a 'bail-out' for troubled Canary Wharf developer Olympia &amp; York.</p>

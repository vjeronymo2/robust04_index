			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RUNAWAYS' SHELTER CUTS SIZE TO 20 BEDS  </P> <P> Covenant House, a private social welfare agency with hopes of opening a 100-bed  crisis shelter for runaway teen-agers in Hollywood, has run into opposition  from competing social agencies and will instead operate a 20-bed shelter,  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Covenant House will open its scaled-down shelter this summer, said Anne  Donahue, executive director of Covenant House California.  </P> <P> Officials have not chosen the site for the shelter, but City Councilman Michael  Woo said he will work closely with Covenant House to find a location.  </P> <P> Other social service agencies that serve teen-agers opposed Covenant House's  original plan to open a 100-bed shelter, contending it was too large.  </P> <P> Some community members also opposed the shelter, saying it would act as a  magnet, attracting jobless, homeless teen-agers to Hollywood, which already has  a large population of runaways.  </P></p>

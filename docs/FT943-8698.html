			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Technology: American R&amp;D rich in paradox - Innovations multiply as research stagnates The latest survey of US companies' investment in research and development echoes the 'ingenious paradox' in The Pirates of Penzance, the comic opera in which hero Frederick was 20 years old and a little boy of five at once - because he was born in a leap year. How the total which American companies spend on R&amp;D can remain flat for six years while so many are vibrantly innovative is a paradox worthy of WS Gilbert, librettist of The Pirates. In 1993, US companies' spending on their R&amp;D rose by 4.2 per cent over the year before, or a tiny 1.9 per cent after inflation, according to Business Week's annual compilation of industrial R&amp;D, based on Standard and Poor Compustat data. Internationally, the 4 per cent rise put US companies slightly ahead of non-US concerns, whose R&amp;D rose overall by only 2.1 per cent, but well behind the UK, Switzerland and Sweden, which increased by 10 per cent or more. In the US, industrial R&amp;D has been nearly stagnant in real terms since 1987, according to the National Science Foundation. The total, now Dollars 83bn (Pounds 54bn) has been held down by nearly level spending by the big auto concerns and by office equipment and computer manufacturers such as IBM and Digital Equipment. Companies had many reasons to cut R&amp;D in the late 1980s. Military contracts were drying up, so defence companies cut their own military-related R&amp;D. The pervasive loss of global market share in a host of industries, followed by the 1990-91 recession, caused chief executives to make further cuts. President Bill Clinton took office pledging to raise industrial R&amp;D, but his supporters can no longer blame the stagnation on his predecessors. Charles Larsen, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute, believes that R&amp;D spending in 1994 will be little better, since CEOs are holding back spending to pay for Clinton's health reforms. So North America's slice of the world's industrial research total will continue to narrow. In the postwar decades, more than half of all industrial R&amp;D spending in OECD countries was carried out by US companies. But between 1985 and 1990, the US share declined by five percentage points to 47 per cent. Japan's share increased by six points to 21 per cent and Europe gained 1 per cent during the same period. By 1993, the US share had narrowed further, to 43 per cent. The trend seems unlikely to be reversed by the much-touted industry-government 'partnerships' which form the core of Clinton's technology policy. They are too small-scale, and the dollars that firms are using to match federal funds seem to be taken from other projects. How can US industry R&amp;D totals stagnate as companies show the very innovations that R&amp;D is supposed to produce? How could IBM have won more US patents than any other company in 1993 - fully 1,087 - while the company slashed its R&amp;D? Berkeley economist Paul Romer argues that monopoly theory has the answer. He notes that the giants such as General Motors, IBM, AT&amp;T and General Electric have found they can no longer afford enormous research programmes as their markets have been eroded by competition. 'A monopoly which controls a whole industry has an incentive to do R&amp;D for the whole industry,' he says. 'But as its market erodes, it has a disincentive to fund the full range of work because its competitors can free ride.' By the new pattern in the US, aggressive small and mid-sized firms invest heavily in research, while the old giants hold R&amp;D down. The related trend by which companies obtain more R&amp;D from universities may help to give US firms a global edge as such arrangements are fewer in Europe and Japan. The pattern is still worrisome because as a side-effect big companies have cut basic science; overall, US industry cut this by one-quarter to Dollars 3.7bn last year. So the final paradox is that industries need to engage in basic research to remain market- competitive in the longer run.</p>

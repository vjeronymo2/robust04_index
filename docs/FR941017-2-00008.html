The meeting will convene on October 31, 1994, at 9 a.m. and will adjourn at 11 a.m. This meeting will be held at the Census Bureau, Conference Center, Federal Building 3, Suitland, Maryland.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1995 Census Test is a continuation of the Census Bureau's research on fundamental changes to reduce the differential undercount from the 1990 census and to contain the cost of the census. The 1995 Census Test will include operations to count people in housing units and in group quarters (such as nursing facilities and college dormitories), and at selected locations that provide services to homeless and needy people. The Census Bureau plans to conduct a test of the feasibility of enumerating people at locations that provide services to homeless and needy people, such as shelters and soup kitchens. Beginning March 1995, Oakland, California; Paterson, New Jersey; and six parishes in northwest Louisiana will be enumerated. This operation is one of the various enumeration methods aimed at improving coverage in the 2000 census for people likely to be missed by standard enumeration procedures for housing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Census Bureau will invite representatives from national organizations that represent providers of services to the homeless population. At the meeting, the Census Bureau will discuss the general purpose of the 1995 Census Test and will provide details of the Service-Based Enumeration operational activities. This meeting should be of significant interest to those organizations that are representatives of national and state coalitions on the homeless, involved with homeless research issues, homeless advocates, service providers, and users of population data from the decennial census.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tentative agenda for the meeting is: (1) Opening Remarks, (2) Overview of the 1995 Census Test, (3) Overview of the ``Service-Based Enumeration Operation,'' (4) Public Questions, and (5) Closing Remarks. The meeting will be audio recorded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This meeting is open to the public; however, seating is limited.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament June 29 SAPA -- The intelligence budget  component of the Special Defence Account [SDA] was split between  obtaining intelligence on weapons smuggling,  counter-intelligence and intelligence operations outside South  Africa, chief of the South African National Defence Force  [SANDF] Gen Georg Meiring said on Wednesday [28 June].    Addressing the joint standing committee on finance, he said  R37 million [rand] of the R3.093 billion Special Defence Account  was earmarked for intelligence projects. The remainder of the  SDA was allocated to capital expenditure and non-project related  expenditure such as ammunition, weapons, missiles, vehicles,  spares and repairs.    The SDA was subject to more stringent control than the rest  of the defence budget. Any expenditure had to be authorised by  both the ministers of defence and finance. The ministers also  had to individually authorise spending on intelligence projects.    R297 million had been cut from the SDA for re-allocation to  the Reconstruction and Development Programme in the current  financial year. He offered the joint committee a detailed  briefing on the manner in which the SANDF determined its  strategic threat analysis which forms the basis for its  budgeting. Chairperson Jill Marcus accepted the offer on behalf  of the committee.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS TOPANGA READY FOR SOUP LINES?;  </P> <P> POVERTY: AFTER A YEARLONG CRACKDOWN ON THE HOMELESS IN THE AREA, ONE GROUP IS  TRYING TO HELP BY PROVIDING FOOD AND OTHER SERVICES.  </P> <P> It was morning in Topanga Canyon. Fog lifted from the mountains as steam rose  from a large pot of chili. Several dozen day laborers stood in line, waiting  for a free breakfast of hot soup, bread and fruit.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the quiet scene was interrupted by shouts from a passing truck. The  driver's words weren't entirely clear -- something about "them" -- but his tone  obviously was one of anger. Volunteers Marg Starbuck and Susan Lovell looked at  each other, shook their heads and kept passing out the food.  </P> <P> "If we wait for government to take care of them, we'll wait forever," said  Lovell, a movement therapist who has lived in the canyon on and off since 1965.  Lovell recently joined a group known as PATCH -- People Assisting Topanga  Canyon's Homeless -- which was formed several months ago to help day laborers  and any other local homeless people.  </P> <P> As the presence of day laborers persists in Topanga Canyon, the approximately  9,000 residents remain divided on whether to embrace, shun or simply tolerate  them. In recent weeks, however, after a year of stepped-up sheriff's patrols  and immigration raids that defied the community's bohemian reputation, Topanga  seems to have shifted back to its liberal roots.  </P> <P> One group of volunteers cooks and serves soup every weekday morning. Another  holds English classes. Still another is hoping to establish a hiring center.  </P> <P> Most are working under the auspices of PATCH. Members said they formed PATCH in  response to suggestions that residents boycott day laborers and turn them in to  authorities.  </P> <P> "All of us feel very strongly that these people are a part of our community,"  said Maryana Kuretski, a family therapist. "We are using them. There are a lot  of jobs up here, mainly in construction, and it is our obligation to integrate  them."  </P> <P> For journalist Flavia Potenza, who moved to Topanga 15 years ago from New York  City, the day laborer debate also signifies the canyon's gentrification as  property values increase and a more conventional crowd moves in.  </P> <P> "People just don't yell at you about your dogs anymore. They sue you," Potenza  said. "The funkiness of the canyon has gotten cleaned up."  </P> <P> For the last six weeks or so, every weekday morning, as many as 50 men have  gathered near the corner of Topanga Canyon and Old Topanga Canyon roads for the  homemade soup. Starbuck, an artist, picks up groceries donated by Topanga and  Santa Monica markets and passes them out to a network of cooks, who take turns  serving their creations from the backs of the trucks and vans.  </P> <P> The food is served between 9:15 and 9:30 on the theory that those who have  gotten work for the day have already been picked up.  </P> <P> On a recent morning, the laborers eating breakfast said Topanga Canyon is  popular among them because of generous wages -- $5 or $6 an hour compared with  an average of $4 an hour elsewhere in the city -- in addition to its friendly  residents and, now, its soup kitchen.  </P> <P> "For me, it's real helpful and demonstrates that the American people -- as I've  always believed and been told -- are very humanitarian," said farmer Thomas  Carnales, 42, who said he left El Salvador after his 16-year-old son was killed  by guerrillas.  </P> <P> Some canyon homeowners remain concerned about day laborers camping in  drought-stricken hills and now fear that PATCH may inadvertently contribute to  the risk of fire.  </P> <P> "What I fear is that it's going to encourage them to live in the brush in  Topanga," said filmmaker David Gottlieb, a Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource  Conservation District board member who specializes in fire prevention.  </P></p>

In accordance with the aim of this agreement, the sides  ensure the safety of refugees and displaced persons during  voluntary repatriation and rehabilitation operations.    3. During the implementation of this voluntary repatriation  program, the sides undertake to uphold the following principles:    a) Displaced persons and refugees have the right to return  voluntarily to their places of origin or residence irrespective  of their ethnic, social, or political affiliation in conditions  of complete safety, freedom, and dignity;    b) The voluntary nature of the repatriation is determined  and  ensured by the corresponding agreements;    c) Displaced persons and refugees have the right to return  peacefully without risk of arrest, detention, imprisonment or  criminal prosecution.    Such immunity does not extend to persons in the event of  there being serious signs that:    They have committed a military offense or an offense against  the person, as this is determined in international documents; or  they have committed a serious criminal offense or earlier  participated in military actions and currently belong to armed  formations that are preparing for military actions in Abkhazia;    Persons belonging to these categories should be informed  through the corresponding channels as to what consequences they  can expect to face on their return;    d) The sides ensure that refugees, on their return, have the  right of free movement and settlement, including in those  regions where they used to live before they left the conflict  zone or in regions of their own choice;    e) The sides ensure that refugees and displaced persons, on  their return, will extend or renew their passports and  registration.

Such compensation should be provided  within the framework of reconstruction and restoration programs  that will be implemented with the financial support of the UN  voluntary fund.    h) Displaced persons and refugees who do not plan to return  to Abkhazia will receive the same assistance and protection  until acceptable alternative solutions are found regarding these  cases;    i) In accordance with the fundamental principle of  preserving the unity of the family, if it is not possible to  repatriate all family members, mechanisms for uniting them will  be created in Abkhazia.

In order to implement the voluntary return of displaced  persons and refugees in accordance with this agreement, a  quadrilateral commission will be formed.    5. The main tasks of the commission are to elaborate,  discuss, and approve plans for implementing the safe, orderly,  and voluntary repatriation of refugees and displaced persons and  also their successful reintegration. The commission will also  establish the rules of procedure for controlling the application  and implementation of Point 3 (c). Such plans should include  registration, transportation, basic material assistance within  six months, and help with rehabilitation.    In order to guarantee the conditions for the return of  refugees and displaced persons, the commission will form a  working group of experts that will assess the amount of damage  done to the economic and social infrastructure in Abkhazia, the  existence of homes in the regions to which refugees will be  returning, and the level of need regarding rehabilitation and  restoration together with the financial consequences proceeding  from this. This research should be organized consecutively --  region by region -- in accordance with the plan for return that  has been coordinated and approved by the sides, taking into  account that the sides have agreed that the repatriation will  commence in Gali rayon.    6. The commission is composed of four members, one each from  the sides, the Russian Federation, and the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees.    In addition, the CSCE will appoint a representative who will  participate in the meetings of the commission as an observer.  If circumstances prevent the appointed representative from  being present at such meetings, the commission will regularly  supply information on the progress of the commission's work to  the CSCE mission in Georgia.    7. Any committee member participating in any committee  meeting can be accompanied by such advisers whose presence is  considered necessary by the side that has appointed this member.  In such cases, when this or that commission member is unable to  participate in any meeting of the commission, the corresponding  side can appoint a replacement.    8. Meetings of the commission will be held when necessary  but not more than once a month. Meetings of the commission may  be convened at the request of any member and it will be held on  the territory of the Russian Federation except in those cases  when commission members are able to agree to something else.  The sides agree to ensure the personal security of commission  members and personnel participating in the implementation of  measures that have been agreed upon.    The date for holding the first meeting of the commission  should be determined in as short a time as possible but no later  than one week after the Security Council has adopted a  resolution on the mechanism that will ensure the safety  conditions in the regions to which the refugees will be  returning.    9. At its first meeting, the commission will establish the  procedure for the assessment mentioned in Point 5 and will  determine a plan concerning:    a) The regions where repatriation will be carried out, first  and foremost, in accordance with the guaranteed security and the  level of readiness;    b) An information campaign among displaced persons and  refugees aimed at encouraging their voluntary return;    c) The process of registering those persons who have  expressed their readiness to return;    d) Measures necessary to ensure the safe return of these  persons on the basis of the principles that are stipulated in  Point 3 (a-i);    e) The financial and transport needs of displaced persons  and  refugees and basic material assistance and also the presumed  needs regarding rehabilitation and restoration in the places to  which they will be returning, as indicated in Point 5.    10. The sides agree that representatives of the refugees and  displaced persons should be guaranteed assistance enabling them  to visit the places to which they will be returning and  ascertain for themselves what conditions are being created for  their return.    11. If disagreement arises in the commission concerning the  application or interpretation of this agreement, and when such  disagreement cannot be resolved in a friendly manner, the  commission will empower the sides and the Russian Federation and  also the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to resolve such  disagreement.    The sides, the Russian Federation, and the board of the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees agree to the following:    a) The board of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will  be  able to implement directly and without hindrance measures  regarding all displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia that  are necessary so that it can fulfill its mandate and also its  operational and surveillance obligations;    b) Employees of the UN and other corresponding  international and nongovernmental institutions who are  cooperating with the UN on implementation of the repatriation,  reintegration, and rehabilitation programs will be guaranteed  freedom of movement between and inside all regions where there  are refugees and displaced persons and also inside regions to  which they are returning. This includes the use of air space  and designated runways and airports for flights so that  emergency aid can be delivered to displaced persons and refugees  from Abkhazia, they [the employees] may be exempt from taxes and  duty on all goods imported for their use within the framework of  the program of voluntary repatriation and the UN and  institutions cooperating with it can provide emergency aid to  the region of Abkhazia for purposes of integration and  rehabilitation, and also so that such goods can be cleared and  processed as soon as possible;    c) The Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered transit  of humanitarian aid that is sent through its territory according  to the aims of this agreement;    d) The board of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will  set up the necessary local departments in places agreed upon by  the interested sides in order to facilitate the voluntary  repatriation and reintegration and rehabilitation;    e) The safety of the personnel and property of the UN and  those institutions cooperating with it will be guaranteed;    f) The sides and the UN and institutions cooperating with it  will be provided with specially established radio frequencies  that they will be able to use permanently in order to maintain  radio contact with their departments and vehicles and personnel  in the regions where there are displaced persons and refugees  and also in those regions to which they are returning.

Shokhin had been assured direct access to the prime  minister.  He will not have to report to deputy prime ministers.    Shokhin also said that Finance Minister Boris Fedorov was  awaiting a reply to his conditions for staying in the government.    Shokhin, who had spoken with him on the telephone Thursday  morning, believed that Fedorov could join the government if just  one of his conditions, dismissal of Viktor Gerashchenko from  governorship of the Central Bank, was met. Fedorov had earlier  said that he would not stay in the government if Aleksandr  Zaveryukha remained a deputy prime minister.    Shokhin thought that if Fedorov left the government, his  duties would be taken over by one of his deputies, for example  Sergey Dubinin, or former finance minister Vasiliy Barchuk.    Shokhin said that the protracted formation of a new cabinet  was tantamount to a governmental crisis.</p>

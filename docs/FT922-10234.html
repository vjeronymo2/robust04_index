			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Waste problem delays smelter sale PASMINCO, the Australian metals group, is delaying sale of its half share in the Budel smelter in the Netherlands, which produces about 5 per cent of the western world's zinc requirements. The Budel stake was put up for sale in March when Pasminco decided to dispose of all its European assets. These also include the Avonmouth lead-zinc smelter in the UK. However, the future of the Budel plant, which has Billiton, the metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group as its other joint owner, has been under a cloud for some time because it is running out of space to store cadmium-containing hazardous waste called jarosite. The management says a decision must be made within months about a Fl 400m (Pounds 130m) scheme to process the jarosite or the smelter may have to close. Pasminco said yesterday that the Budel sale had been delayed pending the outcome of current discussions with the Dutch authorities in relation to the disposal of the waste material jarosite from the Budelco operation. The company said: 'As has been previously announced, these discussions have been under way for some years and, while the outcome is uncertain, the discussions are now reaching an advanced stage with a view to developing a solution which is acceptable to all parties.' Pasminco's production report yesterday showed Budelco produce 54,344 tonnes of zinc in the first quarter this year, up from 52,646 in the same months of 1991. Avonmouth produced 25,249 tonnes of zinc and 10,409 tonnes of lead up from 23,173 tonnes and 10,182 tonnes.</p>

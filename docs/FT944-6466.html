			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Deficit forecast steadies London coffee futures A forecast from Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation of a bigger-than-expected world supply deficit in the 1995-96 season steadied coffee futures in London yesterday. The January futures position at the London Commodity Exchange, which last week dipped below Dollars 3,000 for the first time since late June, closed Dollars 25 higher at Dollars 3,013 a tonne after touching Dollars 3,040 earlier in the day. Dealers said early buying had been encouraged by the Colombian forecast, which suggested that demand would outstrip supply next year by 11m bags (60kg each). Higher green-coffee imports by Germany during August, compared with July, also helped, a trader told the Reuters news agency. Last week's Dollars 400-plus plunge to Dollars 2,870 a tonne followed news that Brazilian coffee stocks were higher than most analysts had estimated. Over the previous two weeks the January price had slipped Dollars 320 after Brazil issued an official assessment of its frost- and drought-damaged 1995-96 crop that was broadly in line with market estimates. Speculators, confident that no further market shocks were imminent, began selling their long positions; and the resulting lower prices attracted no significant roaster buying.</p>

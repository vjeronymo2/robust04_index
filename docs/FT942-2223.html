			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Twelve agree on foreign workers European Union justice and interior ministers agreed yesterday on a joint approach to keeping foreign workers out of the EU, and that no member state should relax this policy without reference to its partners. At the same time, the ministers shelved discussion on a European Commission proposal that non-EU nationals legally resident in one member state should be able to seek work in other member states, a central Brussels proposal to help integrate foreign workers. The ministers, operating under the so-called 'third pillar' of the Maastricht treaty - concerning home and justice affairs - noted that none of the 12 was pursuing an active immigration policy. Yesterday's move was therefore a first step towards ensuring that all member states were going about barring entry to foreign workers in compatible ways. Mr Louis Tobback, the Belgian interior minister, warned the measure would project an image of 'Fortress Europe' to the world. But Belgium joined its partners in unanimous agreement, confining its reservations to a statement in the minutes. The Luxembourg meeting also voted to go ahead with a feasibility study on setting up a so-called EURODAC network. This is a long-mooted system for finger-printing asylum-seekers and suspected illegal immigrants at point of entry.</p>

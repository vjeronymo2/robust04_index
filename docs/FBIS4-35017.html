			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo  Frei today begins a two-day visit to Washington at the  invitation of his U.S. counterpart. In view of its political and  economic significance, President Frei has described the meeting  as "a key visit for the future of the country."    Frei will meet Clinton tomorrow at the White House during a  working meeting that encompasses a luncheon. The agenda of the  meeting includes political and economic issues. Chilean  Government sources have said the meeting will center on free  trade negotiations between the two countries.    Diplomatic sources have said the Summit of the America,  summoned by the U.S. Government for December in Miami, will also  be a key issue of the meeting.    The Chilean president stressed that his first meeting with  the U.S. President comes at the initiative of Clinton, adding  that this shows Chile is "a reliable partner" for the United  States at the political and economic level.    Just before his departure, Frei said the meeting "is of  political, economic, and cultural value." After denying that  free trade agreements will be the main issues on the agenda,  Frei said: "we will not just discuss economic issues."    Frei added: "We will sit face to face with the U.S.  President." Frei said Clinton's invitation is "a great honor,  not just for me, but for the entire Chilean nation."    Frei added: "We will discuss human development, how to  combat  poverty; we will discuss political ethics and how Chile is  facing this worldwide problem; and we will discuss the  importance of achieving development and social justice on the  basis of equality."    Frei said they will also discuss problems pertaining to  women, science, and technology.    Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said Frei's invitation  "shows the U.S. political willingness to seek a rapprochement  with Latin America." Figueroa said he believes the U.S.  President chose Chile because "although it is a small country,  it enjoys enough prestige and moral authority" to be a valid  interlocutor.    Figueroa said Chile "has gone beyond traditional U.S.-Latin  American ties." He said Frei is going to Washington "to propose  ideas and to exchange points of view, not to request anything.  All Chileans should be proud of this fact."    Figueroa stressed that Chile "has overcome the mendicant  stigma that has always characterized U.S. ties with Third World  and Latin American countries."    Figueroa denied that President Clinton's invitation grants  Chile the status of a U.S. "privileged partner." He said this  invitation shows Chile "is a reliable partner for President  Clinton's policy of rapprochement with Latin America."    The Chilean foreign minister added that the meeting  "confirms  the spirit of rapprochement that currently prevails in the  Americas." He said this meeting proves ties with the United  States "are not merely based on buying-and-selling or  borrowing-and-lending."    President Frei is scheduled to carry out an extensive agenda  in Washington following his arrival on Monday. Among other  functions, he is scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen, with AFL-CIO leaders, and attend a reception that U.S.  Vice President Al Gore will host in his honor at the Department  of State.    Before meeting Clinton, Frei will hold a working meeting  with  U.S. businessmen, economists, and legislators. He is also  scheduled to meet with U.S. Trade Secretary Mickey Kantor.    After his meeting with Bill Clinton and before his return to  Santiago, the Chilean president will hold a news conference.</p>

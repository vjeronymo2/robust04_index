			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Police learn how to read palms Pattern recognition techniques developed for the Hungarian nuclear industry are being applied to help police identify criminals. An offshoot of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has developed a palm and fingerprint recognition system which uses the latest high-powered workstations to quickly and accurately match the prints taken from a suspected criminal with those held on record. The massive power means the software can handle prints which are upside down or at an angle. The system enables the police first to search a local database of images, and then extend the search to a central database - all the databases are networked together - if necessary. The system is marketed by Intelligent Networks. Intelligent Networks: Hungary, 1 160 1221; UK, 071 972 0500.</p>

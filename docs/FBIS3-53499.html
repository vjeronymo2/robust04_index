He added that the state had  drawn up plans for the eradication of illiteracy.    His Excellency also said that the citizens of Upper Nile had  welcomed the decision on the redivision of states which aimed to  bring the authorities nearer to the citizens and would also  provide the opportunity for everyone to take part in governing.  He went on to say that the state was determined to achieve  peace and development to build the nation. He confirmed that  the citizens of the state support the revolution's proposals on  participation in power for the building of Sudan.</p>

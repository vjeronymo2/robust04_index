			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, Syria April 12 (AA) -- Interior Minister  Nahit Mentese said today that the Turkish delegations told  Syrian officials that the separatist terror organization's PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Abdullah Ocalan and his  friends were instructing their organization, from Syrian and  Lebanese soil.    `The Syrian officials deny this, while we insist on it,'  Mentese said.    On the second day of his official visit to Syria, Mentese  had  a two-hour meeting with 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, first assistant  to the Syrian head of state.    In a statement afterward, Mentese said that during their  meeting with ranking Syrian officials since yesterday, the  Turkish delegation stressed that Ocalan was living either in  Syria or Lebanon.    `For us, the PKK is the most important problem,' he said.  'We  insist on the fact that PKK leaders are based in Syria and  Lebanon. They claimed that Lebanon was a separate state. Since  we are aware of Syria's influence in Lebanon, we asked them to  intervene into the situation. All these talks proceeded in a  friendly atmosphere.'    `They also told us that they condemned the terror actions of  PKK and it was out of the question for them to cooperate with  these terrorists,' Mentese said.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Support agency for Tecs urged TRAINING and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) were urged yesterday by the government to form a new umbrella body to deal with national providers of training. The 82 Tecs in England and Wales negotiate individually with their training providers, including large high street retailers and organisations such as the Construction Industry Training Body. Before Tecs were set up two years ago, those large-scale providers contracted with a single organisation called the National Providers Unit (NPU). A number of such providers have stopped providing training places, particularly for Youth Training, because of the administrative difficulties of dealing with several Tecs. The NPU, which is now being run down, has tried to ease negotiations between them. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the employment minister, urged Tecs to create jointly a managing agency to give central support to contracting between them and large providers.</p>

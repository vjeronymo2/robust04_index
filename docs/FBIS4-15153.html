			<p>BFN     [Text] On 5 April, Crimean mass media carried a statement  by Valeryy Horbatov, newly appointed representative of the  Ukrainian president in the Republic of Crimea. Here is an  excerpt from that statement.    [Begin Horbatov recording, in Russian] In accordance with  the Ukrainian president's edict, I am assuming the duties of the  Ukrainian president's permanent representative in the Republic  of Crimea. Here, at the beginning, I want to point out that the  main, primary goals of this endeavor are political. These goals  include peace and political stability in the Crimea; control  over the observance of Ukrainian law and the Constitution on  Crimean territory, as envisioned by the Law on the Division of  Powers Between State Bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of  Crimea; control over the observance of Ukraine's commitments to  the Republic of Crimea; and representation of the Crimea on the  international level. I want to say that I am deeply convinced  that there are a sufficient number of educated, experienced, and  knowledgeable specialists in the Crimea to carry out concrete  economic work. I am positive that we will not have any problems  in terms of economics. Our primary task and main goal is to  make the combined potential of the Crimea and Ukraine work for  the benefit of our people, to eliminate from our lives the still  existing ambiguous issues of contention and confrontation, as  well as problems of nationalism. Our lives are too complicated  to be aggravated further by artificial factors. Let us all  unite our efforts for one goal, that is the well-being of our  people. Let every person remember that he lives only once. We  should live our lives in such a way as not to feel ashamed in  the face of those who will come to replace us. I [words  indistinct] that we will have no friction with the Crimean  government. I am sure that our cooperation will be harmonious  and agreeable, because we have a common goal of making the lives  of the Crimean people better. [Words indistinct] to attain peace  and accord.

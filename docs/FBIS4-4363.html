			<p>BFN     [Text] The Royal Thai Army has firmly denied the  accusation that it has supported the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in  their fight against Cambodian forces along the Thai-Cambodian  border.    The Spokesman of the Royal Thai Army Colonel Phalangkun  Klahan has made it clear that the Thai Government and the Royal  Thai Army have always respected the UN resolution on the  political solution to the war in Cambodia. The spokesman said  the Royal Thai Army has not banned site inspections by foreign  diplomats at any time. He added the Royal Thai Army has  provided humanitarian aid to displaced Cambodians who fled from  the fighting into Thailand and that the army did not forcibly  repatriate those Cambodians. It is the Cambodian Government's  responsibility to take care of its people affected by civil war  or those who are displaced in their own country.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / People: Aer Lingus Peter Owen, a former director of operations with British Airways from 1985-90, has been appointed as the new chief executive at AER LINGUS, Ireland's loss-making flag carrier, in a management reorganisation leading up to the rationalisation plan expected to be announced within the next month. He fills the gap left by Cathal Mullan, who resigned two months ago after Aer Lingus chairman Bernie Cahill was appointed executive chairman by the government, with full powers to plan and implement the rationalisation plan. Owen only joined Aer Lingus five weeks ago, as chief executive for passenger services. Now he has responsibility for all aspects of the group's business with the exception of finance, which continues to be handled by Sam Young. Both will report directly to Cahill. The appointment has streamlined Aer Lingus' management by reducing the number of chief executives from six to two. The group's commercial holdings, air maintenance and hotels divisions will be managed now by Larry Stanley, who will report to Owen. After his departure from British Airways in 1990, Owen was chief executive of Innocan Inc, a Canadian holding company with businesses in textiles, distribution, communications and specialist cleaning and consultancy sectors.</p>

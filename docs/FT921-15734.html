			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Judging from the description of today's Dispatches (9.00 C4) it seems that the Gulf War went pretty much as the west intended: whereas the allies' costs were minimal, with most of the Dollars 70bn being paid by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Germany, and almost all the allied troops coming home safely, 350,000 Iraqis were killed. Furthermore the war was good for western business since it resulted in big contracts for repairs in Kuwait and a major boost for the US arms trade. So that's OK. Of course Saddam Hussein is more firmly in control in Baghdad than ever before, but you can't have everything can you? Survival (9.00 ITV) shows the first of an occasional series which promises to 'look beyond Russia's political landscape to the hidden beauty of the countryside'. Today, Siberia, land of the white fox and the snowy owl. For the many fans of Dynasty who were upset when the daft series ended so abruptly in 1989 there is now a 3-hour mini-series tying off the loose ends. Part 1 is on BBC1 at 9.30 and the second part at the same time tomorrow. Channel 4 shows the second part of Jane Campion's trilogy An Angel At My Table telling the story of New Zealand writer Janet Frame (10.00).</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Technology: Jingle bells of the mobile kind - Worth Watching THIS year's high-tech Christmas present in the UK could well be the personal mobile phone. Exploiting the low-use consumer tariffs introduced earlier this year by the two cellular operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, both Motorola and Sony have developed mini phones intended for personal rather than business use. The big advantage for the consumer is the price - Pounds 249.99 for the Motorola model and Pounds 325 for the Sony one - and the ability to purchase them off the shelf in high-street shops. The Motorola phone has even gone as far as using standard long-life batteries, rather than the heavy-weight rechargeable packs used with older mobile phones, in order to make it appealing to the consumer. Add a cable to attach the phones to the cigarette lighter and both can be used in the car. Motorola: UK, 0500 555555. Sony: UK, 0635 873322.</p>

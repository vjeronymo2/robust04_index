			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alberto Cavallari: "European Left's Slow </F> Decline"]    [Text] They were not European elections but 12 "local"  elections. Europe did not issue a supranational vote, but  merely vented confused and conflicting national feelings. It  did not debate or choose its destiny but rewarded or punished  governments and opposition forces within the context of its  regional borders. Moreover, it voted apathetically,  disenchantedly, without enthusiasm, despite the good news about  the Austrian referendum. Of its 266 million voters, 54 percent  abstained.    It is possible to agree with this theory, which has appeared  in the American newspapers, and thus explain the difficulty of  forming a truly European assessment of the elections. Overall,  the right-wing forces advanced, but the Socialists still remain  the largest parliamentary group in Strasbourg. Nationalist  extremism was defeated (the Republikaner in Germany, Le Pen in  France) but the adversaries of the Maastricht Treaty seem to  have been strengthened in the European Parliament. European  integration is not threatened, since the assembly itself is  dominated by two groups of committed Europeanists: the  Socialists, with 200 seats, and the European People's Party,  with 148 deputies. But the right-wing groupings together could  control 250 seats, and the intensification of political union  could risk paralysis, in favor of a scaled-down free trade  arrangement. So there is no certainty about Europe's future,  and the only clearly European result comes from Austria, a  country outside the Community.    Will the process of European integration slow down? Will the  Franco-German axis survive? Will Britain's isolationism  diminish? Will the federalist vision grow stronger, or will the  free-trade vision prevail?    Perhaps the votes do not provide an answer to these  questions, and were merely national polls on the strength or  weakness of individual governments. [German Chancellor] Kohl  and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi were rewarded. But Italy's  Europeanism in the near future remains an unknown quantity, as  does its position among the parliamentary groups. Kohl's  Christian Democrats of course provide a guarantee; they want a  federal Europe and are aiming for 1996 [intergovernmental  conference]. But France's political landscape has fragmented,  it will not be easy for any government in Paris to sustain an  intensification of the supranational institutions in Brussels,  and the Franco-German axis has certainly been weakened. It  remains to wonder whether it will be strengthened by Major's  spectacular defeat. But this raises the new problems posed by  the victorious British Labor Party. In order to gain power it  will have to take votes away from the pro-free trade  Conservatives. It will have to dilute its reluctant  Europeanism, which it embraced only a decade ago. How far will  the British Labor Party back the Franco-German axis?    Furthermore, Kohl's success could set in motion a series of  reactions connected with the danger that Europe will become too  "German." The record level of abstention in the Netherlands  reveals the emergence of some backtracking in the tough  pro-German kernel, the losses by Belgium's Christian Democrats  entail a new uncertainty, and the victory by the Danish  Europeanists is threatened by the anti-Maastricht groups  strengthened by the Socialists. Before judging Kohl's victory  as an optimistic event for Europe, we must therefore assess all  the interactions that a solely German leadership could entail in  the center and the North. Even the enlargement to the East could  become more complicated.    Obviously people are wondering whether the 12 "local"  elections together reveal a more right-wing Europe than before.  A simplified reckoning shows that there were three major  winners and five major losers. Clear victories were scored by  Berlusconi's center-right, Kohl's Christian Democrats, and  Margaret Beckett's Labor Party. A defeat was suffered by  Rocard's Socialists in France, Scharping's Social Democrats in  Germany, Gonzalez's Socialists in Spain, the Italian left-wing  forces led by Occhetto, and Major's Conservatives in Britain.  The whole panorama shows that, except in Britain, Greece, and  Portugal, the left-wing forces are losing ground everywhere in  favor of the center or the right-wing forces. Everywhere a  crisis of the social democratic forces is taking shape, with the  resurrection of the Labor Party as the only exception.    The emergence of this crisis entails three consequences. The  first is that the European Parliament, having long been the  private domain of the Socialists and in which the Christian  Democrats and Liberals were in a minority, has undergone a  shifting of the balance in favor of the center-right. The  second is that, without the help of the Labor Party, the  European social democratic forces would have been canceled out  and the Labor group will be the leading force in the new  Eurosocialist alignment. The third is that the defeat of the  Italian left-wing forces must also be set within this context.  Although it reflects a "local" and national election, it also  reflects a crisis common to all the European left-wing forces.    But this being so, three major questions arise. Is the  eclipse of social democracy in Europe temporary or final? What  contribution will the rebirth of the British Labor Party bring  to European integration? Will the Italian left-wing forces  succeed in analyzing their defeat against this background,  rather than losing themselves in questions of alignment, in  internal struggles between unidentifiable leaders? Indeed, the  12 "local" elections reveal only one factor common to Europe:  the widespread decline of the social democratic forces. They  will have a decreasing influence in European integration, and  this entails more than a few fewer seats in Strasbourg. It  entails basic questions about the very nature of the Left and  its future. We must consider why the Left was defeated  everywhere, why it is not winning any more, and why it is losing  ground at a time when European political union is being  attempted.    Answers to these questions were sought years ago by David  Caute, the historian of the book The Left-Wing Forces in  Europe From 1789 Until Our Own Time. Indeed, it may be  that the crisis of the Left stems from its difficulty in  defining itself two centuries after its birth. It may be that,  by dint of being pragmatic, it has been left without a doctrine  and without programs and become a nebulous ideology. It may be  that, having been born with the industrial revolution, it finds  it difficult to represent a postindustrial society that is  seeking new ways to organize itself. The end of communism  called into question not only Leninism but also the socialism  that preceded it. It may be, therefore, that the Left is losing  because it is unable to consider what historical factors  contributed to its development or decline, from which social  classes it has commonly drawn support, and whether by chance it  no longer knows what to be in a world that resembles less and  less that which created it.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH: CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS;  </P> <P> WHAT TO DO WHEN DOCTORS' ADVICE AND PRESCRIPTIONS ARE HARD TO SWALLOW  </P> <P> A SANTA MONICA pediatrician became frustrated when a 9-year-old boy was brought  to her office for the third time in less than a month. The boy, who had severe  breathing problems, was supposed to be taking a powerful anti-asthma medicine  that was critical for his health. But it was obvious that he had not, and his  symptoms had steadily worsened. Now, concerned that the boy's mother did not  understand the seriousness of the illness, the doctor sat her down, yet again,  to explain the dangers of asthma. And the mother, who was equally frustrated,  insisted that she had tried to give her son the pills, but the medicine upset  his stomach and he refused to take it.  </P> <P> Like the child's mother, many people do not follow doctors' orders, often for  good reasons. Studies show, for example, that at least a third of patients fail  to take medicines as instructed. They stop the prescription before it is  completed, take the wrong dose, or forgo the medicine altogether. According to  one study, people with strep throat who are given a seven-day course of  antibiotics commonly stop taking the medicine by the third day. Another study  found that only two-thirds of patients being treated for high blood pressure  actually take enough medicine to control it.  </P> <P> Doctors refer to patients who follow a medical regimen as "compliant." Those  who fail to do as they are told are labeled "noncompliant." The labeling  implies that a person who does not take medication as ordered is behaving in a  deviant way. But in fact, about half of all people being treated for such  chronic medical conditions as high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and  depression fall into the noncompliant category. Noncompliance, according to one  group of researchers writing in the Annals of Internal Medicine, may be the  most significant problem facing doctors today.  </P> <P> But the notion that a patient always ought to do as told suggests that the  physician alone knows what is best and the patient knows nothing. That, of  course, is false. People have a variety of reasons for not taking medicines as  prescribed. Studies show that an individual's social class and level of  education have no bearing on whether that person takes a medicine, but the  medicine itself does make a difference. People are less apt to take a medicine  if there are troublesome side effects, if it has to be taken for a prolonged  period, or if there are complex instructions for taking it.  </P> <P> In some cases, the high cost of drugs is the overriding factor. A 70-year-old  woman with a skin infection who received a prescription for antibiotics  recently was shocked to learn that the drug would cost $58. She simply could  not afford the drug, so she had no choice but to treat her infection with home  remedies. Had her doctor understood her financial constraints, he could have  prescribed an equally effective drug at half the cost. But most doctors do not  consider the price of a drug when prescribing. In fact, most do not even know  the prices of drugs. Consumers learn the prices when they go to pay for them,  because insurance plans often do not cover prescription drugs.  </P> <P> At times, the failure to follow medical advice can be extremely dangerous. In  the case of the boy with asthma, his recurrent breathing problems could have  fatal consequences. The physician knew that, and focused her efforts on  repeating the instructions for the medicine ever more carefully and slowly. But  this was little help to a mother who needed to know what to do when her child  became nauseated. Should she lower the dose? Was there a different form of the  medication that might not have that side effect? Was she giving the medicine  too close to mealtime?  </P> <P> When patients do not ask specific questions, doctors may fail to address the  problems of medications. Hospitals require that doctors recommending a surgical  procedure list all the possible adverse consequences of the surgery, and  patients are even asked to sign a form saying that they understand the reasons  for the surgery and the possible risks. But there are no such built-in  mechanisms for explaining the benefits and risks of prescriptions.  </P> <P> Because the misunderstandings about medicines are so common, anyone receiving a  new prescription should ask the doctor a few key questions:  </P> <P>  -- Why is this medicine important?  </P> <P>  -- What will happen if I don't take it?  </P> <P>  -- What side effects should I expect?  </P> <P>  -- Is there an alternative medicine that is cheaper or causes fewer side  effects?  </P> <P> Even when all the questions have been answered, it is difficult to take  medicines on a regular basis. Realizing this, medical technology and  pharmaceutical firms have developed a variety of shortcuts -- ways to ensure  that people receive the maximum benefit of a medicine for a minimum of effort.  For example, women with uncomplicated bladder infections who would have been  prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics just a few years ago may now be  treated in the office with a single super-strong dose of medication.  </P> <P> Similarly, people with certain venereal diseases may be treated with a one-time  injection.  </P> <P> Despite these, people with chronic illnesses may simply decide on their own  when to take a medicine, regardless of their doctors' advice. Medical  sociologist Peter Conrad and his colleagues at Brandeis University in Boston  interviewed people with epilepsy who are obliged to take medication daily to  control seizures. More than 40% of those interviewed said they frequently  modified their prescription without consulting a doctor, generally by stopping  the medicine for a period of time or lowering the dose.  </P> <P> They especially did this when the medication seemed to be ineffective, or when  the side effects became too disturbing. The researchers suggested that doctors  stop asking why people don't "comply" with their orders and instead start  trying to understand the need for individuals with a chronic illness to assert  some personal control over that illness through their medications.  </P></p>

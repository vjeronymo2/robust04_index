			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: De Beers earnings up at half-time DE BEERS, the South African-controlled company that dominates the world diamond industry, is maintaining its dividend at 25.2 US cents a share following improved earnings in the half-year to June. Although the company continues to be very cautious about prospects for the second half, the outlook is much better than a year ago when De Beers caused a furore by announcing, unexpectedly, that a weak market would force a substantial cut in the final dividend. The balance sheet has also strengthened, showing an overall improvement of Dollars 963m following a decline in borrowings and an improvement in net current assets. The finances of De Beers were weakened in 1992 when it was forced to spend large sums stabilising the open diamond market. A year ago, at the time of the dividend warning, the company was suffering from an unexpected economic weakening in leading markets and a glut of illicit supply from Angola. The diamond account was largely unchanged from the same period in 1992, with income of Dollars 373m against Dollars 379m. An improvement in South African operations, following increased production from the new Venetia mine and the benefits of downsizing at the other mines, was offset by a weaker performance from Centenary, which holds the non-South African assets - mostly in Botswana and Namibia. Weakness in the South African economy caused investment income from interests outside the diamond industry to fall to Dollars 111m from Dollars 139m. Interest income also declined to Dollars 33m from Dollars 65m, leaving pre-tax income 9 per cent lower at Dollars 444m against Dollars 473m. A lower tax bill boosted attributable income which rose to Dollars 353m from Dollars 325m in 1992. Earnings per share rose to 93 cents from 86 cents last time. Strong sales by the Central Selling Organisation, the marketing arm, of Dollars 2.54bn in the first half of 1993, up from Dollars 1.79bn, helped reduce diamond stocks by Dollars 527m to Dollars 3.24bn from Dollars 3.77bn at the end of 1992. The balance sheet is thus likely to weaken again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Two hundred delegates of the Conservative  Democratic Party-Democratic Party [KDS-DS] held their  constitutional congress in Bratislava today. Their aim was to  finalize the merger of these two nonparliamentary parties of the  political right. Correspondent Oto Goerner interviewed Pavol  Hagyari, the newly elected chairman of the party.    [Begin recording] [Hagyari] The constitutional congress  decided the name of the new party. Three names were proposed:  the Democratic Party; Conservative Democratic Party-Democratic  Party, a double-barrelled name; and the Party of the Democratic  Right. The first proposal was given a clear majority, which  means that, as of today, we are to be called the "Democratic  Party." I am convinced a new, strong party of the right is  being created, which in the last elections attracted 10 percent  of the voters. We are convinced the same will be the case at  the next elections that may be held very soon.    [Goerner] Is it not a paradox that there are some parties  splitting in the present climate while the KDS and the DS merge?    [Hagyari] It is also a question of political foresight. If  the Civic Right failed in the last elections because it was  split, if we can learn from our own mistakes and from the  mistakes of the Polish right, then we are left only with merging  into one political spectrum with more right-of-center  nonparliamentary parties.

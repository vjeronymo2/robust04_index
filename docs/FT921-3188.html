			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Recovery signs deepen rates gloom THE BEAR market in US government bonds passed a significant milestone late last week when the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue rose through the psychologically-important 8 per cent barrier. With the market now almost universally gloomy about the long-term trend of interest rates, the main question facing dealers is whether the market is oversold and whether this leaves scope for a short, sustained rally over the next few months before the bears really get a grip. It was not meant to be like this. Back at the turn of the year, when the bond market was still basking in the Fed's dramatic December 20 easing of monetary policy, the benchmark 30-year issue was yielding around 7.5 and plenty of analysts expected it to dip to around 7 per cent before reversing direction around mid-year. But the market quickly took fright at the prospects for economic recovery, and those anxieties have been intensified by the positive statistical data of the past few weeks. Last week, in particular, brought surprisingly strong figures for February retail sales, with a 1.3 per cent increase coming on top of a revised 2.1 per cent January gain. This pace of advance is not sustainable, and may have been buoyed by special factors, such as a more-rapid-than-usual despatch of tax refunds, but it does add weight to evidence of a recovery in consumer confidence. It was the shock of the retail sales figures which pushed the long bond to close on Thursday above 8 per cent for the first time since last November. Better-than-expected producer price figures on Friday morning temporarily pushed it back below 8 per cent, but that was rapidly reversed when the market saw that figures showing business inventories dipped 0.4 per cent in January, which provided more evidence of recovery. Any lingering hopes in the market of an early easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve have now been quashed. Rather, attention is now focusing on just when the Fed might begin tightening again. There is clearly no early need. Money supply M2, which increased by Dollars 2bn in the week to March 2, is slightly above the mid-point of the Fed's target range, while Friday's producer price figures, showing a 0.2 per cent increase in February, or 0.1 per cent when food and energy are excluded, compared with consensus forecasts of 0.3 per cent on both measures. So far this year the annual rate of inflation is running at around 2.4 per cent, based on the core producer price index. This week will bring consumer price figures which are expected to underline this benign picture. Analysts are expecting a rise of around 0.4 per cent, both including and excluding energy prices. At the same time, the economic recovery still hardly looks that robust. Figures for February industrial production, due out tomorrow, are expected to show a rise of 0.7 to 0.9 per cent, breaking a spell of three consecutive monthly declines. Yet many of the main indicators are little higher than in the middle of last year, the consumer remains edgy, and the recent trend of rising interest rates could start to choke off recovery. All these factors could prove positive for the bond market over the next few months, if the view takes hold that inflation really is under control and the economy is unlikely to grow at much more than a 3 per cent annual rate in the second half of the year. Continued Congressional deadlock over a fiscal policy would also help the mood of the market, which took fright at last week's statement by President Bush that he was more concerned about growth than bringing down long-term interest rates. This is why a substantial number of Wall Street analysts are predicting a mini-rally which could carry the yield on the long bond back down to around 7.75 to 7.80 per cent over the next few months. In the second half, however, most expect the yield on the long bond to be nudging back up towards 8.5 per cent, against a background of a gently tightening Fed, sustained economic expansion, an uncertain presidential race and the danger of fiscal excesses in Washington which could send the budget deficit soaring again.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                            Friday    ago      ago      High       Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly average)  3.63    3.50    3.88      11.00      2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  4.14    4.12    3.89       8.29      3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.36    4.27    4.03       7.70      3.89 Three-month prime CDs       4.38    4.32    4.15       7.17      4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     4.25    4.27    4.03       7.12      3.90 90-day Commercial Paper     4.30    4.30    4.05       7.02      3.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Last       Change              1 week      4 wk.

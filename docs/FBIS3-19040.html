			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "lip": "Better Prospects for German Exports in </F> 1994"]    [Text] Hamburg -- According to the Hamburg-based HWWA  [Hamburg World Economic Archive] Institute for Economic  Research, the German balance of trade surplus will continue to  grow. The current account balance will, however, "register an  estimated deficit of 35 billion German marks [DM]."    In the view of the Hamburg economic research staff,  prospects  for a sustained growth in German exports have increased over the  past few months. The United States is experiencing a brisk  upswing. In addition, a relaxation of monetary policy and the  attendant reduction in interest rates have created favorable  conditions for higher demand and output.    The HWWA states that German exports will profit from the  improved economic climate in the industrialized countries,  especially in Europe. The negative effects on demand of the  German mark's high value in relation to other currencies will  continue to diminish. As the upturn in the economic climate in  Europe will continue at its present rate in the immediate  future, the HWWA expects exports to grow moderately.    The institute estimates that west German exports will grow  by  about 5 percent in real terms in 1994. Last year, exports fell  by about 6 percent. East German exporters are still heavily  oriented toward former Soviet markets. Demand there is only  expected to pick up slightly in the near future. In addition,  east German exporters now have to compete against their west  German counterparts. However, the east German economy is only  gradually becoming more competitive internationally. The  improvement in the worldwide economic climate is making it  easier to enter new markets in the West. The HWWA's overall  assessment is that "east German exports will continue to  increase this year."    Economic expansion in western Germany will cause imports to  start rising again, writes the HWWA. The institute estimates  that west German imports will grow by about 4 percent in real  terms in 1994. In 1993, imports in the old laender fell by about  9 percent. In the view of the HWWA, imports from Central and  East European countries "will register above average growth."    Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have already ceased  to be solely suppliers of raw materials and simple preproducts.  They will gradually assume "the role of threshold countries."  According to the HWWA, the increase in east German imports,  which already rose last year, will "be in double figures  assuming there is continued economic recovery."</p>

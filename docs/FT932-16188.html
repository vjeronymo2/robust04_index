			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Customs admits error over VAT rules THE commissioners of Customs and Excise have admitted exceeding their powers in introducing regulations on the administration of VAT from January 26. In a memorandum to the Commons committee on statutory instruments, the commissioners accept that they erred in introducing rules before the enabling statutory instrument was laid before parliament. The regulations were intended to remedy an inadvertent striking out of vital rules concerning input tax deduction. The committee found that the VAT (general) (amendment) regulations were ultra vires - beyond the commissioners' powers - to the extent that the rules purported to have a limited retrospective effect. It rebuked the commissioners for not notifying Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker of the Commons, and Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, that the instrument came into operation before it was laid before parliament. The committee also criticised the commissioners for failing to issue the regulations free to people known to have purchased a copy of the defective instrument. The commissioners, explaining why they felt the need for urgency in giving effect to the regulations, said the whole of the system under which input tax deduction is made by taxable persons would have been jeopardised without the re-introduction of provisions which had been 'inadvertently revoked'.</p>

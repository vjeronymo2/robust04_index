			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Where the authority is conferred by State statute, a citation to that statute is required. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, app H, section I, paragraph 14&hyph;2; see also &sect;536.21 for additional requirements relating to settlements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A claim normally will include all damages that accrue by reason of the incident. Where the same claimant has both a claim for damage to or loss of property and a claim for personal injury or a claim based on death arising out of the same incident, each of the foregoing or any combination of them ordinarily represent only an integral part of a single claim or cause of action. Under subparts C through J of this part, a single claimant is entitled to be compensated only one time for all damages or injuries arising out of an incident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subrogation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim may be presented by the subrogee in his or her own name if authorized by the law of the place where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred, provided subrogation is not barred by the portion of this regulation applicable to the type of claim involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The claims of the subrogor (insured) and subrogee (insurer) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute separate claims and it is permissible for the aggregate of such claims to exceed the monetary jurisdiction of the approving or settlement authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A subrogor and a subrogee may file a claim jointly or individually. A fully subrogated claim will be paid only to the subrogee. Whether a claim is fully subrogated is a matter to be determined by local law. Some jurisdictions permit the property owner to file for property damage even though he or she has been compensated for the repairs by his or her insurer. In such instances a release should be obtained from both parties in interest or be released by both of them. The approved payment in a joint claim will be by joint check that will be sent to the subrogee unless both parties specify otherwise. If separate claims are filed, payment will be by check issued to each claimant to the extent of his or her undisputed interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Where a claimant has made an election and accepted workmen's compensation benefits, both statutory and case law of the jurisdiction should be scrutinized to determine to what extent the claim of the injured party against third parties has been extinguished by acceptance of compensation benefits. While it is infrequent that the claim is fully extinguished and where it is not, the only proper party claimant is the workmen's compensation carrier. Even where the injured party's claim has not been fully extinguished, most jurisdictions provide that the compensation insurance carrier has a lien on any recovery from the third party and no settlement should be reached without approval by the carrier where required by local law (19 American Law Reports (ALR) 766, supplemented by 27 ALR 493, 37 ALR 838, 67 ALR 249, 88 ALR 665, and 106 ALR 1040). Also, claims from the workmen's compensation carrier as subrogee or otherwise will not be considered payable where the United States has paid the premiums, directly or indirectly for the workmen's compensation insurance. Applicable contract provisions holding the United States harmless should be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

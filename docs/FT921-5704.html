			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / A timely move by sober management: A look at the prospects for Bowater's latest acquisitions Bowater has built up a reputation as a thoroughly sensible business. Its down-to-earth products, spanning consumer products packaging, book printing and window safety films, smack of wholesomeness; its management reeks of prudence; and its profits record - apart from this year's minor blip as a result of the recession - reveals consistent progress. Since new management came on board in April 1987, Bowater's sprawling interests in the paper and packaging sectors have been slimmed down and spruced up as the company has slid into new areas of activity through a series of shrewd acquisitions. Mr Norman Ireland, the company's chairman and former guiding spirit at the BTR industrial holding group, has made a wily contribution to the company's acquisitive restructuring while Mr David Lyon, as chief executive, and Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, have given the company new strategic direction as well as more rigorous cost control systems. The company now consists of 90 operating units clustered around its core skills. In spite of their achievements, the management trio is somewhat dour and sober-suited; just about the only concession to flamboyance is Mr Lyon's penchant for colourful neckties. But such characteristics are much prized in the current market conditions and it was perhaps unsurprising that in spite of springing two acquisitions for Pounds 444m, a Pounds 333.5m rights issue and a slight drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112.7m the market yesterday pushed Bowater's shares down only 3p to 765p. The acquisitions of DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging are in part sheer opportunism but they also serve a distinct longer-term strategic purpose. Both were the subject of highly-leveraged acquisitions and have since had to labour under severe borrowing constraints, exacerbated by the recession in the UK. DRG, which supplies speciality packaging to the food and healthcare markets, was bought by Pembridge Investments, a private takeover vehicle, for Pounds 697m in 1989. But the company has since struggled in some unforgiving markets. 'DRG has been hauled over the coals over the past few years and has lacked good industrial direction,' Mr Lyon said yesterday. He added that Bowater would now spend more than Pounds 30m building a much-needed facility to rehouse some of DRG's packaging businesses - a move which the previous management had outlined but had been unable to afford. Similarly, Cope Allman, a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals products packaging group which was last sold for Pounds 210m in 1988 at the top of the cycle, has also been hit by tough market conditions - especially in the cosmetics field. Mr Lyon said that even the collapse of communism in eastern Europe had worked against the company depriving it of a lucrative side-line in supplying posh cosmetics to the nomenklatura. From a cost point of view, Bowater accepts it can squeeze little more out of these businesses, but believes it can apply muscle in terms of buying and securing better financing terms. It already sees a big opportunity for transferring Cope Allman's US skills in developing child-resistant packaging (for such items as bleach bottles) to the less developed European market. Mr Tim Rothwell, packaging industry analyst at stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the acquisitions represented a good opportunity for Bowater. 'These are two high-quality businesses that have suffered from operating under the constraints of a leveraged buy-out situation. Now that the future of these businesses is secured you will see an improvement in their morale and sales efforts and a higher level of customer confidence,' he said. The only doubts other analysts raised concerned whether Bowater would be able to make the acquisitions work hard enough to enhance earnings if the recession persisted. Mr Mike Murphy, of Warburg Securities, suggested Bowater might lift earnings per share to 50p this year compared with a restated 48.5p but the company had little room for error. Mr Lyon argued that the deals developed Bowater's mainland European businesses making it better able to respond to the changing demands of the market. He suggested that the growing agglomeration of consumer products companies such as Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, BSN, and Nestle on a pan-European basis would increasingly mean that their packaging needs would have to be satisfied on an international dimension. Such thinking has underpinned the wave of restructuring in the European packaging industry that has led to the formation of CMB, the Anglo-French packaging group, the acquisition of European operations of American National Can by Pechiney, the purchase of the European arm of Continental Can by Viag, and the merger of Rockware and BTR. 'There is a restructuring taking place and there are going to be opportunities to participate in more partnership relationships with product manufacturers. By doing so you drive out costs, speed up quality and shorten the time it takes to get new products to market,' Mr Lyon said.

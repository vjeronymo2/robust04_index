			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Medeva The market might be forgiven for being left behind by the whirl of acquisitions and disposals at Medeva. In last year's annual report the chairman was still talking about building the largest generic pharmaceuticals company in the UK. Most of that business has now been sold. Getting out of low-margin commodity generics looks sensible. But Medeva can hardly expect the market not to worry about what the next twist of strategy will bring. Having seen its shares fall by 25 per cent from their peak this year, Medeva will struggle to fund its grand ambitions by issuing new paper. That being placed in the US to acquire the Armstrong respiratory drugs business could be an unwelcome drag on the price. Some solid growth from the remaining hodge-podge of businesses would not go amiss. Whether the management can deliver such growth remains an open question. Niche positions in areas like narcotic pain killers look secure, but the growth prospects are less obvious. The asthma market looks a better bet with Glaxo's Ventolin losing its US patent next year. New accounting standards should at least help separate the wheat from the chaff by making Medeva strip out the contribution of discontinued business. The shares have still out-performed the market by some 200 per cent in the two years since Mr Bernard Taylor arrived from Glaxo. Investors must decide whether the recent weakness is simply a blip in a longer upward trend. There was little underlying yesterday's nine-month numbers, however, to prove that Medeva has the skills to regain its premium rating.</p>

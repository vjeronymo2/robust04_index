			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Companies 'open to option claims' THOUSANDS of companies may be vulnerable to compensation claims over share-option schemes from dismissed employees, Mr David Cohen, of City lawyers Paisner &amp; Co, a leading adviser on share option schemes, says. Since 1980 more than 2m employees, mainly managers and executives, have received share options, and with the recent growth in executive unemployment they are becoming an increasingly important part of a dismissed employee's compensation. When employees are unfairly dismissed, it has been held that they would not be entitled to extra compensation for loss of share options. That belief, Mr Cohen says, has been overturned by a recent verdict of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in a case involving Texas Homecare, the DIY chain. Mr Cohen says: 'That decision appears to indicate that even an option which has only recently been issued - in the Texas case the option was only six months old - will give rise to a compensation entitlement.' Option valuation, he adds, is an imprecise exercise and one that few, if any, tribunals are equipped to tackle.</p>

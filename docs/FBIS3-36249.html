At the meeting Kokoshin said that  "the Russian state leadership places great importance on the  development of relations with France, including the military  sphere. Our relations are being developed extremely carefully,  incorporating both new realities and rich military traditions."    For his part, the French guest said that he was ready "to  debate any security problems or crisis experienced by Russia."  This is Francois Leotard's first official visit to Russia since  his appointment to the post of the defense minister of France in  spring 1993.    Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the general  staff of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces, took part in the  meeting, at which it was noted that close ties have recently  formed between the two military departments. Army General Pavel  Grachev, who visited France in January last year, signed an  agreement on mutual contacts and, in particular, on exchanging  military delegations, training Russian servicemen in France, and  French servicemen in Russia. First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who visited Paris  last autumn and whom Francois Leotard is planning to meet in  Moscow, signed then the Russian- French agreement on cooperation  in dismantling Russian nuclear weapons and ensuring reliability  and safety during their transportation.    Francois Leotard will visit the Moscow army high command  school today, meet Pavel Grachev on Friday, and visit the Tula  airborne division. A Russian-French intergovernmental agreement  on military cooperation is expected to be signed on Friday.</p>

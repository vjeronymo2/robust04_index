			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / India relaxes bank lending rate controls India yesterday scrapped most controls on bank lending rates to promote cheaper credit, greater liberalisation in financial markets and more competition in the banking industry. The decision, announced by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, will bring a decline in lending rates for blue-chip borrowers and is expected to boost economic growth. The changes will help the government rebut criticism that India is dragging its feet over economic reforms. Mr C. Rangarajan, reserve bank governor, said the new policy marked a continuation of financial reforms. While controlling inflation remained important, the central bank would tolerate a faster rate of money supply growth than before: 16 per cent for the year to the end of March 1995, against an original target of 14-15 per cent. Industry welcomed the prospect of lower interest rates. Mr Subodh Bhargava of the Confederation of Indian Industry said: 'The new policy includes initiatives industry has been seeking.' The latest reforms were contained in the central bank's announcement of its credit policy for the six months to the end of March. Minimum lending rate is to be deregulated for loans of about Rs200,000 (Pounds 4,123). Controls remain in place for smaller loans. Bankers were divided over the extent of likely declines in lending rates from the present 14 per cent. Some forecast falls up to 2 percentage points, others a decrease of 0.5 percentage points. Biggest benefits are expected to go to big blue-chip borrowers able to negotiate good terms. An important constraint on cutting lending rates will be that deposit rates will remain fixed, though the key savings rate will fall from November 1 by 0.5 of a percentage point to 4.5 per cent. State-controlled banks are under pressure to improve their profitability. But competition from privately owned banks will tend to encourage lending rate cuts. Also, the reserve bank reduced the statutory liquidity ratio (the ratio of deposits which banks must deposit with the central bank), from a maximum 33.75 per cent to 31.5 per cent. It raised from Rs2bn to Rs5bn the ceiling for loans from all Indian banks to a single large project. Industrial output in June rose 8.6 per cent from the same month in 1993, figures published yesterday showed. The recent surge in industrial activity shows no sign of abating. Output in the first quarter of 1994-95 rose 7.8 per cent.</p>

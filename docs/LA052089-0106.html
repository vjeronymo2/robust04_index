			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WALLS, DUNN DIVE TO TITLES  </P> <P> As the top two finishers in the San Diego Section boys' diving championship  called it, one had the judges, the other the crowd.  </P> <P> But it was Mark Dunn who had the backing -- and dives -- to win his first  title. Dunn, a Mt. Carmel senior, defeated Poway junior Jonathan Gale, 378.60  to 373.65, Friday at UC San Diego's Canyon View Pool.  </P> <P> "You had the support of the crowd," Dunn said to Gale.  </P> <P> "Yeah, but you had the support of the judges," Gale countered.  </P> <P> In girls' competition, Monte Vista's Kristen Walls won her second consecutive  title and scored 450.85 points, shattering the section record of 436.95 set by  Santana's Eileen Maul in 1987.  </P> <P> "Winning CIF was certainly my goal," said Walls, "but ever since last year,  (breaking the record) was my goal."  </P> <P> Walls' title was never in question. The senior, who will attend UCLA on a  diving scholarship, hit each dive in the 11 rounds with Lisa Simmonds, her L.A.  Dive Club coach, encouraging her from poolside.  </P> <P> "She took me through all my dives," Walls said. "That really helped. She was  able to pay all her attention to me."  </P> <P> Far back were Erin Hoese of Point Loma and Kelli Manion of Mt. Carmel, second  and third with 383.25 and 383.05 points.  </P> <P> Walls saved her best dives for last, finishing with an inward 1 1/2 pike and a  forward 1 1/2 with a full twist, both earning her high marks.  </P> <P> "I saved my most consistent dives for last," Walls said. "That was my strategy  all along."  </P> <P> Dunn, second here last year, also ended his meet with a old favorite. He nailed  his final effort, a back dive straight, to secure the victory.  </P> <P> "I wanted to end my meet with my back dive," Dunn said. "It's a dive I rely on.  </P> <P> Dunn recently won the Palomar League diving title and hadn't lost a dual meet  this season. He said he knew he and Gale would be the ones chasing the title;  others have only managed to come within 30 or 40 points of them in dual meets.  Well back in third was Dean Hanson of Santana with 329.70 points.  </P> <P> "I didn't think anyone else would be close to us," Dunn said.  </P> <P> Of Gale, who was fourth here last year, Dunn said: "He'll be the guy to beat  next year."  </P></p>

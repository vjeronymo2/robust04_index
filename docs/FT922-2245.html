			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: Rambert Dance Company - Ballet The opening programme of the Rambert season on Tuesday night was a convincing portrait of the company as it has been shaped by Richard Alston. Two new works, from six the troupe has created during the past year; design by Richard Smith and Paul Huxley that marks a continuing involvement with distinguished painters; serious modern scores - Nigel Osborne, David Sawer, Frederic Rzewski - that inspire movement no less varied and intriguing. The image is bright, fresh, and we are braced by what we see. The evening opened with Alston's Wildlife. Dating from 1984, it is one of his best pieces. Beneath the luminous shapes of Richard Smith's pendant kites, the choreography explores activities - watchful, sportive, erotic - that belong to the fauna of some other world. Nigel Osborne's score is varied in texture, and Alston responds with vivid incidents: a serene nocturne for Amanda Britton; a sensual duet for Alexandra Dyer and Paul Old; a group dance that buoyantly matches the gamelan echoes of the score. Here is an abstraction of animal behaviour that seems all the more potent, and true, for not being specific. Alston's newest work is Cat's Eye, with a score by David Sawer whose punchy rhythms are well suited to dance, and with handsome design by Paul Huxley - rectangles of solid colour, flown against a midnight blue cloth, that make the stage area seem vibrant. The dance is as plotless as the decor, but Gary Lambert is a master of its ceremonies, dancing with ebullient energy, and marking the score's jazzy nuances with just the suggestion of a shimmy. I am not sure, after one viewing, how the choreography holds together - if it is, indeed, intended to cohere - but its varied incidents are pleasing, and offer a melting, pretty solo to Jacqueline Jones, which she shows off with great charm. Siobhan Davies' creation for the company is Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues. Industrial life has rarely inspired choreography. Foregger's optimistic machine dances in early Soviet days; Gertrud Bodenwieser's fascination with 'The Demon Machine' at about the same time; Massine's picture of urban proletariat in Le Pas d'acier for Diaghilev, were hardly concerned with industry itself. Even the Marxist spectacles staged by workers' dance groups during the Depression in New York were more protest than explanation. What Davies has done is to make a subtle, compassionate comment upon an industrial community. Her starting point is Frederic Rzewski's eponymous piano score, which develops from an rhythmic mimicry of machine noise into a touching 'blues'. Alexandra Dyer and Amanda Britton first appear, in a prelude that evokes physical exhaustion as well as companionship, and they will similarly provide a postlude to the work. They are joined by eight dancers whose movements tell of the routine of factory production, of the tedium of repetitive industrial action, even - in the way the dance crosses the stage  -of the movement of shuttle across loom, as if the machine conditioned its operators. Gabrielle McNaughton is shown as a physically buoyant figure, but the idea of blues as lament imbues the choreography with an elegiac mood. Without literalism, and with a characteristic finesse, the dance speaks of the human - and the industrially dehumanising - condition. In her finest work, Siobhan Davies offers something of the visual integrity we see in Gwen John's painting. In this new piece the matching of score, inspiration and imagery is acutely judged. As a musical note, I salute John Sweeney's performance of the Rzewski blues, and the excellent account of the Osborne and Sawer scores by the Mercury Ensemble under Roger Heaton. The ballets were very well lit, by Peter Mumford and Michael Hulls. The Royalty Theatre has one of the most hideous of theatrical interiors, but its stage is well suited for troupes of Rambert size, and the dance looks good. Rambert Dance Company continues at the Royalty Theatre until June 27 with varied programmes.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Head of the Parade: Vice President Dan Quayle will serve as grand marshal of  the Indianapolis 500 parade May 26. Quayle, a native Hoosier, will be the first  sitting vice president to lead the 104-unit parade.  </P> <P> Quayle's wife, Marilyn, and children, Tucker, Benjamin, and Corinne, are  expected to spend three days in the city.  </P> <P> * In Deep: New York Post publisher Peter Kalikow wants to build a 420-foot dock  for his boat fleet near his mansion near Long Island, N.Y. But the dock would  cut through 45 underwater acres he owns, possibly damaging marine life, said a  local zoning appeals board. "The only conceivable residential use for  underwater land is a private dock," Kalikow's lawyer, George Biondo, told the  board, whose members mentioned possible chemical spills from the boats and  disruption of scallop beds. The board makes its decision in May.  </P> <P> * Stunned plaintiff: Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu, a Memphis, Tenn., woman who filed a  lawsuit against the late Rev. Ralph Abernathy, because she claimed he had  wrongly implied that she had sex with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the  night before his death, gasped when she learned of Abernathy's death Tuesday.  "My sympathy goes out to his family. At one time we were friends, and that's  the way I'll remember him." She said she deferred any decision on continuing  her suit.  </P> <P> * White House Waste: George Bush is doing a poor job of taking out the trash,  says the Washington Sierra Club, which Tuesday put the White House on its  "Slimy Seven" list of federal agencies reportedly breaking local recycling  laws. A Bush spokesman said the White House has "some recycling strategies  under consideration."  </P></p>

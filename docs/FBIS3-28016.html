The rise was caused by  the yen's continued strength and brisk auto sales for Hyundai  Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. in the United States.    In the same month, 113,533 autos were sold at home, up 18.3  percent, but the figure compares with 141,991 units sold in  December last year. Among the major automakers, Hyundai Motor  Co. ranked first both in exports and in sales at home. Hyundai  exported 35,360 cars, up 38.1 percent, and sold 55,035 autos at  home, up 13.7 percent.    Daewoo Motor Co. exported 2,027 cars, off more than 50  percent, and sold 25,882 at home, up 42.7 percent. Kia Motors  Corp. exported 10,013 units, up 11.0 percent, and sold 25,062 at  home, up 6.7 percent. The figures were 521 and 2,980,  respectively, for Ssangyong Motor Co. and 1,367 and 1,865 for  Asia Motor Co. Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., which  produces only the jeep Galloper for the domestic market, sold  2,709.

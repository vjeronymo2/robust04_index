			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Santer set to clinch top job in Brussels EU leaders look set today to name Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's prime minister, as the new president of the European Commission in succession to Mr Jacques Delors. In spite of widespread concern in Brussels and among senior EU diplomats and national officials that the Commission would be badly weakened after Mr Delors' influential 10-year stewardship, Mr Santer appeared the only candidate behind whom the 12 member states could unite. However, in a development that raises the possibility of a setback at today's special summit in Brussels, Denmark announced yesterday the rival candidacy of Mr Poul Schluter, a former conservative prime minister. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, declared Mr Schluter's candidacy after meeting parliamentary leaders. 'The Danish government finds that Mr Schluter is the Danish candidate with the best chances of getting the post,' he told Danish radio. 'It is too early to say what the outcome of Friday's summit will be . . . but Mr Schluter is Denmark's candidate.' In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand predicted that today's summit would agree on the Brussels succession, and stressed that the person must be 'someone who speaks French'. Mr Santer, 57, has led a Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg since 1984. He speaks fluent French and German, as well as English. The British government yesterday signalled strongly that it expected Mr Santer to emerge as the consensus choice, although UK officials warned that other candidates remained. Mr John Major, the prime minister, refrained from naming Mr Santer during Commons exchanges but said there was 'a substantial difference' between the current candidates and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who was vetoed by the UK at the Corfu summit. Strong backing for Mr Santer emerged yesterday from Portugal. 'If the candidature of the prime minister of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, is confirmed, Portugal will approve it enthusiastically,' Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, the foreign minister, told reporters. Last-minute consultations took place in Paris. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr Mitterrand, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Dehaene and Mr Santer all attended Bastille Day celebrations. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

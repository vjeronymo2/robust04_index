			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Fang </F> Jin (2455 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- A ceremony to present  certificates of appointment to additional members of the  Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [HKSAR] Preparatory Committee under the  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee was held at  the Great Hall of the People this afternoon.    NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi presented the  certificates to the 13 new PWC members. Vice Chairman Tian  Jiyun presided over the ceremony.    Chairman Qiao Shi made an important speech. He said: Since  its establishment in July last year, the PWC has worked very  hard and pragmatically. It has attracted extensive attention  and won favorable comments from various quarters. On behalf of  the NPC Standing Committee, I extend my heartfelt thanks to  Chairman Qian Qichen and the committee's vice chairmen, members,  and working personnel.    Qiao Shi said: The PWC's work burden will become  increasingly heavier as the day when China assumes the exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong draws near. The purpose of  selecting additional PWC members is to strengthen its working  power. We believe that the additional members will certainly  live up to the people's aspirations and join other committee  members and take the initiative in doing solid preparatory work  for the establishment of the HKSAR Preparatory Committee under  the guidance of the general principle of "one country, two  systems," the Basic Law, and the relevant NPC decisions.    Qiao Shi emphasized: The PWC's work has a direct bearing on  the transfer of government and the smooth transition of Hong  Kong in 1997. I hope that the PWC will continue to widely  listen to the Hong Kong people's opinions; pay attention to  investigation and study; and by various means and ways, make the  Hong Kong people show a common concern about and participate in  the preparatory work for China to resume its sovereignty over  Hong Kong. So long as the vast number of Hong Kong people  participate in our work and the people across the country  strongly support our work, we certainly can triumphantly  accomplish the glorious mission assigned us by history.    Present at today's ceremony were Wang Hanbin, Ni Zhifu, Sun  Qimeng, Chen Muhua, Qin Jiwei, Lu Jiaxi, and Buhe, vice chairmen  of the NPC Standing Committee; Cao Zhi, secretary general of the  NPC Standing Committee; and Qian Qichen, vice premier of the  State Council and chairman of the PWC.</p>

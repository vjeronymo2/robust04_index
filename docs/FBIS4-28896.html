			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 13 (ANTARA) -- The three-day air  defence exercise dubbed "Cakra A/94" involving F-5E Tiger II and  A-4 Sky Hawk tactical jet aircraft, wound up in Jakarta Friday  last week.    National Air Defence Command (Kohanudnas) spokesman  Lieutenant Colonel Widoso Sabarno said in Jakarta Monday that  the exercise took place in the air territory under the Air  Defence Sector Command I [Roman numeral one] covering Jakarta  and its surroundings.    Also taking part in the event, he added, were a number of  C-130 Hercules giant transport planes and Boeing 707 aircraft,  in addition to radar units, with Flight Lieutenant Colonel Tahir  Harita in charge of control and supervision.    Widoso said the main purpose of the exercise was to enhance  the combat readiness of the air defence potential of the  particular region.    The ability and preparedness in the detection, control, and  interception of enemy aircraft under the air defence operation  procedures and control command mechanism, have really been  tested during the exercise, he said.    The exercise was also to train combat pilots in quick  reaction, target identification, action against a target  including cashing [as received] away, forcing to land up to  shooting down, Widoso said.    In the exercise, the A-4 Sky Hawks acted as the enemy,  flying  from their base in Pekanbaru, Riau, for penetration to Jakarta.    The A-4 jets were detected by ground radar, then `met' by  the  F-5 combat planes, and eventually chased away.    The exercise was officially closed by Kohanudnas Commander  Rear Marshal Sujitno.</p>

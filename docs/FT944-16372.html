			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bergesen sees rise in tanker market Bergesen, Norway's largest shipowner which yesterday reported weaker-than-expected financial results for the first eight months, forecast an improved tanker market later this year, Reuter reports from Oslo. 'The situation is more conducive to a good autumn tanker market this year than it was last year. However, any improvement in the market would have a limited effect on tanker results in 1994,' Bergesen said. The company reported eight-month pre-tax earnings of NKr92m compared with NKr171m a year ago.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Trick of Nuclear Criminal"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  reactionaries recently staged the drama of "opening" to Western  reporters the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant where 70 kg of  plutonium had been discovered some time ago, a report from Tokyo  says.    This is a trick to fool the unbiased opinion guarding  against  Japan which is accelerating its conversion into a nuclear power  in full scale.    When foreign reporters asked why the secret of the  accumulation of a large amount of plutonium was not disclosed  for six years," the authorities "did not utter a word in answer".    The nuclear criminal who was caught red-handed in wantonly  violating the universally accepted international law cannot be  absolved from its crime, even if he "opened" the nuclear  fuel-making plant to the public.    Still more ridiculous is that this nuclear criminal,  shamelessly enough, has become noisier in crying over the  fictitious "nuclear weapons development" by the DPRK. This is a  crafty ruse to justify Japan's moves to become a nuclear power,  which has become a target of the accusing finger of the  international community and divert elsewhere the world's  attention from it.    Judging from the fact that many nuclear reactors of Japan  have been operating for scores of years, it is as clear as  noonday that the exposed amount of plutonium is only a tiny part  of the total amount of concealed plutonium.    The Japanese authorities must not resort to a trick to  mislead public opinion but clearly open to the international  community the total amount of plutonium hidden nationwide, and  promptly stop nuclear armament.</p>

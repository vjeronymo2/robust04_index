			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martha Eugenia Davila in Tijuana from the "Early </F> News" newscast]    [Text] Violence and insecurity unfortunately continue here  in the city of Tijuana. Federico Benitez Lopez, director of the  Tijuana Municipal Police, was killed last night in an attack.    According to preliminary reports, an anonymous call was  received at 2000 at the Tijuana Public Security Directorate,  which was headed up by Benitez Lopez. The phone call warned that  a bomb had been planted at the Tijuana airport. Municipal  police officers, led by Benitez Lopez himself, went to the  airport. After a fruitless search for the bomb, the police  officers left the airport via the airport road. While stopped  at an intersection known as Puente Tijuana, Federico Benitez and  his bodyguard Ramon Alarid, who were traveling in a white pickup  owned by Tijuana Municipality, were ambushed by and fired on  from a dark red Bronco pickup with tinted glass windows. This  vehicle was later abandoned at the Murua (?parking lot) in this  same city.    Policemen were deployed in large numbers after this  unfortunate incident. Members of the Federal Judicial Police,  State Judicial Police, Municipal Police, and national security  forces were deployed. Federico Benitez was taken to a Red Cross  Hospital. He had two bullet wounds, one in the head and the  other in the neck. Despite efforts to save his life, Federico  Benitez died at 2215. His bodyguard Ramon Alarid had died  instantly.    Surveillance of the area was ordered. All exits from  Tijuana, the most visited city in the world, were also placed  under surveillance. This operation continued throughout the  night and continues this morning.    Apparently, a medical report was going to be released, but  this was postponed. We are waiting for more information. In an  interview, Jorge Alvarez, commander of the 2d Sector of the  State Judicial Police, and Captain Jose Luis Lopez, of the same  police department, agreed the ambush had been carefully planned.    This situation has created anxiety among the population.  This is one of the unfortunate incidents that has infuriated  the people of Tijuana, Baja California, and the entire nation.</p>

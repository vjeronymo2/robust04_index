			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Arts: Thrilled to be black - Nigel Andrews explains why 'film noir' is solid gold WHAT IS 'film noir'? Of all the catch-phrases in all the languages in all the world, none has walked into more movie lives than this one. It was born in Paris in 1945 and today it is a citizen of the globe. You can scarcely read a review column without bumping into it and movie-makers themselves, wise to its critical popularity, turn out movies as if to solicit the phrase. In the first two months of this year the dark-toned thrillers are tumbling over themselves: Night And The City, Deep Cover, Midnight Sting, The Public Eye. And even para-modern crime movies like Reservoir Dogs and Man Bites Dog clothe themselves in the laconic moral midnight that was film noir's great gift to 20th century sensibility. The phrase was coined by a group of postwar French critics who saw a rhyme between the sombre movie thrillers of the 1940s/early '50s and the contemporaneous Serie Noir crime novels, in which American hardboiled fiction (in translation) loomed large. As a coinage film noir was solid gold and soon became universal tender. Not content with using it to underwrite appraisals of primal 'noirs' like Laura, Double Indemnity and Build My Gallows High - films awash in apres-guerre shadows, threateningly emancipated women and maze-like moral ambiguities - critics handed the currency down to succeeding generations. Today every thriller with a hardboiled hero or fatal woman, plus (if possible) outbreaks of venetian blinds and rain-sleek streets, is showered with the loose change of noir criticism. Some movie people, like critic-filmmaker Paul Schrader, rage against the anachronistic word-bandying. 'Film Noir came up after the war through a convergence of influences', he told me on the set of Light Sleeper, where I had been foolish enough to suggest the picture was a modern FN 'There were the expatriate Germanic influences in Hollywood, and there was the sense of let-down that many Americans felt after the war when guys came home and couldn't get work and their wives were more independent because they'd had jobs. 'It was a kind of dead-end social-psychological backlash and it crept into cinema after the war. From the mid-1950s it gradually died out with the new affluence and the rise of TV and colour photography. So the phrase refers to a specific historical period. There's no such thing as a modern film noir.' Thank you. Lecture appreciated. But so long as they can pass it across the counter, can we doubt that critics will go on using the phrase? Or that film-makers - who are just critics with cameras - will go on pandering to the popularity of noir and neo-noir as a style? Here, for instance, is The Movie Book Of Film Noir (Studio Vista Pounds 16.99). Edited by veteran buff Ian Cameron, once a founder editor of Movie magazine, that 1960s growbag of noir consciousness (here a 5000-word essay on Hitchcock, there a tractactus on Tourneur), it is a priceless primer. Priceless in all senses. Its 21 essays are so ornately intense it is hard not to giggle at times. Read the maze of 'Gestalten' and 'suppressive narratives' that Douglas Pye builds around a mediocre Fritz Lang film, Beyond A Reasonable Doubt. But the book is also affirmatively priceless. All the key components of noir as a style are here. The Byzantine plotting (The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep); the matching obfuscations of decor and lighting (often by immigrant cameramen or directors trained in German Expressionism); the battered, cynical protagonists (Bogart, Mitchum); and the strong-willed, sexually charged women (Stanwyck in Double Indemnity, Hayworth in Gilda and The Lady From Shanghai) who were re-writing the rulebook of male-female rapport. The best essay is Jonathan Buchsbaum's 'Tame Wolves And Phoney Claims.' Buchsbaum takes the word paranoia, the most-used coin of all in the noir currency, and polishes it to a psychiatric exactness. Then he shows where the word is apt (and where not) in analysing films like Double Indemnity or Murder My Sweet. The premise of disturbance or disorientation, the fear of personal or sexual inadequacy, the search for secure data: these components of paranoia clearly lead to the noir iconography of questing (detective) heroes, threatening conspiracies and erotic mystery. Noir, as the book insists, was a style, never a genre. It was an emotional condiment that could season different dishes. Though its favourites were the mystery thriller and hardboiled detective story, its nihilist melancholia could also be shaken over the Western (Duel In The Sun, The Naked Spur), the romantic potboiler (Bogart's no-ideals anti-hero in Casablanca) and even the sci-fi film (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers). Today noir is back and one disputes Schrader's theory of the inauthenticity of its modern heir. True: film noir first emerged in the postwar era when God created perfect conditions for paranoia in a patriarchal society. Men returning from the war a jangle of new anxieties; women busting out from the kitchen or marital bed; and post-'45 austerity painting America in the colours of Poverty Row, black and white with grey an additional option. But 50 years after Laura, the 1993 new year films look just as genuinely noir as those circa 1943. Deep Cover, a mazy thriller full of jet-dark moralising, and The Public Eye, whose gritty fictionalised portrait of the 1940s news photographer Weegee opens in Britain next week, are both in colour; but it is a colour that rejoices in negating itself. And if Reservoir Dogs features no fatal women, its picture of male pride being socked in the solar plexus - or socking itself - is as merciless as in The Big Heat or Build My Gallows High. Even the titles ask us to pin the label 'noir' on them, abounding in words of darkness or concealment - night, midnight, deep. And to keep us happy later in the year more 1990s-noir titles, plus films, are lining up. Woody Allen's next UK-released offering is a pastiche period thriller in black-and-white called Shadows And Fog. And farceur Carl Reiner is busy making Triple Indemnity, a spoof on you-know-what. The 1990s are becoming as noir as the 1940s for a simple reason. Carbon-copy social conditions prevail. We have economic austerity. We have women coming on strong after years of limbering up at the Feminist Gym. And we have a world where the west is once more playing anxious policeman as History ignites come-and-get-me conflicts around the world. For extra measure, it is seven years to the new millennium - and isn't it always darkest before a dawn?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat has suffered a severe health setback that has forced him  to stay home since yesterday and to halt his activities.  Doctors decided to prevent him from receiving visitors because  of his extreme exhaustion.    'Arafat felt exhausted after his return from visits to  Algeria and Mauritania but he forced himself to receive a U.S.  Senate delegation yesterday morning. After the delegation  departed the PLO headquarters, 'Arafat went up to his private  apartment on the second floor. Several Tunisian and Palestinian  doctors were promptly summoned to 'Arafat's residence and he was  given a physical examination plus several laboratory tests.    The doctors gave strict orders banning visits to 'Arafat and  advised him to get total rest.</p>

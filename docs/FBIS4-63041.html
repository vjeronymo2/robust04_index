			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- President Islam Karimov  of Uzbekistan, who is currently on his first visit to Japan,  told a news conference in Tokyo today of his confidence that  economic cooperation between Uzbekistan and Japan will develop  rapidly in the immediate future. Responding to a question from  ITAR-TASS, he noted that "the joint Uzbek-Japanese documents  signed during the visit and the talks with Japanese Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata" justify such hopes.    Yesterday the Uzbek president and the Japanese prime  minister  adopted a joint declaration setting out the fundamental  principles to which Tashkent and Tokyo intend to adhere in  bilateral relations. In the document Uzbekistan expresses  support for Japan's admission to the UN Security Council as a  permanent member. The signatories to the declaration proclaim  their intention to cooperate closely within the UN and other  international organizations. They advocate the expansion of  political dialogue between the two countries.    After the adoption of the joint declaration the foreign  ministers of Uzbekistan and Japan signed a joint document which  asserts that both sides regard all treaties between the former  USSR and Japan, relating to Uzbekistan, as remaining in force.    During yesterday's Uzbek-Japanese talks Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata announced that Japan will grant Uzbekistan fresh  medical aid worth $5 million. The total value of Tokyo's  medical aid to the Republic now amounts to $15 million.    The chief aim of the Uzbek president's four-day visit to  Japan, which began Monday , is to establish a basis for the  rapid development of economic cooperation between Tashkent and  Tokyo. Referring to the prospects for this, Islam Karimov drew  attention to the fact that the interests of both countries would  be served by the harnessing of Japan's technological power to  Uzbekistan's huge natural resources. "According to estimates by  U.S. experts, Uzbekistan's mineral and raw material reserves are  worth $3 trillion," the president said.    Islam Karimov disclosed that the possibility of opening a  direct air link between Uzbekistan and Japan was discussed  during his talks in Tokyo. Uzbekistan is ready to open up  direct air services to any Japanese city and to resolve the  technical questions which this involves, the president noted.</p>

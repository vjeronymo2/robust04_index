			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Rival Czech truck makers to discuss alliance Tatra, the ailing Czech truck maker, expects to discuss a strategic alliance with Liaz, its main Czech rival, to make cabins and other components. However, an immediate merger has been ruled out. The company is also considering approaching the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for up to USDollars 50m and the Czech government for emergency aid to help it repay debts incurred through a slump in sales. Mr Karel Beneda, a former Tatra vice-president, has been appointed acting chairman to replace Mr Gerald Greenwald, recently appointed head of UAL, the US airline. He resigned as chairman and general manager of Tatra on Wednesday along with two senior colleagues. The three men were forced out by the Tatra board under pressure from shareholders after Czech directors accused them of not devoting enough time to the company. They joined in March last year to help return Tatra to profit after it lost its traditional markets with the collapse of communism. They were offered a 15 per cent stake if they achieved a turnround, but falling sales meant the company was unable to capitalise on streamlined production methods and staff cuts.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: HOW TO AVOID, RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH BROKER  </P> <P> Stock market investors, take at least a little bit of heart. New rules approved  this week should make arbitrating disputes with brokers more fair and open. But  these rules are no substitute for taking more care to avoid misunderstandings  in the first place.  </P> <P> Arbitration cases between investors and brokers mushroomed in the 1982-1987  bull market and continued to grow following the crash. Investors complained of  everything from mishandling of orders, to misrepresentation of investment risk,  to unauthorized trading.  </P> <P> Investors have been required to resolve their beefs through arbitration instead  of the courts because the industry contends that it is less costly and time  consuming. But investors complain that arbitration panels operated by the New  York and American stock exchanges and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers  (NASD) are biased toward the industry.  </P> <P> The process hasn't allowed investors to obtain enough information, and the  results of proceedings were often kept under a shroud of secrecy, investor  advocates have complained.  </P> <P> These and other concerns prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission this  week to unanimously approve new rules, effective in September, covering  arbitration systems run by the exchanges and the NASD. One of the most  important rule changes requires brokerages to clearly highlight and explain  pre-dispute agreements that bind investors to use arbitration instead of  lawsuits.  </P> <P> New rules also require arbitrators to disclose their employment history over  the previous 10 years and take other steps to disclose possible conflicts or  pro-industry bias. Brokers will be required to produce more documents, and  investors may be allowed pre-hearing conferences or preliminary hearings in  large or complex cases. Results of arbitration proceedings will be made public.  </P> <P> The rules are an important step forward, but many investor attorneys and  lawmakers say they don't go far enough.  </P> <P> "They aren't a panacea for arbitration," says Theodore G. Eppenstein, a New  York attorney who represents investors in arbitration cases. He and others want  a ban on pre-dispute arbitration agreements, among other things.  </P> <P> But that may be pie in the sky, at least for now. Given what you have to work  with, here are some tips on how to better police your broker and take advantage  of the new arbitration rules:  </P> <P> * Shop carefully for a broker. Get referrals from friends or colleagues.  Interview several brokers. Visit their offices. Ask for references of clients.  Ask clients if the broker had ever executed unauthorized trades.  </P> <P> Be sure a prospective broker tries to understand your investment preferences  and goals. "If he or she immediately tries to sell you something before even  finding out who you are, that means they are a product pusher," says Michael E.  Friedman, a Pasadena attorney who represents investors in arbitrations. Avoid  such brokers, he urges.  </P> <P> * Don't assume you must sign the arbitration clause. Many brokerages don't  require you to sign an arbitration clause if you are just trading on a cash  basis (that is, you are not trading on margin using borrowed funds, or you are  not trading stock options).  </P> <P> See if you can cross off the arbitration clause while agreeing to the rest of  the brokerage agreement, Friedman suggests. Or write in a clause that permits  you the option of also using the American Arbitration Assn., a more expensive  but less industry-biased arbitration service. However, if you do this, be sure  to keep a copy of the form.  </P> <P> * Don't allow your broker discretionary power over your account. A broker can  make trades without your consent only if you grant power of attorney. In almost  all cases, don't do this, Eppenstein advises. That is an invitation for an  unscrupulous broker to churn your account.  </P> <P> If you plan to be out of town but want your broker to keep an eye on your  account, ask him or her to check with a family member before trading,  Eppenstein suggests.  </P> <P> * Take and keep detailed notes and records. Keep copies of all mailings from  your broker. And keep a log of all orders you place, with the date and time,  price and type of order. Compare that with your trade confirmations and account  statements. If there is a discrepancy, write immediately to your broker and  branch manager.  </P> <P> "Don't rely on your broker's word that he will fix it," Eppenstein says. If you  don't respond promptly, the brokerage will assume the statement is correct.  </P> <P> You might also consider tape recording conversations with your broker. But make  sure the broker knows you are doing this. Under most circumstances, it is  illegal in California and many other states to record phone conversations  without the other party's consent.  </P> <P> * Conduct important business in writing. If you are making a complex or  expensive transaction, don't just have your broker repeat back to you the  terms. Send a letter confirming what you ordered, Friedman suggests.  </P> <P> * Keep track of commissions. These usually are reported on your confirmation  slips. But ask your broker periodically for a cumulative accounting of total  commissions you are paying.  </P> <P> * Ask to be kept up to date. Ask your broker to contact you if the value of  your account falls 10% or 15%. "Don't wait for your monthly statement in order  to find out if you're in trouble," Eppenstein says. "Put the onus on your  broker to let you know what's going on."  </P> <P> * Be wary of aggressive sales pitches. If your broker tries to sell you  something you don't understand or that is inappropriate for you, beware. That  type of broker may succumb to unauthorized trading or other misdeeds.  </P> <P> If questionable trades occur more than once, get a new broker. Request in  writing that the offending broker halt trading immediately, Friedman says.  </P> <P> If your brokerage is unable to resolve your dispute and you have to go to  arbitration, consider these steps:  </P> <P> * Seek counsel if appropriate. For small cases you probably won't need an  attorney. Cases of under $5,000 ($10,000 starting in September) can use small  claims arbitration, a quicker and less costly route. But a key drawback is that  there are no oral hearings. Each side simply presents its written case.  </P> <P> For almost all cases involving losses of $50,000 or more, you will want to seek  counsel. Try to get one that specializes in securities litigation.  </P> <P> * Be prepared. Collect and organize documents. Find witnesses. Work to be  credible.  </P> <P> * Check the backgrounds of arbitrators. Ask attorneys or others who have had  cases heard by your arbitrators. Check their backgrounds to make sure their law  firms aren't representing the brokerage firm you are against. In proceedings  before the exchanges and the NASD, you have the right to preempt one  arbitrator, Friedman says.  </P> <P> * Consider alternatives. Arbitrators working for the American Arbitration Assn.  are less likely to have served the securities industry.  </P> <P> However, the AAA won't be better in all circumstances. AAA's fees can cost as  much as three times more than those charged by the exchanges or the NASD,  Friedman notes. In cases of clear-cut and serious securities law violations,  exchange or NASD arbitrators will be more familiar with the rules, he suggests.  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot respond individually to letters.

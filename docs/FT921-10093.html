			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Chrysler warns of big loss for current three months CHRYSLER, the financially stretched US car manufacturer, yesterday reported fourth quarter net earnings of Dollars 97m. However, it lost Dollars 74m at the pre-tax level and warned that it might lose substantially more than that in the first quarter of 1992. The earnings, which worked through at 33 cents a share, were in line with market expectations and were flattered by a Dollars 127m one-time after-tax gain on the sale of its 50 per cent stake in Diamond-Star Motors, its US joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors. Chrysler, in common with Detroit rivals General Motors and Ford, continues to lose money on its core car manufacturing operations due to the recession in the US market and severe price competition. The company is relying heavily on two significant new product launches this year - the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and the LH series of mid-sized saloons - to improve its financial health. Mr Lee Iaccoca, chairman, said the first quarter was going to be tough because the economy had yet to revive and the company would have substantial pre-production and launch costs. As a result, it would incur a pre-tax loss which could 'significantly exceed' the fourth quarter's Dollars 74m. The fourth-quarter figures compared with earnings of Dollars 31m, or 14 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales totalled Dollars 8.2bn, against Dollars 7.6bn previously. For the full year, the company lost Dollars 795m, or Dollars 3.28 a share, after a Dollars 257m accounting charge, compared with 1990 earnings of Dollars 68m, or 30 cents a share. Chrysler Financial, its financial services arm, made Dollars 276m in the year, down from Dollars 313m, and said that the idea of selling a minority interest in the business had been put on hold.</p>

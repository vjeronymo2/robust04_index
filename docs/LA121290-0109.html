			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FDA APPROVES IRVINE HEART-VALVE FIRM'S ALERT;  </P> <P> HEALTH: PFIZER'S MECHANICAL DEVICES, WITH POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING  FRACTURES, HAVE BEEN IMPLANTED IN 82,000 PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced its formal approval of  Pfizer Inc.'s national program to alert 19,000 doctors about potentially flawed  valves for artificial hearts, which are blamed in about 260 deaths. But  government officials said they still have some concerns about the program.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, it was disclosed that the FDA criticized Pfizer's Shiley  Inc. unit for failing to include adequate warnings about potentially  life-threatening fractures in the mechanical valves that have been implanted in  82,000 people worldwide. Irvine-based Shiley manufactured the valves, which the  company voluntarily withdrew from the market in 1986.  </P> <P> After several news reports this week drew attention to the FDA's criticism, the  agency released a statement Tuesday saying it had accepted Shiley's plan to  find patients implanted with its Bjork-Shiley 60-degree Convexo-Concave valve.  </P> <P> "Those words are not meant to convey (that) we accept or endorse the packaging  of the materials," said James Morrison, the FDA's deputy director of training  and assistance.  </P> <P> Shiley had a different interpretation of the FDA's action. "This is almost a  retraction of the statements yesterday," said Becky Zadro, a Shiley  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The FDA, Shiley and Public Citizen -- a consumer group founded by Ralph Nader  -- have been working together since September on a plan for contacting  physicians.  </P> <P> "We and the FDA mainly agree on the plan," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of  Public Citizen's Health Research Group. "We were snookered, though, about the  packaging because they didn't show us those envelopes."  </P> <P> The FDA criticized the original packages that Pfizer sent to doctors, saying  the envelopes resembled junk mail and were likely to be discarded by doctors.  The envelopes showed a picture of a man and woman talking to a doctor.  </P> <P> About 82,000 people worldwide -- 23,000 of them in North America -- were  implanted with the valve; 55,000 of them are still living. According to FDA  figures, 395 of the Shiley valves have fractured, resulting in about 260  deaths.  </P> <P> Shiley has contracted with Medic Alert, a nonprofit medical information  foundation in Turlock in Northern California to build a national computerized  registry of valve recipients that would be available to doctors and emergency  medical personnel. There is some evidence that valve fracture victims can be  saved if the problem is diagnosed in time.  </P> <P> Those people in the registry will receive identification cards and a bracelet  or necklace -- similar to those worn by diabetics -- saying that they have a  Bjork-Shiley valve.  </P></p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu to swallow rest of Poqet POQET Computer, a pioneer in the market for pocket-sized personal computers, is to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fujitsu and the vehicle for the Japanese computer giant's entry into the US and European personal computer markets. Fujitsu, which already holds more than 80 per cent of Poqet's equity as a result of a series of investments, is in the process of acquiring the remaining portion which is owned by current and former Poqet executives. The company was yesterday renamed Fujitsu Personal Systems. Fujitsu's investments in Poqet stem from a long-standing business relationship with Mr Robb Wilmot, chairman of Poqet and the former chairman of ICL, the UK computer company now owned by Fujitsu. ICL is also expected to play a role in Fujitsu's expansion of European personal computer sales. The Poqet acquisition represents a strategic move by Fujitsu, said Mr Tadayasu Sugita, former general manager of Fujitsu's personal computer division in Japan, who became president of Poqet last year. The trend in reducing the size of computer technology, in which networks of personal computers are increasingly replacing larger minicomputers and mainframes, means it is increasingly important for Fujitsu to have a world-wide presence in the personal computer market, Mr Sugita explained. Although Fujitsu's Personal Systems Division in Japan recorded sales last year of Dollars 2bn (that includes word processors and some consumer products), the company has yet to make any significant inroads into the international market. The company will use Poqet's established US and European distribution and marketing operations as the basis for its market expansion. 'That is the reason for Fujitsu's decision,' he said. Initially, Fujitsu will focus on the portable personal computer market with the tiny 'Poqet', a miniature personal computer, and Poqet's recently announced pen-computer will attempt to penetrate the emerging market for carry-along computers. Ultimately, however, Fujitsu will address broader segments of the portable personal computer market, 'after we have achieved a foothold and good brand name recognition'. International Business Machines is to acquire a minority stake in Parallan Computer, a California computer company that specialises in network servers. The IBM investment is part of an agreement between the companies to work together on development of servers and networking software. IBM will obtain worldwide rights to market products developed by Parallan and future products developed by the alliance. Mr Paul C. Mugge, vice-president of development, IBM Entry Systems Technology, said: 'We expect the IBM/Parallan alliance to provide industry leadership in network servers this year and in years to come.'</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Technology for the next generation - Paul Taylor looks at the spread of GSM networks, in Europe and elsewhere Over the past two years the European-developed GSM (global system for mobile communications) digital cellular standard has won widespread acceptance around the world as the technology of choice for the next generation of cellular telephone networks. Although North America led the first mobile telecommunications revolution in the early 1980s, it is Europe that has taken the lead in the move towards digital systems with the GSM standard. 'The big impact of GSM is that it is a single standard,' says Mr Dean Eyers, an industry analyst with Dataquest's European telecommunications group, 'and this means enormous economies of scale for equipment manufacturers.' The big European equipment suppliers, have also benefited from disarray in the US where the telecommunications industry is still divided in its support for two different digital technologies - digital Amps based on time division multiple access (TDMA) or the newly-developed code division multiple access (CDMA) technology. GSM networks are in operation, under construction or planned across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia/Pacific region, having brushed aside the challenge from rival digital standards. Only in the Americas and Japan have alternative standards been adopted. By the end of July, the number of GSM subscribers worldwide totalled more than 3m and is expected to top 4m by the year-end. These customers are in 59 countries with a combined population of more than 2bn and the customer base is growing by more than 70 per cent a year. By 1999 EMCI, the Washington-based market research firm, predicts there will be 45.9m digital cellular subscribers worldwide, with GSM subscribers representing almost 60 per cent of the total. 'The GSM standard is now accepted worldwide as the basis for new digital mobile communications and networks,' Mr Bruno Massiet du Biest, the current chairman of the GSM Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) group, said recently. The first GSM networks were launched in Germany, France and Denmark in mid-1992, and similar services are now being rolled out across Europe. Last year the number of GSM subscribers in Europe jumped from 184,000 to 1.32m , according to figures from Mobile Communications, the Financial Times newsletter. New GSM subscribers represented over 40 per cent of total western European subscriber growth and Dataquest is forecasting that the number of GSM subscribers in Europe will grow to 8.31m by the end of 1996. However, the bare figures hide substantial variations in GSM uptake in individual markets. Almost all of the growth in 1993 - and much of the growth this year  -was attributable to the German market which accounted for 74 per cent of all European GSM subscriber growth in 1993. In Germany and other markets where analogue network capacity was restricted, or had not been developed, GSM subscriber growth has been spectacular over the past two years. As a result, the two GSM networks, Deutsche Telekom Mobil's D1 network and Mannesmann Mobilfunk's D2 network, now both have more than 700,000 subscribers each. GSM subscriber growth has been spurred by competition. Two or more GSM network operators have been licensed in all European countries except Ireland which bowed to Commission pressure and requested bids for a second GSM operator in July. Aggressive marketing which has resulted in the elimination of the price premium on GSM equipment, has also helped. In both Germany and Denmark, another fast-growing GSM market with over 200,000 subscribers to its two GSM networks, Motorola handsets have fallen to under Pounds 100 in some promotion packages. But in those countries such as the UK which had well-established analogue systems which were not capacity constrained, the pace of transition from analogue to digital cellular systems has been much slower. Ms Diana Jones, in charge of marketing for Mercury Mobile Services, says there is still relatively little interest in Britain where GSM handsets are still Pounds 100 more than their analogue counterparts. 'Most business users do not at this stage feel the need to move over to GSM,' she says. Vodafone, which offers two GSM tariffs in the UK, has about 45,000 subscribers to its GSM network while its rival Cellnet only officially opened its GSM digital cellular network in mid-July. Like Vodafone, Cellnet is mainly targeting the business user. The main selling point will be the ability to use a GSM handset anywhere in Europe - Cellnet has negotiated 'roaming agreements' with 22 foreign operators. GSM networks are under construction in eastern Europe, including Russia where the Russian Telecommunications Development Corporation (RTDC) holds 14 GSM licences. Asia, already the fastest growing cellular market in the world, has become the biggest market for GSM. Japan and South Korea, which are developing their own digital standards, are the only two big Asian countries that have not adopted GSM. At the end of last year there were 19 licensed GSM operators in 10 countries throughout Asia, and potentially, 28 operators in 17 countries. Among them, Hong Kong has emerged as one of the most rapidly growing GSM digital cellular markets in the world. The colony's two GSM networks, Hong Kong Telecom and SmarTone, have been averaging more than 10,000 connections a month between them, and the total number of GSM subscribers is now over the 100,000 level. Elsewhere in Asia, GSM networks are in operation in Singapore, China and Malaysia, and are planned in Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Taiwan and India where eight city-based GSM digital cellular licences have been awarded. China recently placed two further contracts for GSM digital cellular systems. Nokia will supply a system for the country's capital, Beijing, while Ericsson of Sweden has won its second Chinese GSM contract for delivery of a system to Shantou in Guangdong province. GSM is seen to have two key advantages over the rival US digital Amps system in Asia. First, GSM frequencies are already available, while digital Amps frequencies may be already occupied. Second, GSM's roaming capability is giving it the edge over rival standards. However, the thorny issue of encryption poses a potential threat to GSM sales in Asia and elsewhere outside western Europe. GSM equipment uses an encryption device based on an algorithm called A5(1). However export rules normally prevent non-European operators from buying equipment that incorporates the A5(1) encryption system because of concerns that it could be used for military purposes. Instead, prospective GSM network operators outside Europe are being offered equipment with the newly-developed A5(2) encryption system. Taiwan has already complained about the restrictions which are seen as a trade barrier and has accused European export authorities of undue discrimination. This is causing concern at the GSM MoU Group which is seeking to promote the adoption of GSM worldwide. Although GSM has been an outstanding success, US and Japanese equipment manufacturers continue to lobby operators worldwide to adopt their rival digital standards. The MoU Group fears that non-European operators might feel that they are being asked to accept an inferior GSM technology and therefore turn to another system. Much is at stake. Frost and Sullivan, the market research group, estimates that the GSM cellular equipment market will peak next year at Dollars 1.6bn and then decline slowly as volumes and prices fall.</p>

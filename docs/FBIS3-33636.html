After the meeting 'Arafat said that not all the problems were  solved, but he expects an agreement soon. Yosi Sarid said there  are ups and downs; agreement was achieved on some issues and now  we are closer to an agreement. Arab sources told our  correspondent Gid'on Kouts that for all intents and purposes an  agreement has been achieved, except for some minor issues.  Israeli members in the formulations committee said that  understandings were reached on all issues; the two sides made  concessions and there is a chance for reaching an agreement.    Foreign Minister Peres will stay in Davos until tomorrow  morning. The contacts will be carried on tonight.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant stake placed Goode Durrant said it was pleased that a 25 per cent hostile stake in the industrial holding company had been placed in the market. No price was disclosed, but it seems likely the shares were placed at a small discount to yesterday's unchanged closing price of 165p. The stake had been held by Winnedael, the South African company owned by the Nash family, which had pushed unsuccessfully for representation on the board. Winnedael had criticised Goode Durrant for diversifying too much and urged it to focus on core businesses. Goode Durrant this month reported a recovery in interim profits from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 4.29m, boosted partly by the sale of its Laidlaw motor distribution subsidiary last June.</p>

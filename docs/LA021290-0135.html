			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EVEN COLUMBUS WAS SURPRISED  </P> <P> James (Buster) Douglas returned home to a hero's welcome today, greeted by more  than 1,000 new fans who wanted to catch a glimpse of the man who surprised the  world by knocking out heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> When Douglas headed for Tokyo to fight Tyson, he left in obscurity. Hardly  anyone noticed or cared. But he was met by a cheering crowd upon his arrival  this afternoon at Port Columbus International Airport.  </P> <P> His grandmother, Sarah Jones, stepped to the microphone, held the World Boxing  Council belt high in the air and said: "We did it, Columbus. We got it. And now  we're going to keep it."  </P> <P> The crowd cheered.  </P> <P> Douglas said he wants to take on undefeated Evander Holyfield, who had already  signed a contract to fight Tyson in June.  </P> <P> "Evander Holyfield's the No. 1 contender, and he would be the next opponent,"  he told reporters.  </P> <P> Johnson said he discussed with Mayor Dana Rinehart the possibility of having  the fight at Ohio Stadium, home of the Ohio State football team in Columbus.  </P> <P> Douglas was greeted by about 500 pupils of the Windsor Alternative School,  where his son, Lamar, is a fifth-grader.  </P> <P> "I'd just like to thank everyone for coming out and showing their support. All  the little people, all the kids," Douglas said.  </P> <P> Douglas, 29, shocked the sport of boxing Sunday with his 10th-round knockout of  Tyson, who went down to his first defeat in 38 fights.  </P> <P> But two of boxing's three governing bodies suspended Douglas' victory, pending  review of film to determine if Douglas received a long count when Tyson knocked  him down in the eighth round.  </P> <P> Rinehart said as far as he and Columbus are concerned, Douglas is the city's  newest champion.  </P> <P> "If they take this championship away from him, Rocky Marciano will flip over in  his grave," Rinehart said.  </P> <P> A parade was scheduled for Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> The International Boxing Federation said it recognized Douglas as the champion,  but the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Assn. suspended the result  pending their investigation. They could order a rematch.  </P> <P> Tyson stood to make at least $25 million by fighting Holyfield, and Holyfield  at least $12 million. Douglas got $1.3 million for Sunday's fight.  </P> <P> Even in Columbus, Douglas' knockout of Tyson came as a surprise.  </P> <P> At the Scoreboard Lounge, a local sports bar, most of the patrons watched the  preliminaries to Sunday's NBA All-Star Game instead of the fight.  </P> <P> "I saw it all happen, but there were just a few of us watching," said bartender  Scott Dye. "The vast majority were paying attention to the slam-dunk  competition at the NBA All-Star Game on the big screens.  </P> <P> "What an upset, the biggest upset in boxing history. It's not too often you get  a heavyweight champion from Columbus, Ohio, but you've got one now."  </P> <P> But Doug Owens of the Fitness Center in suburban Westerville, where Douglas  trains, said he was not surprised. Owens supervises Douglas' diet and weight  training.  </P> <P> "I saw it as a wonderful fight," Owens said. "It shows that James is the great  fighter that he is."  </P></p>

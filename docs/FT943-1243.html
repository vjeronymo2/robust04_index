			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / PepsiCo plans to centralise buying to save Dollars 100m PepsiCo, the US beverage, snacks and restaurant business, hopes to save Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) a year in its rapidly expanding European operations by centralising the purchase of services and materials, including television advertising, sugar, flour and packaging. Heads of Pepsi-Cola, Pizza Hut, KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) and the company's snack food division have been meeting over the past year to identify which items they purchase in common. The company is hoping that the savings, which would carve about 5 per cent off PepsiCo's Dollars 2bn costs in Europe, will be in place in a year. As part of the same exercise, the company has launched a drive to persuade its trade customers, including leisure park operators and cinema chains, to buy the full range of PepsiCo products and services. It recently flew 600 trade customers from eastern and western Europe to Club Med in Ibiza for a weekend of presentations and lavish entertainment. The company wants the different PepsiCo businesses, particularly in newly developing eastern European markets, to share distribution costs, office overheads and staff training. It might even put differently branded restaurants on adjoining sites. Mr Peter Hearl, European head of KFC, said that if PepsiCo's efforts in Europe were successful then 'other parts of the PepsiCo world', including businesses in north and south America, and Asia Pacific, could follow suit. Europe is becoming an increasingly important market for PepsiCo. About 80 per cent of the company's profits are generated in the US at present, but it hopes to reduce this to about 50 per cent over the next six years. Arch-rival Coca-Cola is dependent on the US for just 20 per cent of its profits - a fact which has helped to shield it from the effects of stiff competition in the home market. The company's different businesses have had a history of separate development, said Mr Wayne Mailloux, president of Pepsi-Cola Europe: 'We tend to operate with very autonomous, decentralised divisions, so much so that our customers do not really know us for all of the various dimensions that we represent.' He dismissed the idea that increased centralisation might dampen the commercial zeal of individual divisional heads. 'We're never going to allow ourselves to become a government bureaucracy. We will always put entrepreneurial drive first.'</p>

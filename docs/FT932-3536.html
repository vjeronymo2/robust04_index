			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Management: The right attitude - Staff surveys are increasingly popular, but can be fraught with pitfalls Royal Mail's 180,000 employees now know officially that they are a pretty miserable bunch. According to an internal employee attitude survey fed back to them this month, a record 70 per cent of them are unhappy at work. Uncertainty over privatisation, reorganisation of the service, new technology and worries over job security - not to mention a 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector pay this year - all contribute to rock-bottom morale. Managers at Royal Mail, in common with those at British Telecom, which has had similar upheavals and similar employee attitude survey results, profess not to be surprised by the findings. At the same time, there is within both organisations a profound level of scepticism among staff about whether the results of the surveys will lead to any changes: questionnaire answers show that at BT only 16 per cent of staff were able to think of any improvements resulting from the previous year's survey; at Royal Mail, around half thought management would not act on the findings. But in spite of this widespread scepticism and the predictability, in many cases, of results, the employee attitude survey industry has never been healthier. The BBC is one of the most recent additions to swell the ranks of those organisations now sending out employee attitude questionnaires. Other companies include IBM, Abbey National, Digital Equipment and Hoechst UK. A flourishing band of consultants and survey companies has grown up to service this fashionable growth area. While companies such as IBM, where staff surveys have been conducted since 1963, make conscientious attempts to translate findings into action, other organisations may be wasting money on research - perhaps Pounds 20,000 a shot for a modest project in a medium-sized organisation - that merely raises expectations and is then shelved. 'Let's do an employee attitude survey' appears to be a reflex response by companies to a range of perceived problems, according to Bill Quirke, a consultant with London-based Synopsis Communication. The first mistake companies make is to become immersed in technical matters such as questionnaire design, without being clear what the survey is for and what will be done with the results. Typically, the decision to carry out an employee attitude survey will spring from a fundamental disagreement at board level about what is going on inside the company, he says: 'One director will say that people are unhappy and are complaining - they don't understand the mission, they don't understand the restructuring. Another will say it's not that bad. What he really means is 'to hell with whether they're happy or not, we're in a recession' '. At that point the decision is made to bring in a third party to establish the facts by conducting a survey. And so the process begins, based, essentially, on the kind of debate that is never going to get anywhere - how far companies should be 'nice' to their employees. The idea of worker happiness comes from an outdated, hierarchical view of work, claims Quirke. 'People at the top tell people at the bottom to go and do the job, and then you check every now and then whether the natives are restless,' he says. Indeed, employees may be fat and happy while their company is failing to adapt to new markets, processes or customer requirements, he adds. Companies need a more hard-headed approach to what they are trying to find out, and why, he says. 'People need to know where the organisation is going, they need to understand their local objectives and how they fit in, and they need to get regular feedback. Those are the things that should be tested.' Quality programmes, in particular, mean that the common existing model of communication - the person at the top shouts through a megaphone to the person at the bottom - is no longer appropriate. The next commonly made mistake is to become obsessed with scores and comparisons with other companies, rather than looking at what the results mean and how far they fit in with the business needs of the organisation. Much of the time, admits Quirke, it is possible for a consultant to construct a report on the findings before carrying out the research and without knowing anything about the client's industry. The Norm Report, as he calls it, would reach the following conclusions on communications, for example: most people prefer to hear things through their immediate boss; people are most interested in information about their own immediate work unit; managers want more information but, at the same time, complain about being deluged with paper; the grapevine is the most used, though least preferred, way of finding out about things. There are even national norms for employee attitude survey scores, according to the International Survey Research organisation: Swiss employees are the most satisfied, followed by the Dutch. The British are the most dissatisfied, identifying least with their organisations and feeling most insecure in their jobs. The next stage within most organisations, once the predictably uncomfortable results have been collected, is for collective gloom to set in. For some companies, the first time such an exercise is conducted will also be the last - even the results of a pilot may warn senior managers off the idea.</p>

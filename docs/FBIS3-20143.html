			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Responding to a journalist's question on the  Turkish violations yesterday, government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos said:    Yesterday, on the day of our national holiday, there was  really an organized Turkish provocation, with the infringement  of air traffic regulations and violations of the Greek airspace.  The Turkish aircraft were spotted and intercepted by the Greek  Air Force.    It is obvious that certain circles in Turkey want to create  and cultivate a climate of tension. I wonder what they are  after. Could it be that these acts are expedient for internal  political reasons?</p>

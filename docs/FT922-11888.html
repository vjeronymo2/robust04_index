			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Control Data climbs to Dollars 7.7m in quarter CONTROL DATA , the US computer products and services company, yesterday reported higher-than-expected operating results for the first quarter. Its net earnings were boosted by a gain from the formation of a joint venture. First-quarter net earnings amounted to Dollars 7.7m, or 18 cents per share, up from Dollars 7m or 16 cents per share in the same period last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 365.7m, down sharply from Dollars 405.8m in the first quarter of 1991. Of the latest first-quarter results earnings from operations totalled 6 cents per share, Control Data said. There was a net gain of Dollars 5.2m, primarily the result of a cash payment to Control Data by VNU Business Information Systems in connection with the formation of a joint venture company. Results for the same period in 1991 also included earnings from operations of 6 cents per share and a net gain of Dollars 5.4m. The latter included the proceeds of the sale of stock in Seagate, a disk-drive manufacturer, as well as restructuring gains and losses as a result of the consolidation of operations. Explaining the decline in revenues, Control Data said that because of accounting changes the 1991 first quarter included four months of operating results from the international operations of two of its principle business units: Computer Products and Government Systems. Operating results for ongoing businesses, however, showed a modest gain in the first quarter, the company added. 'The information services and government systems businesses performed satisfactorily, but we believe they can do significantly better,' said Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive. Computer Products' open systems revenues have been growing rapidly, but revenues from proprietary computing continue to decline, Mr Perlman added. 'We are cautiously optimistic about Control Data's operating prospects in 1992. 'We need to be operating in a stronger economy for major improvement to occur, but we are not biding our time and waiting for economic recovery.' Control Data's banks have extended its credit and the waiver of the net earnings conditions to the end of June, the company said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Pacific Fleet will launch a second stage of  an operation to fight illegal fishing around June 20, when the  crab and sturgeon season starts, a source in the fleet staff  told Interfax.    During the first stage of the Putina (Fishing Season) '94  operation, begun on April 20, the fleet detained 20 Russian and  four Japanese boats for breaking fishing regulations in the  Russian waters of the Sea of Okhotsk. Altogether more than 100  Russian and over 20 Japanese fishing vessels have been examined.    The commander of the Pacific frontier forces, Vitaliy  Sedykh,  said most of the violations had been made by Russian boats, 20  of the 100 that had been checked either breaking the border zone  regulations or fishing illegally or carrying contraband. Three  boats have been fined for dumping toxic substances into the sea.  Another three were impossible to stop and went off to Japan but  face arrest on their return.    Four naval patrol vessels, five patrol boats of the State  Fishing Committee, 10 aircraft, 33 helicopters and space  monitoring facilities have been involved during stage one of the  operation, which is due to end on May 10 but may be extended.</p>

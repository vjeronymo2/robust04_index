			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Swiss group offers to buy back shares SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance, the Swiss trade and aid inspection group, is offering to buy back for cancellation up to SFr216m (Dollars 154.2m) worth of its bearer shares with a view to reducing its large liquid reserves. The directors revealed at the annual meeting in Geneva yesterday that consolidated net income in the first four months of 1993 was 'slightly lower' than in the same period of last year due to extraordinary gains in 1992. The operating margin was maintained at a satisfactory level. No figures were given. Following the example of EMS-Chemie last month, SGS is proposing to buy back a significant block of its shares. Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, chairman, observed that the group had net liquid reserves of about SFr1bn, representing about a third of its market capitalisation, and that the return on them was declining as interest rates fell. Shareholders will be issued free options for selling their shares at the rate of five options for every bearer share held and one per registered share. They can then sell one bearer share to the company at SFr2,300 for every 100 options held or one registered share at SFr460 for every 20 options held. In both cases, Swiss 35 per cent withholding tax will be deducted at source, so the effective prices are SFr1,530 and SFr306 respectively. The operation differs from that of EMS in that both classes of shareholder are treated equally. EMS made the offer only on its bearer shares, with the result that the voting strength of its registered shares, held entirely by Mr Christoph Blocher, increased to 64 per cent from 53 per cent. The two groups used different methods of ensuring that individual shareholders, for whom the sell back would not be fiscally sensible, could benefit as well.</p>

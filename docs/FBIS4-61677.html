			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday [5 May], the Supreme Council session of  the Republic of Uzbekistan began in Tashkent. The morning  session was opened by Erkin Khalilov, acting chairman of the  Supreme Council of Uzbekistan. The peoples deputies observed a  minute's silence in honor of those people deputies who died  between the sessions. The floor was then given to Islam  Karimov, president of the Republic of Uzbekistan.    In his speech, Islam Abdulghaniyevich informed the  parliamentarians about the work of the leadership of the  Republic for deepening economic reforms. The speaker noted that  good conditions have been formed in the Republic for work on the  new stage of the reforms. The way is now wide open for  developing private property and its legal protection. The  process of removing from state control and privatization is  gaining momentum. The president of the Republic particularly  touched on the question about the development of the social  infrastructure in the countryside. He also talked widely on the  question about the upcoming introduction of the national  currency. The speech also analyzed the foreign economic  activities of the young state. Concluding his speech, Islam  Karimov said that we are looking at the future with great hopes  and our intentions are [words indistinct] and only selfless  effort will bring us [words indistinct].    The Supreme Council of Uzbekistan adopted a decision on the  speech of the president of the Republic. According to this  document, the work carried in the republic for the  stage-by-stage reform of society and transfer to a socially  orientated market economy is approved, and the conditions and  conclusions of the recent speeches by the president of the  Republic of Uzbekistan are supported. They have been adopted  for undeviating implementation and guidance.    The deputies then began the examination of the establishment  of the order of Uzbekistan Kahrimoni [Hero of Uzbekistan] and  the highest order of perfection, the medal Oltin Yulduz [The  Gold Star], the orders Mustakilik [Independence], Dustlik  [Friendship], the medals Jasorat [Courage], and Shuhrat [Glory].  The session approved the orders and medals of the sovereign  state. The president of the republic proposed that in line with  the upcoming Victory Day that the Jasorat medal be awarded to  all participants in the Great Patriotic War and the home front.  The session approved this proposal. At a proposal by a group of  peoples deputies the question of awarding the order Uzbekistan  Kahrimoni to Islam Karimov, president of the Republic of  Uzbekistan was examined. Speaking on this question Vitaliy  Nikolayevich [last name indistinct], peoples deputy and the  director of the Almalyk mining and metallurgical combinat, said:    [Begin Vitaliy recording] Esteemed deputies! The many  thousand miners collective's and gold miners think that the  first citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan ought to receive the  order of Hero of Uzbekistan, Islam Abdulghaniyevich Karimov,  president of the Republic [loud applause]. I think that there  is no doubt here because the services of the president, comrade  Karimov, are well known to the whole world. It is difficult to  count his services here but the most important thing is, and we  must agree on this, that the republic is living in peace and  tranquility. For the sake of this our president [words  indistinct], his health, and as they say with his life. To  confirm my words I will bring you a small example. Exactly  three years ago Islam Abdulghaniyevich decided to start the  production of gold currency in the Republic. Uzbekistan is the  first country to have done this in the CIS after Russia, where  gold currency is produced. It is good that today we adopted the  law on orders. Islam Abdulghaniyevch we congratulate you from  all our heart! [loud applause] Wish you good health! [loud  applause] [end recording]    The Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan then  decided to award Islam Abdulghaniyevich Karimov, president of  the Republic of Uzbekistan, with the title of Uzbekistan  Kahrimoni and the highest order of perfection, the Oltin Yulduz  medal, for outstanding contribution to the creation of the  sovereign and independent Uzbekistan, the creation of a humane,  democratic and legal state, guaranteeing civil peace and  national accord, and for the firmness and courage shown in this.    During the second half of the day the session continued its  work under the chairmanship of Boris Budrov, deputy chairman of  the Supreme Council. The peoples deputies examined a large  number of questions on the agenda. The deputies discussed the  drafts of the constitutional law on the Aliy Majlis of the  Republic of Uzbekistan, the law on elections of peoples deputies  in the oblast, rayon, and city soviets, and on guarantees for  the voting rights of citizens. The deputies adopted a decision  on approving these laws in their first reading.    The peoples deputies listened and discussed the draft laws  on  foreign investments and guaranteeing the activities of foreign  investors, on bankruptcy and taxes, and on operations involving  valuable papers. These laws were confirmed. The session also  adopted in their first reading the code of the Republic of  Uzbekistan on crimes and punishment and the criminal and  procedural code. Today, the 15th session of the 12th  convocation of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan  continues its work.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORTHY'S ARRAIGNMENT IS SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY; HE STILL HAS NO COMMENT  </P> <P> James Worthy's agent, Eric Fleisher, flew here from New York on Friday, a day  after Worthy's arrest in Houston for solicitation of prostitution.  </P> <P> Fleisher said Worthy would hire a lawyer to handle the matter. Worthy is  scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, at which point he would have to enter a plea  but may seek a continuance.  </P> <P> Worthy continued to have no comment.  </P> <P> "I think it's a hard time for him," Fleisher said.  </P> <P> The Lakers released a statement: "It is in everybody's best interest that this  be put into the past as quickly as possible so that James and the Lakers can  get on with their lives. We do not believe any further comment is appropriate."  MARK HEISLER  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Robert Finkelstein, Chief, Systems Support Division, Office of Safety Analysis, Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;2760); Marina C. Appleton, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628); or Jesus Clemente, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Purpose and Structure of the Accident Reporting Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA's primary function is to promote safety within the railroad industry. To carry out its safety mission, FRA needs information about the conditions of the nation's railroads to enforce safety regulations and to develop railroad injury and accident prevention programs. The injury and accident reports submitted by the railroads form a principal basis for FRA's railroad safety program. FRA uses injury and accident data for, among other things, establishing its inspection strategy, determining comparative trends of railroad safety, and calculating the costs and benefits of proposed safety rules. Because FRA uses the data in all aspects of its operations, it is important that the data it receives be as accurate and consistent as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The railroad accident reporting regulations set forth in 49 CFR part 225 require railroads to submit monthly reports to FRA summarizing collisions, derailments, and certain other accidents/incidents involving damages above a periodically revised dollar threshold, as well as certain injuries to passengers, employees, and other persons on railroad property. The regulations presently define an ``accident/incident'' in &sect;225.5(b) as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any impact between railroad on-track equipment and an automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, farm vehicle or pedestrian at a rail-highway grade crossing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation of railroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in more than $6,300 in damages to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, and roadbed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any event arising from the operation of a railroad which results in:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Death of one or more persons;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Injury to one or more persons, other than railroad employees, that requires medical treatment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Injury to one or more employees that requires medical treatment or results in restriction of work or motion for one or more days, one or more lost work days, transfer to another job, termination of employment, or loss of consciousness; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Occupational illness of a railroad employee as diagnosed by a physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 225.19 of the regulations presently divides railroad accidents/incidents into three categories: (1) highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents; (2) rail equipment accidents/incidents; and (3) death, injury, or occupational illness accidents/incidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Every railroad accident/incident meeting the stated criteria for each category must be reported to FRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR 225.11. Because the reporting requirements and the information needed regarding each category of accident/incident are unique, a different reporting form is used for each category. If the circumstances of an accident/incident are such that it falls within two or even all three categories, then a separate reporting form for each category must be completed by the railroad. For example, if a highway-rail grade crossing accident involves damage to rail equipment over the current reporting threshold of $6,300, then both a ``Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.57) and a ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54) must be completed by the reporting railroad. (In order to conform to the grade crossing signal system safety regulations in part 234, the term ``rail-highway'' will be changed to read ``highway-rail'' throughout part 225. This NPRM will hereinafter refer to ``highway-rail'' grade crossings.) Further, if injuries are associated with the crossing accident, then the monthly ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) must also be completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. General Accounting Office Study on Accident Reporting to FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Increasingly concerned with railroad safety, Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to determine whether FRA's safety programs were adequate to protect railroad employees and the general public from injuries associated with train accidents. GAO studied FRA's railroad injury and accident reporting data and issued a report (GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;109) that raised important questions about the quality of railroad compliance with FRA's accident reporting regulations. GAO found that there was underreporting and inaccurate reporting of injury and accident data for 1987 by the railroads it audited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GAO recommended that FRA (a) Require railroads to establish injury and accident reporting internal control procedures, (b) include an analysis of railroads' internal control procedures for reporting in FRA's safety records inspections, (c) provide inspectors with the authority to take enforcement actions against railroads with deficient internal control procedures, (d) require railroads to update reports on workdays lost due to injuries, and (e) clarify FRA's requirement for railroads to update accident reports when significant changes occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA's subsequent analysis of the findings from the 1989 GAO accident and injury reporting audit indicated that most of the missing accident reports were ``fender benders'' and that the unreported injuries were minor. Nonetheless, the accuracy of FRA's safety databases are of paramount importance, and FRA took several actions to improve railroads' accident and injury reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Accident Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 14, 1990, FRA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting comments and suggestions from the public regarding methods of improving FRA's injury and accident reporting system and its governing regulations (55 FR 9469). Interested parties were invited to participate in a public hearing held on May 17, 1990, and to file written comments prior to May 25, 1990. The responses to that public notice provided additional information and identified further issues and subissues related to the matters in the ANPRM. In order to further explore matters related to the accident/incident reporting system, FRA held informal, open meetings on June 13, 1991, August 22, 1991, and August 18, 1992, in Washington, D.C., with members of the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Committee for Uniformity in Reporting. At the request of rail labor representatives, FRA also held an informal, open meeting on October 21, 1991, in Washington, D.C., to discuss the same issues with representatives of various rail unions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to testimony from five organizations at the May 17, 1990 hearing, FRA received comments in response to the ANPRM from over 15 parties including several railroads, railroad unions, railroad trade associations, as well as two States. Discussions follow with respect to the primary issues addressed by the commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Internal Control Procedures (Proposed &sect;225.33)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, GAO concluded that erroneous injury and accident reporting occurred primarily because the railroads it studied lacked adequate internal procedures for properly classifying and reporting the events. GAO believed that under a system of self-reporting such as the one FRA uses to obtain railroad safety data, internal control procedures would be necessary to ensure that reliable and accurate data is obtained, maintained, and disclosed by the railroads. GAO recommended that FRA mandate such internal control procedures, periodically review them, and then use its enforcement authority to cite railroads for procedural deficiencies when inaccurate reporting is found and the cause can be attributed to internal control weakness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

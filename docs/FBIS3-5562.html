President Kim Yong-sam and  his Romanian counterpart Ion Iliescu recognized the necessity of  the two countries working together to maintain and expedite the  current worldwide trends of peace and cooperation.    "They expressed their support for the international  community's efforts to reduce weapons of mass destruction  including the nuclear arsenal, and to prevent their  proliferation," the statement said.    Iliescu, Romania's first popularly elected president,  arrived  in Seoul Wednesday for a three-day visit. He is the first  Romanian president to visit Seoul since the two countries formed  diplomatic relations in 1990.    President Iliescu backed Seoul's efforts to achieve peaceful  reunification of the Korean peninsula, while President Kim  reasserted South Korea's support for political and economic  reforms in Romania as it heads toward creating a democratic  society and market-oriented economy.    President Kim asked Iliescu to back up South Korea's efforts  to become a member of the United Nations Security Council, and  the Romanian president expressed his support for the idea.    The two presidents agreed to encourage investment and  industrial cooperation in conformity with their domestic laws,  and to forge bilateral agreements in such important economic  areas as energy production, including peaceful use of nuclear  energy, electro-technics and electronics, and the automobile and  shipbuilding industries. They also agreed to expand cooperation  in science and technology and to encourage joint research  projects and exchanges of scientists and researchers, and of  information and experience in the promotion of economic reform,  as well as cooperating in professional education and  specialization of economic experts and managers.    "In this regard," the statement said, "both presidents  agreed  to establish the joint committee in conformity with the  agreement on economic, scientific and technical cooperation  signed on Aug. 7, 1990." The committee's first meeting will be  held at an early date deemed agreeable to both sides, according  to the statement.    At the summit meeting, the two presidents exchanged views on  international affairs including the situation in Northeast Asia,  the Korean peninsula and the Balkans, and on ways to expand  bilateral relations.    Iliescu will be the main guest at a state dinner on  Wednesday  night. He is scheduled to meet with leaders from both the  ruling and opposition camps on Thursday.    Romania had been a staunch ally of North Korea until  Iliescu's election as president, and Seoul officials see his  visit as another sign of the Cold War's collapse.</p>

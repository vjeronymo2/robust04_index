			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Israeli government approved a $140-million emergency spending package to  counter economic stagnation and the worst unemployment in 20 years. Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet, meeting in special session, decided that the  extra funds will be spent mainly on labor-intensive projects and investment in  industry. Almost 30% of the money will be spent building new roads or upgrading  existing routes. The Israeli economy has shown no growth in 1989.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Tokyo artist Tomoharu Murakami makes all-black paintings. They have uniformly  firm-textured, raised surfaces somewhat like dried sponges. Of the five  paintings on view, three are identically-sized smaller rectangles and two are  identically-sized larger rectangles. Maybe they are supposed to be understood  as impenetrable thick skins that shut out the vivifying presence of light.  There is surely a deadness about them, a deliberate lock-out of depth coupled  with the false allure of an inflected surface that reveals nothing. Some  earnest person is no doubt writing a long and arid monograph about their  importance to a hermetic corner of contemporary art. More power to him. (James  Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to Aug. 5.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: SCENES FROM A BRADY DECADE  </P> <P> Men and women who were children during the 1970s sometimes seem to have a sort  of collective chip on their shoulders -- and I must admit, they have some  justification for this.  </P> <P> A lot of them think the people who came before them -- Americans who grew up  during the '50s and '60s -- are continually being catered to, with '50s and  '60s nostalgia being dished up at every turn. This is true; there are times  when it seems much of our current popular culture revolves around memories of  life in the Eisenhower Era or the Kennedy Era. The children of the '70s often  say that it seems as if their own youth never existed -- at least judging by  the predominant media images.  </P> <P> Well, the children of the '70s are in luck. Today they can feel superior. One  of their chief cultural icons keeps getting more and more popular -- popping up  in daily conversations, used as punch lines by young comedians, identified as a  benchmark for a certain period of time. And I am here to confess that I know  absolutely nothing about these cultural icons of the '70s.  </P> <P> I refer to the Brady Bunch.  </P> <P> The Brady Bunch, it turns out, were several adults and a houseful of children  who starred in a TV series known, appropriately enough, as "The Brady Bunch."  The Brady family seems to be as familiar to children of the '70s as the Beatles  were to children of the '60s, or as Lucy and Ricky were to children of the  '50s. The Bradys, it is becoming increasingly clear, are a genuine touchstone  for a whole generation.  </P> <P> Yet if the Brady Bunch -- individually or as a family -- were to walk into my  office right this minute, I would not recognize any of them.  </P> <P> I do know a few things about them. As noted, I hear their names in random  conversations almost every day. I know they are planning some kind of a reunion  series. I know that a TV special they did in 1988 -- a reunion special called  "A Very Brady Christmas" -- was such a spectacular success that it was  broadcast again this past Christmas, and even as a rerun, it was the  highest-rated TV program in the country the night it aired. Also, I know that  the theme song from "The Brady Bunch" has been memorized by an entire  generation, and that it contains the word "curls."  </P> <P> And even knowing all this, I do not believe I ever saw a single episode of "The  Brady Bunch." I think I was working that decade.  </P> <P> This is significant. It may mean that the children of the '70s may finally be  getting ready to have their day in the sun. "The Brady Bunch" -- whoever they  were -- are taking over the hearts and memories of Americans who want to think  back to the past with warm pleasure.  </P> <P> I looked up "The Brady Bunch" in a reference book. It seems the show aired on  Friday nights on ABC from September, 1969 to August, 1974 (which explains some  things: Friday nights between 1969 and 1974 did not tend to be a time when a  lot of my contemporaries were home before 2 a.m., never mind watching TV). The  reference book describes the show as "full of well-scrubbed children, trivial  adventures, relentlessly middle-class parents (and) a nutty housekeeper, Alice,  thrown in to act as referee; plus, of course, the family cat and a shaggy dog,  Tiger." The actor who played a Brady son known as "Greg" was someone named  Barry Williams -- I never saw him in my life -- who, according to the reference  book, was such a teen-age idol that he received 6,500 fan letters a week.  </P> <P> I'm not sure any of this needs further comment, except for two things:  </P> <P> If "Brady Bunch reunion" shows are so popular today, try, if you will, to  imagine the concept of a "Married. . .With Children" reunion show 20 years from  now.  </P> <P> And, you know how the mothers in all the family comedies of the '50s and '60s  were supposed to be bland and unsexy -- sort of matronly and prim and dowdy?  Most of them were. But -- and I don't know how we missed it back then -- did  you ever take a real close look at Donna Reed?  </P></p>

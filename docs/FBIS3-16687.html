			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fiammetta Cucurnia report on interview with Defense </F> Minister Pavel Grachev by unidentified reporters in Moscow; date  not given: "Grachev: Russian Army Loyal to Constitution"]    [Text] Moscow -- The reporters examined him carefully, as  though trying to read his most hidden thoughts. They considered  him the key figure in this Moscow again enveloped in a climate  of conspiracies, where there is again talk about troops being on  a state of alert and about coups, as there was three years ago  and again last summer. But Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense  minister, who received his American counterpart William Perry  yesterday morning, announcing that "Moscow will be ready by the  end of March to join the program of cooperation for peace put  forward by NATO," displayed great confidence, made quips, and  tried to play matters down. "As long as I am in charge of the  Army," he said, "there will be no military dictatorship."  According to the general, the real problems facing the Russian  Army, heir to the Red Army, are of a different kind -- a  starvation budget, allocations "entirely insufficient not only  for carrying out any reform but even for ensuring Russia's  security." And it is only because of this, he said, "that I  will struggle."    [LA REPUBBLICA] General Grachev, everyone has been talking  about a coup for weeks now. And Zhirinovskiy even went as far  as to suggest a date -- by the summer. What do you think?    [Grachev] I have heard enough about this business of a coup.  We must stop fighting, otherwise soon we will not have anything  left to eat. Now is the time to build. But I understand your  question. You want to know what the Army would do in the event  of a coup. And I will tell you that we are impartial. The Army  makes a stand, as you have seen, only if it fears the start of a  civil war. It cannot permit that. But as for the rest --  protests, disorder, demonstrations, or whatever else -- never:  There are other bodies that must deal with that.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And yet we often hear it said that amid so  much chaos, in order to avert the worst and to try to govern the  transitional stage without bloodshed, the possibility of a  "government of discipline," with the Army's backing, may not be  such a remote one.    [Grachev] I think that the military must do its job and  nothing more. It seems to me that absolutely nothing good can  be expected if the Army starts leading the economy or  agriculture. As long as I am defense minister, there will be no  military dictatorships, and we will honor the Constitution.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In the corridors of Parliament there are  rumors circulating that Moscow's garrisons have been on a state  of alert for several days. What can you tell us in this regard?    [Grachev] That it is nonsense. Around Moscow there are only  two major units that can really be placed on a state of alert  and used for a military operation. They are the Tamanskaya and  the Kantimirovskiya. The other troops are still at the training  stage. So it is very easy to check how matters stand.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You said that the Army's real major problem  in the present stage is an economic one, which threatens to have  serious political developments. Could you explain that to us  better?    [Grachev] I will simply tell you that the Finance Ministry  has planned an allocation for military expenditures more or less  equivalent to 46-47 percent of what we are asking for. I do not  want to make any threats, nor do I intend to humiliate myself by  begging. At government meetings I put forward concrete figures  so that it is clear where such a policy could lead us. Our  budget for 1994 was corrected in an attempt to tackle, first,  the social problems of 120,000 homeless officers, thousands of  people without jobs. This will consume 56 percent of our  resources. At the same time, we cannot reduce beyond a certain  point cash expenditure on technological and military  modernization. But unless the Finance Ministry yields, we will  be able to purchase only 25 percent of the weapons planned,  which means the collapse of the military industries and an army  of unemployed men. Not to mention scientific research. It would  be really unfair to level charges of excessive militarization  now. We are asking for the minimum. This, because we are now  very close to the threshold that cannot be crossed, from the  viewpoint of the country's security and of the social problems  within the Armed Forces.    [LA REPUBBLICA] General Grachev, you often talk abut the  need  to have a smaller Army, but one composed of "professionals."  However, many people accuse you of being rather slow in  implementing this reform. It is as though, after an initial  stage of demoralization, Russia were again thinking about a  policy of domination.    [Grachev] We no longer need 4-5 million men under arms now.  But there is a limit that it is dangerous to exceed when you are  concerned about the country's security interests and social  problems. This year we made reductions of 200,000, not 400,000,  as some would have liked. In general, specialists are agreed  that the Russian Army must have at least 1.9 million soldiers.  No more, but no less either, keeping in mind our country's  special geopolitical situation. At present we have only 120,000  men bound to the Army by contract.</p>

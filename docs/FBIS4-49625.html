			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] To speed up our country's entry into GATT, a senior  Council of Agriculture official disclosed yesterday [6 May]:  Our country may offer a concrete response at the Sino-U.S.  consultations scheduled for 12 May on lifting controls on 21  sensitive agricultural products, including chicken, chopped  cooked animal entrails, red beans, and peanuts. Moreover, our  country does not exclude the possibility of promising to further  adjust the size of tariff reductions, with which the U.S. side  is dissatisfied.    Our country's delegation to GATT consultations will leave by  plane for the United States next Tuesday [10 May] to begin the  second round of bilateral GATT consultations with the U.S. side.  Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade has completed the plan for  categorizing import goods, which will go into effect on 1 July.  On that day, 92 percent of the goods on our country's import  categorization list will be allowed into the country without  licenses, bringing to 2 percent the proportion of goods subject  to import restrictions. By taking this action, Taiwan will  truly move toward export and import liberalization.</p>

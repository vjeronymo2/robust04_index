			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / A test for the catastrophe theory of lending: The risks that follow a US banking revival Is this an accident waiting to happen? First-half results from the biggest US commercial banks have confirmed their rapid return to financial health, leaving them among the best-capitalised banks in the world. Recent history, though, has shown the banks to be profligate users of their shareholders' capital - from lending to lesser developed countries at the start of the 1980s to the credit-driven boom in property and corporate deals at the end of it. The fashionable sport for observers of US banking now is to spot where the next disaster will come from. The banks' recuperation, revealed by their second-quarter figures, has been faster than most analysts expected. With US property prices bottoming out, and improved profitability and lower debt levels among their corporate customers, the overall asset quality of most banks has turned markedly upwards. Total non-performing loans held by the 42 big US banks followed by Ibca, the UK-based bank rating agency, fell by Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 2.21bn) during the second quarter. At Dollars 31.1bn, troubled loans are nearly a third lower than a year ago. It will take some time to clear the decks. At the end of June, the banks were also sitting on property with a written-down value of Dollars 14.2bn. Banks such as Citicorp (which accounts for Dollars 3.5bn of this) have said they will sell only when they can realise favourable prices. The improvement in the quality of bank assets was reflected in lower provisions to cover potential credit losses. Added to high lending margins - the average is still about 4 per cent - and record profits from trading in foreign exchange and other markets, this boosted earnings. The Dollars 5.8bn of after-tax profits made by the 42 banks covered by Ibca was Dollars 2bn more than in the second quarter of 1992, further strengthening capital ratios. Even Citicorp, recently the stumbling giant of US banking, managed a tier one capital ratio of 5.7 per cent at the end of June, up from 4.25 per cent. Others strengthened what were already respectable capital levels compared with the internationally agreed minimum of 4 per cent: BankAmerica reached a tier one level of 6.9 per cent and the rest of the top 10 banks achieved more than 7 per cent. But will this renewed balance-sheet health herald another stampede into risky lending? So far, the signs are that both the banks and their customers are more cautious this time around. 'The tendency is to go from one extreme to the other,' says Mr Bill Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank. Individual lending officers are prone to be over-cautious after recent loan-loss experience. Mr Richard Boyle, vice chairman in charge of credit policy at Chase Manhattan, agrees. 'Risk appetite is going to be a bit abated. The hurdle for acceptability of credit is higher than when this cycle started.' There is also a lack of demand for loans. With economic recovery proceeding at a slow pace, companies have yet to build up stocks so keeping a lid on their financing requirements. Federal Reserve figures bear this out. In June, banks' commercial and industrial loans averaged Dollars 594bn, a slight recovery after a steady decline in the six months to March, but still below year-ago levels. Bank lending has picked up in the states that have seen the quickest return to economic health. NationsBank, the North Carolina-based bank which has vaulted by acquisition into the top five, reported 'accelerating loan growth' at the end of the quarter, with loan balances up by more than 10 per cent on a year earlier. At Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, new residential mortgages and consumer loans helped push up lending at an annualised rate of 14 per cent. For banks which lend to large companies, loan growth may not return even with economic recovery. The first six months of this year saw US companies borrowing Dollars 216bn through the securities markets - nearly three-quarters as much as they borrowed in the whole of 1992, a record year for debt issuance. Not surprisingly, a growing number of US commercial banks have been pushing for powers to underwrite securities transactions. NationsBank recently became only the third, after JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, to be given access to both the debt and equity markets. Chase, Chemical and Citicorp can underwrite only debt securities. Starved of loan business, banks have been adding to their holdings of US government bonds. During June these holdings averaged Dollars 701bn. This mountain of bonds is now equal to a third of the banks' total lending. With the US yield curve remaining steep, banks can make an easy turn sitting on long-dated Treasuries and funding their positions with short-term money. A sharp change in the shape of the yield curve as the recovery gathers pace could eat into this income stream. It could also leave some banks sitting on big capital losses - though it would be surprising if they had not hedged part of their holdings. So where might the next disaster to hit US banks come from? A change in the yield curve is one possibility. Another, according to the more sceptical observers, is the derivatives markets - one of the few areas where banks are taking on additional credit exposure. The banking industry shrugged off such fears in a report published by the Group of 30 last month. The dull truth is that there may be no disaster waiting to happen - but no big new source of profits growth either. With domestic lending suppressed, international ambitions clipped and the US securities markets largely beyond their ambit, income growth could be negligible. That will put greater pressure on big banks to cut costs and, maybe, to continue the wave of mergers which has begun to eat into the sector's overcapacity. It may sound dull, but after the traumas of the past decade, few bank chairmen will complain about that.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASSIC SANTANA: UNRETIRED AND RELIABLY INSPIRED  </P> <P> When Santana released its career-retrospective triple-album "Viva Santana!" in  1988, with a corresponding tour, Carlos Santana promised that the  Latin-jazz-rock fusion band would thereafter "call it a day, at least for a  while." Explained the guitarist at the time, "I don't want to just crank out  'Black Magic Woman' and 'Jingo' in the future."  </P> <P> Spoken like a true pop veteran, a la Sinatra or Bowie or Elton, and broken just  like one too. A year and a half later, guess who's back on tour. And what's  still being cranked out.  </P> <P> No one was heard objecting to this backtracking, of course, among the full  house Friday night at the Greek Theatre (the first of three nights there for  Santana), and there was not much reason to: The outfit's nearly three-hour set  is always reliably inspired from year to year -- with even the oldest material  sounding more fired up than cranked out -- and the live blend of styles,  whatever might be happening on the band's albums, is usually scarcely subject  to the shifting vagaries of new musical tastes.  </P> <P> As it happens, the current album, "Spirits Dancing in the Flesh," while  typically overproduced, adheres more closely to a classic Santana sound than  some of the band's compromised '80s LPs, and the set included the bulk of the  album, with vocal numbers sung smoothly and solidly by Alex Ligertwood.  </P> <P> The funky remake of the Isleys' "That Lady" (given a modern, black-dance beat  and retitled "Who's That Lady") and the ballad treatment of Curtis Mayfield's  "Gypsy Woman" by no means count among the group's more memorable moments but  provided diverting enough pop turns amid the instrumental stretches that  account for at least 75% of a Santana show.  </P> <P> New material aside, all that's markedly different about Santana these days is  that the hair is bundled into ponytails, keyboard player Chester Thompson does  a little bit of sampling and the wacky weed smell among the crowd isn't quite  so choking. In many more ways a Santana concert still seems the quintessential  '70s experience, preserved as carefully as a museum piece, complete with  unabashed emphasis on mind expansion through soloing.  </P> <P> Really, though, it's the quintessential '90s concert happening, at least for  L.A., given our shifting demographics: Carlos Santana remains the foremost  enduring music hero for rock-era Latinos, as well as a guitar hero for the  masses, and the group's local shows are as genuinely integrated an experience  as it's possible to have right now.

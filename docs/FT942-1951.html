			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US merchandise exports decline Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, yesterday reported a decline in US merchandise exports for last month, writes Our Foreign Staff. Noting that the US trade position had deteriorated in every major foreign market area except Latin America, he cited lower shipments of non-monetary gold as a big factor in last month's decline. Analysts have attributed the trend to business cycle factors. The secretary said the US trade balance in services, led by travel expenditures, improved last month while the deficit in goods deteriorated.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREEDERS CROWN HARNESS RACES TONIGHT  </P> <P> The Breeders Crown, a series of eight rich harness races, will be held tonight  at Pompano Park, which is in the same South Florida area where the thoroughbred  game will run its Breeders' Cup a week from Saturday at Gulfstream Park.  </P> <P> The harness horse-of-the-year title won't be settled here, because Matt's  Scooter won an earlier Breeders Crown race and is favored to finish first in  the voting. Four Breeders Crown races were held at other tracks in September.  </P> <P> Matt's Scooter is also expected to be voted pacer of the year. Peace Corps  could add to her credentials for trotter of the year by winning tonight's  $335,701 3-year-old Filly Trot. She will break from No. 7 in an eight-horse  field and will be driven by John Campbell, who has won a record 12 Breeders  Crown races since the series started in 1984. BILL CHRISTINE  </P></p>

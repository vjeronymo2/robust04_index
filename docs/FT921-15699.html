			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips consolidate gains but indicator sets new high Wall Street ALTHOUGH secondary stocks powered to new highs yesterday, there was little movement in the broader market, where share prices were mixed as investors consolidated some of the big gains earned during the recent rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.70 at 3,204.83, a new record for the blue chip indicator. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.56 at 417.40, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks reached yet another all-time peak, ending 4.39 higher at 602.29. Turnover on the New York SE remained heavy, totalling 253m shares. The Dow has risen almost 300 points in the past two weeks, and therefore it came as no surprise when the rally ran out of steam in the first two days of this week. As for whether the impressive winning streak had been broken completely or just interrupted, the balance of opinion among analysts was that further, if less spectacular, gains would be made over the coming weeks. Meanwhile, demand for secondary, growth-oriented issues showed no signs of abating. Compaq rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 34 in active trading after the computer group said worldwide orders for its portable 486C personal computer had exceeded expectations. This rare piece of good news from the computer industry lifted others in the sector, with IBM climbing Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 94 5/8 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 60 1/4 . Sbarro jumped Dollars 5 3/8 or 14 per cent to Dollars 44 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange after Morgan Stanley, the broking house, upgraded its rating on the shares and put the Italian restaurant chain on its list of recommended growth stocks. Sears slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 after the giant stores group announced that it was cutting 7,000 jobs from its workforce, although the company said the plan would not involve any lay-offs. Gap, one of the few successful retailers during the recession, fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/2 after Goldman Sachs was reported to have crossed a block of 1.9m shares at a price of Dollars 56 3/4 . On the over-the-counter market, Bioplasty declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 4 3/4 in a delayed reaction to Monday's decision by the Food and Drug Administration to urge doctors to stop using silicone breast implants until new information on their safety was assessed. Bioplasty is one of the main producers of the implants, as is Mentor which, after falling sharply on Monday, recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4 . DNA Plant Technology soared Dollars 4 to Dollars 8 1/2 on news of a venture with Du Pont which is supplying a new form of Canola oil to the snack food business of Anheuser-Busch. Canada TORONTO declined in moderate trading, with gold stocks leading the way. The composite index ended 11.8 off at 3,512.9 and falls held an edge over rises by 316 to 297. Volume came to 27.4m shares, up from Monday's 22m. Ten of 14 stock groups closed lower, with the gold group down 1.6 per cent. Placer Dome, the most heavily weighted stock in the group, dipped CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 11 1/2 . The pipelines group had the day's biggest increase, 1.6 per cent. Silcorp 'A' jumped 50 cents to CDollars 2.50. The company said it has agreed to sell its Quebec convenience store assets to Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc for an undisclosed sum.</p>

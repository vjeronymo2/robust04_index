			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Fifty cable television  stations proposed to the government Friday average monthly fees  of 11,580 won (14.27 U.S. dollars).    Charges will vary by region and number of channels, but the  stations in general agree on between 10,000 won and 12,000 won a  month. One-time subscription fees, however, vary from 10,000  won in Haeundae, Pusan, to 105,000 won in northwestern Pusan,  and average 50,000 won.    Subscribers can tune into 20 channels that range from  YONHAP's 24-hour news channel to film and sports as 46 stations  have said they will carry all 20 channels. The four other  incorporated stations, including one in Kwanak-ku, Seoul, will  carry 16 channels, excluding women, music, education and culture  channels.    Local channels proposed transmitting local information eight  and half hours a day on average, with a regional difference of  between one and 15 hours.    The 50 stations predicted subscription rates at 11.33  percent  next year, the first year of cable television, rising to 25.3  percent by 1997.    Total capital averages 3.3 billion won with the minimum 2.5  billion won in Inchon and maximum 8 billion won in Chongno and  central Seoul.    The stations projected a surplus by 1998 and losses covered  some time after 2001.    Most of them said they will not sell advertising at first,  but will consider between 5 percent and 50 percent of air time  later.    They said they will use Korean equipment 73.7 percent on  average. The Information Ministry announced the 50 final  stations after a second screening based on public interest and  broadcasting ability.</p>

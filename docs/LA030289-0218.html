			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW FORECASTING GAUGE TO DEBUT; ANALYSTS SKEPTICAL  </P> <P> The government on Friday will issue a new version of its much-maligned chief  economic forecasting gauge, but skeptical private analysts expect little  improvement in the monthly report's track record.  </P> <P> The index of leading economic indicators -- sometimes derided by its critics as  the index of misleading indicators -- is designed to foretell future economic  activity by evaluating forward-pointing business statistics.  </P> <P> Government policy makers and private investors watch the index closely for  indications of strength or weakness in the U.S. economy as much as six months  in the future.  </P> <P> Using data information to 1948, the composite index has correctly predicted all  eight recessions by dropping for at least three months in a row, but it also  forecast four recessions that never materialized.  </P> <P> January's report, to be issued Friday, will drop two of 11 components from the  index, revise two others and feature two new indicators of economic activity.  </P> <P> Larry Moran, a spokesman for the government's Bureau of Economic Analysis, said  today that the changes will make the index less prone to after-the-fact  revision, less apt to make false predictions of future downturns and more  precise at predicting when downturns will occur.  </P> <P> "This index is so good that it has predicted 12 of the last eight recessions,"  he quipped. "The new index will be less inclined to give us false signals. We  hope it will be better at telling us when they (downturns) are going to occur."  </P></p>

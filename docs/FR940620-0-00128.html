			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.2.2&blank;New Construction: Dispersion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This provision requires that accessible dwelling units be dispersed throughout a facility so as to provide people with disabilities the housing choices comparable to and integrated with those available to other members of the public. The provision also requires certain factors to be considered when dispersing accessible units. These factors include: vertical dispersion in buildings where elevators are provided; unit size; rental or sale price; amenities provided within dwelling units; and the availability and proximity of amenities serving dwelling units. In addition, when units of different size in terms of number of bedrooms are provided, at least one of each such unit must be accessible. This provision may necessitate that the minimum number of units required to be accessible by 13.2.1(1) be exceeded. Additionally, if the minimum number has not been met, units shall be dispersed throughout the facility according to the number of bedrooms provided to the maximum extent feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM asked whether there were overriding factors which are more significant than a dispersed location for certain types of facilities. Commenters were also asked whether accessible units should be located close to entrances, amenities such as parking, or common use areas. Most commenters supported the dispersion provisions included in this section. They expressed a number of preferences for the location of accessible units including: proximity to parking, recreation, and laundry facilities; more secure areas; and more remote and secluded areas. A few commenters noted that clustering accessible units in large facilities with centrally located amenities may be preferable to dispersing them in a manner that would not necessarily provide greater geographic separation between units but would result in great travel distances to those amenities for some occupants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters were concerned that dispersion according to unit configuration would force construction of accessible multi-story dwelling units where multi-story units such as townhouses are provided. Similarly, others were concerned that a requirement for dispersion according to configuration would be interpreted strictly and that accessible units would be required to have exactly the same footprint as inaccessible units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed requirement that units be dispersed according to configuration has been deleted. Multi-story dwelling unit construction is not uncommon and dispersion according to unit configuration could limit viable design solutions such as constructing one ``flat'' unit between two multi-story units. Provided that the single-story unit includes the same elements and spaces as the multi-story unit, it is an acceptable design. In light of commenters' diverse preferences, especially concerning the location of accessible dwelling units, the guidelines generally do not limit or restrict the method used to achieve dispersion except that vertical dispersion must be considered in elevator buildings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.2.3&blank;Alterations: Minimum Number and Dispersion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 13.2.3(1) provides that the minimum number of dwelling units required to be accessible be based on the requirements of 13.2.1 in relation to the total number of units being altered. This requirement remains in effect and applies to each subsequent alteration until such time as the total number of accessible dwelling units required by ADAAG 13.2.1 for the entire facility is achieved. An appendix note illustrates this requirement. ADAAG 13.2.3(2) takes into account that existing conditions or the scope of the alteration may limit full dispersion of accessible units throughout the facility. This provision only requires altered units that are made accessible to be dispersed to the maximum extent feasible in accordance with ADAAG 13.2.2. An appendix note clarifies that merely replacing an oven is not generally considered an alteration, unless the oven in an accessible apartment is replaced. In that case, the oven must meet the requirements of ADAAG 13.3.4(7) (Ovens). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Few comments were received for this section. Most of the commenters were concerned with the application of these guidelines to renovation of older existing single-family dwellings. The State of New York Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities noted that accessible features ``result in an `institutional looking' home''. They were concerned that such homes would not serve the goal of community integration of people with developmental disabilities. Further, some commenters expressed concern that the cost of complying with these guidelines would limit the selection of homes purchased for renovation. A commenter requested assurance that the provisions of ADAAG 4.1.7 are applicable to renovations of historic properties such as a governor's residence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> References in this provision to proposed ADAAG 13.5 (Dwelling Units Accessible to Persons with Vision Impairments) have been removed because that reserved section has been deleted. As regards aesthetics, application of these guidelines does not necessarily result in institutional looking facilities. Architects and designers have demonstrated the ability to incorporate accessible features in a manner that reflects the overall style of the neighboring community. A number of factors must be considered in the selection of homes purchased for renovation. Although certain styles of existing dwellings lend themselves more readily to renovations for accessibility, ADAAG contains no requirement that these be selected. In fact, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) contains an exception from full compliance with these guidelines if alteration work is technically infeasible. Additionally, the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA require that alterations to each facility covered under title II be made in a manner that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, to the maximum extent feasible. See 28 CFR 35.151(b). Renovation of historic properties is covered in ADAAG 4.1.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3&blank;Requirements for Accessible Dwelling Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.3.1&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.3.2&blank;Minimum Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides that dwelling units required to be accessible by ADAAG 13.2.1(1) shall comply with ADAAG 13.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.2(1)&blank;Ancillary Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision applies the requirements of ADAAG 4.1 through 4.35 to those spaces and facilities serving accessible dwelling units which comply with 13.2.1(1). These include entry walks, trash disposal facilities, storage areas, and mail boxes. Few comments were received on this provision. However, a change has been made to clarify that these requirements apply only to fully accessible dwelling units and not to those accessible only to persons with hearing impairments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

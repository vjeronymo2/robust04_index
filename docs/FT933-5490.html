			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Islamic parties call strike in Karachi BUSINESS and corporate life in Karachi, Pakistan's largest commercial city, came to a halt yesterday, in response to a strike called by the Pakistan Islamic Front - a coalition of Islamic political parties, Farhan Bokhari reports from Islamabad. Public transport was shut down forcing shopkeepers, labourers and port workers to stay at home. There was only thin trading at the Karachi Stock Exchange, Pakistan's leading stock market. The strike was called to protest at economic reforms announced by Prime Minister Moeen Qureshi. Islamic leaders claim that the recent devaluation of the rupee and a 21 per cent petrol price rise this year have 'intensified miseries for the common man'. Elsewhere in Pakistan, the response was partial. In Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, some shops were closed, but most businesses and public transport were unaffected. It was not clear last night if yesterday's events would encourage the Islamic leaders to step up their campaign.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: FRENCH PRICES UP BUT DEMAND HEADS SOUTH  </P> <P> If you think prices for French wines are excessive, you're not alone. Even  fine-wine collectors, people who don't raise an eyebrow at a $100 price tag,  agree.  </P> <P> According to an informal poll of major wine merchants in the Los Angeles area  -- considered to be the most important wine market in the United States -- the  weakness of the dollar against the franc, the number of excellent recent  vintages and a lot of full wine cellars have combined to force down demand for  expensive wines drastically.  </P> <P> "The market for expensive wines? There is no market, as far as I can see," says  Steve Wallace, owner of Wally's on Westwood Boulevard, one of the Westside's  top wine merchants. "The people who usually buy these wines, the collectors --  their cellars are full. There is only a small group of people I call 'the  players,' and they have seen so many good vintages in the last decade they're  getting tired of the hype."  </P> <P> He says savvy buyers find older wines at auctions at attractive prices. "You  can find Second Growth Bordeaux for under $300 a case," he says.  </P> <P> Larry Seiple at the Wine House in West Los Angeles says the big buyers are  dying off. At a recent wine auction, he says, "I saw a number of the 'big  players' in Los Angeles. They are not players anymore, not involved in the  market except as casual sippers. Their cellars are full, and they are selling  their wines at auction." Newer buyers, he says, are more tentative in their  purchases.  </P> <P> Futures for the highly praised 1989 Bordeaux are selling slower than in other  past vintages, when the wines also were rated as being excellent, merchants  say. (In a futures purchase, buyers agree to make a down payment for wine they  will take possession of in a year or 18 months, when it is released. Usually,  such wines are not tasted by the buyer before they are bought.)  </P> <P> "Without even tasting a wine, people will say: 'I have to have that label,' "  says Tom Burke, a Los Angeles attorney and major wine collector. "Isn't that  silly?  </P> <P> "People buy wines they think are going to appreciate in value instead of laying  them down to drink. They say, 'In 10 years this will be worth $200 a bottle  more than I paid for it.' Sure, and I remember too well the people who bought  the '69s only to find out that the wines were terrible."  </P> <P> Burke says futures prices are too high; often the same wine will be available  at a lower price when it hits the shelves. His advice is: "Take money and put  it in a CD (certificate of deposit) and if you want the wine in a decade, you  can still find it. It's amazing how many wines you can find on the secondary  market. You can find high-quality Bordeaux from the 1970 vintage at a lower  price than today's new releases."  </P> <P> "Futures these days are a poor purchase," says Bob Golbahar of Bel Air Wine  Merchant. "About 50% (of the sale of futures) is hype and 25% is price: People  see the price of what some older vintages are selling for and they get excited.  </P> <P> "But I'd say that 30% or 40% of the people who are buying wine today started  with the 1982 Bordeaux, which have gone up in price, and they think prices are  going to continue to rise. And I think the first vintage that it won't happen  with is 1989."  </P> <P> He says that if the franc, now trading at less than five to the dollar, should  reach seven to the dollar, the price of French wine not yet shipped here would  drop in price. But even if that doesn't occur, he says, "I think you'll see  prices coming back"; some dealers in Bordeaux "are holding the '89s and they  will start dumping them if they don't sell them."  </P> <P> Despite the acclaim 1989 Bordeaux red wines have received, some merchants  believe the vintage may not be all it's supposed to be.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely concerned about the (1989) vintage," says Keith Perez of  Northridge Hills Wine and Spirits. "I think some customers are going to taste  the wines and wonder if they are worth this kind of money. The fact that people  (from Bordeaux) have alluded to technical problems (with the wines) is a red  flag. When they say the acidities are a little out of balance, well, that  reminds me a little of 1982, and a lot of my customers are asking me to buy  those wines back from them."  </P> <P> In fact, merchants say, so many wine collectors' cellars are full they are  trying to turn them into cash.  </P> <P> "People always want the new thing," says Golbahar. "They forget what they have  in their cellars. Then, after they buy the new stuff, they start selling their  old wines. We're being offered a lot of '85 Bordeaux. That's why I see little  market for '88 Bordeaux, and we didn't buy any futures of '89s; we don't see  any interest in them. And all the stores that did buy them are just sitting  with them."  </P> <P> Burke, who owns a home in France, says the typical wine buyer doesn't drink all  that is bought: "You like to buy wine, and you're obsessed with buying it, so  years later there's some solace if it's (worth) $100 a bottle more than you  paid for it. But the auction houses are selling off cellars from people who are  deceased, who amassed huge collections and who died with the corks still in.  What a tragedy."  </P> <P> Sharp says he has been offered "a lot of wine from private collectors, a lot  more than before." Other merchants are buying private cellars too.  </P> <P> Ed Masciana, wine buyer for Bristol Farms, sees no real slowdown in the sale of  expensive wines, though he admits he's working harder to maintain them.  </P> <P> "When business is down like this, a lot of wine shops don't promote. But our  dollar volume is up in the last month, and that's because we've been more  conscientious going after our loyal customers. We've done more advertising,  sent out more flyers. And we've been selling a lot of Italian wines."  </P> <P> Masciana says Bristol Farms doesn't offer futures on wine. "There so much of  that available. If you tie up your money a year before you get the wine, you're  entering into a competitive market where everybody is beating the daylights out  of each other. Besides, we're buying private cellars and selling 1982s and  1985s at less than the pre-offer prices. I have 1982 Mouton for $125 a bottle.  I bought it from a collector. I remember buying that wine at $140 a bottle,  wholesale, just a year ago."  </P> <P> Seiple at Wine House and Dale Sharp at Red Carpet in Glendale have sold a lot  of Bordeaux futures for 1989, but both said they had to beat drums to do so.  </P> <P> "We sold a lot of wine in May, June and July, when the futures first came out,"  Sharp says. "It was based on all the hype -- you know, 'vintage of the  century.' "  </P> <P> Sales of expensive Burgundy wines, including those of Domaine de la  Romanee-Conti (DRC) are off as well, merchants say. There was so little  response to the initial offering of 1988 DRC wines that the West Coast  representative for DRC, Wilson-Daniels Ltd., held a summit meeting with top  wine shops in Los Angeles to find out why. On a futures purchase, the DRC wines  had a suggested retail price of nearly $4,000 for a mixed case of the various  vineyard wines. (The suggested retail price for a mixed case of the 1986 and  1987 wines was $2,200 last year.)  </P> <P> Wallace says he wrote letters to two dozen of the top Burgundy buyers, offering  them some of the finest red Burgundies in the world, including the DRC wines,  at cost plus 10%, and had no response. Golbahar says he mailed fliers to 2,000  wine buyers offering high-end Burgundies at prices barely above cost and had  about 10 responses. "I think they've priced them for the Japanese market,"  Golbahar says.  </P> <P> Jack Daniels of Wilson-Daniels says sales of the DRC wines have been "good, not  great. It's been slower than in past years, but that's a combination of things.  We came out earlier with them this year, during the holidays, and then the  wines are higher priced because it was an outstanding vintage, probably the  best they ever made. Now, combine that with the weak dollar and our economy. .  . .  </P> <P> "But overall, the entire wine business has softened quite a bit. Even our most  popular items are slowing down."  </P> <P> Sharp says some red wines -- such as those of George Mugneret, Leroy, Jayer and  Meo-Camuzet -- are so limited, he had more orders than he had wine to sell. He  adds, "White Burgundies are dead too, with the exception of three or four  producers, like Ramonet, Leflaive and Sauzet. There is big price resistance  because buyers remember when they were $20 to $40 a bottle, and now they are  $60 to $200 a bottle."  </P> <P> Moreover, merchants say the market for futures on high-end California wine  appears flat too. "California futures is a bogus market," says Seiple. "People  are not as interested in it as they were a few years ago. It was all based on  limited supply, but it hasn't worked out that way."  </P> <P> Perez at Northridge Hills adds: "I think people are being a lot more selective.  A couple of years ago, a good wine selling for $125 would have sold. Now  there's resistance. People are trading down and saying, 'Let's look for the  value.' "  </P> <P> He says this is a new phenomenon for Los Angeles. "(Wine buyers in) San  Francisco and New York have a long history of buying fine Burgundy, and with  them price was a major factor." In Los Angeles, he says, it hasn't been a major  factor until now.  </P></p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Ministers to back bill on leases The government is set to back a Conservative MP's bill to change the law of privity of contract in England and Wales in a move which could mean that reforms to commercial leases are enacted as early as this summer. The bill - being prepared by Mr Peter Thurnham, Tory MP for Bolton North East - would abolish the convention, peculiar to England and Wales, by which an original tenant in a commercial property lease is liable to pay the rent if a subsequent tenant defaults. The Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday that the government would support any private member's bill that was close to its own proposals. Mr Thurnham said he was confident that his bill - which would be drafted 'very shortly' - would receive 'very strong backing from all sides of the House of Commons'. It has long been the government's intention to reform this aspect of the law but ministers have been unable to find the parliamentary time needed for a bill to be enacted. Business leaders have been prominent among those calling for change. Earlier this month Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, cited a bill reforming privity of contract as an example of the type of legislation - helpful to the business community - that he would like to see ministers accommodate in the parliamentary timetable. Parliamentary procedures make it far from certain that Mr Thurnham's bill will reach the statute book even if it is backed by ministers. Private member's bills can be blocked by the opposition of one MP. Opposition is expected to the change on the grounds that limiting a tenant's responsibility for paying rent throughout a lease is likely to reduce the security of a building's income and so the value of a landlord's investment.</p>

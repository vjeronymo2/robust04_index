Security Council for discussion,  Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said. Christopher made the  call in talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in reference to  North Korea's suspected nuclear development program and ongoing  inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities, the  officials said.    Hata told Christopher that Japan will fulfill its role as a  member of the United Nations in such a case, and gave high marks  to Washington's "tenacious" negotiations with Pyongyang, they  said. The two men agreed in the meantime to continue  cooperation to solve problems regarding North Korea's alleged  nuclear weapons program, the officials said.    North Korea announced a year ago that it would withdraw from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) but suspended the  decision after negotiations with the United States.    Late last month, Pyongyang said it will allow inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of seven of its  nuclear facilities and the IAEA inspectors entered Pyongyang on  March 1.    Washington and Pyongyang are scheduled to hold a third round  of high-level talks beginning March 21 in Geneva on the  condition that North Korea comply with a four-point accord that  includes successful completion of the nuclear inspections.    Christopher arrived in Tokyo from Australia on Wednesday on  the second leg of a three-nation tour which also takes him to  China on Friday.    The secretary of state urged Japanese support in pushing  China's leadership to improve its human rights record, the  officials said. Christopher told Hata that the U.S. considers  improvement in China's human rights record as an important  condition to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status to  Beijing.    Hata noted that Japan has been urging China to improve its  human rights record.    Christopher and Hata both expressed concern over the recent  emergence of ultranationalists in Russia, the officials said.    Christopher said he does not think a spy scandal involving a  high-ranking CIA official will affect U.S.-Russian ties in the  long term, they said. He also said Washington welcomes Moscow's  initiative in the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    On Friday, Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank  Wisner will hold "two-plus-two" security talks with Hata and  Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi.    Christopher is scheduled to deliver a speech before Japanese  business leaders later the same day.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Premier makes music in a minor key: The UK leader's visit was cordial if unexciting MR JOHN MAJOR came to Washington to make friends. He left yesterday convinced that during his first encounter with President Bill Clinton he had made a start. The British prime minister could not claim that his visit had stirred the excitement of a Washington establishment preoccupied with the new administration's domestic programme. For its part, the local media's interest in Britain this week has focused on the murder in Liverpool of two-year-old James Bulger rather than on the warmth of Mr Major's reception at the White House. Nor did several hours of talks with Mr Clinton yield any diplomatic breakthroughs on the issues facing the US and Europe. The days have gone when Republican presidents and Conservative prime ministers would jointly pre-empt the decisions of their allies. But for Mr Major the trip had a limited objective. He had to prove that he could get on with a Democratic president; that British influence in Washington had not vanished with the departure of Mr George Bush; and that Mr Clinton would not seek retribution for the help offered by the Conservatives to the Bush campaign. The president's calculated generosity during their joint appearance at the White House allowed Mr Major to claim he had succeeded. Mr Clinton deferred to Mr Major's greater experience of foreign policy issues. He went out of his way to underline his commitment to the transatlantic 'special relationship'. He reminded reporters that he was one of only two presidents who had lived in England. To the visible relief of Mr Major's entourage he made light of the British government's decision during the presidential campaign to rummage through his Home Office files for evidence of youthful wrongdoing. For his part, Mr Major suppressed his private doubts about the US decision to air-drop supplies into eastern Bosnia, declaring it a 'brave' and 'imaginative' initiative. He also heaped lavish praise on Mr Clinton's programme to reduce the US budget deficit. It is not often that you hear Conservative prime ministers offering plaudits for tax increases. There was none of the natural chemistry apparent during Mr Major's meetings with Mr George Bush or the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's encounters with Mr Ronald Reagan. But the prime minister had already scaled back once extravagant claims for the relationship. And Mr Clinton, side-stepping awkward questions about Northern Ireland and playing down differences over trade issues, had clearly decided there was nothing to be gained from a public snub. The substance of the two leaders' discussions also offered Mr Major cause for satisfaction, if not celebration. His claim that there had been a 'meeting of minds' over the need to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade talks perhaps went too far. Mr Clinton speaks still of the need for 'fair' trade, a coded demand for more concessions from his partners. But the tone of the president's comments - and suggestions by US officials that extension of congressional 'fast-track' approval arrangements for any Gatt accord will be for months rather than years - reinforced the view that he does want a settlement this year. 'I got no sense of a protectionism president,' Mr Major said with some justice. There were differences between the two men: over the 'map' of Bosnia being proposed in the peace negotiations between the warring factions in the former Yugoslav province; over the remit for an American emissary to Northern Ireland; and over a raft of transatlantic trade disputes concerning steel, Airbus and public procurement. The activism in international economic management which Mr Clinton expects of the Group of Seven countries may be difficult to square with the limited expectations which Mr Major has of joint action to manage demand in the world economy. But this week at least the differences remained below the surface. Mr Clinton was generous. Mr Major was mightily relieved.</p>

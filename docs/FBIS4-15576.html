			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 8) TURAN--"Democratic Congress is deeply  concerned about return of Russian troops in Azerbaijan", says  the statement distributed yesterday in Baku.    The statement says that the return of Russian troops will  not  help to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.    Democratic Congress considers that the priority in the  settlement of the conflict should be given to the UNO and the  CSCE organizations, but not to the efforts of one state.  Democratic Congress mentions that Azerbaijan's conservative  forces can make use of the return of Russian troops and it can  lead to tragic consequences. Democratic Congress says that it  will use all democratic means to prevent the return of Russian  troops in Azerbaijan.    The statement was distributed due to resolution of Russian  President concerning the creation of military bases of the  Russian army on the territory of the CIS. Earlier Russian  Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, said that Russia intends to  create one military base in Azerbaijan as well.    Democratic Congress was founded on March 23 by the  opposition  parties of the country. It includes Democratic Party, the  Popular [People's] Front, "Ana Torpag" party and the party of  Nation's Freedom.</p>

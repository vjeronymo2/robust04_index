			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Seoul orders tax audit at steel group THE South Korean government has ordered a tax audit of Pohong Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's third largest steelmaker, in what is regarded as a possible political reprisal against its former chairman. Mr Park Tae-joon, who created the state-run steel company 25 years ago, refused to support Mr Kim Young-sam, Korea's new president, after he was nominated candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) last year. Mr Park, who then headed the majority faction within the DLP, resigned from the party and as Posco chairman in protest against Mr Kim's nomination. Mr Park is now honorary chairman of Posco. The government appears to be settling political scores with industrialists who opposed Mr Kim by investigating their business activities. Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai industrial group, was forced to retire from politics last week after he was indicted for allegedly receiving illegal campaign funds from the conglomerate. The United People's Party, the opposition group formed by Mr Chung a year ago, could be dissolved this week. Mr Chung is encouraging its MPs to join the ruling party in an apparent attempt at reconciliation with the government. The Office of National Tax Administration has not conducted a tax audit of Posco in 13 years, although the company's accounts are regularly inspected by the government's audit agency. The tax office denied that it was investigating Posco for the illegal use of corporate funds for political purposes. It described the audit as 'routine' and said it was focusing on the 1990 financial year. The Posco share price fell on Saturday when the tax audit was disclosed. Posco became a popular stock among foreign investors last autumn after the government allowed them to acquire 8 per cent of its shares. The foreign shareholding limit was quickly filled, reflecting Posco's earnings performance with a 27 per cent growth in 1992 profits to Won185bn (Pounds 160m).</p>

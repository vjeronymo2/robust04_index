			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 24 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs on Friday [24 June] said that the government has no  concrete plans to set up a representative office in India.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Rock Leng made the statement in  response to press queries on the possibility of a breakthrough  in Taiwan's relationship with India. The two nations have had  no formal contacts since India recognized Beijing in 1949.    Commenting on remarks by visiting former Indian Ambassador  to  Beijing A.P. Venkateswara that India will establish an office in  Taipei by the end of August, Leng said that his ministry needs  to verify that Venkateswara's remarks reflect the policy of the  Indian Government. He said that the government hopes to develop  relations with India, but that developing a relationship would  take time.    Venkateswara, a member of an Indian delegation that arrived  here last Friday, met with Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen  on earlier this week, Other members of the Indian delegation  include former Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral and the former  Governor of India's central Bank, R.N. Malhotra.    While meeting Gujral Friday morning, President Li Teng-hui  said that he hoped Gujral's visit would help restart exchanges  between the two nations.</p>

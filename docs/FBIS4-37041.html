			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, the interior minister of  the Islamic Republic of Iran, heading a high-ranking delegation,  arrived in Ankara yesterday for a two-day official visit. Mr.  Besharati announced the agenda of the talks as being the  expansion of security, military, political, and parliamentary  cooperation between the two countries.    The interior minister's visit to Turkey is within the  framework of the visits that have taken place during the recent  decade of ties between the two countries. The heads of the two  countries' executive authorities exchange visits to Tehran and  Ankara regularly in order to study the possibilities for  expanding political and economic relations. The last such visit  was First Vice President Hasan Habibi's trip to Ankara in  December of 1993, and President Suleyman Demirel is to visit  Tehran in the near future.    Iran and Turkey are the founding members of the Economic  Cooperation Organization, ECO, and are regarded as active  members of the Islamic Conference Organization vis-a-vis the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. Tehran and Ankara cooperate in  technical, economic, and transportation fields as well as on  regional issues. The volume of trade between the two countries  was about $600 million last year, and the amount of goods  transported from Turkish ports to Iran reached a figure of  200,000 tonnes. At the same time, security and military  cooperation to establish order and tranquility along the borders  is considered one of the important aspects of the two countries'  relations.    Iran and Turkey share a common border of 511 km. Two years  ago, a joint security committee was set up to prevent  infiltration of elements that threaten the two countries'  security. On the basis of the agreements reached, the two  countries will not permit any illegal activity on their  territory that threatens the other country's security. At  present, the interior ministers of Iran and Turkey; officials of  the security cooperation committee; the border provinces'  governors general; and the governors, military, and security  officers stationed along the two countries' borders are in  direct contact. These initiatives on the whole and the existing  mutual goodwill is assisting the two countries in their war  against terrorism and drug trafficking. It is hoped that in the  wake of Mr. Besharati's visit to Ankara, further steps will be  taken to continue and expand cooperation.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Manweb advances to Pounds 95m MANWEB, the Chester-based regional electricity company, raised pre-tax profits by 61 per cent from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 94.7m in the year to March 31. Like the other regional electricity companies, Manweb earned most of its bumper profit from price increases in April 1991, which were exceptionally high to compensate for undercharging the year before. In addition, Manweb said, the comparable profits were depressed by exceptional costs. Excluding these effects, profits would have increased by only 26 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 60 per cent to 58.7p (36.7p) and by 71 per cent on the pro forma figure of 34.3p. The dividend is raised by 14 per cent to 18.25p for the year, via a final of 12.8p (11.2p). The advance in operating profit to Pounds 93.2m (Pounds 56.8m) was earned in the core distribution business, which increased its contribution by 83 per cent to Pounds 106.3m. This was despite a 0.75 per cent decrease in units of electricity sold, as recession depressed industrial sales. The company saved Pounds 10.2m in operating costs, mainly by shedding 1,000 jobs, or nearly 18 per cent of its workforce. In the supply business, however, an unforeseen Pounds 11m increase in costs gave a loss of Pounds 5.3m, rather than the Pounds 6m profit the company had expected. The retail division lost Pounds 1m, about the same as the previous year, and contracting was also loss-making. Manweb's strong cash flow paid for capital investment of more than Pounds 60m, slightly down on the previous year. Gearing was down from 27.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent, and the return on capital was 19.6 per cent on an historic cost basis. Continued cost cutting is expected to save between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m via about 150-200 more job losses. Both the supply and retail businesses are expected to move into profit, and electricity sales are forecast to grow by about 1 per cent. COMMENT Manweb rather disingenuously based its demonstration that its underlying profit growth was only 26 per cent on actual tax and interest figures for the year to March 1991, rather than the pro forma figures which should be the basis of an accurate comparison of the two years. In fact, underlying growth is closer to 35 per cent. That said, Manweb's defence against the regulator was very sound. It has slashed costs dramatically, and has detailed plans for investment in the core business - capital expenditure is due to rise to maybe Pounds 85m next year. The only worry is that a company with a reputation for prudence should have failed - unlike East Midlands and Norweb - to foresee the increase in charges that pushed the supply business into loss. The City will be hoping that it fulfils its hopes of turning this and the retail business around next year. The company has forecast real dividend growth of 5-7 per cent in the period to 1995, as this year's profits were a one-off. Analysts predict pre-tax profits of Pounds 105m-Pounds 110m for the year to March 1993, putting the company on a prospective p/e of about 5.1.</p>

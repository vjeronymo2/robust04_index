			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Officials of failed S&amp;L face Dollars 1.5bn lawsuit THE US government has filed the biggest lawsuit to date against the officers and associates of a failed savings and loan institution - a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) legal action charging former officials of the Arizona-based Western Savings and Loan with civil fraud and racketeering, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The lawsuit was filed at the weekend by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the federal agency responsible for disposing of assets of failed savings and loan groups. The RTC, in an attempt to recover damages, has over the past year filed more than 100 claims against former savings and loan officials across the US. Among those named in the lawsuit is Mr John Driggs, Western's former chairman and the scion of a prominent Arizona family that founded the group in 1929.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'INTERACTING' AT THE GETTY;  </P> <P> MUSEUM AIMS TO PLEASE VISITORS WITH NEW WAYS TO LEARN ABOUT ART  </P> <P> Clustered in the dark, visitors at the J. Paul Getty Museum watch a colorful  slide show describing how an ancient Roman villa was buried by the volcanic  wrath of Mt. Vesuvius. The glorious Villa dei Papiri, they learn, acted as the  architectural model for the Getty.  </P> <P> Upstairs in a hands-on gallery, Pauline Chambers and her two sons look through  an original 19th-Century view camera. An instructor extends its accordion-like  bellows to show how early photographers found their focus.  </P> <P> In a cubicle nearby, Alma Ruiz and two friends gaze at a 13-inch video screen,  transfixed. Centuries-old artworks, reproduced with the latest laser-disc  technology, flash before their eyes.  </P> <P> "I love it. I think it's very informative," said Ruiz, using the Getty's new  "interactive" video about illuminated manuscripts.  </P> <P> By tapping the screen with a finger, visitors advance the video's images,  allowing them the otherwise forbidden luxury of leafing through the fragile  artworks page by page. Users may also learn all about the books, from how they  were bound to the meaning of their miniature illustrations.  </P> <P> The recent installation of the video, like the debut of the Getty's hands-on  gallery and introductory slide show, is part of a revamped educational program,  one which is now coming into full operation after about five years' work,  officials say.  </P> <P> "We want to find ways to help people -- who need and want the help -- to  understand and enjoy the works in our collection. That's the bottom line," said  Bret Waller, associate director in charge of education and public affairs.  </P> <P> The Getty's educational program was "very modest" when director John Walsh  hired Waller in 1985 to begin the improvement process, Walsh said recently. "It  was a kind of home-grown thing, well done, but not even scratching the surface  of its potential."  </P> <P> Restructuring, reorganizing and restaffing, Waller and his staff have addressed  a range of needs, from tours to help visitors find their way around, to bigger  art history classes, to gallery talks on the art of appreciating fine art.  </P> <P> But the world's wealthiest museum had an obligation that went beyond its own  audience, Walsh and others thought. Its resources should be used to find  innovative ways to enrich visitors' trips -- such as a $280,000 interactive  video -- that could serve as models for museums internationally.  </P> <P> The Getty introduced it's first interactive video in 1986, a tape concerning  its Greek vase collection. Many other museums use such teaching tools but the  Getty's videos are more advanced, reproducing detail with greater precision,  and they contain more information, Waller said.  </P> <P> "We've had visits from at least a dozen museum professionals to look at (the  Greek vase video) and see what they can learn from it -- how much it cost, how  much time was involved in making it, how you hire an outside firm to produce  it, as we did," Waller said.  </P> <P> Public education has begun to command more attention -- and funding -- at  museum's nationwide, said David Ebitz, the Getty's head of education and  academic affairs. And it will continue to do so in the future.  </P> <P> "There is a limit on what you can acquire, a limit on what's left in private  hands," he said. "You can't build much more, so you turn to education" and  conservation.  </P> <P> To discover what their own museum browsers need to deepen their experience of  art, Getty officials have conducted several studies as well as evaluations to  gauge the success of their efforts. (Along with 10 other museums nationwide,  they've also held revealing visitor focus groups. See adjoining story.)  </P> <P> The illuminated manuscripts video, which features live action sequences and  most of the Getty's manuscripts collection spanning the 5th to the 16th  centuries, attracted one viewer after another on a recent Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> The museum's hands-on gallery was popular too. Like the video's Browsing Room  (also a place to read about museum collections), this "Information Center" is  small and often cramped. But administrators "pushed ahead" with such projects  partly because they are considered experiments for the Getty's new expanded  Brentwood museum, slated for completion in 1995.  </P> <P> The center will always contain displays that relate to a current exhibit and  will be staffed with a gregarious educator ready to demonstrate how the items  on view operate.  </P> <P> "The First Golden Age, 1851-1889," a photography show, is the theme of its  current display that charts the early days of the medium. Its objects include a  19th-Century view camera, tinted stereographs -- the first three-dimensional  images -- and a stereoscope to see them with.  </P> <P> Educator Sara Cannon encouraged visitors to try out the equipment as she  answered their questions.  </P> <P> "Our aim is to have people interact (with the materials) and learn about  photography, then go into the gallery with greater appreciation of technique  and artistry," said Cannon, a USC graduate student. "This is one of the few  hands-on interactive gallery spaces for adults in the country."  </P> <P> Peering into a stereoscope, visitor Diane Faust said she preferred the approach  over the old stop, look and linger method. "It's boring," she said, " if you  just walk around."  </P></p>

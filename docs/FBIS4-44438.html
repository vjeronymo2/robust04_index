			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "You Know and I Know; Only the Kuomintang Does Not </F> Know"]    [Text] People used to joke that there are gambling halls  everywhere and unlicensed brothels everywhere, and everybody  knows it but the police in the areas where they are located.  Today, this crack should be rewritten to read that every time  there is an election, everyone knows who is offering gratuities,  the amount of the gratuity, what is expected in return for the  money, and who is a thug. The Kuomintang is the only one that  does not know.    But how could it not know? Whenever a party official large  or  small states how "strong" his nominator is, that shows that the  KMT has actually known for a long time. "Strong" is a special  term used as a code word in Taiwan politics. When the KMT urges  the withdrawal of an inexperienced young person, it says he or  she "is not strong so how can he or she be elected." When the  media analyze an election, they also rank candidates by who is  and who is not "strong." When the election is won, everyone  declares that the "strong" person won. The KMT is the "strong  faction." In short, to be "strong" is to be like Chiang Kai-shek  and Sun Yat-sen. If you are not "strong," how can you be  elected? Take the present election of county and city assembly  chairmen and vice-chairmen, for example. It was really extremely  coincidental that before balloting all the assemblymen were  surprisingly so wholehearted in their great interest in group  tours for their constituents. But no one knew anything about  this coincidence. Rubbish.    However, in Taiwan, hard evidence is important. Election  bribery? Did anyone see a KMT candidate give money to anyone.  Thugs? Did anyone see a KMT candidate shoot at another person?  Since there is no hard evidence, naturally everything is  considered mud slinging. What is more, from the very beginning  of the election, the KMT repeatedly exhorted comrades against  using bribery to get elected, against wining and dining people,  against offering group tours to constituents, and against force  and threats. Since it had be so emphartic, surely there would  be no breaking of the rules. Even if some candidates did offer  bribes, that was not the party's problem, but a problem with the  social atmosphere. Dammit! What kind of logic is that! What  makes one not know whether to laugh or cry is that it was the  logic used in the 2 March KMT Standing Committee meeting.    Therefore, Taiwan's bribed elections have actually long been  an incurable disease. It is not that the disease is so serious  or a remedy so hard to find, but only the "not knowing." When  everyone realizes that elections are sick, the KMT does not  admit that anything is wrong. When everybody sees bribed  elections and thuggery, the KMT does not know anything about it.  It tells bare faced lies. Now, even were a remedy to be offered  with the best of intentions, the KMT would not countenance it.    Bribed elections are not a difficult to cure disease. All  that is needed is for a young candidate who has a good image,  who is capable, and who is not "strong" to win once or twice,  and the disease would be suddenly cured. Of course, to run for  election without being "strong" means victory would not be  assured. However, a good person might lose once, but he would  not lose forever. Once a good person won, that would not be just  a small win; it might bring a great, complete victory in its  wake.    Are bribed elections difficult to cure? Not at all. All that  is needed is to change the hearts of the party bureaucrats into  the hearts of the common people. There is nothing to it!</p>

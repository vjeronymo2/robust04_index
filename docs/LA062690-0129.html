			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY AIM TO 'PUTT' IT ALL AWAY;  </P> <P> DISC GOLF OPEN ATTRACTS SOME OF WORLD'S BEST  </P> <P> Eric Jewell eyed his target, then uncorked a soaring shot that curled around a  tree and landed about 110 yards away, just shy of a hole-in-one. He easily made  the tap-in "putt" for birdie.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, Hale Irwin: Don't move over. Jewell, 26, of Villa Park was  golfing in a U.S. Open, all right. But he was competing with a plastic disc  known to most as a Frisbee.  </P> <P> "Disc golf" and six separate events lured Jewell and 219 others -- among them  20 who have set disc "world records" -- to La Mirada Park for what sponsors are  calling the 1990 U.S. Open Flying Disc Championships. The events will run  through Sunday.  </P> <P> It may sound, well, flighty, but with corporate sponsors providing $42,000 in  prize money to the top finishers, be assured that this U.S. Open is no joke to  those involved.  </P> <P> "The competition is top-notch," said Dan Mangone of Fullerton, the tournament's  chief organizer. "With 20 current or former world record holders, you can  imagine how tough it is."  </P> <P> Referring to the expansive 27-hole disc-golf layout at the park, Mangone said:  "It's so unique that people from around the world come to have their pictures  taken here."  </P> <P> Indeed, the seven competitions that make up this U.S. Open also are distinct --  even if some of the terminology and strategies appear to have been borrowed.  </P> <P> "I've got decent power, but the main thing in disc golf is, you have to be a  great putter," said Steve Valencia, 18, a two-time national disc golf champion,  discussing the sport before he took to the course.  </P> <P> Valencia added something that any weekend hacker with clubs could confirm: "If  your putting's not on, you're not going to score that effectively."  </P> <P> As with conventional par-three golf, the disc "holes" are typically 300 feet to  700 feet long. Players must negotiate trees and occasionally water bodies  before landing their discs in a receptacle roughly five feet above the ground  that is affixed to a metal pole.  </P> <P> Valencia, a graduate of La Mirada High School, said he has already won $5,000  in disc competitions, plans to enter tournaments later this summer in Texas and  Missouri. On Monday, he fired the best disc golf round of the field, a 45, or 9  under par.  </P> <P> The day's most-talked-about achievement, however, came hours earlier at the  side-arm-shooting hand of Conrad Damon, a computer programmer who said he is  eschewing the office in Brea this week to manage discs of the airborne genre.  </P> <P> "This morning I tied the world record for accuracy," Damon reported happily.  </P> <P> As with major league baseball's World Series, the disc-throwing crowd goes  international when describing records. But unlike baseball -- which has yet to  place a foreign team in its "world" championship games -- the disc-golf open  has competitors from other nations -- Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, West  Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  </P> <P> Fewer than 100 spectators showed up for the opening rounds Monday, although  Mangone said he expects as many as 15,000 for Saturday and Sunday. But those on  hand Monday appeared to appreciate the expertise of the competitors.  </P> <P> "It's interesting to see the different solutions they find to the problems,"  said 22-year-old Adrienne Moll of Solana Beach.  </P> <P> By far the most elaborately outfitted competitor was Tim Selinske of Covina,  whose pull-cart toted a bag of 13 different-size Frisbees (a standard  assortment for serious players), water and "a flashlight for when this runs  late." Selinske is one of 15 disc devotees to make the 1990 Guinness Book of  World Records.  </P> <P> As for Jewell, the entrant from Villa Park, he ended his disc golf round at 2  under par, placing him among the top 20.  </P> <P> "I was a novice up until six months ago," Jewell said. "Now I'm up with the big  boys, and I'm not winning anything . . . . If I can just find my putter, I'll  be fine."  </P></p>

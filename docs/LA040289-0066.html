			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DIFFERENT VIEW  </P> <P> I'm writing to express my dismay at the change in format and articles written  in the View section.  </P> <P> In the past few months, there seems a concerted effort to publish pieces geared  to the sensational and bordering on tabloid journalism. Previously you had  portraits of achievers who were trying to make a difference -- issue-oriented  individuals whose selfless lives we admired and whose courage we wanted to  emulate. Issues of hunger, nuclear war, peace and justice were prominently  displayed. What happened to the terrific pieces by Kathleen Hendrix and Beverly  Beyette?  </P> <P> Now there seem to be an excess of the rich and famous -- individuals whose  contributions are dubious. Who wants to read about Donald Trump or David Duke  in the wonderful Los Angeles Times? There are plenty of magazines that cater to  this type of rubbish. Please bring back the old View section.  </P> <P> KAREN FLAHERTY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

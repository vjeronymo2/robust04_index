			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Serbs demand private banks return their cash CROWDS in Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav federal capital, yesterday demanded the return of their savings from private banks whose licences have been revoked by the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), writes Laura Silber. Many people deposited their life savings with Dafiment and Jugoskandik, private banks in Serbia, in order to receive interest rates up to 10 times higher than the official rate on foreign currency deposits. But the NBY revoked the licences of the banks, which were opened last year, saying they should not have been permitted to operate at all. A western economist said the closure appears to result from a conflict between the National Bank of Serbia and the NBY. He said that the two private banks would most likely continue to operate, buying up hard currency to the benefit of the Serbian National Bank. This most recent financial scandal is part of the overall deterioration of the Serbian economy. Inflation has hit a monthly rate of 60 per cent and industrial production has fallen by more than 30 per cent. The rising price of hard currency has helped to boost the black market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poland: Mr. Olechowski Will </F> Recommend a Request for `Partial Membership' When Hungary  Applies"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database]    [Text] The Foreign Minister of Poland, Andrzej Olechowski,  has announced his intention to recommend that his government  submit an application for membership in the European Union at  the same time as Hungary. He nevertheless said the solution of  "partial membership" would be more realistic for his country  because complete adherence to the Union's economic pillar (the  first) would involve "costs and delays." In contrast, he hopes  Poland can be integrated into the two other pillars (CFSP  [Common Foreign Security Policy] and Home Affairs) as soon as  possible so as to "prepare for subsequent full membership." At  a restricted press conference the day after the first session of  the EC/Poland Association Council, Mr. Olechowski underscored  the favourable and rapid development of the country's main  economic indicators, which today makes it possible for Poland to  envisage "giving tangible form to its desire for membership in  the European Union." Following a period of recession, the  Polish economy registered growth of 4.5 percent in 1993, i.e.  the highest in Europe (East and West alike), due to growth in  the industrial sector (7 percent to 10 percent) which is itself  based on a sharp rise in productivity.    Poland has also managed to slash inflation from 600 percent  in 1990 to 30 percent. The country has some two million private  companies and 60 percent of the workforce is employed in the  private sector. The most striking development may be the  shrinking of the public sector, which provided the earnings of  60 percent of Polish households two years ago, compared to only  35 percent today, he noted.    Political developments are also encouraging. Mr. Olechowski  said that Poland's democratic institutions are "surprisingly  mature." These promising signs make it possible for Poland to  aspire to "political membership" enabling it to participate in  the development of the common foreign and security policy and  intergovernmental cooperation in home and justice affairs.  "This would certainly be a much more convincing and effective  solution than, for example, a partnership or another form of  relations," he told the Association Council. With respect to  the Union's economic sphere, Mr. Olechowski said that "waiting  periods and derogations" would be necessary, in particular for  the integration of Polish agriculture and participation in EMU  [European Monetary Union]. Regarding agriculture, he recalled  that this sector still employs 25 percent of the workforce in  Poland, adding that a reduction in terms of jobs and, in  general, an "adjustment" would have to be undertaken in the long  term. In these circumstances, full membership seems  "impossible" and partial membership "interesting." For Mr.  Olechowski, it would be preferable to set a timetable with  objectives and deadlines at the earliest opportunity so as to  more clearly target the adjustments required, "giving a sense of  commitment" and "conferring credibility to our objective of full  membership. Partial membership would be the proof that the  wider Europe is not a pure figment of the imagination but a  project already underway," he added. The minister commented  that Poland could promote this approach beginning in the latter  half of this year, when Germany takes over the rotating  Presidency of the Council of the Union. In his view, this  Presidency will be "particularly open to the questions raised by  its neighbours." Mr. Olechowski regretted that the Czech  Republic and Slovakia cannot join in the membership movement  launched by their Visegrad Group partners. The minister was to  meet NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner later on Tuesday [8  March], along with the President of the Western European Union  [WEU] Jacques Poos and its Secretary General Wim Eekelen.  Membership in the WEU must also be considered an integral part  of the process of Poland's integration into the European Union.</p>

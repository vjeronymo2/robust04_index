			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / People: Ernst &amp; Young David Wilson, the Ernst &amp; Young partner who has been acting finance director of Ladbroke since February, has formally joined the hotels, betting and do-it-yourself group. Wilson, 46, was brought in when Jerry O'Mahony, the vice chairman and finance director, fell ill. He died in June. Wilson's departure from Ernst &amp; Young does not mean he is Ladbroke's final choice as finance director. Ladbroke is still looking for someone to take on the job. When it does, Wilson (above) will move on to another, as yet unspecified, post in the group.</p>

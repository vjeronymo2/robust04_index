			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent  Pavel Kuznetsov]    [Text] The State Duma (lower house of the Russian  Parliament)  adopted on Friday bills on corruption control and on amendments  and addenda to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedural  Code of the Russian Federation in the first reading.    A heated debate between factions preceded the approval.    Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the lower chamber security  committee, who submitted the bills to legislators, noted that  the need for their adoption is predetermined by the fact that  crime in Russia has substantially changed its forms and  substance.    According to the chairman, the number of the convicted for  bribe- taking substantially decreased as compared with the  1980s, which indicates that legislation is utterly outdated.    He stressed at the same time that mobs, using loopholes in  the present laws, "influence the adoption of political decisions  up to the level of member republics of the Russian Federation".    Ilyukhin reported that he has information showing that the  underworld is laying hands on 55 per cent of capital and 80 per  cent of voting shares in the country. The chairman stressed  that the bill was drafted by specialists from the Prosecutor's  Office, courts, the tax service, the Interior Ministry and the  Federal Counterintelligence Service.    He noted that, in the opinion of foreign experts, measures  in  the bills aimed at fighting bribe-taking and corruption are  "very lenient".    Representatives from the Russia's Choice, Yabloko and  Russia's Women factions opposed the adoption of the bills in the  first reading. Their main arguments were that the bills  indicate an extremely broad range of people who can be held  responsible for bribe-taking and corruption, while the state  should, in fact, ensure control over incomes of the entire  population.    Ilyukhin's opponents claimed that the mechanism of the bills  will not permit to bring to court high-ranking grafters.    The Party of Russian Unity and Accord and the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) supported the bills on the  whole but suggested that they should be finalised, taking into  account remarks at today's debate, and adopted in the first  reading in the near future.    Advocates of the bills noted that their opponents poorly  studied the documents and intend to dump them. They also  claimed that fight against bribe-taking and corruption should be  started from the lowest levels and that all law-breakers should  be put in the dock, irrespective of their posts whether he is an  engineer at a house- repair administration or a high-ranking  politician.    LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed a special  opinion, noting that the bills are necessary. Nevertheless,  their adoption will be useless. "The Duma is not ready to fight  corruption in its ranks," he underlined.    "Therefore, it cannot fight corruption on a nation-wide  scale," he claimed. This notwithstanding, Liberal Democrats  voted for the adoption of the bills in the first reading.</p>

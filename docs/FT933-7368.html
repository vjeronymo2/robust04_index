			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Shares gift to daughter IN 1991 I transferred shares, then valued at Pounds 6,000, to my daughter as a gift. She sold them recently for Pounds 5,000. Will she be allowed to establish a loss of Pounds 1,000 (plus indexation)? Or would she be reckoned to have made a profit of Pounds 5,000 (less indexation) on the ground that the original holding cost her nothing? In 1984, I bought shares in Premier Oil Consolidated for Pounds 3,143. In every subsequent year except 1992, I received bonus shares because the company wanted to conserve resources for exploration rather than pay dividends. Recently, I sold the original plus the bonus shares. For capital gains tax purposes, would the basis be just the Pounds 3,143 plus indexation? When you gave the shares to your daughter in 1991, you were subject to CGT as though you had sold them in the open market at their market value. Consequently, your daughter will have an allowable loss as though she had bought them in the open market at that market value. On Premier Oil, the cost remains at Pounds 3,143 plus indexation (subject to adjustment for the 1985 rights offer). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT-13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT-14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

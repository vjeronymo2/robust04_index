			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> ENROLLMENT DOUBLES AT NEW CSUF BRANCH  </P> <P> Enrollment has doubled at a Cal State Fullerton satellite campus in South  County, leading university administrators to declare the new facility a  success.  </P> <P> The campus opened last fall with 384 students, and officials say that spring  semester enrollment will be between 700 and 800 students.  </P> <P> "There is such a demand for classes and programs in South County, we had  projected doubling enrollment (for the spring) and it will probably double  again in the fall," said George Giacumakis, director of the Mission Viejo  campus. "I'd say this proves the trend toward greater demands for higher  education in South Orange County."  </P> <P> After nearly 10 years of planning, the university opened a branch campus on the  grounds of Saddleback College. Last year, more than 4,000 Cal State Fullerton  students commuted from the South County area, Giacumakis said.  </P> <P> "We have had so many other students say that if they didn't have to drive 30 to  35 miles to Fullerton, they would take classes with us," he added.  </P> <P> Students enrolled at the Mission Viejo campus take advanced courses in  business, communications, computer science, mathematics and social science.  </P> <P> The jump in enrollment frees the university to proceed with plans to expand the  satellite campus, Giacumakis said. University officials will now consider  building a 75,000-square-foot building on the Saddleback campus, he said.  </P> <P> Eventually, university officials hope to enroll up to 4,000 students at the  branch campus.  </P> <P> This summer, the extension campus will be renovating another structure now  being used by Saddleback. The building should be ready for the spring semester  in 1991, Giacumakis said. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

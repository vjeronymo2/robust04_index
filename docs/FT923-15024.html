			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Ulster's big man lets himself go - Sir Patrick Mayhew Usually urbane and upright, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has this week been restless and in peculiarly good humour. He chuckled before television cameras with Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister. In Winston Churchill's old Admiralty room, now occupied by the Northern Ireland Office, he cannot sit still. Only three months in the job, after nine years' service as solicitor-general and then attorney-general, the former barrister has a mischievous confidence. 'I never wanted to be a law officer . . . I came into politics to get away from the law,' he laughs. His cheer is understandable. Northern Ireland's wretched politics has taken a rare step forward. On Monday, Unionists, nationalists, and the Irish and UK governments will gather in London for the most wide-ranging discussion on the province's future since partition in the 1920s. The breakthrough is, in large part, Sir Patrick's achievement. His predecessor, Mr Peter Brooke, constructed a complex talks programme that nine weeks ago allowed nationalist and Unionists to return to the conference table. But Sir Patrick has this week cajoled the recalcitrant and suspicious participants to agree sufficient common ground for the Irish government to enter the negotiations. A chink of brightness has crept beneath Northern Ireland's gloomy history of failed political initiatives and unceasing terrorist killings. Whitehall insiders wonder whether Northern Ireland politics has entered a new chapter. UK Prime Minister John Major is not passionate over the direction Ulster should take; but he is determined to find a negotiated solution and has a warm relationship with Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister. Sir Patrick is more a pragmatist than a visionary. He is unusual among Tory Northern Ireland secretaries in having expressed to an interest in the position before his appointment. Oppressive personal security and the intransigent politics usually deter thrusting ministers. But Sir Patrick has a strong sense of duty and propriety. During the 'Westland crisis' in 1986 he demanded a full inquiry into the leaking, by the Department of Trade and Industry, of advice he sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, then defence secretary. Law officers' advice had to be confidential, he insisted. Colleagues report that he is a courteous, straight-backed English gentleman. He chooses a hard chair to fidget on, not the soft-leather settees in his office. His first press conference as Northern Ireland secretary was taken standing up. Sir Patrick describes Northern Ireland's politicians as 'engaging' - not an adjective that springs immediately to the minds of many Westminster politicians. Aged 62, the patrician air is enhanced by a rounded face, swept-back silver hair and his height. His national service army paybook said 6ft 4 3/4 in - two inches taller than the Rev Ian Paisley, the rumbustious leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and hitherto undisputed 'big man' of Ulster politics. The voice is polished but Sir Patrick is not pompous. His first instruction at meetings this week with the participants in the talks was to take off their jackets. He is businesslike, responding to flippancy with a drawn-out, condescending 'yeeaaas'. He is strongly Christian, but believes religion and politics have to be kept apart. In spite of his 'Paddy' nickname, Sir Patrick fears his Irish background is overplayed. His mother came from an Anglo-Irish Protestant family, which had been based in County Cork since 1263. But he was born in Berkshire, England, educated at Tonbridge School and Oxford. As MP for Tunbridge Wells, Kent, since 1974, he did not make a speech on Northern Ireland before taking office and first visited the province in the 1980s. More significant than his national identity, perhaps, is his family's familiarity with public service, which helps Sir Patrick fit into a job once described by Pravda as a 'colonial pro-consul'. A great grandfather was a first lord of the admiralty; a grandfather had a ceremonial post at the British viceroy's court at Dublin castle. His Irish roots have led to confusion among participants in the talks about his attitudes to Northern Ireland - a fog that may perversely have helped in recent weeks and which he has shown little inclination to clear. Irish diplomats were initially sceptical. As attorney-general, he presided over fierce rows between the UK and Ireland over extradition, and upset nationalists by refusing to prosecute Royal Ulster Constabulary officers for alleged 'shoot to kill' offences. But his appreciation of Irish history has forced a reappraisal. 'He may be a southern Irish Unionist but, first and foremost, he is a Cork man,' says one Irish official. Unionists have similarly mixed feelings. They like his dedication but are not convinced of his motives. Southern Ireland Anglo-Irish families 'are the sort of people who run up the Union Jack one day and then the Irish tricolour the next', says a Unionist MP. With the current round of Northern Ireland talks intended to be private, Sir Patrick wants to limit public utterances. Yet he says that ultimately the Northern Ireland secretary has to work himself out of existence. 'My job is to relieve the people of Northern Ireland of the indignity of having their local affairs governed for them by Westminster ministers. It is an indignity, it is an affront and I also think it is an absurdity.' He is also surprisingly ambitious about what might be achieved by political talks, apparently rejecting any suggestion that Northern Ireland could be ruled like any other part of the UK. Since 1972, when the Unionist-dominated Stormont parliament was dissolved, the UK government has tried to enable Northern Ireland to become self-governing, 'to the extent at least that it was when Stormont had jurisdiction'. It is probably too much to expect Sir Patrick to get that far. Only a month is left before the time set aside for the talks expires. A new political settlement - if one can ever be achieved - will almost certainly require a fresh set of talks later this year. And, probably, another after that. Sir Patrick's high spirits will be tested.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Omar Belhouchet: "Unity of Army Endangered"] </F>   [Text] The decision by Liamine Zeroual to continue talking  with jailed leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], a  dissolved political party, could put the unity of the army in  danger. A great many of those in the military hierarchy and at  intermediate grades as well as among ordinary enlisted men do  not like this way of conducting the political dialogue that, in  the space of several weeks, favored a marked advance of the  fundamentalist movement in Algeria.    There is, the evidence would suggest, a major risk of seeing  the country's total destabilization rush forward. Indeed,  Algeria is currently experiencing the most dramatic moments of  its young existence since independence. You truly have to be a  complete innocent to keep on thinking the way some people were  barely a few months ago. The fundamentalist movement is an  indivisible whole but one that is subdivided into different  compartments, oftentimes contradictory ones, to be sure, but  that is all. Its basic logic is a rejection of the other.    The record of the dialogue that can be drawn up is an  undeniably disastrous one for the country. The state has not  negotiated from a position of strength. It has given every  impression that it is discussing from a position of weakness, as  its numerous concessions, which have produced nothing,  demonstrate.    And this attitude was very well understood by FIS leaders  who  not only failed to lift their little finger to put an end to the  terrorism, despite the concessions made by the Algerian state,  but who also increased their directives to "burn" the country.    The basic question facing Algerians today is to know whether  the Army is going to stand behind a process that will make  Algeria disappear a few months from now.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Chairman of the Slovak  parliament Ivan Gasparovic said today that a constitutional law  on the shortening of the electoral period could be passed as  early as Thursday [17 March].    However, he said, there would have to be a "harmony of  opinion," between the deputies' groups of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Slovak National Party (SNS), the  Democratic Left Party (SDL) and other deputies.    The HZDS preferred a June date for elections, Gasparovic  (HZDS) said on Slovak radio, because this was what citizens  wanted, and this was shown among other things by the organizing  of the petition drive.    Gasparovic said that today's report from the President's  Office that the president would not be calling a referendum due  to alleged inadequacies in the petition sheets was a "hard blow"  for the citizen. However, he indicated that a certain "new  step" would be decided on today still, but did not give further  details.    SDL chairman Peter Weiss confirmed that his party was  attempting to reach an election date by a constitutional law,  but said he understood a referendum as "insurance," to make sure  that elections were not forgotten about. He added that the SDL  considered a September date as best.    The KDH would vote on Thursday for the shortening of the  electoral term, and gave precedence to a date at the end of  September and the beginning of October, KDH chairman Jan  Carnogursky said.    The deputies' group of the Alternative of Political Realism  (defectors from the HZDS) favor the same date, spokesman  Vladimir Bajan said. It was unacceptable for the new Slovak  government to function only for two months, Bajan said, and thus  the group rejected a June date.    Deputies from the National Democratic deputies' group will  vote for a September, or perhaps an October date, their chairman  Ludovit Cernak said. Their belief was "the later the better,"  Cernak said, so that the political practices of ex-premier  Vladimir Meciar could be fully unveiled and so that he would no  longer be an "idol" by the election time.    Deputy Pal Csaky said that for the Hungarian minority  Egyutteles- Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH)  coalition a September date was acceptable. Given that two camps  were forming, of which one supported a June date and the other a  September one, he did not think the law would be passed. Csaky  said he considered the idea of making President Michal Kovac  call a referendum by parliamentary decree to be unhappy, because  if a referendum was called, and then both parliamentary and  community elections were held, people would be fed up of voting  this year.</p>

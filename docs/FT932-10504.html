			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Losers face the Surrey disaster BRIGHT SUNSHINE did nothing to perk up Tory spirits at Surrey County Hall in Kingston upon Thames yesterday. The local Conservative leadership had been prepared to lose some seats to the Liberal Democrats, but to lose overall control after more than a century of Tory domination was a nightmare they had not contemplated. Mr Michael Gammon, Conservative group leader, admitted he was still trying to come to terms with the result. 'My first reaction was one of sheer disbelief at what was happening, and the consequences could take some time to work through.' Other party leaders were equally taken aback by the scale of the Tory losses and Liberal Democrat gains. The Conservatives now have 34 seats (down from 55), Liberal Democrats 29 (10), Labour 8 (7), Residents 3 (2) and Independent 1 (2). All parties meet early next week to plan tactics and to start bargaining on power sharing. Surrey is in uncharted territory. Although Mr Derek Thomas, chief executive, had preliminary meetings with some party leaders yesterday, there is no clear sign of how things might work out. 'Provided there is goodwill and a wish to make it work, then we should find solutions,' he said. The Conservatives could retain power with the help of the Residents and Independent, but these could provide shaky support. Mr Gammon, Mrs Dorothy Buckrell, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, and Dr Joe Bullock, a leading Labour councillor, agreed there was likely to be a pragmatic approach. Mrs Buckrell said: 'We want to make it work. We haven't got control, but we now have a lot of influence and we will use it.' Relations between Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been too strained in the past for anything approaching a deal to be considered, but the traditionalist leader of the Labour group was defeated on Thursday and much will depend on whoever is elected next week to succeed him. Neither party intends to enter into a formal pact. Nor do they expect sharp changes in policy, partly because the Conservatives remain a powerful force, and partly because of stringent budgetary restrictions. Surrey is very near its spending limit, and if more money is to be spent on some services it will have to be cut back on others. But there are bound to be changes in emphasis. Dr Bullock said Labour would set priorities, including more help for nursery education, for children at risk and for social services, and would push hard for these. Labour and the Liberal Democrats see common ground developing over education, social services and environmental issues but there will inevitably be problems. The obvious candidate for cuts is education, where spending is substantially higher than the government targets, but none of the parties wants to see this curtailed. Power sharing will be a unique experience for Surrey and it will take time for the participants to learn the rules of the game.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Chang Chun (4545 0689) from </F> Shanghai: "At Deng Xiaoping's Suggestion, Zhang Zhen and Wang  Ruilin Take Charge of Major Reshuffle of Generals"]    [Text] The Central Military Commission held an enlarged  meeting of the military commission in mid-December last year to  carry out a major reorganization among generals at the level of  military region. Reorganization among army-level generals is  still going on now.    Involving seven military regions, the Navy, the Air Force,  and academies under the Central Military Commission, the current  reorganization covers the widest scope and the largest number of  high-ranking military officers in the past decade.    The theoretical basis for the current major changes is to  make the ranks of military cadres younger in average age and  more professional competent.    Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission,  and Wang Ruilin (director of Deng Xiaoping Office), first deputy  director of the General Political Department, have taken charge  of the operation at Deng Xiaoping's suggestion.    As envisaged by the current military leaders, with all  leaders of the Central Military Commission having been or soon  to be overage, the leading bodies of the new military commission  and three general departments will be composed of principal  officers of the Navy, the Air Force, and the military regions in  1996, with generals newly promoted to the deputy posts in  military regions and principal officers of group armies serving  as principal officers of the military regions and armed  services. Moreover, a number of younger division-level military  officers will be selected in preparation for the gradual  takeover.    This is precisely the "echelon takeover" arrangement which  Deng Xiaoping earlier assigned to Zhang Zhen, who is responsible  for personnel matters in the military, and it is being  officially implemented.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Leaders shrink from force in Yugoslavia LEADERS of the Group of Seven industrialised countries are tomorrow due to adopt a separate declaration on Yugoslavia, leaving open the use of military force as a last resort to back up United Nations sanctions and relief operations. It will make clear that such a decision can be taken only by the UN Security Council. At a dinner meeting last night, President Francois Mitterrand of France argued strongly in favour of installing non-UN troops on the road from Sarajevo airport to the city. These troops would protect convoys carrying humanitarian aid into the city and would be empowered to shoot if necessary. But Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, was worried that the plan could lead to confusion between UN and non-UN troops, and so endanger the lives of UN troops. This was one of the issues still unresolved last night. Mr Enzo Scotti, the Italian foreign minister, said the G7 leaders also discussed a possible naval blockade to enforce UN sanctions against Serbia. Officials from the nine-nation Western European Union have already been examining contingency naval plans. WEU foreign ministers may discuss the idea further at a special meeting in the margins of the 52-nation summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki later this week. British officials, however, stressed that the question of military action did not arise at the moment. They said it would become an option only if humanitarian aid to Bosnia was not getting through, which was not the case at present. The G7 leaders also discussed new French and Italian proposals for transforming the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, chaired by Lord Carrington, into a wider international conference under the umbrella of the UN. But it was not clear whether this proposal would figure in the planned declaration on Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, officials in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo said yesterday the international relief effort was not stopping fighting or preventing Bosnia from being divided between Croatia and Serbia. According to Croat television, Serb forces have captured the strategic town of Derventa in central Bosnia, setting houses ablaze. Relief agencies said Serbs had also seized control of a string of towns in eastern Bosnia, on or near the Serbian border. Moslems in the region had been killed, imprisoned or forcibly deported. Refugees who escaped from Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, say there are hardly any Moslems left in the town, though they used to make up 70 per cent of the population. The Serbian offensive coincided with the formation at the weekend of a new Croatian state in western Hercegovina. A British official said the new state, backed by the government in Zagreb under President Franjo Tudjman, 'would not be recognised'. He said western diplomats might now be pushed into considering sanctions against Croatia in view of Zagreb's attempts to undermine UN peacekeeping operations in Croatia, and its de facto annexation of western Hercegovina. Mr Milan Panic, the California-based businessman who last week was appointed prime minister of the new Yugoslavia, consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro, appealed in Belgrade yesterday for a delay of 100 days to determine the status of the country at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In a letter to CSCE delegates, he said his goal was to stop the fighting. The US and other countries want to exclude Yugoslavia from the CSCE which starts a two-day summit in Helsinki on Thursday.</p>

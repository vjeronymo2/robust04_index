			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Ghosts of gold and dollars take to the streets of Beijing: Demand is ballooning for hedges against any further devaluations in China's currency A Beijing newspaper this week told its readers two ghosts were wandering the city's streets - gold and US dollars. This was a reference to ballooning Chinese demand for the two commodities as a hedge against the continued depreciation of China's currency, the Renminbi, amid persistent rumours of a further sharp devaluation. The Beijing Youth Daily reported that in the six weeks to mid-February, the city's main department store sold some RMB4.47m (Pounds 542,253)-worth of gold jewellery, double the amount for the whole of last year. Chinese officials this week signalled alarm at the continuing pressure on the currency, although it was unclear whether this was genuine or connected with the presence in Beijing of a team from the Office of the US Special Trade Representative - the first high-level US delegation to visit China since the change of administration in January. The US, whose trade deficit with China last year reached Dollars 18bn, does not want a further depreciation of the Renminbi, as this would make Chinese exports even more competitive. US officials have even been hinting that support for China's plans to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may be conditional on it stabilising its exchange rate. Chinese officials have pledged to move gradually towards a unified rate based on the 'market value' of the Renminbi, but foreign bankers in Beijing are sceptical that a single market rate is possible soon. Many of China's faltering state enterprises are dependent on 'subsidised' foreign exchange allocations for imports of raw materials and equipment. Under China's foreign exchange system, there are broadly two rates: an administered 'official' rate used largely for trade transactions under the state plan, and a more market-based rate determined in the 100 or so foreign exchange 'swap' centres throughout the country - where approved enterprises are allowed to buy and sell. Some 80 per cent of foreign exchange transactions are conducted through these centres. There is also a street 'black market' in many Chinese cities. Rates on the street shadow those in the swap centres. Since December, 1989, China's official 'administered' rate has depreciated by more than 60 per cent against the US dollar, due to several devaluations and a managed float of the Renminbi. At one stage, the difference between official and market rates was reduced to about 8 per cent, but in the latter part of 1992, as China's economic boom and consequent demand for imports gathered pace, the gap widened dramatically, with the differential this week standing at about 30 per cent. With China's economy continuing to grow at a rate exceeding 12 per cent, there seems little prospect of the gap between official and market rates narrowing, unless the authorities resorted to strong administrative intervention - something they have vowed not to do. Western economists in Beijing say that although Chinese officials are worried about inflationary pressures caused by an overheated economy, accompanied by a surge in imports and pressure on the Renminbi, it was unlikely they would be stampeded into hasty action. China's trade surplus reached about Dollars 5.5bn in 1992, its foreign exchange reserves remain healthy at about Dollars 50bn, and it continued to trade strongly through the first months of this year. 'Maybe they will be happy to sit back and do little,' said a western official. That may prove to be the case, although a further widening in the gap between the official and market rates would almost certainly test the nerve of Chinese central bankers. China's plans gradually to unify its dual exchange rate system and bring about at least partial convertibility of its currency have been set back. Speculation against the Renminbi seems set to continue.</p>

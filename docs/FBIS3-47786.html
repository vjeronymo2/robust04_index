Shunji Yanai, who headed a Japanese  survey team to the former Yugoslavia, told a press conference  the ministry has to study various requests made during the  mission's trip to decide what kind of contributions Japan can  make.    The ministry will then ask for a judgment from the foreign  minister, the chief cabinet secretary and the prime minister,  Yanai said, adding that there have not been any "specific  instructions" from them.    Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign Policy  Bureau, said Tokyo has to study the legal aspects of whether it  is possible to send unarmed military observers to Macedonia as  requested by the commander of the United Nations Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in Macedonia last week. Yanai said he did not  immediately respond when Brig. Gen. Saermark Thomsen [name as  received] made the request in person.    Yanai's remarks followed comments by Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura earlier in the day that Japan does not intend  to dispatch Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel to join U.N.  peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Takemura told  a press conference he had instructed Yanai to "respond with  discretion so as not to cause misunderstanding."    On Sunday, Yanai said in Budapest after wrapping up his  nine-day survey mission that it is "worth considering" Thomsen's  request and that Japan could send peacekeepers to Macedonia if  the nation agreed to the dispatch since no military conflict has  broken out there.    Japan's law on U.N. peacekeeping cooperation bans any  deployment of peacekeepers in a nation that rejects them.    Yanai explained at Wednesday's press conference that he was  pressed to present his personal view in Budapest. He also said  Yasushi Akashi, head of the UNPROFOR, has asked Japan to  participate in consultations among major countries at the  UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, to discuss problems in  the region.    Akashi reportedly said he wants to set up a consultation  system because such a system was effective in U.N. Transitional  Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) activities. In Cambodia,  permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Indonesia,  Japan, Australia and ambassadors of other nations in Phnom Penh  held talks whenever problems occurred, Akashi was quoted as  saying.    Akashi said he wants Japan to participate in the proposed  consultation system because it is not directly participating in  UNPROFOR activities and because it is in a position to consult  on problems of great international interest, according to Yanai.    Yanai also said that during his trip, officials of Croatia,  Slovenia and Macedonia strongly called for strengthening ties  with Japan at both the government and private sector levels.  Macedonia also asked for economic assistance and cooperation to  solve its debt problem, he said.    International organizations engaging in humanitarian  activities in the former Yugoslavia cited the lack of facilities  to accommodate refugees and also medical and other goods, he  said.    In a related move the same day, Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata  said Japan has appointed a Foreign Ministry official as  political officer to assist Akashi, as part of Japan's  contributions there. Tomiko Ichikawa, assistant director of the  U.N. Administration Division in the ministry's Foreign Policy  Bureau, is the first woman among five Japanese political  officers dispatched in connection with U.N. peacekeeping  operations.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  HILL STREET SECTION REOPENED TO TRAFFIC  </P> <P> A stretch of Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles that was closed two weeks ago  to shore up a Metro Rail tunnel was reopened Monday.  </P> <P> The segment was shut down Jan. 27 after construction engineers found unexpected  stress on the struts that support a 1,000-foot section of Hill above the tunnel  between Temple and 1st streets, said Greg Davy, a spokesman for the Southern  California Rapid Transit District.  </P> <P> Several horizontal steel struts have been added to the 80-foot-deep tunnel in  the past two weeks, Davy said.  </P> <P> The block near the Civic Center carries 2,400 vehicles during a normal morning  rush hour. City traffic engineers rerouted traffic on downtown streets, and  there has been congestion on and off since the closure. Six RTD bus lines were  rerouted, Davy said.  </P> <P> The refitting of the struts had little impact on the time schedule for the  subway project, which is scheduled for completion in 1993, Davy said.  </P></p>

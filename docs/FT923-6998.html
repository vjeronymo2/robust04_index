			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Speculation mounts over cabinet hit-list: Republican Party Convention in Houston MR Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, said yesterday he accepted that President George Bush would want to reshuffle his cabinet if he won a second term, but he had not talked to the president personally about leaving, writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Houston. His remarks were in response to a flurry of speculation generated on Tuesday night when Mr Bush said in a television interview: 'You'll see plenty of new faces, plenty of changes in this administration.' The instant assumption was that Mr Brady, Mr Richard Darman, the budget director, and Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the council of economic advisers, would go, as long demanded by right-wing Republicans dissatisfied with the performance of the economy. Of these, only Mr Boskin has previously indicated a desire to leave his post, although Mr Brady said it was within the president's prerogative to make changes he wanted and that a second term was a logical time to make such moves. This was coupled to a report in the New York Times that Mr Bush was considering keeping Mr James Baker at the White House in a second term, to serve as overall economic policy chief. Mr Baker, secretary of state until Sunday when he becomes Mr Bush's chief of staff and campaign manager, was reported to be resistant to the idea on the grounds that it was 'too gimmicky'. His return to control over foreign policy had previously been considered the most likely option should Mr Bush win in November. The White House yesterday denied rumours that Mr Jack Kemp, the outspoken housing secretary, was also on the potential hit-list. His departure would upset the right and might be interpreted as ingratitude after Mr Kemp's effusive endorsement of the president in a speech to the party's convention on Tuesday night. Mr Bush's main purpose in his television interview, as in many others recently, has been to demonstrate he is as committed to 'change' as is Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic rival. This will be an important theme of his acceptance speech tonight, in which he is said to be contemplating an announcement about Mr Baker's long-term future. But Mr Clinton was quick to latch on to the president's plan for cabinet changes, saying it was an acknowledgement that Mr Bush's current team had failed. Changing the composition of his economics team would demonstrate that on domestic affairs the president is prepared to turn over a new leaf. Of even greater immediate interest tonight is the extent to which he will commit himself to tax cuts. The risks of going out on a limb and making an unsustainable promise comparable to his 'read my lips, no new taxes,' pledge of four years ago are well understood. The more likely approach is a general commitment to reducing taxes in a second term as progress is made towards cutting the federal budget deficit. But this middle way might be seen as ineffective, much as Mr Bush's past speeches on the economy have been. An ABC News-Washington Post poll released yesterday, the first nationwide survey of voting preferences conducted since the party's convention opened, showed Mr Bush dropped two points in the last week, leaving him trailing Mr Clinton by 58 to 33 per cent. Republican leaders had forecast Mr Clinton's lead would be halved by the convention's conclusion.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD COOKING: BREAKFAST;  </P> <P> TO MAKE AN OMELET, FIRST YOU BREAK A FEW EGGS  </P> <P> When it comes to fast-food preparations, no option is easier than an omelet.  </P> <P> The reasons are obvious: Most people keep eggs on hand, so there's no need for  last-minute shopping. And once you've got the eggs, there is no limit to the  range of ingredients that can be tossed in with them to make an omelet. Omelets  have other attributes. They are inexpensive. They are appropriate at any hour  of the day or night; they cook in about three minutes. And, with a little  practice, they are incredibly easy to make.  </P> <P> What goes into the omelet is limited only by the imagination and inventiveness  of the cook. Simple combinations -- such as a handful of fresh herbs or  leftover potatoes -- create peasant omelets. Mix those potatoes with Swiss  cheese and you have an omelette savoyarde. Saute some onions, add a little red  wine vinegar and butter and you've got an omelette Lyonnaise.  </P> <P> Scraps of smoked salmon mixed with sour cream and sliced green onions make an  elegant omelet. Leftover pasta with sauce or sandwich fillings, such as chicken  or tuna in mayonnaise, make surprisingly tasty additions to the basic omelet.  Leftover fresh vegetables make such wonderful omelets that it's worth cooking  extras with dinner so you can turn them into an omelet the next day.  </P> <P> My basic omelet recipe uses one whole egg and three egg whites, which makes the  omelet lower in cholesterol than the whole-egg version. It looks like the real  thing, but the taste and texture are lighter than its classic counterpart. For  those who require cholesterol-free foods, the all-egg-white omelet is a  delicious answer. And when you're feeling really reckless, the go-for-it  country omelet is completely satisfying.  </P> <P> The secret to successful omelet rolling is simple. All it requires is some  practice. For batterie de cuisine, you'll need: one mixing bowl, one whisk, one  dinner fork, one firm plastic spatula, one plate and one omelet pan, preferably  non-stick and 7 inches across the flat bottom, with shallow sloping sides and a  long handle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BASIC OMELET  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 3 egg whites  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon water  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> Heat butter in 7-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium high heat. Place egg and  egg whites in mixing bowl with water, salt and pepper. Whisk until smooth,  without any egg white lumps.  </P> <P> When butter is sizzling hot but not browned, add eggs. Keep heat at medium  high. Shake pan back and forth, holding it flat on burner.  </P> <P> Once bottom layer of omelet is set, simultaneously stir surface of eggs rapidly  with fork without disturbing cooked bottom, accomplished by holding fork tines  parallel with bottom of pan. Keep eggs in motion in this manner until almost  set, about 1 minute. Then add filling, if any, on omelet half nearest pan  handle.  </P> <P> Cover pan to fully cook eggs through, about 1 more minute. Uncover pan and  grasp handle firmly with hand turned palm up. Tilt pan up and insert firm  spatula under omelet nearest handle and roll onto heated plate. Omelet can be  held in 200-degree oven several minutes while other omelets are cooked. Makes 1  serving.  </P> <P>  This is a most refreshing omelet option, working well for breakfast, brunch,  lunch or even as dessert after a very simple, light meal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> FRESH STRAWBERRY OMELET  </P> <P> 1/2 pint strawberries, hulled  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons sugar (use more if berries are tart)  </P> <P> Grated zest of 1/4 orange  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon orange juice  </P> <P> 2 large eggs  </P> <P> 6 large egg whites  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> Additional strawberries for garnish  </P> <P> Quarter half of strawberries (or cut into eighths, if large). Toss with 1  tablespoon sugar, orange zest and juice in small bowl. Puree remaining 1/4 pint  strawberries with 1 tablespoon sugar in food processor or blender.  </P> <P> Whisk eggs, egg whites, water and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in mixing bowl  until smooth.  </P> <P> Heat 1 tablespoon butter in 7-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium high heat  until sizzling hot but not browned. Add half of egg mixture. Shake pan back and  forth on burner. Once bottom of omelet is cooked, use fork to simultaneously  stir uncooked surface of omelet without scraping bottom of pan.  </P> <P> When eggs are almost set, about 1 minute, use slotted spoon to arrange half of  cut strawberries (reserve juices) on omelet nearest to pan handle. Cover pan  and cook eggs until fully set, about 1 more minute. Uncover pan, grasp handle  firmly with hand turned palm up. Tilt pan up and insert firm spatula under  omelet nearest handle and roll onto heated plate. Keep warm in 200-degree oven.  </P> <P> Repeat steps with remaining omelet. Combine reserved strawberry juices with  pureed sauce. Spoon sauce over omelets, dividing evenly. Garnish with  strawberries. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings.  </P> <P>  A well-seasoned puree mixed only with beaten egg whites is a delicious option  for those on cholesterol-free diets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> SPINACH-AND-GARLIC NO-CHOLESTEROL OMELET  </P> <P> 1/2 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed completely  </P> <P> 4 teaspoons light-tasting olive oil  </P> <P> 1 large clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 large shallot, minced  </P> <P> 4 large egg whites  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup prepared marinara sauce, heated, optional  </P> <P> Squeeze spinach dry in cloth towel (measures 1/3 cup).  </P> <P> Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in 7-inch non-stick omelet pan over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and shallot and heat through, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and heat  through, about 1 minute. Transfer to blender or food processor. Add 1 egg white  and mix until smooth.  </P> <P> Using mixer, beat remaining 3 egg whites with salt until they hold shape but  are still glossy. Fold in spinach mixture and season to taste with pepper.  </P> <P> Heat remaining olive oil in pan until sizzling. Transfer omelet mixture to pan,  spreading evenly with spatula. Cover and cook until well set, about 3 minutes.  Uncover pan, grasp handle firmly with hand turned palm up. Tilt pan up and  insert firm spatula under omelet nearest handle and roll onto heated plate.  Serve immediately with marinara sauce, if desired. Makes 1 serving.  </P> <P>  This traditional omelet has everything going for it, making the splurge well  worth it. It's a recipe that can be easily doubled or tripled.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Unpalatable facts sink in at Central Office AN UNCOMFORTABLE truth has slowly dawned on Conservative Central Office: in the propaganda war over taxes and middle-income C2 voters, the government was upstaged by Labour's shadow Budget and has failed to regain the initiative. The Tories must persuade these lower-income and middle-income voters that Labour is the party of high taxation. But Labour has ensured that these voters gain more from its Budget package of benefit and tax increases than from the Conservative Budget. Moreover, by releasing the precise details of its tax and spending assumptions Labour has ensured that their impact can be independently verified. Labour can both assert that eight out of 10 families will gain from its Budget and cite the Institute for Fiscal Studies as the source of this claim. The IFS analysis shows that the majority of families will be better off under Labour than the Conservatives. The richest 10 per cent of the population will be much worse off with Labour's top tax rates. But they would still be taxed less than they were in 1979. The Tory strategy relies on persuading the electorate that Labour's plans are not what they seem. Yesterday they relaunched their 'Labour's tax-bombshell' campaign, claiming that Labour intends to increase the basic tax rate from 25p to 37 1/2 p. Conservative Central Office claims to have discovered 37 uncosted spending pledges in Labour's manifesto which it believes add up to an extra Pounds 37.9bn annually by the last year of a full parliament, at current prices. They then assume that Labour plans to finance this extra spending by raising the basic rate of tax. Labour denies this will be the case. Its shadow Budget pledged only Pounds 3.3bn of extra spending in 1992-93 and Pounds 6.8bn in 1993-94 - mainly on higher pensions and child benefit - financed by a 19 percentage point increase in the top marginal rate of tax. Extra spending would be permitted only as economic growth allowed. The Conservatives have to persuade the voters that Labour will not be able to contain its spending ambitions. It can only succeed if the gainers from Labour's Budget can be persuaded that they will actually be worse off under Labour. If the Tory claims are true, extra tax would be paid by lower-income and middle-income earners. A married couple with two children on Pounds 14,000 a year would lose Pounds 551, while the average Sun-reading family earning Pounds 14,200 would be Pounds 697 a year worse off. Labour has also supplemented its analysis with specific examples designed to show its proposals in the best light. Labour tends to focus on families with two moderate income earners because the rise in higher tax rates hits single-earner families harder. The 'Robinsons in Hampstead', for example, have two children and a combined income of Pounds 43,500. If this gross income is earned equally by the two parents the family is more than Pounds 150 a year better off under Labour. But a single-earner family with an income of Pounds 40,000 a year would lose under Labour. Tory tax comparisons always highlight single-earner families. The opinion poll evidence suggests that the Tories' 'bombshell' has failed to explode, in spite of repeated launches. The problem for the Tories is that both parties have made promises during the campaign which they will find difficult to keep over the next few years. Labour's aim to increase public spending does not look any more or less realistic than the Tories' desire to cut taxes. Yesterday Mr Major said that the government plans to 'make progress - year by year - towards a 20p basic rate for all' by increasing the width of the new lower tax band. Yet the government's Budget plans allowed no room for tax cuts until 1995-96 unless it were to cuts spending or increase borrowing further.</p>

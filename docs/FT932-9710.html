			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (10): Lessons from earlier pact - The nuts and bolts WHEN US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators sat down to produce a framework for the North American Free Trade Agreement, they had three years of experience to draw on from the US-Canadian pact. The first trade accord had worked well in most areas and had successfully boosted trade. The bipartisan dispute settlement mechanism had been successful in defusing a number of disputes - more often to the Canadians' liking than the Americans' - but both sides saw the need for important 'clarifications' for the process of reviewing anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases, said Mr Jules Katz, former Deputy US Trade Representative. Both agreements stress that 'consultation' is the best way to resolve disputes, but they set timetables for settlement. In the Nafta, if a dispute is not settled within 30 to 45 days, a government can request a meeting of the cabinet-level, three-member free trade commission. If the commission cannot solve a dispute, a panel is selected from a roster of trade, legal and other experts. Most cases were expected to concern all three countries, Mr Katz said. Panels have four months to decide an issue and if a dispute is not resolved within 30 days after that decision, then the injured country can impose sanctions. On the rules of origin question, there had been even more controversy and even more concern about 'the pass-through' potential for foreign businesses using Mexico as an export platform to the north. The US and Canada, having fallen into a dispute about the level of domestic content in Hondas, were both anxious to clarify the means of calculating the level of North American content. Negotiators apparently learned well their lessons from the FTA. When the agreement was finished, the Industry Policy Advisory Committee which advises Congress on the impact of trade agreements, gave an enthusiastic thumbs up: 'The Nafta rules of origin have a level of clarity and detail for which the negotiators should be congratulated,' the advisers said. 'The Nafta customs provisions represent an improvement over the FTA and provide a sound basis for regulating and classifying goods.' Basically, goods are considered to be made in North America if they are manufactured there or products from elsewhere have been 'substantially transformed' so that they are moved to a different tariff classification. Special rules were devised for vehicles, computers and textiles. To meet the concerns of Canada, which wants to give its vehicle factory-owners time to adjust to stricter rules, the local content standard will remain 50 per cent for four years, the current minimum under the FTA. It will then rise to 56 per cent for four more years and reach 62.5 per cent after eight years. Mexico will phase out its 20 per cent computer tariff for the US and Canada and will seek to harmonise its external tariff with the US and Canada, lowering it to 3.9 per cent for all other countries. Computers will be required to contain a North American-made motherboard, a big component that usually accounts for 20-40 per cent of the value of the computer. Mexico will phase out its tariffs for US and Canadian-made textiles and apparel over five or six years. To qualify for tariff benefits, blue jeans, blouses and other apparel will have to be made from yarn spun in North America, and fabric would have to be made from North American fibres. Canada and Mexico will be allowed to ship a specified amount of clothing and textiles made from foreign materials to the US each year; the quota will rise slightly over five years. The Nafta - building on much of the work done in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - has a high level of obligations on intellectual property rights. Mexico agreed to protect foreign-registered patents for pharmaceutical and other products for at least 20 years. This has been met with some grumbling among elderly Americans, many of whom send couriers to purchase large quantities of cheap medicine in Mexico. Copyright protection for films, records and television will meet international standards. One remaining problem is the illegal pirating of satellite television broadcasts by Mexican cable systems. However, licensing contracts with the systems have remedied the problem for the time being. On investment, Mexico has agreed to liberalise many of its restrictions and to treat US and Canadian companies equal in most areas. Mexican liberalism has spurred a 10 per cent rise in foreign investment this year. During the first two months of 1993, more than Dollars 1.68bn was invested in Mexican manufacturing, services, retail, transportation, communications and stocks. The US accounted for more than half of the total investment, followed by the UK, France, Spain and Canada.</p>

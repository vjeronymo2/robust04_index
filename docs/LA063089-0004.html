			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TO OFFER ITS OWN LEASH LAW  </P> <P> A Hermosa Beach City Council majority, contending that a group of dog owners is  seeking an exemption from the leash law under the guise of an open-space  initiative, has added its own ballot measure. It would designate a 20-acre  railroad right of way as parkland but ban unleashed dogs from the strip.  </P> <P> The council-sponsored measure for the November ballot was adopted on a split  vote Tuesday. It will compete with the initiative circulated by Watchdog, a  group that formed in March after the council decided to apply the leash law on  the Santa Fe Railway right of way once the city acquires ownership later this  year.  </P> <P> Both initiatives would designate the railroad strip as open space that could  never be used for residential, commercial or other development.  </P> <P> However, the Watchdog initiative, which easily qualified for the ballot, would  allow unleashed dogs on the strip, whereas the council measure would bar them.  </P></p>

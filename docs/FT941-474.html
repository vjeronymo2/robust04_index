			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Buy-out teams emerge in British Coal ahead of privatisation Several potential management buy-out teams are emerging within British Coal as the corporation prepares to publish preliminary information next month about the five areas on offer for privatisation. None of the possible bids involves executive board members, although at least one regional director, Mr Alan Houghton of the central north region containing most of the Yorkshire pits, is believed to be interested in leading a bid for the mines he manages. According to Coal UK, the Financial Times newsletter, Mr Bob Siddall, director of British Coal's opencast operations, is studying the possibility of bidding for all deep-mine areas in England. Mr Jeff Ainley, manager of the Hatfield pit near Doncaster, has also told British Coal of his interest in leading a management buy-out of the pit. Separate bids are thought to be under consideration by managers in Wales and Scotland for the regions in which they operate. British Coal would not comment yesterday on whether any managers had notified the chairman of their interests. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told the Commons yesterday that the corporation had given instructions to employees to ensure that no potential purchasers were given preferential access to information before privatisation.</p>

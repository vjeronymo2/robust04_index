			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to reports, the United States is  deliberately driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a  war phase [kyehoekchoguro chosonbandoui chongserul chonjaeng  kungmyonero moragago issumnida] after rupturing the DPRK-U.S.  talks.    As has been learned, the United States completely turned  over  [chonmyon twijibo opko] the agreement reached at the New York  DPRK-U.S. contact and broke up [patansikigo] the third round of  the DPRK-U.S. talks. Nevertheless, the United States poses open  [nogolhwa] military threats and pressure against us under unjust  pretexts, shifting the responsibility for the rupture of the  talks to us.    U.S. President Clinton made a very provocative order [maeu  tobalchogin myongnyong] to deploy 192 Patriot missiles in South  Korea as soon as the DPRK-U.S. talks came to a rupture, as  though he had been waiting for it.    The U.S. Department of Defense said that a Patriot missile  battalion with some 40 missile launching ramps and 850 soldiers  was going to move from Texas, the United States, to South Korea,  according to the order. The U.S. measure of deploying Patriot  missiles in South Korea is threatening and extremely agitating  [simhi chaguk]. It is a kind of declaration of overall  confrontation with us [urie taehan ilchongui chonmyon taegyol  sonon], a declaration of war.    According to the U.S. newspaper WASHINGTON POST dated 22  March, the U.S. Administration is plotting a scheme to take  next-stage military steps against us [urirul pandaehanun taum  tangyeui kunsajok chochidurul chwiharyogo hoekchukhago  issumnida].    Following the decision to deploy Patriot missiles, the U.S.  Administration is trying to dispatch additional U.S. military  forces to South Korea, to move and deploy U.S. aircraft carriers  along the coastline of the Korean peninsula, and to arm the U.S.  Forces in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Army with new  military equipment.    The British newspaper EVENING STANDARD reported that a U.S.  naval fleet with 30 naval vessels was approaching an area where  it can reach our country's coast in 24 hours. This fleet has  two mobile aircraft carrier units and landing operations forces,  including the Marine Corps, aboard.    According to Japan's MAINICHI SHIMBUN dated 19 March, the  U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson lately  departed from Japan's Yokosuka Port with six escort ships and is  maintaining a mobile posture heading toward the Korean peninsula.    Prior to this, the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence led by  the Mobile Bay, an Aegis missile cruiser; (?Bainbridge), a  guided missile cruiser; and two frigates had called at Port  Yokosuka. They are also preparing against a possible case by  standing by within the reach of the Korean peninsula.    Meanwhile, the U.S. warmongers are openly disclosing its  plot  to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, and the  bellicose remarks on the Team Spirit continue to resound from  the Congress.    The Democratic whip leader in the House of Representatives  and the Republican whip leader in the Senate, in an interview  with NBC Television, raved that the United States should resume  the Team Spirit joint military exercise so as to impose pressure  on North Korea by actually carrying it out.    We cannot but say such ill-boding military moves, containing  the danger of a war provocation, will only bring out vigilance  [undanghan kyonggaesim].</p>

His arrival was preceded by direct telephone contacts between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and between President al-Asad and  King Husayn and President al-Hirawi. An agreement was reached  to invite the Arab parties concerned with the peace process to  hold a meeting soon in order to consider resuming the Washington  talks in light of UN Security Council Resolution 904. This  resolution strongly denounces the Israeli massacre at the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque. It calls for international protection for the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories and for the  concentration of efforts to push the peace process forward.    The fact is that Syrian-U.S. contacts have been active since  the recent Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton.  The U.S. Administration clearly announced that Syria is playing  a basic role in making the peace process a success and that  Syria exerted major efforts to prevent the collapse of this  process after the atrocious Hebron massacre. All members of the  international community took the Hebron events and their  negative impact on the peace process very seriously. This  horrible massacre affirms to the entire world the need to end  Israeli occupation of Arab territory and to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the Madrid  formula and Security Council resolutions.    Israeli prevarication for the past 27 months has prevented  any real progress. It is no longer acceptable on both the Arab  and international levels. It is time for Israel to stop playing  with its bargaining chips. Either it demonstrates real  involvement in the peace process and a clear commitment to its  bases and requirements, or it frankly rejects this process.  Real involvement means, first and foremost, a firm pledge to  withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for peace.  Rejection will mean pushing the region to the verge of an  explosion. It will represent a blatant disregard of all  international efforts and of international legitimacy principles  and charters.    Syria has always shouldered its responsibilities toward  peace  and has been loyal to UN principles and resolutions. It has  worked with all its strength to make the U.S. initiative a  success. On several occasions, it effectively contributed to  rescuing this initiative from Israel's plots. The meeting  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in Geneva gave a strong  push to the peace process.    However, instead of responding to the spirit of Geneva and  its results, Israel intentionally cast doubts. The result was  the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that shook the conscience of  the world and confirmed the need to move the peace process  beyond the impasse caused by Israeli intransigence.    Since the start of the U.S. initiative, Syria has made it  clear that peace in the region depends on ending Israeli  occupation. Peace cannot prevail if it does not provide right  and justice and does not end Israel's attacks and its repressive  and settlement practices.    Syria has repeatedly said peace and occupation cannot  coexist. Partial and incomplete solutions that do not end the  occupation and remove the settlements will not bring the region  any closer to peace. Instead, they will push it away from  peace. Indeed, Syria has stressed that such solutions are time  bombs. There is no solution except a just and comprehensive  solution that restores the territories and rights and realizes a  firm and real peace -- the peace of the brave.    All events in the Middle East confirm the soundness of the  Syrian stand and reinforce the international conviction that  Syria's concept of peace is a sound, comprehensive, and  integrated concept. The Oslo agreement was not only obstructed,  it led directly to the Hebron massacre. Future developments  will not be any less negative if Israel does not submit to the  will of the international community and complies with the bases  of the Madrid conference that stipulate achieving a just and  comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict based on  Security Council resolutions.    Syria, along with all the Arabs, are seekers of a real  peace.  The ball is in Israel's court. Israel must choose between peace  and occupation, between security and aggression, between  stability and settlement, and between becoming a member of the  international community and the law of the jungle and the  declaration of a war on human values, principles, and laws.</p>

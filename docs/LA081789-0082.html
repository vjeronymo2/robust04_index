			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIRUT SHELLING CONTINUES DESPITE U.N. CALL FOR PEACE  </P> <P> The Christian commander of Lebanon's army welcomed a U.N. call to halt  increasingly fierce fighting in Lebanon, but there was no official word  Wednesday from Syrian-backed Muslim forces, who have ringed Christian territory  with guns and armor.  </P> <P> Fierce shelling erupted Wednesday across the so-called Green Line that divides  Beirut, Lebanon's capital, into Muslim and Christian sectors, after a short  period of relative calm.  </P> <P> Syrian gunners also shelled the Christian enclave north and east of Beirut, and  the Christians responded by firing on residential areas of mostly Muslim West  Beirut. Several apparently unoccupied apartment houses in the Muslim sector  were set ablaze. Six people were wounded in Christian territory, police  reported.  </P> <P> The cease-fire appeal was issued late Tuesday by the U.N. Security Council in  New York. The resolution was approved during an emergency meeting called by  U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Christian commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said, "The  general unconditionally welcomes the U.N. Security Council resolution."  However, he added that the general views the resolution as a "package deal" --  meaning that Syrian forces besieging the Christian enclave would have to lift  their blockade for the resolution to take effect.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from the gutted presidential palace at Baabda, Aoun  affirmed that he welcomes the Security Council's statement but reserves for  himself "the natural right for self-defense."  </P> <P> Syria has not officially replied to the U.N. appeal, although President Hafez  Assad, in a message to the Italian government released in Rome, promised to do  his utmost "to silence the guns and promote, as far as possible, an  inter-Lebanese agreement."  </P> <P> Assad's letter, received Tuesday, was in response to a message sent Aug. 2 by  Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, according to an Italian official.  </P> <P> Five months of artillery duels between the Syrians and the 20,000-member force  headed by Aoun have killed more than 750 people and wounded more than 2,000,  nearly all of them civilians.  </P> <P> The U.N. resolution said, in part: "The Council . . . urgently appeals to all  the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and  shelling on land and sea."  </P> <P> It also appealed for the parties "to do everything possible to secure the  consolidation of the cease-fire, the opening of the lines of communication and  the lifting of sieges."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Senseless Bloodshed'  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher read a statement that  said, in part: "The senseless bloodshed . . . has gone on for far too long, and  it must cease. We urge in the strongest terms that all parties abide by the  council's call for a total and immediate cease-fire."  </P> <P> Aoun, whose offices have been repeatedly hit in the recent fighting, calls  Syrian troops an occupation army and has declared a "war of liberation" to  drive them out. Syria has about 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League  peacekeeping mandate granted in 1976, the year after the sectarian civil war  began.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Muslim security sources said the Muslim allies moved more tanks,  troops and ammunition up to their positions along the 65-mile confrontation  line with Aoun's outnumbered forces.  </P> <P> One said the Syrians deployed Soviet-designed T-62 tanks on the northern and  eastern flanks of the 310-square-mile Christian zone and that Druze chieftain  Walid Jumblatt positioned scores of T-54 and T-55 tanks in the mountains to the  south. The Christian area faces the Mediterranean on the west.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Druze Jeeps in West Beirut  </P> <P> Druze fighters, seen manning jeep-mounted machine guns and recoilless cannons,  were seen in West Beirut for the first time since Syrian troops moved into the  Muslim sector in February, 1987, to stop factional war among militias.  </P> <P> The Lebanese capital has taken the brunt of the battle. All but 150,000 of its  1.5 million people have left since the shelling began in early March.  </P> <P> Acting Lebanese Premier Salim Hoss, who is a Sunni Muslim, and Sunni religious  leaders also embraced the U.N. truce appeal, which was broadcast by Beirut  radio stations.  </P> <P> "On behalf of all the suffering people, who are the majority of the population  in Lebanon, I welcome the cease-fire," Hoss said.  </P> <P> Hoss added, however, that Aoun should end his "war of liberation" against Syria  and that Syria's allies should end their blockade on the Christian enclave.  </P> <P> Hoss and Aoun lead competing Muslim and Christian Cabinets, formed during a  government crisis in September, 1988, that also led to a split of the army into  Christian and Muslim commands.  </P> <P> The artillery war began two days after Aoun's forces blockaded illegal ports  run by Muslim militias that deprived the government of about $100 million a  year in customs revenue.  </P> <P> On Wednesday night, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati returned to  Tehran from Damascus after assuring Syria and its Lebanese allies of his  country's support. Velayati met Lebanese and Muslim leftist leaders one by one  at the Iranian Embassy in the Syrian capital after presiding over a session  with various militia leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meetings With Militias  </P> <P> Among the militia leaders who took part were Druze leader Jumblatt, Nabih Berri  of the Shiite Muslim Amal militia and Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a Syrian-based Palestinian  group that has been implicated in terrorist incidents. Also attending was  Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh.  </P> <P> Cease-fires in Beirut seldom last, and few Lebanese appeared to believe that  the U.N. resolution would have much impact unless the underlying political  disputes are solved.  </P> <P> "It seems we are heading for a new confrontation despite this cease-fire call;  the militias are back," said Talal Hosseini, watching his janitor fill plastic  bags with sand to fortify the entrance of his apartment house.  </P> <P> Another resident, Adla Haroun, commented: "It is yet another call which will go  down the drain. If U.N. resolutions were effective, all wars across the world  would have ended by now."  </P></p>

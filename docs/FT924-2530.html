			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Clinton brings in the economic heavyweights: Talented line-up will attack budget deficit GETTING legislation through Congress and reassuring Wall Street appear to have been President-elect Bill Clinton's dominant concerns in assembling a talented and remarkably conservative economic team. As expected, the two top jobs go to Democratic congressional heavyweights, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Mr Leon Panetta, a congressman from California, who were named treasury secretary and budget director. As former chairmen of the Senate finance committee and the House budget committee respectively, they appear ideally suited to shepherd sensitive economic and social legislation through Congress. Wall Street is strongly represented, with Mr Robert Rubin, a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, becoming special assistant to the president for economic policy, and Mr Roger Altman, an investment banker at the Blackstone Group, named as Mr Bentsen's deputy at the Treasury. The only professional economist in the team announced yesterday was Ms Alice Rivlin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who will serve as deputy to Mr Panetta at the Office of Management and Budget. The biggest surprise was that Mr Clinton did not name the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in his first batch of appointments. In previous administrations, the CEA chairman has served as part of a 'troika' of advisers to the president, alongside the treasury secretary and budget director. But Mr Clinton said he intended the CEA to have 'more of an influence in terms of ideas' than in the past. He also wanted to elevate the role in economic policy-making of other departments, such as energy and commerce. Speculation about CEA chair yesterday centred on Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an industrial and trade policy expert at the University of California at Berkeley, and Mr Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, who is opposed by some environmentalists because of an insensitive memo he wrote at the bank. However, Mr Clinton's mention of the importance of ideas could indicate that his old friend Mr Robert Reich, who heads the economic transition team, is still in the running. The biggest innovation was the appointment of Mr Rubin to head a new economic council within the White House. This is intended to play a role analogous to that of the National Security Council and represents an attempt to bring economic policy to the same level of prominence within the White House as foreign affairs and defence - all topics which have tended to preoccupy past presidents. Mr Clinton will chair the economic council, whose members will include relevant cabinet officers, such as the commerce secretary, as well as the other members of the economic team named yesterday. Some academics, however, fear that the new council could overshadow the CEA. Mr Rubin regards his main task as co-ordinating economic policy. Mr Clinton yesterday compared his role to that of General Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser, and played down the possibility of any conflict between Mr Rubin and Mr Bentsen, making it clear that the treasury secretary would be the administration's senior spokesman on economics after the president. The team boasts a wealth of experience and a long institutional memory. Mr Bentsen and Mr Panetta have played leading roles for over a decade in framing congressional economic and budget policies. Ms Rivlin is remembered as a highly competent and fiercely independent director of the CBO from 1975 to 1983. Mr Altman served in the Treasury during the Carter administration. Mr Rubin has all-round financial expertise as co-chairman of one Wall Street's most successful investment banks. Mr Bentsen's widely trailed appointment as treasury secretary was welcomed in US business and financial circles. If he and Mr Panetta have a weakness, it is lack of experience in international economic policy-making. However, the Wall Street appointees are both knowledgeable about foreign economies and financial markets. The overall composition of the team suggests considerable stress will be laid on measures to improve the economy's long-term competitiveness. All members of the team are known to regard budget deficit reduction as a priority. The OMB duo of Mr Panetta and Ms Rivlin is likely to prove especially hawkish on fiscal policy. Mr Clinton was at pains yesterday to emphasise two points: he remains the administration's chief economic decision maker, the 'ultimate arbiter' of policy; and he puts a premium on co-operative teamwork - something obviously lacking in the Bush administration. He appeared justifiably pleased with his handiwork: on paper at least, he is fielding the strongest economic team of any recent president, one which is likely to gain the respect of Republicans as well as Democrats.</p>

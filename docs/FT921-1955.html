			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Japanese banks Japan's banks have so far reacted with surprising calm to the long slide in domestic equity prices. After all, it was widely predicted last year that their capital bases would be so weakened by a Nikkei index at 20,000 that they would be unable to meet the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) capital adequacy requirements. The ensuing clawback of overseas assets appeared to threaten a worldwide financial crisis. While the banks' capital position is now just outside the long-run BIS target, it appears they have barely responded. That is partly because the weak trend of the yen has made the repatriation of assets an unattractive method of boosting capital. But there is also a growing sense among the banks that BIS standards only matter where banks have unfulfilled overseas lending ambitions. In other words, at present they scarcely matter at all - capital ratios can always be rebuilt once the domestic crisis has been resolved. The lack of concern on international markets does not mean the original thesis was wrong, however. The world credit scene has been hit by the Japanese lenders' spontaneous withdrawal over the last two years, but they still have considerable lending outstanding. If the stock market goes down much further, the world could yet receive a nasty fright.</p>

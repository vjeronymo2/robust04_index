			<p>BFN     [Text] The second plenary session of the National  Assembly's first legislature was opened on the morning of 5  April 1994 and closed in the same morning because it did not  agree on two of the four items on the agenda proposed by the  National Assembly's Standing Committee.    The four items on the agenda of the Assembly meeting are: 1/  the message from Cambodia's king; 2/ the report by the National  Assembly's Standing Committee; 3/ the discussion and decision on  the invalidation of the status of the people's representatives  and the validity of new assembly members; and 4/ other matters.    Before the opening of the session, the third item attracted  the most attention because it was expected that the Assembly  would discuss the cases of 17 members who will leave the  assembly as they are taking up public positions which are  incompatible with the role of assembly members. The assembly  was also expected to examine the validity of 17 new members.  Due to differences in the views concerning the wording of the  agenda, the third item was withdrawn. This difference of views  stemmed from the words "invalidity of assembly members' status"  which many members thought improper, as the wording seems to  look down on those who are leaving the assembly. Objection was  also raised concerning the fourth item over the wording "other  matters." A large number of assembly members demanded to know  precisely what these matters are.    There were two conflicting views on the third and fourth  items. A minority view held that the wording can be changed;  however, the majority objected. This objection led to the  withdrawal of items three and four and the meeting closed  cheerlessly after listening to the king's message and the report  by the National Assembly's Standing Committee.    It is worth noting that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh,  first prime minister, attended this session but Samdech Hun Sen,  second prime minister, did not, for health reasons.    His Excellency Loy Simchheang, acting National Assembly  chairman, said at this meeting that it was almost the day the  meeting was due to open and yet the National Assembly's Standing  Committee seemed to have found nothing of importance to include  in the agenda...[ellipsis as published]    This was probably why this session's agenda is so short.    Earlier, it was expected that the immigration law, the new  investment law, the press law, the bill on the Supreme Council  of Judges, the 1994 state plan ... [ellipsis as published] would  also be discussed at this session.    However, what was planned and what some personalities have  disclosed were not raised in the agenda of the second National  Assembly's plenary session following a three-month recess. Some  Assembly officials said that the fact that the session does not  have any bills for the National Assembly to debate and decide  upon was due to the delay in forwarding those bills from the  government to the National Assembly's Standing Committee so that  these can be included in the agenda.    Analysts say that there seemed to be something hidden in  this  movement to object to the third item concerning the switching of  Assembly members.    An assembly member from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for  an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] is  of the opinion that this switching of Assembly members "is  complex and that there is certainly no way out." However, what  people did not expect was the fact that this issue has not even  been resolved at its agenda stage.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Ted Turner expresses interest in buying CBS Mr Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, the cable television group, yesterday said he was interested in buying CBS. His comments intensified speculation over the future of the US television broadcasting network. However, Mr Turner also said he would be interested in acquiring either of the other two main US networks, ABC and NBC. Speaking in St Petersburg, Russia, where he is attending the Goodwill Games, Mr Turner said a merger between Turner Broadcasting - which owns various cable stations in the US, including CNN - and one of the big three broadcast networks would make good business sense. 'It's very, very logical for us to be in that business.' He said a merger with CBS would be especially attractive. 'It'd give us a network. We'd be in the same position that ABC is with ESPN in sports. We would have both cable networks and a broadcast network.' Mr Turner remarked that Turner could afford to buy CBS. 'One reason we're being taken seriously is our market capitalisation varies between a low of Dollars 8bn and a high of Dollars 9bn or Dollars 10bn in the last year, and CBS was just over Dollars 5bn before they did their buy-back.' Although Mr Turner told reporters he had no plans at the moment to bid for a network, his comments lifted CBS shares Dollars 2 3/4 to close at Dollars 314 3/4 on Wall Street, where traders and investors have been speculating in recent weeks over whether CBS would be acquired by another company. That speculation was sparked by the collapse in mid-July of the network's planned Dollars 7.1bn merger with QVC, the home-shopping television channel run by Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment industry executive. The deal with QVC fell through after the cable systems company Comcast, a big QVC shareholder which had been unhappy about the planned merger with CBS, unexpectedly launched a rival bid for the home-shopping channel. Although Mr Laurence Tisch, CBS's chairman, insisted after the merger's collapse that his network was not for sale, industry analysts said the company was vulnerable to a hostile bid from a big US entertainment group. Among the possible suitors mentioned were the Walt Disney group, Tele-Communications, the large cable group, and Turner Broadcasting. CBS has the highest-rated programmes on US television among the big three networks. However, a series of setbacks this year - including the loss of the rights to televise American football games to Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, and the defection of several important affiliate stations, also to Fox - has damaged morale and led to renewed criticism of Mr Tisch's management. In particular, Mr Tisch has been attacked for maintaining CBS as a pure television broadcasting business, and not diversifying, like ABC and NBC, into the rapidly-expanding cable television market.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> PROGRAM OPENING DOORS TO COLLEGE  </P> <P> For some students at Anaheim High School, getting to college has been little  more than a dream. But a program called University Preparation is helping  college become a reality for about 70 students.  </P> <P> The high school, part of the Anaheim Union High School District where  achievement test scores are often among the lowest in the county, started the  program 5 years ago to encourage Latino students who might not otherwise think  about college as a goal.  </P> <P> "Many of our kids will be the first in their families to graduate from high  school, let alone go to college," said Jeannie Beckett, a teacher who works  with the program. "So the idea of even going to college was way out there."  </P> <P> At Anaheim High, 80% of the students are Latinos, and many come from low-income  families "so the students have a lot of other stresses and a lot of other  responsibilities," said Beckett.  </P> <P> For half of every school day, the students attend courses in math, English,  sciences and social studies in smaller classes with special teachers who are  familiar with the aptitude and progress of each student.  </P> <P> About 70 students participate in the program every year. Last June, the first  group that started as freshmen graduated. Sixty-three of the graduates went on  to college, contrasted with less than a dozen in previous years.  </P> <P> Similar programs at eight other schools in California were started with state  grant funding. But after three years, when state funding was cut, most of the  other programs folded. The Anaheim program continues.  </P> <P> Carmela Harvey, coordinator of school relations at Cal State Fullerton -- where  the majority of the Anaheim graduates take classes -- said the Anaheim program  and others like it are keys to helping students get into and stay in college.  </P> <P> "You're looking at educating a population that maybe was ignored. . . . At  least they need to know that somewhere down the road college can be an option,"  said Harvey. "Programs like that, coupled with other programs, certainly  enhance the students' preparation."  </P> <P> The program is beginning to recruit from the junior high schools, and will  begin again this fall.

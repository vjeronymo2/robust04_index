			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Yoshiaki Kato, NIHON KEIZAI </F> SHIMBUN Tokyo Bureau reporter: "Financial Condition of Local  Governments Deteriorating; Outstanding Balance of Loans Exceed  100 Trillion Yen"]  <H5>  [12 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] While the national budget is yet to be  deliberated on due to political confusion, financial conditions  at the local level are rapidly deteriorating. As reported in the  national government's local financial plans, the outstanding  balance of loans of all local governments will exceed 100  trillion yen in the fiscal year 1994 for the first time in  history. With a drastic reduction in tax revenues, more local  municipal bonds are steadily being issued to respond to requests  from the national government for more locally financed projects.  Although the economic outlook has somewhat improved, a rapid  economic growth cannot be expected in the future. Local  governments with large debts began to feel the sense of fiscal  crisis. Restructuring of operations, including a review of  personnel requirements, is likely to intensify.  <H5>  Debts Equaling 40 Percent of National Debts </H5>   A forecast of financial conditions compiled in mid-March by  the Tokyo Bureau of Finance was truly a "nightmarish scenario":  "Eight years from now in 2002, the financial condition of Tokyo  will fall down to that of associations with restrictions imposed  on their issuance of bonds." According to this estimate, ratio  of the cost of municipal bonds over the total amount of general  revenues will become double-digit in the fiscal year 1995,  moving up to 10.8 percent from 7.7 percent for the original  estimate for the fiscal year 1994. It is estimated to increase  gradually, reaching 20.6 percent in the fiscal year 2002.    Metropolitan Tokyo, which was once regarded as an affluent  self-governing community, is suffering from dwindling tax  revenues. According to its original budget, tax revenues for the  fiscal year 1994 will decrease by 7.7 percent from the previous  year. At their peak in the fiscal year 1989, funds for fiscal  adjustments and for redemption of bonds amounted to 450 billion  yen, but these are expected to be depleted entirely.    An executive at the Finance Bureau of Tokyo says, "To make  cautious estimates, we assumed a lower level of tax revenues and  a higher amount of bonds issuance." However, he looks worried,  saying, "During the Minobe administration when the fiscal  condition deteriorated most, ratio moved up more than the 10  percent range." As the estimate indicated that "ratio of  municipal bonds issuance in 2002 would exceed 20 percent target  range set by the Ministry of Home Affairs for imposition of  restrictions on issuance of bonds," its announcement was  postponed.    Those having difficulty in collecting tax revenues are not  limited to local governments in large cities that were directly  hit by the recession following the bubble economy. According to  budget for the fiscal year 1994 of each of four prefectures --  Akita, Shimane, Kochi, and Oita -- the cash flow from issuance  of municipal bonds exceeds that from tax revenues. This is  equivalent to a household that borrows money more than it earns  in salaries.    According to local governments' financial plans for the  fiscal year 1994, the balance of loans, including bonds for  public enterprises (which are born by local governments) and  loans from the special account for tax allocated to local  governments, increases dramatically to 102.83 trillion yen from  81.09 trillion yen for the fiscal year 1993. This means that  local governments will bear close to 40 percent of nation's  long-term liabilities of approximately 161 trillion yen.  <H5>  Distrustful of the National Government </H5>   The total amount of municipal bonds to be issued in the  fiscal year 1994 will be 10.39 trillion yen, an increase by 66.9  percent from the previous year. As a result, the degree of  dependence on municipal bonds is 13.1 percent, exceeding 12.6  percent registered in 1979 following the second oil shock.    The increase in issuance of municipal bonds is due to the  fact that local governments expanded the scope of their  independent projects in order to stimulate the economy and to  share the burden of the national government's fiscal crisis.  Ibaraki Prefecture increased the amount of its independent  projects by 23.5 percent, saying that "An economic recovery is  the first priority for the nation as a whole." Thirty-two  prefectures in total, including Hokkaido, Gunma, and Yamanashi,  had a double-digit increase in the amount of their independent  projects. According to fiscal plans for local governments,  annual growth rate for independent projects was 12.0 percent in  both fiscal years 1993 and 1994, surpassing greatly that of  total expenditures.    Governor Morihiko Hiramatsu of Oita Prefecture, whose 1994  budget shows more cash inflow from issuance of municipal bonds  than from tax revenues, says, "Many independent projects of  local governments should be carried out by the national  government through issuance of construction bonds. Local  governments are taking care of these, and municipal bonds are  like national bonds in disguise."    For the first time in 18 years, the Ministry of Home Affairs  has approved issuance of deficit-covering municipal bonds in the  amount of 1.6 trillion yen so as to make up for reduction in  income and resident taxes. Also, it has been providing  "guidance" to local governments to secure needed funds in  various ways -- bonds to supplement revenue reduction, loans  from the special account for tax allocated to local governments,  and so on. However, most of these loans are liabilities of local  governments, except for the portion that is to be paid by tax  allocated to local governments.    The Ministry of Home Affairs pretends to be calm about the  current financial conditions of local governments, saying,  "Aside from the question of medium- to long-term prospects, we  don't think current conditions to be deteriorating." However, a  local governmental official doesn't hide his feeling of distrust  toward the national government: "Under the guidance of the  national government, local governments are forced to make public  investments. However, there is no guaranty that these  investments will stimulate the economy, increase tax revenues,  and help pay for the cost of municipal bonds."  <H5>  Tax Revenues Can't Be Expected </H5>   Among local banks, which are the partners of local  governments, the following view is gaining strength: "The  scenario for redemption of municipal bonds that relies upon an  increase in tax revenues from an economic recovery will  eventually come to a halt." It has been suggested that potential  growth rate for the Japanese economy is becoming smaller.  Therefore, even though the prospect for an economic recovery is  gradually improving, a big increase in tax revenues as  experienced in the past cannot be expected. As a result of the  issuance of municipal bonds to expand the scope of their  independent projects to stimulate the economy, local governments  will be likely to face tight financial conditions in the mid- to  long-term future. They have become reflective: "We can't follow  the same old pattern of doing whatever the national budget  dictates" (per Governor Daijiro Hashimoto of Kochi Prefecture).  <H5>  [13 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] Administrative Reform Using Corporate Methods    As their fiscal conditions are affected by the recession and  getting tighter at an accelerated speed, some local governments  began to undertake restructuring of their operations.    Kobe City, which has been called "Kobe, Inc." because of its  corporation-like skills in managing its municipal affairs,  established a Headquarters for Promotion and Improvement of  Administrative and Fiscal Reform at the end of March [1994]. It  aims at consolidating offices with similar functions by making a  thorough review of its organization, which has become too  fragmented due to an expanded demand for administrative  services. It plans to make a massive cut in the number of  management positions. As the budgeted amount of revenues from  city taxes for the fiscal year 1994 decreases from that in the  previous year for the first time in 39 years, Mayor Kukitoshi  Sasayama says, "This time, we are going to be as cost conscious  as a private enterprise in tackling with our administrative  reform."    Governor Yoshinobu Ishikawa of Shizuoka Prefecture is also  aiming for an administrative reform by applying corporate  management methods. In January he established a "Conference to  Discuss the Ideal Way of Administration and Finance," inviting  representatives from the industrial circle. Based on suggestions  gathered from the conference, he eliminated 23 posts that were  judged to be "unnecessary" in the organizational reform in April.    The wave of restructuring is also pressing in on those local  governments that used to be considered affluent a few years ago.  In compiling budgets for the fiscal year 1994, Kanagawa  Prefecture has adopted a stringent standard that would cut the  budget for each section by 20 percent in principle from the  actual amount of spending in the previous year. In February  [1994] it decided to consolidate eight extra-governmental  organizations, including the association of prefectural parks.  Some officials in the prefectural government ask with a sigh,  "Do we really have to shed our blood to this extent?"    Some local governments are experiencing friction with their  labor unions over their restructuring plans. Matsumoto City in  Nagano Prefecture is the case in point. Late last year the city  revised its broad policies on administrative reform, and  announced its plan to reduce the number of work-site employees  gradually, including those in charge of collecting garbage and  preparing school lunches. Although the plan calls for a gradual  shift toward the use of private companies by not hiring new  employees to replace those who are retiring, negotiations with  the labor union became difficult. In March the Prefectural and  Local Labor Relations Commission became involved for the first  time in 32 years to mediate between the two parties.    According to the estimate by the city, garbage disposal per  ton costs 12,000 yen when done by the city, but it will cost  7,000 yen, about 60 percent of the current cost, when  commissioned to a private company. Although the friction with  the labor union still continues over the contents of an  agreement proposed by the Labor Relations Commission, Mayor  Tadashi Ariga went ahead with the original plan of not hiring  new employees to replace retirees in his personnel and  recruitment policy in April. He is determined to improve  efficiency by using private companies for their services.    Common among the local governments that began to implement  administrative reform is a belief that "If we don't make a  decisive action on administrative reform now, it will be too  late" (per Mayor Ariga). This belief is enforced by a critical  reconsideration of the bloated size of administrative  organization and the sense of crisis over increasing  administrative costs due to the aging society.  <H5>  The Swelling Number of Employees </H5>   The number of employees at local governments declined after  the fiscal year 1982, but it began to increase since the fiscal  year 1989, exceeding 1.16 million in general administrative  fields--the largest number in history. Although this increase  was caused in part by advance orders for public works and an  increase in work load required by the nation's laws and  regulations, some people say that "the bloated personnel cost is  putting a cap on an increase in the expenditure for general  construction projects" (per the Finance Division, Kanagawa  Prefecture).    The same is true for extra-governmental organizations.  Hokkaido began reviewing the extra-governmental organizations it  helps finance. One of the factors that prompted this review is a  research report compiled last fall by the Hokkaido Economic  Association. Out of 88 organizations, 39 had operating losses,  and 49 had been unable to eliminate their cumulative deficits.  Two organizations had been accumulating losses over 20 years  since their inception. Some people say that "there are some  public corporations whose operations are quite unclear to us"  (per the Hokkaido Economic Association).    As of January 1993, there were 6,659 extra-governmental  organizations financed for more than 25 percent [of their  equity] by respective local governments. The number of  organizations has increased by 40 percent over six years. Many  of these organizations had a bleak prospect for profitability  even at the time of their inception. One organization in Kochi  Prefecture, for example, retains 22 directors per a staff member.  <H5>  Unnecessary Operations Abound </H5>   In addition to the bloated size of organization, financial  conditions of the local governments have been rapidly  deteriorating due to a difficulty in increasing tax revenues and  a large increase in issuance of municipal bonds. The outstanding  balance of municipal bonds as of the end of the fiscal year 1993  reached a historic high: "The balance in ordinary accounts alone  exceeds well over 70 trillion yen" (per Finance Research and  Guidance Division, Ministry of Home Affairs). Local governments  seem to have driven themselves into a state where they must  carry out restructuring, including cuts in the number of  employees, which they have avoided so far.    Some people point out critically, however: "Although local  governments are ripe for administrative reform, only a handful  of them feel a genuine sense of crisis" (per Norio Sakata,  professor at Toyo University). Because of fiscal crises at the  national and local levels, there have been discussions on tax  increases, including consumption tax. However, residents are  keeping a watchful eye because they are the ones who will be  burdened by such tax increases.    Professor Sakata believes: "Local governments have many  operations that are not necessary today. If they have a courage  to eliminate those operations, they will be able to slim down  futher their administrative entities." The move toward  restructuring, which has already been taken up at some  progressive local governments, is likely to be widepread from  now on.</p>

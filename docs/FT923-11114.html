			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nationwide in D-Mark notes plan NATIONWIDE Building Society plans to issue D-Mark denominated notes as part of its Euro medium-term note (MTN) programme, following the Bundesbank's recent decision to relax the guidelines concerning the issuance of D-Mark paper by non-German borrowers. Nationwide can issue up to Dollars 750m under its Euro MTN programme. The programme currently has about Dollars 500m outstanding and is part of the building society's wholesale funding programme. Mr Paul Barratt, treasurer (risk management) at the building society, said it would be looking at opportunities for issuing D-Mark notes over the next few days: 'We will be looking at the pricing and if an opportunity arises we will take it,' he said. The new Bundesbank guidelines on issuing D-Mark paper were announced earlier this month and come into force on August 1. Nationwide has appointed Merrill Lynch as its German arranger, and is appointing Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale as a dealer under its existing Euro medium-term note programme.</p>

Results from the National JTPA Study show that outcomes achieved by out-of-school youth 30 months after entering the program are disappointing. To implement section 107(b)(7)(C) of the amended JTPA, the Department encourages in PY 1994, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> will require <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in PY 1995, that Governors reward out-of-school youth programs that are identified by the Department or recognized by the State as having a demonstrated record of success. States need to develop ways to identify such programs. Possible approaches include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Using outcomes achieved to identify successful programs. Outcomes could include both the two youth performance measures and measures such as learning gains and earnings/retention in full-time employment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Alternatively, States could offer SDA's ``seed money'' from incentive funds to plan/operate programs that provide innovative or high-quality training to out-of-school youth based on criteria established by the Governor. Examples of such criteria include training that integrates occupational and basic skills training, and training that emphasizes acquiring job skills in demand in the emerging workplace. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Whatever method is used to reward successful out-of-school youth programs, access to such incentives must be limited to those SDA's that serve in excess of 50 percent out-of-school youth in their overall Title II&hyph;C program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / SNP hopes its May bandwagon will keep rolling There are eight Euro constituencies in Scotland but frontbench spokesmen are focusing most of their energies on just one of them: North East Scotland. This is because three parties could win it: Labour, which took the seat from the Conservatives in 1989; the Scottish National party, which Labour overtook on that occasion by only 2,613 votes; and the Tories, whose share of the vote was less than 3 percentage points behind that of the SNP. A victory for the SNP would have special significance. On the likely assumption that the party retains Highlands and Islands, where Mrs Winnie Ewing took more than 51 per cent of the vote in 1989, victory would give the nationalists a second Scottish Euro-seat. It could also boost an SNP bandwagon that began rolling in the regional council elections last month - in which the party came second - and give it a good chance of winning the by-election in Monklands East caused by the death of John Smith. The latter would entail wiping out a Labour majority of 15,712. But the SNP has poured in activists to achieve such surges before - it took the Labour safe seat of Glasgow Govan at a by-election in 1988. It also won a regional council seat in the constituency in May. As a response to the SNP threat Labour is likely, early next week, to call the by-election on June 30, the earliest date possible. On Thursday night it selected Mrs Helen Liddell, a former secretary of the Scottish party, as its candidate. On the campaign trail in Aberdeen, Mr Allan Macartney, the SNP candidate for North East Scotland, says the party has 'a Mexican wave effect' running in its favour in the constituency, which runs from Peterhead down to the river Tay, and includes both Aberdeen and Dundee. 'I thought we would have to crank the party up again for the Euro-elections but because of our success in the regional elections they're raring to go,' he says. The party believes Mr Macartney will win the seat with a 5 per cent to 7 per cent margin over Labour if people vote as they did in the regional elections. But the psephology is complex and Labour claims the regional results suggest it will win by 1 point. Mr Macartney is a strong candidate. A vice-convener of the party, he is not one of its tub-thumpers: he is a political scientist who tutors Open University students and tends to eschew shallow debating points. He says Labour, in spite of having seven of the eight Scottish Euro-seats, has not acted in Scotland's interests at Strasbourg. 'I'm appalled that the socialist group in the parliament voted to allow Spanish fish boats access to the North Sea,' he says. The SNP has an advantage in European elections, he says, because opinion polls show most Scots believe Scotland would be better off if it were directly represented in Brussels. 'We can only interpret that as meaning they would like Scotland to be independent.' His Labour opponent Mr Henry McCubbin is a hard-working MEP who shows bundles of European legislation for which he has campaigned, and can point to membership of parliamentary committees relevant to life in the north-east, such as farming, fishing, and health and safety (for the oil industry). On the big European issue he is not afraid of raising the issue of federalism, but sees it as 'a pooling of sovereignty, not as a loss of sovereignty'. The Tory candidate, Mr Ron Harris, appears quietly upbeat, in spite of the fact that national opinion polls are running heavily against his party and it is haunted by a disastrous performance in the regional elections. A thoughtful businessman from Montrose and a former professor of chemistry, Mr Harris believes constituency Tories are returning to the fold, having made their protest about higher taxes and value added tax on domestic fuel last month. Labour privately fears that the collapse of the Tory vote in the regional elections could be replicated to its disadvantage on June 9, with disgruntled Tories going over to the SNP. The Liberal Democrats, whose candidate Mr Simon Horner is a journalist, won almost as many votes in the regional elections as the Tories. Each party polled about 19 per cent of the vote.</p>

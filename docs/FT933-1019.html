			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Rhapsody in prudence - How to insure musical instruments against passing coat-tails, the roadie's beer or the casual attitude of their own players IF YOU knew an object was worth several thousand pounds, and was so delicate that one crack could halve its value, you would normally treat it with some respect. You would hesitate to entrust it to a teenager, bundle it into a car boot, or lug it around on public transport. But people do this all the time - a cello is designed to be played, after all, not locked away for safety's sake. Many musical instruments are not only valuable, but fragile, yet the attitude of players can be somewhat casual. Instrument repairers point to workshops full of cracked bows, left balanced on music stands, and chipped violins, abandoned on chairs during rehearsal breaks with necks sticking out to be caught by passing coat-tails. Brass and woodwind instruments are slightly more robust, but cannot take rough handling. A decent, student-quality musical instrument could be one of the single most valuable items a family owns; older pieces, perhaps passed down through the generations, can easily be worth five-figure sums. Household insurers are usually willing to cover musical instruments up to a certain value, for example Pounds 12,000 at Legal &amp; General, but you will need to ensure the instrument is named on the policy, and you will pay extra for accidental damage cover, or all-risks if the instrument is ever taken outside the home. Sun Alliance charges Pounds 30 per Pounds 1,000 value for all-risks cover, for example. If you have an instrument you do not play, but which you keep as an investment or for sentimental reasons, clumsiness or carelessness should not be such a problem, but insurers will need to know that it is kept properly. They will not cover hazards such as woodworm or deterioration caused by extremes of temperature. However, claims handlers at general insurers may not be familiar with the peculiarities of musicians' requirements. Damage claims are more common than theft claims, and expert repairs can be very expensive. Household insurers are not used to paying large amounts for possessions to be repaired: it is often cheaper and easier to throw out a damaged video recorder and buy a new one, but few musicians would want to junk a 200-year-old instrument if it suffered one dent too many. The wording of most home contents policies is unlikely to allow compensation for loss of value if a damaged instrument can be repaired, but will never be worth as much again. If the instrument is ever played professionally it becomes 'business equipment' in the eyes of many general insurers, and is therefore excluded. These are the kind of areas where specialist insurers may have an advantage. They are more likely to appreciate the problems of antique instruments and the need for expert repairs; also they do not draw distinctions between professional and amateur players. Premiums may be lower than for an all-risks extension to home contents insurance. The biggest name in classical music insurance is British Reserve, a division of Cornhill. It has been offering insurance for orchestral instruments for three decades, and now has the largest share of the UK market. Pop and rock musicians are excluded, but jazz is a grey area - 'serious' musicians are usually acceptable. The British Reserve insurance package covers loss and damage anywhere in the world. There are 10 per cent discounts for members of the Musicians Union and various other professional bodies. If you are happy for theft from an unattended vehicle to be excluded, there is a discount of 20 per cent. The minimum premium is Pounds 15 - the company aims to catch young musicians when they acquire their first half-size violin or clarinet and keep their custom as they metamorphose into soloists and orchestral players. Hired instruments can also be covered. Hartley Cooper Associates, part of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation group, has just entered the market with a policy similar to the British Reserve one. Again, the cover is intended mainly for classical musicians, whether amateur or professional, and discounts are available for members of professional organisations. Cover can be limited to the UK, or Europe, or worldwide. The minimum premium is Pounds 50, for cover limited to the UK. Electronic instruments present different problems to underwriters. No insurer is going to pay out if would-be rock stars start smashing up their guitars on stage. But the disruption to a sensitive synthesiser's innards caused by a carelessly placed beer can, or a rough roadie, can be covered. The rapid pace of technical innovations means that badly damaged electric guitars or keyboards are rarely worth repairing, even if the spare parts exist - but a musician with an emotional attachment to the guitar he played on his first big tour may insist on a repair no matter what the cost. Entertainment &amp; Leisure specialises in rock and pop music equipment, even disc jockeys' records and microphones, but it will also cover classical instruments. Premiums depend on the type of equipment or instruments being insured, and whether the things insured are kept in one building or need to be covered for anywhere in the UK. The wider option includes an automatic 31-day western Europe extension. As a rough guide, managing director Brian Martin quotes an annual premium of Pounds 241 for Pounds 5,000 of heavy-duty rock equipment, and Pounds 160 for classical equipment to the same value. A teenager's Pounds 500-worth of electric guitar and amplifier, kept in the home, would cost Pounds 30 to insure, or Pounds 39 if it was used in practices or performances elsewhere. E &amp; L can also provide performers' public liability cover of up to Pounds 2m, and pays up to Pounds 2,000 for the hire of replacement equipment. Galaxy 7 is another specialist offering insurance for musical instruments used for classical, jazz, pop and other types of music. Even karaoke equipment can be insured. The choice ranges from cover limited to a single building in the UK to worldwide, including all transit risks. The basic cost is Pounds 2 per Pounds 100 insured, with a minimum premium of Pounds 25, plus a Pounds 7.50 documentation charge. Public liability cover can be arranged as a policy extension.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "hk": "Monetary Policy Has To Be More </F> Intelligible"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- "It is of particular importance  to inform the public about the reasons for monetary policy  action and inaction," stressed Alexandre Lamfalussy, president  of the European Monetary Institute (EWI), in a lecture delivered  on Tuesday evening [14 June]. Information policy becomes all  the more important if more flexibility is displayed in using  money supply targets as an instrument.    Lamfalussy applied the statement to countries that are in  the  envious position of being able to pursue a monetary policy based  on rules, while also establishing a money supply target because  of a stable relationship between money and prices. However, the  same also applies to countries that cannot set any money supply  targets. "For them, the obligation to achieve price stability is  of even greater importance," said the EWI president at the sixth  "International Frankfurt Banking Evening."    Lamfalussy's impression is that things are developing in a  positive direction with respect to the greater intelligibility  of monetary policy decisionmaking, and he said the appropriate  steps taken by the Bank of England were exemplary. Regarding  the situation in Germany, he said: "As far as the Bundesbank is  concerned, I have noticed a constant increase in the depth and  breadth of the flow of information. The public is being  informed about the interpretation of facts and numbers that  affect decisionmaking as well as the reasons for the decisions  that are made."    There is no question of the premature abandonment of the  strategy of announcing money supply targets, stressed Bundesbank  President Dr. Hans Tietmeyer, speaking at the same event. As  long as there are clear indications of marked distortions in  relation to excessive monetary growth, the strong expansion of  the M3 money supply should not prompt inflationary fears.  [sentence as published] The development of the money supply is  not an indicator of future price trends, but of the danger of  inflation: "As long as all other sources allow us to be  confident that prices are developing in the right direction, a  certain degree of pragmatism is justified."    A glance at the way in which the cost of living price index  is evolving really does provide a basis for optimism. It is  true that the latest figures do not correspond to the  Bundesbank's ideas about price stability, but they show that  things are developing in the right direction. Tietmeyer's  actual words were: "According to all current forecasts, we will  continue to make progress -- exchange rates, in particular,  indicate that."    Of course, one has not disregarded the fact that current  problems with directing the money supply have made it more  difficult for the markets to assess monetary policy. The  current way in which the monetary supply is developing does  indeed place the Bundesbank under a great obligation to provide  explanations and justifications, said Tietmeyer, confirming  Lamfalussy's statement on intelligibility. Ultimately, the  difficulties that exist can only be resolved through a gradual  "deceleration," even if that might have to occur over a longer  period of time.</p>

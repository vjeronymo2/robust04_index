			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> LUKE RISES TO OCCASION FOR FINAL  </P> <P> Matt Luke had an up-and-down season for the El Dorado High School baseball  team.  </P> <P> It ended with an up, as Luke went down the third-base line to steal home in the  Southern Section 5-A championship game against Millikan Saturday.  </P> <P> "When I got to third, I was talking to Coach (Steve) Gullotti about it," said  Luke, who had led off the inning with a single. "He told me to see how far I  could get off the bag. I just kept going."  </P> <P> Luke, The Times' athlete of the week, broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning  with his run and the Golden Hawks went on to win, 2-0.  </P> <P> "We talked about possibly stealing home before the game," Gullotti said. "Their  pitcher (Todd Taylor) had a slow delivery. We felt if we got the right player  in the right situation, it could work."  </P> <P> Although Luke had only three stolen bases on the season, Gullotti believed he  was the right man for the job.  </P> <P> "Matt is extremely competitive," Gullotti said. "I would say he is one of the  most determined players we have."  </P> <P> Luke, who plays first base and pitches, couldn't crack the starting lineup last  season as a junior. The Golden Hawks had Scott Tomko, an All-Empire League  selection, at first base and several talented pitchers.  </P> <P> The fact that Luke also played basketball hurt his chances, because he didn't  even throw a baseball until late February.  </P> <P> "He had only one week to practice before we started playing games," Gullotti  said. "He had no time to get into shape, especially for pitching. It takes six  weeks to get your arm in shape."  </P> <P> Luke was mostly used as a pinch-hitter.  </P> <P> "The other pitchers were in better shape than I was," Luke said. "I had also  grown five or six inches in two years. My muscles hadn't caught up with my  growing, so I was a little awkward."  </P> <P> Luke, who is 6-foot-5, decided to be ready to pitch when this season started.  </P> <P> During basketball season, Luke pitched twice a week. He was a teacher's aide in  the physical education department during fifth period and spent some of the  time throwing.  </P> <P> "There's not a lot for a teacher's aide to do," he said. "I would run some  stuff to the office, then go throw."  </P> <P> When basketball season ended, he was ready. However, three weeks into the  season, he developed a sore arm.  </P> <P> "I think Matt was just physically tired," Gullotti said. "He had played  football and then basketball. By the time baseball started, he was worn out."  </P> <P> Luke played first base for the next five weeks. He was one of the team's better  hitters with a .406 average. Pete Janicki and Jay Hassel handled the pitching.  </P> <P> "They were throwing very well, so we could rest Matt," Gullotti said.  </P> <P> That rest paid off near the end of Empire League play.  </P> <P> The Golden Hawks had a crucial two-game series against Katella. Janicki and  Hassel combined for the victory in the first game.  </P> <P> Two days later, Gullotti called on Luke, who again was the right guy in the  right situation.  </P> <P> Luke pitched a three-hit shutout for the victory and remained in the rotation  the rest of the season. He finished with a 6-1 record and 1.57 earned-run  average.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Greg Hansell of Kennedy pitched a four-hitter, striking out 10, as the Fighting  Irish defeated Saugus, 1-0, in nine innings Saturday in the Southern Section  3-A baseball final.  </P> <P> Pete Janicki of El Dorado pitched a three-hitter, striking out four, as the  Golden Hawks defeated Millikan, 2-0, in the Southern Section 5-A baseball final  Saturday.  </P> <P> Mike Nielsen of Mater Dei ran the fastest 1,600 meters in Orange County this  season in placing fourth at the state track and field meet Saturday. Nielsen's  time was 4 minutes 11.56 seconds.  </P> <P> Greg Thurston of Edison finished sixth in the shotput at the state track and  field meet Saturday with a throw of 56 feet 11 1/2 inches. His mark was a  seven-inch improvement on his personal best.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Matt Luke  </P> <P> El Dorado High School  </P> <P> Position: Pitcher / first base  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-5, 195, Senior  </P> <P> Last Week: Luke stole home in the fifth inning to break a scoreless tie in El  Dorado's 2-0 victory over Millikan in the Southern Section 5-A final. He also  pitched four innings, allowing one run, in the semifinals against Lakewood.  </P> <P> Season: Luke was 6-1 with a 1.57 earned-run average. He also hit .406.  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (8): The brightest and best stand up to be counted - Alice Rawsthorn asks some influential designers to choose one item each from the galaxy of products Despite all the warnings about maturing markets and sated consumers, each year thousands of new products are still launched. Some will last. Others will not. The FT asked some of the most influential figures in European design to choose one example of imaginative and intelligent design which is already - or is about to be - available in Europe. Philippe Starck, the French architect and designer, plumps for Concept 1, the car Volkswagen of Germany is considering for a launch in the mid-1990s as a successor to the old Beetle. 'It's something really extraordinary - warm and friendly,' says Starck. 'Design today isn't about making something that people gasp at and say 'Ah] How beautiful.' It's about creating a product which will please people and that they need, without using unnecessary materials. The new Volkswagen is intelligent and cute. It's like looking at a baby. A baby needn't be beautiful to make you smile.' 'My vote goes to the Caddie, a shopping trolley designed by Raul Barbieri for Magis, the Italian manufacturer,' says Jasper Morrison, the British product designer. 'It's a genuine reinterpretation of an essential product which, until now, no one had thought of re-evaluating. It consists of a lightweight aluminium frame on which is hung an expanding woven nylon sack. It folds away to insignificance. It also offers an element of road safety - a reflector built on to the side of the wheel. Beautifully engineered, faultlessly practical.' The TGV, or Train de Grande Vitesse, the high speed French train, is the choice of Gert Dumbar, the Dutch graphic designer. 'It's innovative, aesthetic, functional, comfortable, safe, silent and looks stunningly beautiful crossing the European landscape,' he says. If the TGV was to adopt a frequent flyer system like the airlines, I'd never again take a plane to a TGV destination.' Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion dsigner, opts for the lamps of Giorgio Sabattini, a young Italian designer making intricate lights in a contemporary vein. 'I particularly like Giorgio Sabattini's work because it is both exotic and modern,' says Armani. 'His lamps can look both like objects from outer space or old Moroccan lights.' 'I admire Renault for having the guts to bring out a bold piece of design in the Twingo,' says Sir Terence Conran, chairman of the Design Museum in London. 'It's easy to drive and it's affordable. The Twingo is also an exciting, modern design that has captured the imagination of the mass market. The Renault Twingo is like other classic designs such as the Concorde, which seemed absolutely extraordinary when it was first launched, but is still remarkable years later.' Jil Sander, the German fashion designer, selects an established design classic: the Serie 7 chair designed in 1969 by Arne Jacobsen, the Danish architect. 'Jacobsen's work succeeds in creating a context not only between space and facade, but between space and design,' she says. 'A good example is the Serie 7 chair which has lost none of its modernity or clarity of style over the years.' The Italian designer and architect, Ettore Sottsass, also picks a classic: the Leica M6, a range finder camera introduced in 1984 by the eastern German camera-maker as a direct descendant of its first-ever, the Leica 1 which was brought out in 1914. Sottsass, a compulsive photographer, likes the camera because it is 'small, well balanced and very well-made, although it's expensive.' He also likes the Leica M6's reflex shutter. 'I have other cameras that are easier to use, like my Olympus. But the reflex shutter makes such a difference. It's almost a sexual pleasure every time I push the button.' James Dyson, the British inventor and engineer, chooses the new Spear &amp; Jackson anvil large garden shears. 'When I first saw these shears I assumed they'd be very expensive products from Sweden or Switzerland,' he says. 'It was terrific to realise that they'd been made by Spear &amp; Jackson in Sheffield. For years the only large shears on the market have been enlarged pairs of scissors that are foul to use, particularly when you're hacking away at really tough things. These new shears have a clever mechanism on the end which gives them an anvil action that is much more effective. They're a joy to use and they do look rather stylish.' 'If I could choose any product it would have to be the Thonet bentwood chair, because it is a perfect combination of technical and aesthetic innovation,' says Michele de Lucchi, design director of Olivetti, the Italian electronics group. 'But the most interesting contemporary phenomena are not products but events.' He cites Oz, the Dutch collective of ecology activists who stage events to raise awareness of environmental issues among other designers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- The Russian State Duma has  proved to be adherent to the former Supreme Soviet's traditions,  Chairman of the All-Russian TV and Radio Company Oleg Poptsov  told ITAR-TASS here today, commenting on the Duma decision to  form its own TV and radio service.    In his opinion, the Duma "claims on certain information  exclusiveness", which may provoke a chain reaction on the part  of other power structures, including the juridical one. "Then  we will have a splendid TV and the radio," said Poptsov.    Lamenting there were no deputies to show wisdom and  understanding, Poptsov stressed "the main feature of democracy  is openness, modesty and availability of power bodies, their  ability of self-estimation, and not claims on privileges".</p>

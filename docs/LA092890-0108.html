			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANGERFIELD AWARDED $725,000 IN CAESARS PALACE ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who went to federal court seeking some respect and  $5 million after his eyes were burned in a steam bath accident at Caesars  Palace, was awarded $725,000 by a jury Thursday.  </P> <P> Jurors deliberated less than a day before returning with a verdict awarding the  comic $225,000 for performances he missed in March, 1988, and another $500,000  for pain and suffering.  </P> <P> The jury ruled that Caesars was obligated under the contract to pay Dangerfield  for the missed shows because the injury should have excused him from  performing.  </P> <P> The jury also ruled against the resort in its $100,000 countersuit against its  former headliner.  </P> <P> "The truth won out," said Dangerfield, 68, who arrived at U.S. District Court  after the verdict was announced. He criticized Caesars for filing papers in  court before the trial accusing him of drug use and called the accusations  "nonsense and untrue."  </P> <P> "We're very disappointed," said Bruce Aguilera, Caesars Palace counsel. "We'll  have to have our lawyers look at the case.  </P> <P> Dangerfield had asked for $5 million in damages plus $45,000 for each of the  five shows he missed the week of the accident, claiming that Caesars was  negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath he used immediately after  each of his performances at the posh resort.  </P> <P> The hotel, in its countersuit, claimed that Dangerfield breached his contract  by not performing shows as scheduled and contended during the 2 1/2-week-long  trial that the comedian showed no signs of permanent injury from the accident.  </P></p>

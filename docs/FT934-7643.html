			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Big drop in jobless fires recovery hopes THE BIGGEST fall in unemployment for more than four years and a sharp drop in average earnings growth raised hopes yesterday that the UK economy can continue to recover without igniting inflation. The jobless and earnings figures, coming after a sharp drop in inflation announced this week, heightened the chances of an interest rate cut before the end of the year to offset the effects of tax rises widely expected in the Budget on November 30. The number of people claiming benefit fell a seasonally adjusted 49,000 last month to 2.85m, the lowest level since September last year. The monthly drop, which may have been partly inflated by high numbers of students returning to education, was the seventh this year and spread across all regions. Meanwhile, average earnings growth dropped to 3 per cent in the year to September from 3 1/4 per cent in August, dragged down by the public sector pay ceiling of 1.5 per cent, and underlining the lack of inflationary pressures in the economy. But weak bank and building society lending figures, also out yesterday, acted as a reminder of the fragility of the recovery and the continued reluctance by consumers and businesses to borrow. The Bank of England said the M4 lending growth rate dropped from 3.3 per cent in September to 3 per cent in the year to October, only marginally higher than the 30-year low of 2.9 per cent, reached in July. The pound, buoyed by the encouraging economic news, closed in London a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at DM2.5275, with little change in New York. The FT-SE 100 share index ended up 5.5 at 3,125.5. The government took the drop in unemployment and the surprise fall in inflation from 1.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent in October as evidence of the strength of recovery. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'There is a very high level of activity across the labour market. The UK's flexible and deregulated labour market is delivering both economic growth and jobs.' But Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said the level of unemployment in Britain was still 'unacceptably high'. 'Wealth-creating manufacturing employment continues to haemorrhage at the rate of 125,000 jobs a year, consigning Britain to a low-pay, low-skill, service-based economy with no sustainable long-term future,' he said. Although economists were surprised by the size of the October drop in the jobless total, many now believe that the jobless total is on a firmly downward trend. The October drop, with September's 17,800 fall, more than outweighed an increase of 9,900 in July and August. The Department of Employment said seasonally adjusted unemployment had fallen by 137,000 since the beginning of the year while employment trends had improved. Manufacturing employment rose by 9,000 in September. Decline in unemployment accelerates, Page 14</p>

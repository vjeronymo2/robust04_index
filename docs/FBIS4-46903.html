			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Press release by the Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers Press </F> Center: "To Overcome the Hardship of the Period of Transition"]    [Text] As has already been reported, a republic-wide  conference of the heads of administrations, chairmen of city and  rayon soviets, leaders of ministries and state committees,  executives from the president's staff, the Supreme Soviet, and  the Cabinet of Ministers was held in Kazan on 17 May. The  conference was opened and chaired by President M.Sh. Shaymiyev.    F.R. Gazizullin, deputy prime minister and chairman of the  Committee for State Property, noted in his presentation that the  Russian program of mass check-based privatization is nearing  completion. Out of 3.840 million Russian vouchers distributed to  the population of our republic, about 2.5 million have been  used. During the time remaining until 30 June, it is necessary  to gather from the population the remaining vouchers to be  canceled and turned in to the National Bank.    With a view to accelerating the emergence of a market  economy  and ensuring the extensive and involved participation of  citizens in the process, it is necessary to vigorously use check  investment funds, ensure the exchange of vouchers into the  shares of privatized enterprises, and put the chain of stock  outlets to extensive use. We should also hold auctions to sell  real estate for tender, including Russian vouchers, speed up the  conduct of subscriptions to the stock of highly profitable  enterprises for citizens who do not take part in production  activities, and issue stock in the process of converting  enterprises, including municipal, into joint-stock companies.    Touching on the distribution of unclaimed vouchers, F.R.  Gazizullin proposed to distribute them among the least protected  categories of the population--orphaned children, Categories I  and II handicapped, and families with many children.    Special attention was paid in the presentation to the  registered privatization deposits (IPV) of the republic.    In keeping with a presidential edict, on the whole, the  IPV's  will be distributed on a priority basis to the least protected  strata of the population--handicapped war veterans, Categories I  and II handicapped, the families of servicemen who perished,  families with many children, and retirees over 65 years old.  Issuing them the stock of the most prestigious enterprises has  already begun. The task was set to complete this work before 1  June.    Between 1 June and 1 September, the IPV's should be traded  in  for the shares of prestigious enterprises by all retirees.  Between 1 September and 1 December, the IPV's for organizations  financed from the budget should be used, and, from 1 December  on, the remaining shares will be sold at the nominal price to  all categories of the population. In the process, the members of  labor collectives shall use their IPV's in keeping with  privatization plans and regardless of the above deadlines.    Moving on to the problems of small-scale privatization, F.R.  Gazizullin noted that registered deposits may be used for up to  90 percent of the sale price of a facility in the case of trade  sector, public catering, and consumer service enterprises. By  now, 430 such enterprises have been privatized. In a number of  rayons (Bavlinskiy, Zainskiy, Zelenodolskiy, and Leninogorskiy),  the level of small-scale privatization comes to between 70 and  90 percent. However, in many rayons, this important state  endeavor has been left to its own devices, or worse yet is  restricted, especially by trade administrations and  associations. Unfortunately, the heads of administrations of  individual cities and rayons and chiefs of ministries and  departments have taken a wait-and-see attitude.    With a view to laying a strong foundation for the completion  of small-scale privatization in 1994, it is necessary to  immediately break up and eliminate the existing trade  administrations, trusts, and associations. It is important to  sell facilities through competitions (especially investment  competitions), to keep the selection of products, their  assortment, physical volume, sales, and so on, and tap as much  as possible the "hot" money held by entrepreneurial structures,  that is, implement privatization at a fee.    In keeping with the State Program of Privatization,  enterprises of the trade sector, consumer services, and public  catering located in the downtown and other prestigious zones of  cities must be sold primarily at auctions.    F.R. Gazizullin noted that, with a view to avoiding  violations of the law, upholding the legality of privatization,  and protecting the interests of citizens and the labor  collectives, all privatization documents must be drawn up in  keeping with established rules, signed by the chairman of the  city or rayon committee for the management of municipal  property, and verified by the Committee for the Management of  State Property, with a relevant certificate being issued and the  act of purchase and sale being recorded in the state register of  Tatarstan.    The conference heard a report by Minister of Finance D.N.  Nagumanov about the status and priority measures to stabilize  the financial situation in the republic.    He said that all our troubles are associated with the  nonpayment crisis that has broken out in the entire Russian  Federation. Our main sector--the oil sector--is going through a  difficult time. Oil-refining enterprises of Russia owe the  Tatneft more than R400 billion. The financial situation is being  exacerbated by the continuing slump in production. However, even  under such circumstances, a lot depends on the standard of  organizational efforts, inquiry, and overcoming stereotypical  thinking. There are, after all, enterprises that have good  economic indicators. These are the associations Teplokontrol,  Elekon, and Tatkhimfarmpreparaty.    D.N. Nagumanov stressed that, in the environment of  transition to a market economy, the state should support  enterprises that manufacture easily salable and tax-intensive  products, which are in demand on the market. At present, these  are mostly the goods produced by the light and food industries.    The extensive implementation of the circulation of bills of  exchange and guaranteed backing for the bills are another  important problem. Sharp criticism was leveled in the  presentation against the managers of a number of enterprises and  heads of administrations who have substantially increased the  administrative and management staff, are carried away by the  acquisition of high-priced equipment and passenger cars, and  overstate wages and various forms of financial remuneration. The  chiefs of housing and municipal facilities, health care, and the  association Tatenergo drew criticism in conjunction with this.    The minister has called for the strictest possible economies  and thrift. Strict accounting and monitoring of the expenditure  of funds and material resources should be organized.    Dwelling on the issues of mutual budgetary relations with  Russia, D.N. Nagumanov said that they have been completely  settled at all levels and now there are no obstacles to engaging  in independent financial and credit activities. Everything  depends on the involvement of the republic heads of ministries,  departments, enterprises, and organizations.    Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs F.S. Sibagatullin  devoted his presentation to the state of affairs in the republic  agroindustrial complex and the tasks of its future development.  He outlined the results of the work of cattle breeders during  the [first] four months and dwelled on the task of an organized  transition to the summer pasture management of public-sector  cattle.    The wintering of cattle was not easy. A slump in the  procurement of animal husbandry products was allowed to occur on  some republic farms despite an adequate supply of fodder,  perhaps because of the poor quality of fodder. Added to these  were organizational shortcomings, and, in some places,. the  irresponsibility of the chiefs of farms and specialists. The  herd of cattle is diminishing because of the less intensive  efforts to reproduce it. It is necessary to restore the herd, to  reduce the intrafarm consumption of animal husbandry products,  and to increase meat and milk procurement from the population.    Planting in the republic is coming to an end at an optimal  time; the quality of planting is good. However, in view of the  fact that less mineral fertilizer has now been applied, as  compared to last year, a considerable volume of crop cultivation  work has yet to be done, and a set of measures has to be taken  to protect the plants against pests, disease, and weeds.    F.S. Sibagatullin proceeded to touch on the issues of  procuring cattle fodder and repairing fodder and  grain-harvesting machinery. It is necessary to reduce the  scrapping of machinery to a minimum.    As far as reforms in agricultural production are concerned,  the Edict of the President "On Procedures for the Transformation  of Kolkhozes and Sovkhozes and Privatization of State  Enterprises and Organizations of the Agroindustrial Complex of  the Republic of Tatarstan" is the legal foundation in this  matter. Collective enterprises, partnerships, joint-stock  companies, agricultural cooperatives, and peasant farms and  associations that have already appeared in our republic have  convincingly proved, through the results of their work, their  advantages over the obsolete forms of economic operations. By  now, 200 kolkhozes and sovkhozes have already been transformed,  and 300 farms have been prepared for this.    Further on, the presenter dwelled on the issues of providing  credit and monetary support to rural areas, putting the use of  the bills of exchange in order, granting relief to the rural  producers of goods, regulating procurement prices for the  products of crop farming and animal husbandry, and reforming the  Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs and its local  subdivisions.    Chairman of the National Bank Ye.B. Bogachev covered the  status of the republic banking and finance-and-credit systems  and priority tasks in stabilizing the situation in this area.    In summing up the results of the conference, President M.Sh.  Shaymiyev described the republic sociopolitical situation. The  leadership of Tatarstan and local government organs operate  harmoniously and jointly; there is complete understanding  between them, stressed M.Sh. Shaymiyev. Referring to the  historic significance of the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan, the president noted that the conviction that it was  signed at the proper time grows with every passing day. A recent  meeting with the president of Chuvashia who stated that the path  traveled by Tatarstan is correct and commands great respect also  testifies to this.    Dwelling on economic problems, M.Sh. Shaymiyev noted that  the  economic and cadre potential in our republic makes it possible  to overcome the hardships of the period of transition rapidly.  The republic leadership is working on a detailed program for  further socioeconomic development. In conjunction with this, he  called on participants in the conference to approach the  fulfillment of the state privatization program with a full  measure of responsibility.    Among priority tasks, the president mentioned the  acceleration of settlements with kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and  enterprises of the agroindustrial complex for delivered  products, stabilization of remunerations payments to employees  of institutions and organizations financed from the budget,  hiring of individuals for management positions on a contractual  basis, changes in the taxation system, and restoration of order  in the operation of off-budget funds. Touching on the issue of  herds of cattle kept on the personal lots of rural residents,  M.Sh. Shaymiyev stressed that their reduction cannot be allowed  to occur under any circumstances. It is necessary to provide all  possible incentives for the growth of the herd of cattle and  procure milk and meat from the population at fixed rates.    In his presentation, the president paid much attention to  the  issues of renewal in local self-government.    The 50th anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet  people over fascism is drawing closer, said M.Sh. Shaymiyev in  summation. This is an unforgettable date, which is particularly  dear to all of us. It is necessary to begin preparations for the  50th anniversary right away, without delay, so that every  resident of Tatarstan, whether young or old, may feel the  greatness of this victory with his soul and heart and develop  respect for those who protected the honor and independence of  their Motherland at the price of incredible efforts,  self-sacrificing labor, and life itself.    Chairman of the Supreme Soviet F.Kh. Mukhametshin, Prime  Minister M.G. Sabirov, and Vice President V.N. Likhachev took  part in the conference proceedings.</p>

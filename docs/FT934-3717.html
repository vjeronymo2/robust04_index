			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Chile finds growth fights poverty: Politicians put poor on top of the agenda From La Pintana, a desperately poor municipality in south Santiago, the Chilean economic miracle seems worlds away. Most of La Pintana's inhabitants, many forcibly relocated from more prosperous neighbourhoods during the military regime, live in rows of cramped, squalid government housing, often looking out on unlit, unpaved streets plagued with crime. La Pintana's 170,000 inhabitants have no hospital and only one secondary school. More than half live below the poverty line. According to the mayor, Mr Jaime Pavez, residents are four times less likely to have regular work than their fellow Chileans. They are nearly 200 times less likely to own a telephone. In spite of a decade of exceptional national growth, a third of Chileans still find themselves below the poverty threshold, while nearly one in 10 lives in extreme poverty. Huge discrepancies between rich and poor, long existent in Chile, are becoming more obvious in a country whose rapid growth has delivered the trappings of a consumerist, western lifestyle to large sections of the population. So much so that both left and right-wing candidates in the presidential election this weekend have put the issue of Chile's poor at the top of their agenda. Mr Eduardo Frei, the Concertacion coalition candidate widely expected to win the presidency, has pledged to eradicate poverty within six years. Although there is much to be done, Mr Frei says, the centre-left coalition has made considerable inroads during its four-year term. According to official figures, by November 1992 the percentage of people living in poverty had shrunk to 32.7 from 40.1 two years earlier and 44.4 in 1987. Given current growth rates, that figure should drop further to about 29 per cent by next March, according to Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister. 'Essentially, in 1987 you had 5.5m living below the poverty line and by the end of this administration it will be 3.8m. I think that's pretty impressive.' Mr Foxley also cites data showing that people in abject poverty - defined as those unable to afford basic food requirements - fell to 9 per cent in 1990 from 13.8 per cent two years earlier, and 16.8 per cent in 1987. Such progress, Mr Foxley says, has been the result of economic expansion (which has averaged 6.3 per cent over four years), the rapid creation of jobs, as well as specific policies to target Chile's poorest. Since 1990, the government has raised the minimum wage by '30 per cent in real terms', while family allowances have seen a 'big expansion'. Mr Gert Rosenthal, executive secretary of the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, agrees that there have been significant improvements. 'The recuperation that you are seeing now in part reflects the fact that, when this economy grows, you can pull people out of poverty in a relatively short time,' he says. 'In other countries you can pour a lot of money in, but you are unlikely to see results for a generation. The type of poverty you have here is qualitatively different from that found, for example, in Peru or Bolivia. The levels of education, infant mortality, health and so forth are quite different. 'In Chile the workforce is sufficiently skilled to take up opportunities as they arise. They are trainable. In many other Latin American countries, there comes a point where this is not true.' The creation of jobs is thus the over-riding factor, he says. Official figures show unemployment continuing to fall sharply. The number of jobless is 4.5 per cent, against 6.5 per cent in 1990 and 20 per cent in 1982. Although some observers question the accuracy of government jobs statistics, few disagree with Mr Rosenthal's belief that unemployment has 'clearly come down terrifically', nor with his assessment that wages at the lower end of the scale have risen markedly. According to Prealc, the world employment programme, Chile has bucked the regional trend by creating not only more, but 'better quality' jobs. Since 1985, the proportion of Chileans with low-paid, unstable work has steadily declined. Only 50 per cent of Chileans are self-employed or work for small businesses against 56 per cent in Mexico and 60 per cent in Colombia. 'Real salaries in Chile have shown a sustained recuperation since 1988,' Prealc's report says. 'Despite this, minimum wages are still below those of 1980.' The group estimates real minimum wages at 83.4 per cent of 1980 levels, up from 63.4 per cent in 1985. Mr Rosenthal says the government has struck the right balance between specific measures aimed at tackling poverty and policies intended to stimulate economic growth and job creation generally. 'If we were asked to grade the government in this area we would give them high marks. They seem to have got it about right.' From La Pintana, it is less easy to be sanguine. Mr Pavez feels the government has not done enough to help 'marginalised communities'. He is particularly aggrieved at the allocation of local taxes which, he says, favours wealthier municipalities. 'For example, in Las Condes (one of Santiago's richest districts) you have well-equipped public health facilities even though most people go to private clinics. Here, where there is much greater need, we don't even have a hospital.' Government housing too, he says, often fails to meet basic standards. He recently refused to attend a ceremony in his municipality intended to welcome residents to their new homes. 'Some houses didn't even have floors or staircases,' he says. 'I didn't go because I couldn't say 'welcome' - it would have been false.' Mr Pavez says districts such as La Pintana need what he calls 'discriminatory decentralisation', the channeling of funds from wealthier districts to poorer ones. In the absence of the necessary resources, he says, it will prove almost impossible to 'cut the vicious cycle of poverty. Without this we won't be able to incorporate our people into the world outside - the world of the Chilean miracle.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Evgeni Gavrilov: "Berov Stepped on Firm </F> Ground"]    [Text] The statement of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov to the  mass media on 1 March in effect showed that the government views  the 1994 budget, which was adopted late on 28 February, as the  most important vote of confidence that it has received in just  over a year. Unfortunately, the budget was adopted at the last  minute, under pressure, in a typical Bulgarian manner. Pressed  by the time limit posed by the international financial  institutions as a precondition of allocating to Bulgaria the  still illusionary $1 billion, the deputies and ministers had no  choice but to dispose quickly of the matter of adopting the  budget, which is the most important law of any normal state.    Generally, the government received the parameters of the  macroeconomic budget framework that it demanded. However, it is  clear to all that this framework is unrealistic and unfeasible.  Everyone knows that the emperor is naked, but no one dares to  admit this publicly. The dollar rate, which was artificially  kept within decent limits, immediately reached 40 leva on the  real market. The budget's income and expenditure are calculated  on the basis of a $1/35 leva rate. There is hardly one normal  Bulgarian citizen who believes in the inflation of 45 percent  promised by the end of the year and a basic interest rate of 30  percent. After all, every week there is another official price  increase--electricity, heating, postal services, and so forth.  The citizens, subjected to the price racket of the official and  unofficial government, do not appear to have any choice.    The 1994 budget contains more restrictions than the budgets  of the last four years. Three governments have publicly  announced that they will serve in the name of the reform, but  they have all limited themselves to the monetary part of the  reform proposed by (former Finance Minister) Ivan Kostov.  Otherwise, in his statement, Prime Minister Berov did not say  anything new regarding supporting private and state business,  and socially supporting the poor, whose number continues to  grow. He did not make any promises. Basically, the present  cabinet can afford this. It stands on relatively solid ground  that materialized under its feet with the adoption of the  budget, regardless of how impossible it will be to implement.</p>

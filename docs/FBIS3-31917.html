The fatal deadline imposed by the United States is already  the extension of an investigation into Brazilian industrial  property law. Last November the U.S. Government decided to  bring forward by three months its decision on whether to adopt  restrictive measures on Brazilian exports.    This subject was discussed yesterday by Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim and 20 businessmen from the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce. The minister does not think there will be  difficulties in the talks with the United States, because the  Brazilian draft bill being discussed in Congress "will be very  similar to the intellectual property agreement" of the Uruguay  Round of GATT talks which concluded last 15 December.    "An action that does not take into consideration what was  attained bilaterally and multilaterally would be technically  precipitate and politically inopportune. If Brazil had wanted  to, it would have hindered the GATT intellectual property  agreement," Amorim said.    The main point of controversy in the Brazilian draft bill is  the requirement that pharmaceutical products must be  manufactured in Brazil in order to obtain a license. The text  of the GATT agreement on the subject is ambiguous, and has not  yet been clarified within the Paris Convention which deals with  intellectual property rights. "The text of the agreement deals  with the subject indirectly. Political vision is necessary to  deal with this ambiguity, which will in time be resolved," Celso  Amorim said.    The foreign minister also spoke with the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce businessmen about the Common Market of the South, the  Uruguay Round of the GATT talks, and trade problems between  Brazil and the United States, such as problems in the iron and  steel industry and in the shoe and tobacco sectors.</p>

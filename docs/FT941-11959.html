			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity hopes raised by Lebanon reawakening - Mark Nicholson hears talk of a bonanza in Beirut If investments of cash come to match those ofhope in Lebanon's reawakening capital market, there is a bonanza in store. Blakeney Management, London-based specialists in Middle East markets, tells clients in its first-quarter bulletin that 'Beirut has the potential to be one of the best-performing markets this year'. Merrill Lynch advised its emerging market watchers late in 1993 that Lebanon was, with Cuba, Vietnam and Israel, a country where returning expatriate capital could ignite the local financialmarket. Mr Riad Salame, governor of Lebanon's central bank, quotes IFC data forecasting that Lebanon's equity market could reach a capitalisation of Dollars 25bn within a decade. Meanwhile, it is early days. Although Lebanon has been at peace for more than three years and reconstruction is gathering pace, the country's capital market is presently little more than a twinkle in investors' eyes. Beirut's stock market has been closed since the middle of the civil war and the sole negotiable securities at present are Lebanese pound denomination government treasury bills. But there are signs of movement. The first was the successful share offering last month to capitalise Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn company which will manage the reconstruction of downtown Beirut. Mr Salamesays that a secondary market in the Dollars 100 shares should open within a few weeks. In the absence of a stock market, he says, the shares will be quoted and tradeable under the auspices of the Societe Financiere du Liban, a group jointly ownedby 44 of Lebanon's commercial banks, which will at the same time centralise allT-Bill trading. In time, and Mr Salame is reluctant to say how much time, this centralised market will form the basis for a reopened stock and bond exchange. Much needs to be done first, including making amendments to capital market legislation and finding a new building for a fully fledged exchange. But, with an eye on growing emerging market funds available from London, New York andelsewhere, Mr Salame says that the market, when it reopens, will be open to direct foreign investment. 'We have always been an open market, and we intend to remain such,' he adds. A number of foreign institutions are, accordingly,starting to position themselves. Both Paribas, the French merchant bank, and Saudi American Bank, the Saudi joint-venture bank - both of which acted as subscription agents in the Solidere issue - are understood to be setting up localbranches shortly. Paribas is considering establishing a separate investment company. Merrill Lynch is also said to be looking to expand its small Beirutoffice; and Banque Audi, the Beirut-based commercial bank, says it expects thisyear to establish the first local investment fund.</p>

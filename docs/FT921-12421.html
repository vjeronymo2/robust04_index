			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Roaring start may herald record year in D-Mark sector THE D-Mark Eurobond market could be set for a record year of new issue volume, judging by the surge of activity in the first few weeks of the year. New issues totalling nearly DM7bn have emerged so far this year, already about 20 per cent of last year's total. The sector stands to benefit from bullish sentiment on German interest rates and the D-Mark. With last year's poor performance poised for reversal, there has already been a substantial shift of assets, largely US, into the German bond market. Demand for D-Mark Eurobonds seems unusually broad-based, covering retail and institutional investors in the domestic market and overseas. The average new issue size has risen from DM160m to DM280m, which could boost liquidity, and surging demand has attracted a more international range of issuers, including Norway and Belgium. Borrowers have also been enticed by arbitrage opportunities enabling them to swap new issue proceeds into floating rate funds at attractive rates. However, swap rates shifted abruptly last week, due to a lack of counterparties willing to pay fixed-rate D-Marks. As D-Mark rates are widely expected to fall, few banks will at present commit themselves to paying fixed-rate interest in D-Marks - at least not at a rate attractive to borrowers. The market faces other potential handicaps. Although yields are expected to fall, it will be difficult for Eurobond yields to maintain their tight spreads relative to bunds. Some Eurobond yields are lower than bund yields, reflecting the participation of retail investors who often prefer bearer bonds to registered paper, for tax reasons. Nevertheless, dealers say this anomaly cannot persist in a widely-traded market. Illogical trading levels reflect a more serious problem: the market's well-known illiquidity, which could yet scotch the expansion of the market, despite favourable portents. German institutions, as well as retail investors, are less concerned about liquidity than many of their counterparts overseas. 'A lot of German institutions, like insurance companies, are still lock-up buyers,' one trader said. The market is still largely domestic in character, and overseas institutions in many cases prefer to buy bunds, particularly when D-Mark Eurobonds offer little pick-up. Also, the structure of the primary market is old-fashioned - for example, the fee structure is not competitive with other Eurobond sectors. However, there are some favourable points. Bund market volume no longer seems a serious threat, given the bull market. Last year, the market was beset by fears that borrowing requirements would rocket because of the need to fund the development of eastern Germany. But bund issuance fell well below initial expectations. The government's handling of its borrowing has also reassured investors. 'The panic selling of bunds (by the government) of two years ago is over,' said one trader. If the market can absorb government debt, part of any residual appetite for paper will generate demand for Eurobonds. Secondly, following the recent securities reforms, Frankfurt's desire to liberalise is seen as hopeful. The way could soon be open for development of a medium-term note market, which would broaden Germany's debt markets. Meanwhile, Frankfurt's growing importance as a financial sector is prompting international banks, US investment banks in particular, to build up their presence there. As this shift coincides with a bull market in German bonds, these banks are likely to renew their efforts in a sector long dominated by German banks.</p>

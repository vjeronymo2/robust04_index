			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPLETED RAMS, 49ERS KICK OFF SEASON IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Considering the task at hand, maybe 5,600 miles isn't far enough from home for  George Seifert, who makes his pro head coaching debut tonight (Sunday, Japan  time) when the San Francisco 49ers face the Rams in American Bowl '89 at the  Tokyo Dome.  </P> <P> As it was soon discovered this week, not even crossing the international  dateline helps. Eager to show the world they've done their homework on a  strange game that certainly is not baseball, the Japanese were curious to know,  foremost, what it felt like to replace a legend.  </P> <P> Seifert might have referred them to the new emperor. Instead, he worked his way  deftly through an interpreter.  </P> <P> "Once we start in this profession, we all tend to live with it," Seifert said  of handling pressure. "Whether as a head coach, or assistant coaches and  obviously, the players. That becomes a way of life to us."  </P> <P> The good news is that Bill Walsh, who coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl  titles in the 1980s, no longer even hovers in the front office, having recently  accepted a broadcasting position with NBC. Only the memories of a genius and  his sweaters remain.  </P> <P> Undramatically, tonight's game should prove little, other than to see how well  Seifert handles the pregame interviews and sideline headset. The game itself is  pure ceremony, marking the third consecutive season the Rams will play five  exhibition games instead of the customary four. It's the second overseas  exhibition in two years for the 49ers, who faced the Miami Dolphins in London  last summer. All for the betterment of humanity, of course.  </P> <P> The rivalry on the field has long been heated, but what about these owners,  Edward DeBartolo Jr. and Georgia Frontiere, who have been duking it out in the  game of international diplomacy?  </P> <P> DeBartolo is already challenging Frontiere to a game next year in Milan, Italy.  Although the Ram owner is interested, she concedes that she may need some time  to think it over.  </P> <P> This week, the owners have asked coaches Seifert and the Rams' John Robinson to  put something interesting together for their hosts, which is easier said than  done.  </P> <P> The Rams could be missing seven offensive starters because of injury or  holdout. Tailback Greg Bell, tight end Damone Johnson and guard Duval Love are  back on the mainland, poring over negotiating strategies. Flanker-tight end  Pete Holohan is out with a bad knee, and left guard Tom Newberry and wide  receiver Aaron Cox have hamstring pulls. Receivers Henry Ellard and Ron Brown  are doubtful with back and hamstring problems, respectively.  </P> <P> So how can a game live up to its billing?  </P> <P> "You get the feeling their expectations of the game are very high," Ram  quarterback Jim Everett said of the Japanese. "I think all we can do is play as  aggressive and hard as we can and hopefully win."  </P> <P> Robinson will do his best to squeeze two quarters out of his starting  quarterback. No one said show business was easy.  </P> <P> "We would like to have a cultural show for the Japanese people," Robinson said.  "But we don't want to embarrass ourselves. We have mixed goals. We'd like to  play a lot of people and we'd like to have some rhythm. I think you worry about  the first game, you know, getting the snap from center."  </P> <P> Thankfully, the Rams' offense will be equally matched by the 49er defense,  which is missing cornerbacks Don Griffin and Tim McKyer, end Larry Roberts,  linebacker Charles Haley and strong safety Jeff Fuller, all of whom are  negotiating contracts.  </P> <P> "Go out and have a hot dog when we have the ball," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Joe Montana, Super Bowl hero, will start at quarterback for the 49ers and no  doubt draw the most attention. His legend stretches across the Pacific and was  further enhanced by Robinson at an opening-night news conference.  </P> <P> "In Joe Montana, you will see one of the great players ever to play this game,"  Robinson said. "He certainly has been the best quarterback to play in my time  in the NFL, and I think he will go down in history as perhaps the best  quarterback of all time."  </P> <P> Does Joe dare throw an incompletion? And what of the transition from Walsh to  Seifert, a nine-year 49er assistant and the team's defensive coordinator since  1983.  </P> <P> "The difference isn't as great as everyone believes," Montana said. "George has  been in this organization and has been the major reason for our winning.  Everybody knows what he can do and respects him. For us, it doesn't seem like  that much of a change. I think there's a little transition in the beginning,  but practices are going along as usual."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Tonight's game starts at 7, PDT, and will be televised locally by ESPN and  KTTV-Fox, Channel 11. . . . The team charter departs immediately after the game  and arrives home at noon Sunday. The Rams will move their training camp to Cal  State Fullerton Monday. . . . With Damone Johnson and Pete Holohan out, rookie  free agent Richard Ashe from Humboldt State gets the start at tight end. . . .  Gaston Green will start at tailback and split time there with Robert Delpino.  Buford McGee will start at fullback. . . . On defense, inside linebacker Fred  Strickland is out with a knee injury and will be replaced by Richard Brown. . .  . This is the second NFL game to be played in Tokyo. The St. Louis Cardinals  defeated the San Diego Chargers, 20-10, here on Aug. 16, 1976. . . . The Rams  are on the road again next week, facing the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium  Saturday night. The team opens the home exhibition season at Anaheim Stadium  Aug. 21 against Phoenix.  </P></p>

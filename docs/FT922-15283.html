			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Minimum wage can safeguard skills Sir, Edward Balls reports ('Higher minimum wage, more hamburger', March 30) findings from the US that increasing minimum wages increases employment. Such results are not confined to the US. Recent research we have done on the UK wages councils (Minimum wages, wage dispersion and employment, Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics) finds there is no evidence of a negative relationship between employment and minimum wages. If anything, rises in minimum wages seem to increase employment, an effect that seems particularly strong in the catering industry.

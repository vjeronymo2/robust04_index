			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report: "Peaceful Solution of the Crisis"] </F>   [Text] Zagreb -- The Serbian People's Party [SNS] has  welcomed the joint declaration initiating the normalization of  relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. The SNS particularly welcomes the  decision on opening government offices in Belgrade and Zagreb.    "This is a step forward toward establishing crucial  conditions for mutual recognition and the establishment of  diplomatic relations between the two states," said Milan Djukic,  president of the SNS at a press conference held on Thursday [20  January].    He assessed as "positivie and extremely significant" that  "for the first time in Croatian policy all forces are clearly  opting for a peaceful solution to the crisis, and Presidnet  Tudjman is talking about Serbian autonomy in the UN Protected  Areas, although he has not as yet specified its nature." He  nevertheless expressed certain reservations toward the latest  Geneva negotiations, and said that, taking into consideration  the differences and unprincipled attitude of Europe and the  world toward finding a solution to the crisis in former  Yugoslavia, more significant results could not have been  expected.    "This gives all the sides involved in the conflict the  chance  to persevere in realizing their aims," stressed Djukic and added  that this is "more than enough reason for continuing the war."    Djukic reiterated the SNS's position that the global  solution  of the Balkan crisis lies in relations between Serbia and  Croatia. He also said that the issue of "how to create an  atmosphere of mutual trust" remains an open one. In Djukic's  opinion, Croatia's main problem is the solution of the Serbian  issue, which should be debated in the Sabor [Croatian  parliament], along with other pressing issues of internal  policy, as soon as possible. He added that it was "important  for Croatian policy to opt for, and clearly understand that a  compromise is the only solution open to it." "Croatian policy no  longer has any time for mistakes," said the president of the SNS.</p>

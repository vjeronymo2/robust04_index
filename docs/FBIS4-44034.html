			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sigfrid Leijonhufvud: "Victorious Franzen Starts </F> the Election Campaign"]    [Text] "Let's get moving," was the message from New  Democracy's [NYD] latest leadership team when it called a news  conference yesterday afternoon in the Riksdag building.    With preliminary voting figures of 1,543 against 301,  Vivianne Franzen's party executive won approval in a vote by  2,960 party members, and it wants now to set the election  campaign in motion.    However, the enthusiasm of the new party chairman, wearing  red culottes and a jacket with a white sailor collar, was  dampened by the fact that the battle for the party's funds seems  to be continuing.    Day-to-day payments can be made as long as [rival party  leader] Harriet Colliander or members of the party executive  elected at the regular party congress in April and members of  the new party executive countersign the bills.    But neither of the executives will be able to get their  hands  on the money needed for an election campaign as long as they are  blocked by the other side.    "If she carries on like this after this vote, her only aim  is  to sink the party," Vivianne Franzen declared while the old  party executive gathered for a meeting elsewhere in the Riksdag  building.    Those who support Colliander do not consider the new  executive to have been appointed according to the party's  statutes.    Therefore it is not legitimate and should not have access to  party funds that currently are in excess of 7 million kronor.    Stefan Kihlberg, the party secretary on the former party  executive, has wanted the matter to be brought before a court,  and according to Franzen the Stockholm District Court will  announce within 14 days whether it intends to investigate the  matter.    Yesterday evening the two party factions met to discuss the  problems regarding party funds, among other things. Vivianne  Franzen left the group before 2100 hours, and the meeting broke  up just before midnight.    Stefan Kihlberg said after the meeting that the Colliander  executive does not accept the vote by the party membership, but  remains firm that the matter should be settled in court.    Taking as its point of departure the party program, NYD will  raise issues such as the budget deficit, refugee policy, and  youth unemployment in the election campaign, Vivianne Franzen,  seconded by Sten Dybeck, said.    Both expressed regrets that the established parties are  incapable of solving the nation's problems. "This shows that  New Democracy is needed."    Proposed spending cuts include a 50-percent cut in  development aid, reductions in the cost of accepting refugees,  and naturally a cut in the financial support for political  parties.    A 50-percent cut in the value-added tax on services is also  in the program.    Vivianne Franzen described NYD as a youth party.    "I myself can attract beer-drinking youths under 20. They  are my fans," she said laughing.</p>

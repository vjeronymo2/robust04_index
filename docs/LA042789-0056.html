			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Players drove, flew, took the train and walked to the nearest Pennsylvania  lottery ticket counter up to the last minute before the winning North American  record jackpot of more than $100 million was drawn. The official winning  numbers were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71. A winning ticket must  have seven of the 11 numbers drawn. James Scroggins, the lottery's executive  director, said the prize would be "something higher than $100 million when it's  all said and done." How much higher won't be known until sometime today, but  unofficial estimates have put the jackpot at more than $110 million.  </P></p>

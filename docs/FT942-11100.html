			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Russians taken for Dollars 5m ride: John Mason describes how three businessmen, who were found guilty yesterday, set up a car fraud Three British businessmen were convicted yesterday of a multi-million dollar fraud on a Russian automotive company which was trying to set up a large-scale kit car assembly operation after the collapse of the Soviet command economy. The fraud, centred on the non-delivery of goods paid for in advance by the Russian Autokam company, is seen by UK police and prosecutors as a prime example of the vulnerability of emerging eastern bloc entrepreneurs to outside exploitation. At Portsmouth Crown Court Mr Alexander Mullins, a commodity broker, from Chandler's Ford, Hampshire; Mr Malcolm Jennings, a motor dealer from Bethersden, Kent; and Mr Charles Johnson, from Brentford, west London, were all convicted of conspiring to defraud Autokam. Mr Mullins was also convicted on five charges of stealing almost Dollars 5m from the company. All three will be sentenced on May 27. In 1990, Autokam, based 100 miles outside Moscow, was seeking to break into the automotive market by assembling cars from parts imported from the west. With strong political backing from the then Gorbachev-led government, the company planned to build a large plant employing 740 people and using western production techniques. It intended importing parts from an established western manufacturer and assembling them into complete vehicles. The bulk of the cars would then be exported back to the west to earn hard currency. Its directors had experience in tank and truck manufacture under the old Soviet regime but little experience of operating in a market economy. They also lacked the support previously offered by the Soviet state. The Autokam directors also demonstrated considerable trust that a British businessman's word was always his bond. This proved to be sadly misplaced. Autokam's plans had begun to falter when their negotiations with western manufacturers such as BMW foundered. The company's lack of production experience meant no deal could be agreed. Instead, in summer 1990, it turned to Mr Mullins, who was looking for business opportunities in the emerging Russian market economy. He persuaded Autokam to agree to purchase the parts for 1,000 kit cars for Dollars 5m. The design of these cars had been carried out by the respected Hampshire-based Rickman Brothers motor engineers. However, their cars were hardly high-quality concepts. Their design involved grafting a glass-fibre body on to a steel chassis with the engine and other mechanical parts coming, second-hand, from obsolete Ford Escorts. The Rickmans doubted the suitability of their car for such an enterprise but Mr Mullins insisted the project was viable and bought their factory. He then agreed a second contract with Autokam - to supply 100,000 car kits at a price of Dollars 5,000 each. Mr Mullins was the main perpetrator of the fraud. He was supported by Mr Jennings, who became his technical adviser, and Mr Johnson, who was brought in to provide financial advice. The Russians paid the Dollars 5m for the first contract but their concerns mounted. To allay these fears, the three men used a variety of fraudulent devices, such as false accountancy reports and warranties, to persuade the Russians they were complying with the contract. All the Russians received for their Dollars 5m were 47 vehicles containing second hand parts, such as wiring looms, bought from Belgian scrapyards and passed off as new. Increasingly suspicious, the Russians contacted a British solicitor who contacted the police. The police handed the case over to the Serious Fraud Office. The experience left Autokam directors chastened, but not deterred, according to the company's UK solicitor Mr Andrew Stacey. 'They lacked commercial experience and perhaps had too much trust in those they were dealing with. They have now learnt some valuable lessons,' he said. In spite of the fraud, the company now assembles cars from parts manufactured by Ford and has taken a substantial interest in Reliant, the British motor manufacturer.</p>

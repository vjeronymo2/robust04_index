			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio accepted yesterday  afternoon the resignation of Economy Minister Fanny Dominguez de  Estrada and named Guillermo Rodriguez Mahuad as acting minister.    It was officially announced last night that President de  Leon  decided to accept Estrada's resignation after studying the  matter. She submitted her resignation in mid-November, shortly  after replacing Cesar Alcides Soto Rodas.    Ms. Estrada resigned citing health reasons, but the  government announced last night she will be named head of the  Association of Nontraditional Products (Gexpront), where she  performed a work public officials and private businessmen have  described as successful.    Banker and exporter Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo is reportedly  a  strong contender to replace Estrada, although the possibility  that Rodriguez may be confirmed has not been ruled out, given  that he is also an expert in commerce and international  businesses.</p>

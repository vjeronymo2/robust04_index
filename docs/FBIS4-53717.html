			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yu Tong-hui from Beijing] </F>   [Text] A Western source in Beijing well versed in North  Korean affairs said on 22 May: Kim Chong-il, North Korea's  successor, has been completely excluded from the decisionmaking  process in North Korea because he has been suffering from  serious illnesses like heart disease, ever since his excessive  pursuit of a hard-line policy toward China last year, which  drove North Korea into a wall, and which caused him to  eventually lose Kim Il-song's trust.    This source added: As a result, the inner circle of the  North Korean leadership has been seriously discussing the issue  of having Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's half brother, become the  successor.    This source also said: During last December's party and  government reshuffle, many of Kim Chong-il's confidants were  relieved from their posts, and Kim Yong-chu, Kim Il-song's  younger brother, who had disappeared from the North Korean power  circle in the mid-seventies, reappeared. Rumors abounded at  that time that something had happened to Kim Chong-il. However,  the rumors abated in early March, when Kim Chong-il met with a  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan delegation.  However, the Kim Chong-il who appeared at that time may have  been a "stand-in" [taeyok].    This source went on to say: North Korea sent Kim Pyong-il to  Finland as ambassador last December to soothe Kim Chong-il's  opposition to the expulsion of his confidants from the  leadership but called him in later. Kim Pyong-il again visited  Pyongyang recently. This was possible because Kim Chong-il's  power has waned significantly in a few months.</p>

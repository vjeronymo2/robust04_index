			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> U.K. LINKS IRAN RELATIONS TO THREAT  </P> <P> Iran must withdraw the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death edict against  author Salman Rushdie before relations between Tehran and London can return to  normal, Britain said today.  </P> <P> "We shall be looking to Iran to renounce publicly the use or threat of the use  of terrorism and violence," a Foreign Office spokesman said.  </P> <P> Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since Khomeini's order last  February. Iran broke diplomatic ties with Britain last March in the furor that  followed Khomeini's call on Muslims to kill Rushdie because his novel, "The  Satanic Verses," blasphemed Islam.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Try shares slip after trading statement Shares in Try Group, the contractor and housebuilder, yesterday fell 2p to 34p, after the company issued a trading statement warning of a break-even position at the operating level, exceptional charges of over Pounds 1m and no final dividend. The statement was made in response to a sharp rise in the share price, which yesterday reached as high as 41p. At the beginning of the year, Try's shares stood at 28p. The group's full-year results are due in mid-March. In 1992, pre-tax profits grew 43 per cent to Pounds 1.38m, while net attributable losses came out at Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 3m) after provisions of Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 3.23m) in respect of a move out of commercial and industrial property. Try said yesterday that its contracting and plant hire operations had traded profitably in the year, but 'continued recessionary influences' had resulted in a further loss from housebuilding. Certain actions had been taken to improve future profitability, which had resulted in exceptional charges. First, the group had secured its release - at a cost of Pounds 750,000  - from a rental guarantee relating to a property sold in 1990, which would otherwise have resulted in a continuing operating charge of about Pounds 300,000 a year. In addition, Try had incurred a restructuring charge of some Pounds 300,000 in respect of further rationalisation. Explaining its decision to omit the dividend, Try said that it had deemed it appropriate to recognise the accumulated deficit in its housebuilding division on the parent company balance sheet. The effect of this adjustment will be to eliminate the distributable reserves of the parent company and as a result, no final will be paid. Last year, the total dividend was cut from 6p to 1p with a 0.5p final. At the interim stage in September, the payment was held at 0.5p, although pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 68,000.</p>

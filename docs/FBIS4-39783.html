			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by A. Abonosimova from Vladivostok; from the </F> "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] The administration in Maritime Kray considers it  necessary to introduce direct presidential rule on the region's  territory. Asking for privileged economic conditions in  taxation, customs duties, subsidies, and compensation for two to  three years, the governor Ye. Nazdratenko believes that it is  necessary to introduce a state of emergency on the territory of  the Maritime region in order to fight gangsterism and crime.  Discipline and a tough executive authority are needed.    Insofar as the kray's economy and management cannot be  separated, the head of administration believes that it would be  very appropriate for the kray to switch to direct state rule, at  the same time as a resolution on the special economic situation  of the kray is signed in September after the arrival here of  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. A system for the compulsary  implementation of presidential decrees has been drafted. He had  the following to say about this.    [Nazdratenko] The government should take action on all of  these matters. Maybe even, in many cases, without the agreement  of parliament because of the inefficiency of the enterprises on  the territory of our country.    [Abonosimova] Sure of the support of the president and the  tendency of parliament to put a brake on matters, Nazdratenko,  asked who would make the decision to introduce emergency rule,  said:    [Nazdratenko] The Federation Council, of course -- that  would  be the ideal choice.</p>

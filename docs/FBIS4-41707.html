			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Text] The government adopted a decision in April to create  a federal fund to finance the early shipment of cargoes to the  North. A government commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister  Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray is responsible for the distribution  of the funds and the supervision of their use. During a news  conference held as a part of his working visit to Magadan, he  told of how this commission works:    [Begin Shakhray recording] This is not a tourist trip --  this  is the work of a government commission which has the powers to  solve some of the problems on site. This is how the commission  works: First, ministries represented by people empowered to  make decisions -- usually by a deputy minister -- work here with  the appropriate department of the administration. There are a  lot of examples: For example, the MPS [Ministry of Railroads] in  Krasnoyarsk Kray port solved several questions on the spot;  several problems were directly solved in Surgut. This same  applies to Magadan Oblast.    This is not just an exchange of opinions and information;  having discussed the volume of supply and financing, we are  actually preparing a government document containing instructions  on volumes, on what should shipped where, and how it should be  done and implemented. In other words, this is not a  familiarization tour and not a scientific and practical  conference.    Therefore, I hope -- no, I am certain -- that the situation  will change after this visit, not in the least because we have  squeezed out the first part of the financial aid of 55 billion  rubles as part of the preparations for this visit. The head of  the administration is now able to maneuver and make decisions  which we are also discussing here. Therefore, this is practical  work, and we will do everything to guarantee the minimum of  functions necessary for the North to survive. This means  Russia's wealth, and of course, people, specialists, and  resources.    But one should be honest and candid -- it has been mentioned  that under the conditions of the budget financing for 1994, we  will be forced to work under stressful conditions and will be  able to provide only a minimum, or maybe even bordering on the  minimum of what the North, in this case, Magadan Oblast, needs.  I am referring to petroleum products, coal, and a supply of  food reduced for the federal budget. [sentence as heard]    Moreover, there are issues critical to the oblast which have  to do with other kinds [of products]. We explored various ways  of applying efforts. A new system of financing was employed  this year -- instead of financial resources being scattered  across many organizations, in the case of Magadan Oblast,  practically all of it is deposited as a part of the budget in a  special account available to the head of Magadan Oblast. His  task is organizing the preagreement work, to check on suppliers  and consumers and their transportation systems -- the selection  is not very varied here -- so as to organize this work and to  prevent the scattering of funds.    We have allocated Magadan Oblast 50 billion rubles for this  fund from the federal fund. It is a budget subsidy with an  interest rate which is a little less than 70 percent of the  interest rate charged by the central bank. So, in effect, these  are preferential conditions for financing. We have allocated  Magadan Oblast 50 billion rubles for this fund, and you can  judge the demands for yourselves because according to the  limited calculations of the oblast itself, it needs more than  300 billion rubles. This is the sum which, together with  centralized credits amounting to about 35 billion rubles, would  allow us to start work, and to start it by bringing cargoes in.    We have decided on a protocol which would allow us to  finance  at least 70 percent of all the demand for cargoes brought in.  When the icebreaker fleet starts working, or when  Severo-Evenskiy Rayon, as a rayon of Magadan Oblast, closes  completely during a time of limited incoming shipments, it will  already be too late. Therefore, July is a key month, and in  organizing the work itself, the Magadan Oblast Administration  gives me hope that we will overcome this task through joint  efforts. We must not turn the North into yet another source of  Russian refugees -- not only from the South, as has been the  case up until now, but from the North as well. However, you  must understand that the people who remain in the North must be  those who would be guaranteed work, and who would be able to  live under conditions in which their children, family, and  environment would be protected.    Therefore, gold mining and other areas of development of  Magadan Oblast... [pauses] we have examined the issue of the two  hydroelectric power stations, and it is clear that there will be  a redistribution of resources, that new work places will have  to be looked for, and that there will be an exodus from Magadan  Oblast. However, this exodus must be an organized and a planned  one, and we have inspected the issue of the supply of  containers, of compensation, and of the fulfillment of  government edict No. 11-41 of last year on the payment of this  compensation. I do not want these processes to become  uncontrolled or unplanned, and it is desirable that even people  leaving Magadan Oblast or moving from the northern part of the  oblast to its south survive as the potential of the Far East and  the Russian North.

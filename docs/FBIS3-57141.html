			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko and Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- "The most alarming thing of all  happening in society is the real danger for the president of the  Russian Federation becoming isolated from those who were  professionally involved in implementing democratic reform and  from their support," Gennadiy Burbulis, a State Duma deputy from  the Russia's Choice Bloc, told ITAR-TASS correspondents in an  interview.    "It is necessary to persuade the president that unless he  relies on a clear and definite support from reformers, he risks  finding himself in isolation," he said. "In that case, serious  shocks may occur, including the hysteria around a possible  resignation of the government." We must do all we can to  prevent Boris Yeltsin from becoming alienated and isolated, he  added.    Burbulis considers that the government, with its present  composition, "has the resources and the country has the  professionals to continue reform-oriented policies." As for the  reform strategy itself, "it is in danger but not fatally so."    Burbulis did not rule out that "many work collectives might  seriously express their discontent" in April and May. However,  the president and the government are in a position to prevent  this happening. "A search for mechanisms of social and  professional rehabilitation of the workers who are under threat  of lay-offs should start today," he stressed.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: The price of saying 'oui' too often - The impact of Credit Lyonnais' lending miscalculations The opulent head office of Credit Lyonnais on Boulevard Haussmann in the heart of the Paris banking district is plastered with posters proclaiming its slogan - 'Le pouvoir de dire oui' ('The power to say yes'). However, when Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais' chairman, casts his eye along the list of his bank's debtors, he must wish that it had not said 'oui' quite so often. This afternoon he will reveal annual results which will show how much it cost Credit Lyonnais to say yes to Mr Robert Maxwell - the disgraced British media baron - Mr Giancarlo Parretti - the Italian businessman who hauled the bank into an embarrassing and expensive legal fight over MGM, the Hollywood movie studio - and Mr Jean Luc Lagardere - whose media empire, Hachette, has been hit by the collapse of La Cinq, the French TV station. Analysts are bracing themselves for a fall in net profits from last year's FFr3.7bn (Dollars 672.7m) and for hefty provisions, which, as one put it, 'could be anything from FFr7bn to FFr10bn'. The agony will not end there. Even if Credit Lyonnais makes the fullest possible provisions for 1991, it almost certainly faces another painful write-down for 1992 because of its exposure to the precarious property sector, particularly to Olympia &amp; York, the ailing Canadian company currently trying to reschedule its Dollars 20bn debt. Credit Lyonnais is believed to be O&amp;Y's second biggest European creditor, after Barclays. On the surface Credit Lyonnais seems to be paying a painful price for the aggressive lending policy pursued by Mr Haberer in the late 1980s. This formed part of his attempts to turn the sleepy, state-controlled French bank into a 'universal bank' along the lines of the mighty Deutsche Bank, with broad interests across the banking sector, extensive industrial investments and one of Europe's biggest retail banking networks, with a significant presence in Belgium, Spain and Italy as well as France. The cynics in the French financial establishment, who had fumed as Mr Haberer swept through the ranks of the Treasury and then to the top of the prestigious Paribas investment banking group, were quick to condemn his plans. Over the past year or so they have barely bothered to disguise their glee as Credit Lyonnais' loans have gone sour. But Credit Lyonnais' predicament may not be quite as bad as they believe. Some aspects of Mr Haberer's strategy have undoubtedly flopped, notably the loans policy. Many big banks lent money to the stricken giants of the 1980s, but few banks lent quite so much money to so many losers as Credit Lyonnais. Credit Lyonnais has tried to limit the damage. It secured some of its loans to Mr Maxwell and has managed to securitise part of its Soviet debt. It has also won its legal battle against Mr Parretti, if only to be left with the stricken MGM. Moody's, the credit ratings agency, last autumn lowered the rating on Dollars 6.9bn of its long term debt. That said, the real impact of Credit Lyonnais' bad debts is not as disastrous as it first appears. Mr Sasha Serafimovski, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, reckoned that if it made provisions of FFr8bn for 1991, the charge as a proportion of total loans would be 1.3 per cent. This would be much lower than such proportions at the big banks in the UK, with an average of 2 per cent, and in the US, where the worst cases have reached 3 per cent. Moreover, Mr Haberer's strategy has succeeded in some areas. He has been criticised in France for his ambitious international expansion, but most of the investments, notably the Italian and Spanish retail networks, are thought to be performing well as is the core French network. 'Credit Lyonnais has invested heavily in tighter management and cost control which seems to be paying off,' said Mr Chris Davis, European banking analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. The progress in retail banking augurs well for the future. Credit Lyonnais is trying to expand in Germany where it is in negotiations over an investment in BfG Bank. Last year it also fared well in other financial activities - the Altus banking subsidiary in France and its huge junk bond portfolio in the US. But Altus is a volatile business, as illustrated by its swing from hefty losses (from foreign exchange dealings) in the first half of 1991 into an impressive profit for the full year, as are junk bonds. 'These are high risk businesses,' said Mr Serafimovski. 'Credit Lyonnais could make a killing one year, but nothing the next. And what is a French bank doing with one of the biggest junk bond portfolios in the US?' But most analysts seem prepared to accept that, however ghastly today's results may be, it is still too soon to assess whether, in the long term, Mr Haberer's strategy will succeed. 'Credit Lyonnais certainly has its problems, but this is a very big business. It will be three or four years before we can make a sensible assessment,' said Mr Davis.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                         CREDIT LYONNAIS  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1986    1987    1988    1989    1990 Total balance sheet (FFr bn)    20.2    24.6    33.8    39.0    61.6 Total banking income (FFr m)  26,438  27,297  30,171  35,236  40,830 Net profit (FFr m)             1,821   2,223   2,063   3,130   3,707  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Credit Lyonnais annual report  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

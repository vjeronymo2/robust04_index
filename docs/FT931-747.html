			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais hires agency CREDIT Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank that controls MGM, the loss-making Hollywood studio, has taken the unusual step of hiring Creative Artists Agency (CAA), the leading Hollywood talent agency, to advise on the management and strategy of the bank's Dollars 3bn entertainment industry loan portfolio. The hiring of CAA, whose chairman Mr Michael Ovitz is considered the most influential power broker in Hollywood, comes in the wake of controversy, lawsuits and a flood of red ink from MGM. Credit Lyonnais took control of the studio last year after a bitter court battle with Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who received a Dollars 1bn loan from the bank to buy MGM in 1990. For Mr Ovitz the deal with Credit Lyonnais marks another step towards his goal of expanding from the handling of movie industry talent to investment banking. Mr Ovitz has worked on deals such as the Dollars 6bn acquisition of MCA/Universal, the Hollywood studio, by Matsushita of Japan and the Dollars 3.4bn purchase of Columbia Pictures by Sony of Japan. MGM is believed to have suffered a 1992 operating loss of about Dollars 80m, or half the previous year's deficit.</p>

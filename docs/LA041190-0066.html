			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FLY THAT'S BUGGING SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> New Medflies are popping up in all sorts of places. Yesterday, West Los Angeles  -- tomorrow? Still, the state says that it's sticking to its May 9 deadline for  the end of widespread malathion spraying in some 350 square miles of Los  Angeles and Orange counties. But it also says that it's reserving its right to  spray, once or twice, new areas of infestations. If necessary, the state says,  a new infestation will be put down by malathion spraying first, followed by a  release of sterile flies to breed the remaining pests out of existence.  </P> <P> Make sense? While many scientists agree there is no pesticide more "innocuous"  than malathion, the state's seemingly instinctive reliance on pesticides as the  first line of defense against pests like the Medfly raises serious questions.  So does proposed legislation by Assemblyman Norm Waters (D-Plymouth). The bill  would extend indefinitely the exemption, scheduled to expire Jan. 1, 1991, that  allows the California Department of Food and Agriculture to pesticide-bomb  pests without an assessment of the effect on the environment (an environmental  impact report).  </P> <P> The pro-exemption lobby, which includes the agriculture department and the  Western Growers Assn., argues that the state must be able to respond to  infestations in a timely manner to avoid a permanent establishment not just of  Medflies but of other destructive insects. But it makes no sense to extend the  pesticide free hand indefinitely. Any stopgap measure is by definition  temporary, to be used only until a permanent solution is found. But no  permanent solution for combatting the Medfly is likely to be found as long as  the state holds onto the pesticide security blanket. With no responsibility to  demonstrate the environmental impact of using pesticides, the use of pesticides  will likely remain the easiest feasible option to eradicate troublesome bugs  and will prevent other options from receiving the degree of study, testing,  planning and money needed to be develop them.  </P> <P> Because there will likely always be some degree of ambiguity about the health  effects of malathion, most residents of California would like to believe that  the state would consider pesticide spraying, especially over crowded urban  areas, as a last-resort method of eradication. But the Waters bill, and the  department's support of it, suggests that the old-style mentality still  prevails.  </P></p>

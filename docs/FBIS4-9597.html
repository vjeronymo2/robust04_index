			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 28 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs are  demanding that all aid convoys for the Moslem enclave of Gorazde  start from Belgrade, the aid organisation International Action  Against Hunger (AICF) said Thursday [28 April]. The Serbs have  already halted a convoy organised by AICF in Sarajevo and bound  for Gorazde, the aid agency said.    "Only UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] military convoys are  authorized by the Bosnian Serbs to travel from Sarajevo to  Gorazde," according to Beatrice d'Ervau, spokeswoman for the  humanitarian group. The group's convoy in Sarajevo was  originally to have been escorted by UNPROFOR, but the Serbs  refused to allow UN involvement. They demanded that the convoy  be protected by Serb militias, which was unacceptable to the  organisers.    On Wednesday, an International Committee of the Red Cross  convoy arrived in the eastern Bosnian enclave after being held  up for several days in Pale, the Bosnian Serb self-proclaimed  capital. A NATO ultimatum which eventually sparked the Bosnian  Serb withdrawal from around Gorazde included a demand that aid  convoys be allowed unimpeded access to the enclave, which was  under Serb assault for three weeks.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES traders appeared satisfied yesterday with a session which saw stock index futures moving erratically before closing with the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index near to the fair value premium, writes Terry Byland. Trading volume eased as, in the early part of the session at least, tensions over the political drama in Russia relaxed somewhat. The session was punctuated by rumours, sometimes reported on the international newswires, of developments or impending developments in Moscow. Early trading saw the December contract move up to 3,041 before reversing to 3,015. Switching into UK gilts from other European markets inspired a closing rally in equities and December closed at 3,025, a premium of 22 against cash, compared with 24 on the fair value premium which allows for dividend flows and the cost of carrying the underlying stocks until December. Volume dropped from 15,230 to 10,303 lots. Business in traded options fell sharply, from 42,110 on Wednesday to 28,690 yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 8,600 contracts against 14,753. The Euro FT-SE option traded 5,477 contracts, while pressures from the equity market brought 1,475 deals in Guinness. J. Sainsbury saw 1,220 lots transacted as food retailer shares fell sharply, and Tarmac (1,062) was also active.</p>

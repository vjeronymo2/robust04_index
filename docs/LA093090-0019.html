			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VICTIM OF POLITICS -- OR OF BAD ART?  </P> <P> "It is a crisis, but one of public policy and politics -- not of art," writes  Allan Parachini, immediately distorting the issues at stake at the Los Angeles  Theatre Center ("At LATC, Not All the Drama Is Onstage," Sept. 16).  </P> <P> As a displaced Chicagoan who stopped attending the center some months ago not  because of the dangers of downtown L.A. but because of the garbage on the  stages, let me assure you the LATC problem is fundamentally artistic.  </P> <P> It is rousing to have a "cause" -- like saving a threatened theater, but not  all theaters deserve saving and not all closures are unjustified.  </P> <P> The theater's attempt to pass itself off as a cutting-edge, avant-garde outlet  for "dangerous" work is pure hype. Its revivals are stodgy, its new work  pathetic and its multi-ethnic policy designed to attract political rather than  artistic converts.  </P> <P> Artistic director Bill Bushnell has had plenty of time to prove himself in Los  Angeles. All he has demonstrated is ineptitude. It is high time genuine theater  artists rather than pseudo-rebels and phony iconoclasts got down to the  business of creating real theater in this town.  </P> <P> ED TRUJULLI  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

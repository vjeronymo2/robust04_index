			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Official statement by the Republic of Azerbaijan MVD </F> [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Press Service"]    [Text] The radical wing of the political opposition, united  within the framework of the so-called "Karabakh Liberation  Movement," recently announced its intention to conduct a mass  action of disobedience in March and to call upon the republic's  people to revolt against the country's legal leaders.    It is necessary to point out that illegal armed formations  have been one of the main factors destabilizing the situation in  the republic in recent years, and they have served as an  implement of violent actions aimed against the state and  citizens of Azerbaijan.    A particularly large quantity of arms were illegally  distributed to members of the NFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan]  and other radical organizations when A. Elchibey was president,  and there is documentary evidence of this. Despite repeated  appeals by the authorities, only a small part of the arms held  by them have been returned to the republic's law enforcement  organs.    Taking into account the extreme public danger of calls to  revolt, which are a threat to Azerbaijan's national security,  the republic's law enforcement organs have recently stepped up  their work to confiscate the combat weapons held illegally by  private individuals.    During the course of this work more than 100 firearms, over  200 explosives and incendiary agents, and 95 bulletproof vests  and other munitions and equipment have been confiscated from  various members of the radical opposition. Seven persons have  been arrested for their illegal possession. An investigation is  being conducted in connection with the discovery of munitions  and military gear on the premises of the NFA headquarters; there  have been no arrests.    These actions by the authorities have received the full  support of the republic's citizens, who are tired of the illegal  acts and political extremism of the radical opposition.    In attempting to whitewash their illegal activity, the  radical opposition and the mass media controlled by it seek to  misrepresent the actual course of events and unleash a  propaganda racket about "repressions" and "persecution" against  the opposition.    Unfortunately, many news agencies have become unwitting  participants in this deliberate manipulation by disseminating  unverified information.    In this connection, the press service of the Azerbaijan MVD  has been authorized to state the following.    Observance of personal rights and freedoms is a fundamental  principle in the Republic of Azerbaijan's domestic and foreign  policy. The authorities' actions to ensure the security of  citizens, the society, and the state and to confiscate the  weapons held illegally by extremist and radical groups who call  for violent actions are aimed at these very objectives.  Political pluralism and the rights and freedoms of opposition  organizations are observed to the full extent, and the activity  within the law by many opposition parties and their mass media,  which do not pursue extremist objectives or call for violent  actions, attests to this.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Variable vintage in Burgundy Although the production of fine burgundies is a fraction of Bordeaux's output, the quality of the former is much harder to assess when first available for public tasting: in the cellars of the Hospices de Beaune before the auction of its new wines on the third Sunday of November. Bordeaux, better organised, wait for its Union des Grands Crus around April 1. This year, the Hospices' 38 cuvees, mostly from the Cote de Beaune, were particularly hard to taste as, in order to avoid the risk of a secondary fermentation - highly unlikely, anyhow, especially in this year's very cold weather - the wines all were injected with sulphides just before the weekend of the auction. The result was a lack of colour and a hard, acid taste that obscured fruit and body. This could have contributed to a 24 per cent fall in prices for the reds and 5.4 per cent for the whites: a drop for the fourth year in succession following the mostly excessive rises from 1985 to 1989. During those years, prices that, for charity and publicity reasons, traditionally are about double those in the outside market, rose by three or four times. This year, in a stagnant market for the Cote d'Ors Grand and Premiers Crus wines, merchants were less prepared to buy. The classic red Beaune, Nicolas Rolin, that had made more than FFr43,000 a cask (300 bottles) in 1989 was knocked down this time for FFr12,000, while the Meursault Philippe le Bon fell from FFr81,000 to FFr20,000. And although 759 casks were offered - 96 more than last year and the highest total for 20 years - the proceeds of FFr10.617m were more than FFr1m less than 12 months earlier. The most interesting aspect was the substantial acquisition by merchant firms which deal with French supermarkets. Unlike buyers for top-level clarets, these firms had not been much involved with leading burgundies. As in Bordeaux, a potentially very fine vintage was diluted by rain. There had been an early but variable flowering at the beginning of June, followed by stormy weather in June and July, but August was exceptionally hot and sunny. Picking began in the Cote de Beaune on September 15 and was mostly completed by the 21st. Then came heavy rain on the 22nd and later, just when much of the Cote de Nuits was picking. The parcellation of the Burgundy vineyards means that it is sometimes hard to summarise the year's vintage. In theory, this year, the Cote de Beaune was more successful than the Cote de Nuits, but I tasted prominent tannin everywhere. Eighty per cent of Meursault's premier cru was damaged by hail and there was hail, too, in Chambolle. A provisional expectation is fairly light reds that can be drunk early but whites that are austere and lack character. Prices will not follow the Hospices' falls - for the simple reason that they have dropped already. In the past year, so much regional wine (Bourgogne Rouge, Aligote, Macon, etc) has been sold at low, often loss-making, prices that a run on the '93s has cleared out the market already. There is no en primeur fine wine market in Burgundy and most growers (not the merchants) prefer to offer their wines in bottle in two years' time. So, we have plenty of time to make up our minds about buying the '93s. But, like their two predecessors, they will be inexpensive by burgundy standards. (Indeed, one distinguished merchant, Louis Latour, told me that in real money terms, prices were back to the 1962 level.) I tasted some attractive '92 whites at prices half those of the '89s. The '92s will be available next spring and the reds are thought to be acceptable but not very interesting although the whites already have a high reputation: rich and full-bodied. The '91 whites, appear dull although, on the spot, there are some great admirers of the reds. Of course, the most attractive vintage recently is '90, but whether it is superior to the '89s remains open to question. The trade in Burgundy is in better shape than last year, and there is a good market for the 'village' wines. The recession in France has hit hard, but both Latour and Drouhin have expressed confidence in the UK market. Confirmed burgundy drinkers can look forward to plenty of very acceptable, moderately priced wines.</p>

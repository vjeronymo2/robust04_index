			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Monks, not devils THE LAST TIME China tried to cool an overheating economy, in the late 1980s, it did so too late, with a heavy hand and evidently without the benefit of foreign expert advice. The result is history: the economy's hard landing, political turbulence and the international isolation that followed the 1989 Tiananmen square massacre. This time, China's economic overlord, Mr Zhu Rongji, is determined to do things differently. In the last two months, he has moved deftly and rapidly to combat rising inflation and curb helter-skelter growth by tightening control over the country's financial system and central bank. His measures have probably come (just) in time to permit a softer landing. As remarkably, Mr Zhu is acting in part on the advice of economists from the World Bank and elsewhere - people whom Communist party bosses would only a few years ago have dismissed as 'foreign devils'. The World Bank has, of course, been present in China for many years and has assisted in Deng Xiaoping's 15-year effort to open up the economy. But the involvement of foreign advisers in recent months is the clearest possible indication of Mr Zhu's desire to cool it down without stifling market reform. Moreover, as the bank points out, the measures he has adopted - a mixture of old-style administrative commands and more sophisticated financial fine-tuning - accurately reflect an economy poised between the distortions of communism and the dynamics of capitalism. Mr Zhu has a simply gargantuan task in moving further from the former towards the latter: reforms of foreign trade, the tax system, state-owned industry and the welfare state all lie ahead. But in attempting to sort out the financial system first, he has started in the right place. If he perseveres, he may be able to pull off a trick that eluded his predecessors: breaking the economy's boom-bust cycle and engineering a steadier path of growth towards the market.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Information, not technology, is key asset Sir, I commend your editorial position ('IT's not a knockout', May 17) that information technology is no 'magic bullet'. There is, indeed, a growing body of research which indicates that IT rarely produces lasting advantage. IT seems only to magnify existing advantages. Yet, the same research suggests that the electronic integration of both markets and organisations is inevitable. No company can afford to ignore the consequences of the dramatic industrial reorganisation which this is now causing. As you suggest, in one sense business will remain as usual. Success will belong to those with 'shrewd judgment, entrepreneurship, innovation, and sound organisation'. However, these terms are likely to have new connotations. An abundance of information forces us to take a more complex view of the world. Future entrepreneurs may have to reflect more carefully before acting. What will 'gut instinct' mean when existing information concerning customer preference can be run through sophisticated models of market demand? The answer will not be welcomed by executives who thrive on simple solutions, for example, those who believe in magic bullets. We must learn that information, not technology, is the crucial asset and that learning to use information judiciously will be the key to success in an electronically integrated world. Governments and businesses invest billions annually developing new technologies. Surely, they should spend a fraction of this sum learning to use information better. This is the 'secret' of sustaining competitive advantage, both at national and corporate levels, but it is a lesson which we refuse to learn. Until we do, the FT will continue to have stories such as Taurus, London Ambulance, and Wessex Health Authority to write. The FT must have a vested interest in keeping the secret.

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Bolivia and Peru in trade accord Bolivia and Peru have signed a free trade agreement, Chris Philipsborn reports from La Paz. The treaty marks the tentative first step in Peru's attempts to restore trading links with its neighbours since it dropped out of the Andean trade pact in July. Tariffs on some 6,000 products are to be axed. However, as a concession to the Peruvian agricultural sector, tariffs of 8 per cent will be maintained on soya and sunflower oil.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: AVANT-GARDE WILL FIND ITS PLACE IN THE  SUN AT ELARIO'S  </P> <P> In a radical departure from the status quo, Elario's will play host to a  one-night visit by jazz space cadet Sun Ra and his 15-piece Arkestra next  Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The appearance by an avant-garde jazz artist is the first shake-up by San Diego  Jazz Festival founder Rob Hagey since he took over as talent coordinator last  month, replacing Steve Satkowski.  </P> <P> It was Hagey who first brought Sun Ra to San Diego, for a sold-out show at the  Old Globe Theatre's Festival Stage in 1980. This time around, Ra will tame his  act in deference to the slightly more conservative surroundings, playing a  tribute to Big Band leaders Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson.  </P> <P> Hagey acknowledges that the progressive show is an experiment; he said he needs  to sell 150 tickets between the two shows to break even. Shows are at 8:30 and  10:30.  </P> <P> Ra, whose real name is Herman (Sonny) Blount, was weaned on traditional jazz in  Chicago, played with Henderson's band, and arranged Big Band charts for  Henderson and Benny Goodman. He started his Arkestra in 1955.  </P> <P> Today his band's collective improvising isn't so shocking, but it turned a few  heads in the early days as probably the first Big Band to depart from  traditional structures.  </P> <P> There is some degree of mystery surrounding Mr. Ra, if we can call him that. He  claims to have arrived from Saturn, and has no legal birth certificate. He is  purported to be in his late 70s, and lives in Philadelphia. The Arkestra's most  recent album is last year's "Blue Delight."  </P> <P> Rusefest '90, which brought a rare dose of experimental jazz to town this  spring, including a performance by the Bay Area-based Rova Saxophone Quartet,  closes Friday night with a concert by pianist Joe Garrison with the Ruse Brass  Ensemble and featured soloists.  </P> <P> The group will dish up new music by Garrison, who has titled this suite "My  Brothers, My Sisters."  </P> <P> "My point of departure was, I'm really tired of musicians using music as a way  to justify their lives," Garrison said. 'I want to take care of my life. I want  my life to work. It used to be enough to worship music. A lot of musicians do  that, and they hurt a lot of people in the process. They hurt their families;  they don't care enough about other people; they put music above everything. I'm  trying to join the human race, put people first.  </P> <P> "That's what I was thinking about while I wrote. I also noticed I was letting  go of my iron grip on the compositions and thinking of the strength of the  players. Some of these pieces will only work because of the specific  musicians."  </P> <P> Among Garrison's band mates for this date will be trombonists Louis Watkins,  Will Martin and Jeff Bernard and trumpeters Derrick Cannon and Bill Caballero.  Featured soloists will include Frank Lamarca on tenor sax, David Millard on  soprano, Turiya on bass clarinet and flute, plus Caballero. Several of the  players, including Garrison, are also members of Turiya's Immediate Freedom  Band.  </P> <P> Garrison said the music is designed specifically for this Big Band lineup, but  with a more abstract approach than is typical of Big Band charts. Some of the  music is quite formal in structure, some virtually free-form, according to  Garrison.  </P> <P> You'll hear traces of Latin in the music, but nothing like what Garrison and  the Immediate Freedom Band produce; this band doesn't have a percussion  section.  </P> <P> The music starts at 8 p.m. in the San Diego City College Theatre on C Street  between 13th and 15th streets.  </P> <P> Keyboard player and studio wiz Spencer Nilsen, whose debut album, "Architects  of Change," enjoyed moderate success last year on light jazz and new age radio  stations, is ready to perform live for the first time. Nilsen will mix tunes  from the album with new compositions next Wednesday night in the Catamaran's  Cannibal Bar in Mission Beach.  </P> <P> Nilsen said his post-album compositions are heading in a new direction. In  addition to playing keyboards, he's been singing, and he hopes to reach a  broader audience with a sound he calls "global pop," influenced by artists such  as Sting and Peter Gabriel.  </P> <P> The key to the live act is trumpeter and wind synthesizer player Mitch Manker,  who has backed Ray Charles. Manker uses the synthesizer to duplicate lead  melodies produced on Nilsen's album by a variety of instruments, including  violin. Rounding out the group are Brad Kaiser on drums, Dave Curtis on bass  guitar and former Flight 7 guitarist Mark Shapiro.  </P> <P> For next Wednesday's performance, Nilsen has sculpted a tight 90-minute show  that includes new material and seven songs from his album. He'll play it twice,  at 8 and 10.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Sunday's show at UC San Diego featuring Cecil Lytle and Sonny Rollins  has been canceled. . . . Next Tuesday, trombonist Rocky Cole puts a sextet  through its paces for KSDS-FM's (88.3) "Jazz Live" concert at the City College  Theatre, with a live broadcast on the station. . . . Trumpeter Bill Caballero  unveiled his new seven-piece tropical and Latin band, Quien Sabe, last Friday  night at a downtown dance studio. Caballero is a Texas transplant whose recent  San Diego work has included frequent appearances with Turiya and her Immediate  Freedom Band. . . . Today and tomorrow, pianist Mike Wofford holds down the  lunchtime solo piano at Cafe Lautrec in La Jolla from noon to 3:30. Wofford  also plays the new Hyatt Regency in La Jolla from 5 to 7:30 p.m. Monday. . . .  Friday and Saturday nights, flutist Lori Bell and pianist Dave Mackay hit the  Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown. . . . With the success of his first  two "Innovation in Modern Music" concerts at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach,  jazz promoter Bob Geib hopes to continue the jazz revival at the club with such  names as trombonist Mike Fahn, Freddie Hubbard sideman Bob Sheppard, former  Count Basie trumpeter Oscar Brashear, Harold Land Jr. and Key Akagi, a  keyboardist who's worked with Miles Davis. . . . Art Johnson, master of  seven-string jazz guitar, plays Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest this  Sunday at 3 p.m., with Gary Scott on flute and sax and Jim Plank on drums.  </P></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Attwoods' US unit indicted A SUBSIDIARY of Attwoods, the waste management group where Sir Denis Thatcher is deputy chairman, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for billing irregularities and alleged violations of municipal contracts. The indictments, from the District of Maryland, follow an investigation by the US attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the group's Eastern Waste Industries subsidiary in Annapolis. Attwoods said the indictments related to overcharging dating back to 1982, before the company was acquired. The investigations had already been reported to shareholders. A Dollars 10m provision was made in the last accounts. Customers who had been overcharged had been reimbursed with interest at a cost of about Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.7m), according to Mr Ken Foreman, chairman and chief executive. Directors still believed the provisions were adequate to cover legal costs and any fines that might arise from the indictment of the company and eight current and former employees. Mr Foreman said: 'There is no doubt that customers were overcharged. We discovered it and wrote to every customer back to 1982.' Most of the customers affected had stayed with Eastern. He said Attwoods had begun auditing and reimbursing customers in March 1990, before the federal authorities announced the investigation. The employees who Attwoods thought were responsible for the over-billing had been fired. It did not believe the indicted employees still with the company were guilty. Attwoods is about to report preliminary results depressed partly by poor performance at its US recycling company.</p>

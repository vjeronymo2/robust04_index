			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK: HOW TO BUY TREASURY SECURITIES BY MAIL  </P> <P> QUESTION: I need information regarding the purchase of Treasury bonds, bills  and notes. At what locations can they be bought? Is there a fee? Are there  specific times during the year when they are for sale? Do you pay federal taxes  on them? Do you pay state taxes on them? -- A. H.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Treasury securities, the generic name for bonds, bills and notes, can  be purchased from several outlets. Banks and brokers sell them, but often  charge a fee of as much as $25 per security. Perhaps you might be more  interested in making your purchase directly from the U.S. government, which  charges no fee.  </P> <P> Bonds, ranging in maturity from 10-30 years, are available in $1,000 increments  to a maximum of $1 million from the Federal Reserve Bank or any of its  branches. The Los Angeles branch is located at 950 S. Grand. You may also buy  bonds by mail through the Bureau of the Public Debt, Washington, 20239.  Personal checks are accepted. Bonds are traditionally auctioned four times a  year -- in February, May, August and November -- and the interest rates paid by  the bonds are set then.  </P> <P> Treasury bills and notes are shorter-term instruments than bonds. T-bills, as  they are known, are sold in 3-, 6- and 12-month maturities and are available in  $5,000 increments from a minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $1 million.  Three-month and 6-month bills are auctioned every Monday; 12-month bills are  sold once a month.  </P> <P> Treasury notes come in a variety of maturities and amounts. Two-year and  three-year notes are available in increments of $5,000 from a minimum of $5,000  to a maximum of $1 million. Four-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes are available in  increments of $1,000 from a minimum of $1,000 to a maximum of $1 million.  Two-year notes are sold monthly; the rest are sold quarterly.  </P> <P> You may buy any of the bills or notes directly from any Federal Reserve branch,  or by mail. Before buying through the mail, you are well advised to establish a  "Treasury Direct" account with the Federal Reserve. For appropriate forms,  Southern California residents may write to the Federal Reserve at P.O. Box 2077  Terminal Annex, Los Angeles, Calif. 90051. Mark your envelope "Attention:  Securities Information." You may also obtain a detailed auction schedule by  writing to the same address.  </P> <P> Once you have opened a mail-order account, you may order T-bills or notes by  sending a check payable to the Federal Reserve Bank. Treasury bill purchases  must be accompanied by a cashier's check; for Treasury notes, a personal check  will suffice. Again, Southern California residents would reach the local  Reserve branch at P.O. Box 2077 Terminal Annex, Los Angeles, Calif. 90051.  Certified mail is recommended to ensure that the order arrives at least one day  prior to the auction.  </P> <P> Interest paid on Treasury securities is exempt from state and local taxes but  not federal taxes.  </P> <P> Few Are Eligible to Choose Own Tax Year  </P> <P> Q: I don't quite understand the optional taxable year section of my income tax  form. May I pick the beginning and end of my own tax year? This would be  helpful since my last paycheck for 1989 covered only until Dec. 17. Can I just  make my tax year from Jan. 1 to Dec. 17? Also, I was married on Dec. 31. Must I  file as married, or -- if my tax year ends Dec. 17 -- may I file as a single  individual? It would be nice to avoid the "marriage penalty." -- A. R.  </P> <P> A: For a variety of reasons, which we'll detail below, you are probably stuck  with the traditional Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 tax year like the rest of us. Further,  because you were married as of Dec. 31 -- and regardless of the tax year matter  -- you are required to file your tax return as married.  </P> <P> According to our tax experts, the provision for choosing the taxable year is  meant for businesses, not individuals, unless you can persuade the Internal  Revenue Service that you have a pretty good reason for deviating from the pack.  And even if you could persuade the IRS, you would have to select the dates of  your tax year the very first time you filed your income tax return. Finally,  your tax year must end on the final day of a month.  </P></p>

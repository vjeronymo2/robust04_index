			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Anger over seizure of documents at Italian party HQ: Berlusconi denounces 'orchestrated' action The pent-up anger in the final stages of Italy's election campaign exploded yesterday when police seized documents from the headquarters of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. Media magnate Mr Berlusconi made an enraged attack upon what he claimed was a politically orchestrated action against the movement's Rome and Milan offices. He will meet President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today to express his concern about the degeneration of the electoral contest, due to take place on Sunday. Mr Berlusconi leads the rightwing bloc, which in polls last week was marginally ahead. But Forza Italia was able to claim the scalp of one of the leading figures in the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) which is spearheading the anti-Berlusconi campaign. Mr Luciano Violante, the head of the parliamentary anti-mafia commission, was forced to resign yesterday following an interview in which he alleged Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, an important member of Mr Berlusconi's entourage, was under investigation by Catania magistrates for arms and drugs trafficking. Police moved into Forza Italia headquarters in Milan and Rome yesterday morning on the orders of magistrates from Palmi near Reggio Calabria. For almost two years, the Palmi magistrature has been conducting an investigation that links membership of secret masonic lodges with organised crime, elements in the security services, and political parties. It said it had requested police to obtain a list of Forza Italia clubs, their members and party candidates. 'This was totally without justification and involved no notification of any crime having been committed,' Mr Berlusconi said. He added: 'This has never happened before in our democracy. These things only happen in totalitarian states. In a free country the electorate are those who judge the parties with their vote.' Some of his aides suggested he would ask President Scalfaro to postpone the elections. It was the second time during the campaign that he has complained to the president of unfair treatment by the opposition. The conflict between the PDS-led Progressive Alliance and the Berlusconi camp has been intensifying for several days. The PDS has not forgiven Mr Berlusconi for his exploitation of his commercial television network to make Forza Italia a leading political player. Mr Berlusconi, meanwhile, believes many institutions of state, including the magistrature, are sympathetic to the PDS and deliberately sabotaging Forza Italia. The PDS has been trying to undermine Mr Berlusconi's credibility as an entrepreneur. It also sensed he was politially inept at handling criticism in public. As a result, it has forced him away from his carefully scripted role as the seductive purveyor of good news. Mr Violante, however, made a serious error in breaching judicial secrecy and revealing the state of investigations into Mr Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, the advertising arm of Fininvest.</p>

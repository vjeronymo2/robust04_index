			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers One of the finest private wine cellar's to come on the market is to be sold at Christie's on Thursday June 16. Some 18,000 bottles from the world's greatest wine estates, which have been assembled over 30 years by a private collector, are expected to fetch more than Pounds 1m. Many of the wines are so rare they hardly ever appear at auction by bottle, let alone by the case. For example, there are seven cases of Chateau Cheval Blanc 1947, one of the greatest clarets, and each case is expected to fetch between Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 300,000. Other highlights of the cellar include: eight cases of Chateau La Mission Haut Brion 1945; seven cases of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1959; eight cases of Hermitage La Chapelle 1961 and 16 cases of Gewurztraminer, Cuvee Anne Schlumberger 1976. Mixed lots will range in estimate from as little as Pounds 80.</p>

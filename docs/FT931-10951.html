			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / People: Healthy Julien turns to tax Michael Julien, the former group chief executive of Storehouse, has become a non-executive director at Chiltern Financial Services, an international tax consultancy firm based in London. Julien resigned from Storehouse last summer in order to recover from what was called at the time a 'mystery virus'. Though none of his doctors believes in the ailment, Julien believes it was chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as ME, and irreverently as yuppie flu. But Julien, at 54, says he is no yuppie. More important, he is substantially recovered, and is taking Chiltern as the first of what he hopes will be a number of non-executive directorships which he is currently examining. Chiltern was founded in 1977. Dennis Tapper, the executive chairman, says he expects Julien - its first non-executive director - to tender his experience of large companies and strategic development. He had come across the consultancy when he had used its services in the past. Julien qualified as a chartered accountant at Price Waterhouse, became finance director at BICC, then at Midland Bank and finally was managing director of Guinness at the time of what he calls 'the event of which we don't speak'. He has no plans to return to a full-time executive position with any company, except his own family business, Uniform Clothing in London, which makes ceremonial uniforms. He is also indulging his passion for France, and has an eye open for non-executive directorships at companies with an international focus so that he can mix business with pleasure. ***** Jim Felker is resigning as a director of Simon Engineering, where he had responsibility for Simon's environmental division. He will step down at the end of March to become president and chief executive of EMCON, a US engineering and consultancy business. Simon has sold off nearly all its environmental businesses this year because of falling profits. On Wednesday the company made its last disposal, selling its European environmental consultancy division to Northumbrian Water for Pounds 10.5m. ***** John Rose, corporate development director of ROLLS-ROYCE, has been assigned to Rolls-Royce Inc as president and chief executive officer; he succeeds John Sandford, recently appointed md of the aerospace group in the UK. ***** David Kitching, formerly director new business development of BICC Andover Controls, has joined TEMEC as commercial director. ***** Dares Estates, the heavily indebted property developer currently in talks with its bankers, may be remembered for one thing in the current recession. It has laid off its finance director in order to cut costs. Michael Giles Knopp, who has worked for the company for seven years, has resigned as a director of Dares although he will remain a consultant. Brian Tomlinson, Dares' chief executive, is a chartered accountant and says that Giles Knopp's departure is part of a cost-cutting exercise. He will take on Giles Knopp's responsibilities. At its peak the firm employed 18 staff but there are just eight left on the payroll.</p>

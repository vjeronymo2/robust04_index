			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lilliput Lane to float 3 years after Pounds 1.2m rescue LILLIPUT LANE, the Cumbrian miniature model maker, is to float in November, only three years after being rescued with Pounds 1.2m of venture capital. North of England Ventures, which put in Pounds 850,000, is expected to make an estimated Pounds 7m from selling five-sixths of its 30 per cent stake. Lazard Ventures, which had previously backed a disastrous diversification by Lilliput in 1987, was the other institutional equity partner in the 1990 deal. Mr John Russell, whose appointment as chairman and chief executive was a condition of the rescue, will continue to run the business. Lilliput Lane employs 650 people, has 140 current models and exports to 45 countries. It was founded 11 years ago by Mr David Tate, an artist who worked out how to mould intricate miniature designs for mass production. He is the technical director and will be the third principal beneficiary of the flotation. Mr Russell, an accountant who learned his managerial skills with Burton and Courtaulds, introduced productivity controls into the mass hand-painting of Lilliput's models. He also developed a worldwide collectors' club. This now has 63,000 members, nearly 18,000 of them in the US, where models which have been 'retired' from production sometimes change hands for thousands of dollars.</p>

The  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] patrols on the ground have  discovered another 55 similar sites. Frozen guns and howitzers  are located in many of these sites, and several days will be  needed to haul them away.    According to UNPROFOR representative Colonel Bill Aikman,  another 12 sites with Serbian artillery have still not been  placed under control, although this should have been  accomplished before the expiration of the deadline in the night  from Sunday to Monday. Colonel Aikman said that two incidents  with Karadzic's Serbs had occurred yesterday. The Serbs came to  two sites and demanded that they be allowed to haul away the  heavy artillery. After the UNPROFOR soldiers had refused to  allow them to do so, they withdrew without causing further  problems.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Ministers are urged to act soon on shops legislation PRESSURE mounted on the government from all sides at Westminster yesterday to press ahead with Sunday trading legislation as fast as possible in the light of the EC judgment. MPs across the argument were united in calling on ministers to realise that the decision meant that a bill should be introduced as quickly as possible to end uncertainty. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the government should 'now bring forward its proposals as a matter of urgency'. He repeated his warning to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to honour his promise to allow a free vote on all issues related to Sunday trading. Mr James Couchman, Tory MP for Gillingham, said: 'Sunday shopping has become a normal British weekend activity, and the sooner we have a sensible law which reflects this the better.' He has put forward a backbench bill that reflects the proposals of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, but it has no chance of becoming law. Some Tory MPs privately expressed anger that the government had not moved earlier, saying it had been clear which way the EC judgment would go. 'We should press on with this as a priority even over Maastricht,' one commented. MPs also demanded an urgent government statement to clarify the position after the judgment. Mr Ray Powell, the Labour MP whose backbench bill would strengthen existing Sunday trading restrictions, said there should be a statement by the home secretary or attorney-general explaining whether the Shops Act 1950 still applied after yesterday's ruling. The government should make its position clear before large stores were allowed to trade on the last Sunday before Christmas, he said.</p>

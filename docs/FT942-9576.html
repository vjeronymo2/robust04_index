			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The strange story of Japan's unit trusts - John Cuthbert analyses the reasons for a market phenomenon Something extraordinary has happened in the Japan unit trust sector over the past five years. Since 1989, the sector has - on the face of it - outperformed the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) index regardless of whether the Japanese market rose or fell (see top chart). No fewer than 60 of 62 Japan trusts beat the TSE over the period. How has this happened? There are three reasons. First, Japan funds have done better since 1989 for the simple reason that they did less well previously. Between 1986 and end-1989, Japan unit trust managers avoided the highly-valued fashionable plays - so beloved by the locals - that lifted the TSE to a new high. When the crash hit the Japanese market at the end of 1989, the highly-valued high-flyers that had driven up the TSE pre-crash became the laggards which then dragged it down. Avoiding these types of stocks had led to underperformance for Japan funds in a bull phase. Now, it meant outperformance in a bear market. Over the 30 months the crash lasted, the average Japan fund fell 45.6 per cent against a fall in the TSE of 58.6 per cent. Second, a lot of Japan funds have taken considerable advantage of the high returns from the burgeoning over-the-counter (OTC) market in small capitalisation stocks. Japanese investors usually ignore these. But in a market where the average earnings of large cap stocks have fallen four years in a row, it is surprising that the positive earnings of small cap stocks have moved more to centre stage. The fact that small cap exposure of Japan funds has risen dramatically, and fund returns with it - the average discrete total return of the eight Japan small company trusts with five-year records to February 28 1994 (79.27 per cent) is almost twice that of the 48 growth funds (40.9 per cent) over the same period - says much about why a performance comparison of the Japan sector with the TSE, an essentially large cap index, can be misleading. Third, and most important, is that any reading of the past five years of performance history is dominated by the effects of the 1989-92 crash. . Yet, it is quite clear from our top chart that the past five years have covered two quite different periods of performance - one of sustained loss, the other of sustained gain. Decoupling these provides a very different picture of performance altogether. The bottom chart shows the sector's performance relative to the TSE from the beginning of the period of gain at the end of June 1992. This time round, the sector has underperformed the TSE, rather than the reverse. This finding has two important implications. First, it warns investors to be on their guard. It is all too easy for most established Japan funds to puff up their five-year performance by using a cumulative performance chart relative to the TSE, as we did at the start of this article. Normally, this would be acceptable. But when virtually the whole sector has beaten the TSE - something which is not normal - then it becomes a highly devalued meter of performance assessment. Then again, our reading of Japanese investment history suggests that placing equal emphasis upon loss management, as well as upon total return, is of special importance in judging the performance of Japan unit trusts. Moreover, having two periods of markedly different conditions - one of loss and one of gain - provides us with a robust means of testing if Japan fund managers have all-weather managerial abilities. Look at Table A. Here, we have taken the upper quartile of the sector on a five-year, risk-adjusted return basis and then split it into its individual investment orientations - small cap, growth and technology/special situations - to allow better performance comparisons. Column 1 of this table shows the negative total return, or crash loss. Column 2 shows the percentile rank of each fund's crash loss (1 is the highest and 100 the smallest). Column 3 then shows the percentile rank of each fund's total return - this time, a gain - from the end of the crash period to the end of February, 1994. The final column, percentile change, illustrates the degree to which a manager has been better at managing growth or loss relative to the rest of the sector. The conclusion based on this table is quite different to that derived from a comparison with the TSE. Far from making the whole sector look good, this approach finds only four funds - Dunedin Japan Smaller Companies, Perpetual Japanese Growth, Gartmore Japan and Provident Mutual Japan - which have displayed top-quartile performance in both periods of loss and gain. Furthermore, the overall performances of many funds are dominated by an outstanding outturn in only one field. In simple terms, most managers tend to be better at managing one thing rather than another. Two further funds deserve recognition. Although their total returns in the gain period have been fourth and sixth decile respectively, Schroder Japan Small Companies and Stewart Ivory Japan are among the very best when the returns are risk-adjusted (see table B). This is no surprise; they are two of the top four loss return funds and have displayed high consistency relative to the TSE. Finding the best-performing Japan funds is full of pitfalls. At first look, investors appear spoilt for choice. But wholesale outperformance of the market index is a sign that something is wrong. In any one sector, expect to find only a handful of funds that deserve your attentions.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           TABLE A: HOW FUNDS PERFORM IN BULL AND BEAR MARKETS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Loss                Gain                               Return    Loss     return                             29/12/89    perc*    1/7/92-       Perc                             -30/6/92    rank     28/2/94     change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SMALL CAP FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Schroder Japan Smllr Cos     -22.01      1         44         +43 Dunedin Japan Smllr Cos      -24.30      5         13          +8 NM Japan Smllr Cos           -40.11     26         89         +63 Fidelity Japan Smllr Cos     -38.55     19         32         +12 Invesco Japan Smllr Cos      -45.75     68         19         -49 M&amp;G Japan Smllr Cos          -45.35     50         15         -35 Save&amp;Prosper Jap Smllr Cos   -45.00     50         82         +32 Average                      -37.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GROWTH FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Perpetual Jap Growth         -26.40      5         15         +10 Stewart Ivory Japan          -27.37      6         60         +54 Gartmore Japan               -36.30     16          8          -8 Schroder Tokyo               -39.93     27         11         -16 Prov Mutual Jap Growth       -35.96     15          5         -10 Confederation Japan          -38.82     31         36          +5 James Capel Japan Growth     -37.73     32         34          +2 Allied Dunbar Japan          -45.17     56          3         -53 Thornton Japan               -40.52     27         48         +21 Average                       36.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TECHNOLOGY and SPECIAL SITN FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kleinwort Benson Jap Spec    -43.11     37         31          -6 Hill Samuel Japan Tech       -42.49     34         44         +10 Barclays Uni Jap Spec Sits   -38.76     21         27          +6 Average                       -41.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY: The table compares total return performances for the top quartile of risk-adjusted return funds over two distinct periods - one of sustained gain, and one of sustained loss. The percentile* rank of each fund's loss and gain return are shown in columns three and four respectively from the left. The percentile rank expresses each fund's position in its sector as a proportion of 100 where the top fund is 1 and the bottom is 100. This makes it easier to see quartile (units of 25) and decile (units of 10) positions. The percentile rank of NM Japan Smaller Companies crash loss of 26, for instance, says that it is in the top 26 per cent, namely, just outside the top quartile (25 per cent) or third decile. Changes in percentile rank for the loss and gain returns reflect the relative strength of each manager's loss and growth management performance; that is relative to the sector also.

Total return is the sum of period to period figures, thus removing cumulative effect. Therefore, the sum of the five-year figures does not equal the five-year total. For the one year, it is the sum of 12 months offer-to-offer, net income re-invested; for five years (total), it is 60 month-on-month periods of offer-to-offer, net income re-invested. Source: HSW. The Benchmark column is a measure of a fund's consistency relative to the stated index. Two indices have been chosen to reflect the different investment orientations of funds. A negative figure in this column means underperformance. The figure in bold in the total row is the benchmark ratio - each fund's total return divided by the index's return. Risk is total risk or volatility as measured by the standard deviation of monthly returns. Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided by the standard deviation of the 62 funds (the sector) that qualify for this survey (8.23). Risk description refers to risk relative to the sector figure of 8.23. Risk/return is the division of each fund's average monthly return by the standard deviation of those monthly returns. The higher the risk/return figure, the better the performance.

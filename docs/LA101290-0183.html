			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ASAHI REVISES DEAL FOR BREWERY  </P> <P> Japan's Asahi Breweries, faced with a steep drop in the share price of Elders  IXL, today revised a $787-million deal to buy a major slice of the world's  fourth-largest brewer.  </P> <P> Asahi, Japan's second-largest brewer, still plans to buy 19.9% of Elders, but  it will not buy all the shares from Elders' debt-laden parent, Harlin Holdings.  </P> <P> "Although Asahi still intends to acquire 19.9% of Elders, it plans to acquire  fewer shares from Harlin and to buy the balance on the market in due course,"  Harlin, which owns 56% of Elders, said in a statement.  </P> <P> "The basic structure of the original transaction will be preserved," Harlin  said. "In particular, the transaction will have the effect of stabilizing  Harlin's financial position."  </P> <P> A sharp rally in Elders' share price today to $1 on a large turnover of almost  4 million shares prompted speculation that Asahi may already have been  accumulating in the open market.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Social Democracy Party [PSDB] and the  Liberal Front Party [PFL] will base their alliance on a  government program. Former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes and PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique  Cardoso today met in Rio de Janeiro to discuss the nomination of  the candidate for vice president on the PSDB-PFL ticket. After a  two-hour meeting, the former governor announced that his son,  Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, would not run for vice president  on Cardoso's ticket.    In Brasilia, Deputy Magalhaes confirmed his father's  announcement. Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, who is the PFL leader in  Congress, said he never wanted to be vice president.    [Begin Magalhaes recording] I do not want to run for vice  president. I believe there are other qualified candidates in  our party. Next week, the PFL national and congressional  leaders will be nominating someone else. [end recording]    Former Governor Magalhaes gave details of his meeting with  Cardoso.    [Begin Magalhaes recording] I discussed with him his  political strategy, campaign issues, how to make the campaign  gain momentum more rapidly in Bahia State and the northeastern  region, and I conveyed to him our support for his candidacy.  The first thing I told him is that I support him. After  conveying to him my support, I felt at ease to give him my  thoughts, and he democratically listened to me. He respectfully  discussed these ideas with me, thus confirming the qualities  that would enable him to lead Brazil as president of the nation.  [end recording]    The former governor noted that it was the party's decision  to  have Deputy Magalhaes nominated as vice president. He regretted  the deputy's refusal, but noted that the party must respect Luis  Eduardo's decision, and announced that the PFL will nominate  someone else.</p>

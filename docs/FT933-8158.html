			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report THE GOLD price looked set to mount a test of the upper in of its recent price range as it moved ahead yesterday to close in London at Dollars 373.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5 from Friday. Dealers said the rise was caused by heavy US investment fund buying. SILVER joined in the uptrend, gaining 15.50 to 477.50 cents an ounce, but the PLATINUM market was relatively muted, rising only Dollars 2.75 to Dollars 387.75 an ounce. At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER market appeared to be finding support around the Dollars 1,900 level for three months metal and despite a dip to Dollars 1,898, coinciding with a slight narrowing in cash-to-three-months premium, the price recovered in the afternoon aided by the steady performance of copper futures at the New York Commodity Exchange dollar weakness. The ZINC market was again supported on dips toward Dollars 880 a tonne for the three months position but rallies failed to attract follow-through interest, dealers said. Manufacturer Buying interest boosted London COCOA futures, with the December position closing Pounds 25 up at Pounds 786 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

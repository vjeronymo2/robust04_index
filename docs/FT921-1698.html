			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Kinnock says Labour is 'party of industry' MR NEIL KINNOCK set out Labour's agenda for the start of the second week of election campaigning yesterday with a 'charm offensive' squarely targeted at industry and commerce. In a question and answer session with Labour-supporting business leaders at London's Hilton Hotel, he said a Labour government would 'enable' business but not interfere in it. His business 'brunch' was hosted by Lord Hollick, managing director of MAI, the financial services group, and also addressed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary. It was clearly aimed at portraying Labour as having adopted the best practices of governments of all political colours in the European Community. However, amid a barrage of Tory attacks, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, had to correct comments by Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader. On TV-am Mr Hattersley said an increase in Labour's proposed 50 per cent top rate of income tax could not be ruled out. Mr Smith said the rate would not rise above 50 per cent but failed to stem charges from Conservative frontbenchers that Mr Hattersley had revealed a hidden agenda of new tax rises. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the 'gaffe' had 'confirmed what we suspected all along - that Labour are secretly planning to put up taxes way beyond the levels they have admitted'. Mr Kinnock's central theme - that Labour is now 'the party of industry' - will be further developed at today's launch of the party's manufacturing policy in the West Midlands. Party strategists said they would build on Mr Kinnock's 'prime ministerial' image and Labour's positive agenda, contrasting it with a Tory campaign which, they said, had increasingly become negative attacks. Opinion poll showing 'steady, inexorable movement' in Labour's favour had panicked the Tories into deploying Mrs Margaret Thatcher to give 'backbone' to a lacklustre campaign, Mr Kinnock said. Looking confident and relaxed, he used yesterday's meeting to appeal for business' support. He argued that, of all the EC governments, Britain's was unique in believing 'the function of the state was to withdraw from all responsibility' for business. Labour believed that government 'does have a real role' in aiding the development of the economy and the manufacturing base. Asked by one businessman how nervous voters might be persuaded that Labour would not adopt more radical policies once elected, Mr Kinnock said such a move would be an exercise in suicidal 'throat slitting'. Labour's goal was not merely to achieve office but to stay in office, he said. Labour's business brunch was attended by a 100-strong audience that included Mr Denny Bernstein of Monarch Airlines, Ms Carmen Callil of Chatto and Windus, Mr David Goldstone of Regalian Properties, Mr Paul Loach of Framlington plc, Mr Michael Montague of Williams Holdings, Mr Brian Oakley of Logica Cambridge, Mr Swraj Paul of Caparo Industries and Sir Sidney Sternberg of Martin Slowe Estates. Mr Smith later made clear that a Labour government would not set zero inflation as its target, but would be content with a rate equal to the EC average.</p>

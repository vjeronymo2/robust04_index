			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Alcoa in red after Dollars 104m charge ALUMINUM Company of America (Alcoa), the world's biggest aluminium company, plunged to a loss of Dollars 30.6m, or 37 cents a share, in the second quarter. The decline followed after-tax charges totalling Dollars 104.7m, or Dollars 1.22 a share. The charges also pushed Alcoa's first-half earnings down 74.5 per cent from Dollars 178.2m, or Dollars 2.09 cents, to Dollars 45.4m, or 52 cents. The company maintained it had done reasonably well, considering the turmoil in the industry and low aluminium prices, to be able to report earnings of Dollars 74.1, or 85 cents, before charges in the second quarter. In the same months of 1991, net earnings were Dollars 81.2m, or 95 cents. Although sales in the second quarter fell from Dollars 2.57bn to Dollars 2.41bn, shipments were up from 659,000 tonnes to 706,000 tonnes. In the first half, sales slipped from Dollars 4.98bn to Dollars 4.66bn while shipments totalled 1.37m tonnes, against 1.34bn in 1991. Although aluminium prices were substantially lower in the quarter, the impact was mostly offset by a fall in costs, a favourable tax rate, and reductions in finance costs. The second-quarter charges included Dollars 44.9m (Dollars 65.9m before tax), or 52 cents, for redundancy payments. Alcoa said recently it would reduce its world-wide workforce of 65,000 by 2,100 this year. There is also an extraordinary charge of Dollars 50.2m, or 59 cents, for the previously-announced redemption of high-cost debt to reduce financing costs, and a charge of Dollars 9.6m, or 11 cents, paid to US hourly employees to extend labour contracts by one year. This is the second time in six months Alcoa has been hit by substantial charges. In the fourth quarter of 1991 it suffered charges of Dollars 217m relating to the cost of environmental clean-ups and restructuring.</p>

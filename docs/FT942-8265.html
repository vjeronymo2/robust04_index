			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Chorus of dissent in HK Mr Anthony Cheung, a founder member of Hong Kong's new coalition Democratic Party, has been stripped of his post as a Hong Kong affairs adviser to Beijing just one week before he was due to be formally appointed, Louise Lucas writes from Hong Kong. China's move has been broadly criticised, even by pro-Chinese figures. The implication is that those with dissenting views will not be seen as suitable advisers and Beijing will listen merely to sycophantic voices. The newly created Democratic Party brought under one roof Mr Cheung's own party, Meeting Point, and the United Democrats, the pro-democracy group led by Mr Martin Lee which is considered subversive by the Chinese.</p>

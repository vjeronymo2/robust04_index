			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: 'Guaranteed' products GUARANTEED products offer investors variations on the slogan 'stock market growth or your money back'. A new round has been launched this month. National &amp; Provincial Building Society is offering a Guaranteed Equity Reserve account, which promises the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index in the form of 'interest' which can be received at the end of a five year period. There is a slight twist on the normal formula, in that the final Footsie figure will be based on the average level of the index over the final six months of the product's life (September 1, 1997 to February 28, 1998). As a minimum, investors will receive their money back on maturity in March 1998. Like most other products in this area, this account does not pay any income, nor does it reflect the income on the Footsie (which at 4-5 per cent a year is a significant component of equity returns). Basic rate tax is deducted at source and the result is that such taxpayers will receive 100 per cent of the rise in the Footsie over the period (starting March 1). However, a bonus for those who invest before January 20, pushes the rate up to 103.7 per cent; those who invest between January 21 and February 15 will get 101.5 per cent. Higher rate taxpayers would face a further bill, bringing the return down to around 80 per cent of the Footsie's rise (or 83 per cent with the full bonus). Unless they use up their Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance, higher rate payers would almost certainly do better to invest in a indexed fund, where the return would mostly come in the form of capital gain. However, unlike some insurance-based guaranteed products, N &amp; P says that non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax on this account. This would convert the return into 133.33 per cent of the Footsie's rise (or 138.33 per cent with the full bonus). If you want to withdraw your money, you cannot do so during the first year. After that, there is a 'penalty' of 5 per cent and no interest will be credited. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and the maximum Pounds 250,000. Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial adviser group, is offering a product which combines a fixed interest bond with the capital shares of split capital investment trusts. The fixed interest portion (in a guaranteed growth bond from Consolidated Life) will grow so that the total capital will rise by at least 20 per cent over five years (net of basic rate tax). The capital shares then give the investor a 'geared' interest in the stock market. If the trust's assets rise by 7 per cent per annum, then the total return would rise to 40 per cent. Returns rise substantially as the investment assumptions get more optimistic. There is an element of flexibility in the product since the investors can take profits on the capital shares if they rise substantially over the five year period. The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000. Meanwhile, Sun Alliance is launching a third issue of its Capital Protector Bond. This offers a four year guarantee, but only 90 per cent of the fund is linked to stock market growth. Charges are 4.5 per cent initial and 1.25 per cent annual; there are surrender penalties during the first four years. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000.</p>

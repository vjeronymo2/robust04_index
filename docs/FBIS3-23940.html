			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal from Azerbaijan People's Front: "APF Calls On </F> Government To Refrain From Strengthening The Fragmentation  Within The Nation "]    [Text] The Azerbaijan People's Front [APF] has issued a  statement in connection with the strengthening of the campaign  by ruling circles against the APF and other opposition forces.  The text of the statement is below:    "Recently, attacks against the APF and opposition forces in  state information organs and statements of representatives of  the ruling circle have become even stronger. The accusation is  being spread that the political opposition is disturbed by  successes gained by Azerbaijan's army on the front and about  barriers standing before the successful course of military  operations. [passage illegible]    "Even during the empire the APF, which was the first  organization to rise to the struggle for Azerbaijan's  independence and its territorial integrity, and which gave  thousands from its ranks as martyrs in the struggle for  Karabakh, emphatically rejects these accusations. At a time when  a great portion of our soil is still under enemy control these  accusations are the manifestation of a devious and malicious  policy to create dissension in the ranks of the opposition  within the nation and efforts to deal a new blow to our national  unity under a situation when our territorial integrity is being  violated.    "There have been times of great success and times of crisis  in the history of the APF. But always and at all times  patriotism, the Fatherland and the interests of the people have  been and are our most important principles. The relationship of  the APF to the present foreign and domestic policies advanced by  the ruling circles is well known. At the same time, from the  time of the further strengthening of attacks by the  occupier-Armenians and the broadening of military operations on  the front as a consequence of this, the APF has supported all  measures for the sake of maintaining stability within the  country. [passage illegible]...Despite the cessation of the  publication of some channels of information, no sharp articles  have been permitted.    [Passage illegible]..."although it remains questionable as  to  what these great military successes consist of, the organization  is using all its possibilities and influence to verify these  victories, and has directed the efforts of its members in this  way.    "But at the same time, we also see efforts to blame every  possible failure and all sins on the opposition, primarily the  APF, and to direct public opinion along this line. At this  responsible moment, the Azerbaijan People's Front appeals to the  ruling circles of the republic to refrain from the dangerous  path of strengthening the fragmentation within the nation during  the fourth anniversary of 20 January which was a serious tragedy  for our people and to call on the population not to listen to  provocations."</p>

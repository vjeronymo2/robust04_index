			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Mauritania's ruler wins poll MAURITANIA'S military leader Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya yesterday won the country's first open presidential elections, but his main rival and diplomats said there was cheating, Reuter reports from Nouakchott. With only one minor result to come, Interior Ministry figures gave Col Taya 62.8 per cent of the vote - nearly twice as much as the 32.9 per cent polled by Ahmed Ould Daddah, the main opposition candidate and a former political exile. But the opposition said it had proof of electoral fraud.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cometa-SRM takes lead in Spanish telecoms race Cometa-SRM, a consortium led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Vodafone, the UK telecommunications operator, has taken the lead in the battle to obtain a mobile telephony licence in Spain with a cash bid of Pta89bn (Dollars 689.9m). The consortium entered a higher bid than its rival Airtel-ASR, which has the US telecoms company AirTouch as its main foreign partner. Airtel-ASR bid Pta85bn. The offers were well above the minimum Pta50bn established by the tender's rules, and sufficiently close to keep the result of the contest open. The winner will be announced before the year-end. Under the rules of the tender, the competing consortia are also required to make undertakings covering industrial investment, job creation and research and development. The prize is a GSM (global system of mobile communications) licence to be the second operator in the Spanish mobile telephony market, forecast to have turnover of Pta210bn and 2m subscribers by 1998. The other GSM licence has been reserved for Telefonica, the government-controlled group which now faces the first significant incursion into its domestic telecommunications monopoly. BBV, a big Spanish retail bank, has a 30 per cent shareholding in Cometa-SRM and Vodafone, 23 per cent. Both companies sharply increased their initial stakes. DeTeMobil, a unit of Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, has 10 per cent of Cometa-SRM's equity. Smaller shareholdings in the consortium are held by the domestic utilities Endesa, Sevillana and Iberdrola, and by La Caixa, the Catalan savings bank. AirTouch has 16 per cent of the rival Airtel-ASR group, and British Telecommunications, the second technological backer in the consortium, has 7 per cent stake. The main financial partners are the domestic banks Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano, which share 27 per cent of the consortium's equity, and five regional savings banks which jointly own a 16.7 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Israeli anxiety at rising casualties SEVEN Palestinians were shot dead and more than 70 wounded in the Israeli occupied territories at the weekend, the latest convulsion in a spate of violence that has undermined efforts to regenerate Middle East peace talks. Left-wing ministers in the Labour-led coalition yesterday expressed concern over a sharp rise in casualties in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six people were shot dead by troops in Gaza on Friday and Saturday, three when a carload of armed men was intercepted and three in protests that followed. One Palestinian was killed in Jerusalem last night. They brought to 79 the number of Palestinians killed since the beginning of October last year and 38 since the expulsion of more than 400 alleged Islamic militants in mid-December. The figures include 10 children under 15. Palestinian leaders have refused to accept a US-brokered compromise allowing 101 of the deportees to return as sufficient for resumption of peace talks.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered As talk of a rights issue from Standard Chartered always sounded a little wild, its failure to materialise hardly provides an explantation for yesterday's sharp share price rise. More plausible is the sense of relief that another set of results figures had passed without further trouble. Certainly the unexpected increase in provisions against well-known UK problem loans was unwelcome, but investors were at least spared the emergence of wholly new difficulties. The management's aim must be to continue the encouraging profits' trend over the next 18 months, rebuilding its tier one capital ratio above 6 per cent and its credibility with institutions into the bargain. That would probably earn a credit re-rating and open the possibility of an issue of dollar-denominated preference shares to bolster its sterling capital base against shocks from the predominantly dollar asset base. If such a strategy looks sensible, the difficulty is that circumstances are partly outside Standard's control. Boom conditions in the Asia Pacific region may boil over in the next year or so, yet the bank's general provision looks modest when set against its Pounds 22bn of assets in the area. To be sure, the bank has recently shown restraint in Hong Kong in an effort to boost profits. If Standard is fortunate and Asia holds up, then there is room for some further improvement in its relative rating. Yet the risk of disappointment remains - the new management says that it intends to generate consistent earnings, but this is an inherently cyclical business.</p>

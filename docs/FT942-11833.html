			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Heseltine denies big spending ambitions Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, sought yesterday to dampen speculation about his forthcoming white paper on competitiveness by insisting that it would not propose big increases in government spending. Mr Heseltine said the paper, to be published on May 16, would not contain 'gimmicks or short-term expedients' and would be consistent with the evolutionary nature of the government's policies. He said: 'The first priority of government in the promotion of UK competitiveness is the proper management of the economy. Suggestions therefore that we are about to indulge in an orgy of expenditure are not only inaccurate but, much more to the point, would positively undermine our own overriding priority. 'The white paper will not be the vehicle for announcing a range of lavish new expenditure programmes. The government remains firmly committed to the public expenditure ceilings announced by the chancellor in the Budget.' Mr Heseltine said in a speech to the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange that the white paper had three main objectives: To set out how the totality of the government's policies affected wealth-creating businesses. Assess the UK's competitive strengths and weaknesses. Indicate 'how many of us in our own way are involved in the process of helping our country to win'. He also hinted that his proposals would contain a fresh broadside against excessive regulation from Brussels, which he described as part of the competitive challenge facing Britain. 'In Europe, we have hardly begun to tackle the bureaucratic and restrictive nature of the procedures that are characteristic of Community regulation,' he said. He defended the government's record against criticisms in last week's report on manufacturing competitiveness by the Commons trade and industry committee. He said the report found much to applaud in the government's policies towards industry.</p>

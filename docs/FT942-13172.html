			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Pibs rise sharply on C&amp;G bid news The market in permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs) issued by UK building societies has rallied strongly on the news that Lloyds Bank is to take over the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. The largest price rise is in the C&amp;G's Pounds 100m issue of 11 3/4 per cent Pibs, which has rallied by six points since Thursday, to 122. The yield spread over the UK gilt due 2017 has shrunk from about 230 to 180 basis points, as a result. However, other Pibs issues have also rallied, though less dramatically. For example, the spread on the Halifax Pibs has tightened by about five basis points to 160 basis points since Thursday, and the spread on the Leeds Pibs has narrowed sharply from 225 basis points to 210 basis points. Dealers said the market had already been improving prior to the Lloyds announcement, as wider spreads and higher yields had attracted fresh buying after a sell-off at the start of the year. Dealers say there are several reasons for the sharp rise in the C&amp;G Pibs price. First of all, holders of the paper are rewarded in the same way as other investing members and will therefore be entitled to receive a cash payment of Pounds 500 and 10 per cent of the value of their holdings, up to a maximum of Pounds 10,000. This means that investors are more likely to keep hold of the paper, even though it is rallying strongly, creating a shortage of paper. Second, the status of the Pibs will rise when the takeover goes through. Currently, Pibs, which never mature and were issued to provide capital for building societies, are the equivalent of equity and would therefore, theoretically, count as Tier 1 capital under bank capital rules. However, under the terms of the Lloyds deal, the Pibs will become subordinated debt securities and count as upper tier 2 capital. The deals which have rallied most strongly are those issued by building societies deemed likely to be takeover targets, or likely to convert to bank status, bringing about a similar change in the status of their Pibs.</p>

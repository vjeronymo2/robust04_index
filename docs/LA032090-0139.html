			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES' ALL-COUNTY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM;  </P> <P> GUARDS TAKE OVER THIS SEASON  </P> <P> It was the year of the guard in Orange County high school girls' basketball  this season.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda point guard Aimee McDaniel set school scoring and assist records;  Edison's Debbie Fischer set a national record for three-point shots made; and  La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia, who plays guard -- and forward and center -- set a  county record for most points scored in one game.  </P> <P> McDaniel, Fischer and Jalewalia are among 10 girls named to the 1990 Times'  All-Orange County girls' high school basketball team. Also named to the team  were: Tammy Blackburn, a senior at Brea-Olinda; Sara Bone, a senior at El Toro;  Jennifer Harney, a senior at Esperanza; Jennifer Rohrig, a senior at Mission  Viejo; Melisa Sortino, a senior at Marina; Jennifer Sullivan, a senior at Ocean  View, and Karie Yoshioka, a senior at El Toro.  </P> <P> McDaniel, who set school career records for points (1,845) and assists (602) at  Brea-Olinda, teamed with Blackburn to form one of the best guard tandems in the  state. They led the Lady Cats to a Southern Section title and second-place in  the state.  </P> <P> Both were were Times' all-county selections in their junior seasons and led  Brea-Olinda to a Southern Section record for consecutive victories (55).  </P> <P> Jalewalia, who led the county and the state in scoring last season, led La  Quinta to the Southern Section 4-A title, averaging 33 points a game. In four  years, she scored 2,205 points, 71 shy of the county record set by Paula Tezak  at La Habra (1980-84). Jalewalia, who will attend UCLA, set a county  single-game scoring record (60 points).  </P> <P> Fischer set county, section, state and national records with her three-point  shooting. She set a national record for three-pointers with 105 this season.  The old reported record was 85. She also set a reported Southern Section record  for most three-point baskets in a game (10). She averaged 21.8 points, 4.5  assists and had 115 career three-pointers.  </P> <P> Yoshioka, also a guard, led the the county in assists with 8.4 a game. She made  close to 50% from three-point range, and averaged 16.5 points. She was the  South Coast League MVP.  </P> <P> Bone, a center, led El Toro in scoring (18.1 points) and rebounding (10.4).  Harney was one of the county's most versatile big guards this season, averaging  16.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists to lead her team to the Empire League  title.  </P> <P> Rohrig, a two-time selection, led the county in rebounding with a 20.1 average.  She also averaged 21.2 points. Sortino helped Marina to a second-place finish  in the Sunset League, averaging 20.4 points and 5.1 assists. Sullivan led Ocean  View in scoring (17.3) and rebounding (14.7).  </P> <P> Those earning honorable mention were: Jenny Newsome, a senior guard for Rancho  Alamitos; Denise Gandara, a senior forward for University High; Tracy Titus, a  junior center for Loara; Jinelle Williams, a junior center for Brea-Olinda;  Leslie Rathbun, a senior guard for Woodbridge, and Olivia DiCamilli, a freshman  guard for Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> GUARD  </P> <P> Tammy Blackburn  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda * 5-8 * Senior  </P> <P> The emotional leader of the Lady Cats, Blackburn overcame major back and  shoulder surgery in 1987 to emerge as the team's best defender and open court  player. A two-time all-county selection and an all-state guard, she averaged  13.6 points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 steals. She will play for San Diego State in  the fall.  </P> <P> CENTER  </P> <P> Sara Bone  </P> <P> El Toro * 5-11 * Senior  </P> <P> Bone brought the moves, agility and quickness of a forward -- her natural  position -- to the post for El Toro, which needed a center. Her versatility  enabled her to power up inside or shoot from three-point range. She led El Toro  in scoring (18.1 points) and rebounding (10.4). Bone, an honor student, will  play at Dartmouth in the fall.  </P> <P> GUARD  </P> <P> Debbie Fischer  </P> <P> Edison * 5-6 * Senior  </P> <P> Fischer set a national record for three-pointers with 105 this season. The old  reported record was 85. She also set a reported Southern Section record for  most three-point baskets in a game (10). Fischer, MVP of the Marina tournament,  led Edison (17-9) to the 4-AA quarterfinals. She averaged 21.8 points, 4.5  assists and had 115 career three-pointers.  </P> <P> GUARD  </P> <P> Jennifer Harney  </P> <P> Esperanza * 5-9 * Senior  </P> <P> Harney was the county's most versatile big guard this season. "She can play  point guard or center on offense and she can guard a perimeter or post player  on defense," Coach Marc Hill said. Harney averaged 16.6 points, 5.8 rebounds  and 3.7 assists to lead her team to the Empire League title.  </P> <P> FORWARD  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia  </P> <P> La Quinta * 6-1 * Senior  </P> <P> Jalewalia led state in scoring (31.2 points) last season and was second this  year (33.0). In four years she scored 2,205 points, 71 shy of the county record  set by Paula Tezak at La Habra (1980-84). Jalewalia, who will attend UCLA, set  county single-game scoring record (60 points) and led La Quinta to 4-A title.  </P> <P> GUARD  </P> <P> Aimee McDaniel  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda * 5-6 * Senior  </P> <P> McDaniel led Brea-Olinda to two Southern Section titles, the state Division III  championship last season, another appearance in the state final this year and a  national ranking (fourth). She led Brea-Olinda in scoring (16.4 points) and  assists (6.4) and is a three-time all-county selection.  </P> <P> CENTER  </P> <P> Jennifer Rohrig  </P> <P> Mission Viejo * 6-3 * Senior  </P> <P> Rohrig, a two-time selection, led the county in rebounding with a 20.1 average  and averaged 21.2 points. Her mobility made her a formidable shot blocker (5.8  average) and a force on the offensive boards. Rohrig, all-league in volleyball,  plans to attend Duke on a volleyball scholarship in the fall.  </P> <P> GUARD  </P> <P> Melisa Sortino  </P> <P> Marina * 5-7 * Senior  </P> <P> Sortino's leadership and scoring helped Marina to a second-place finish in the  Sunset League. Sortino, a prolific three-point shooter -- she made 64 -- led  Marina in scoring (20.4 points) and assists (5.1). Sortino, the co-MVP of the  Sunset League with Ocean View's Jenny Sullivan, will attend the University of  San Diego.  </P> <P> CENTER  </P> <P> Jennifer Sullivan  </P> <P> Ocean View * 6-3 * Senior  </P> <P> Sullivan, the Sunset League MVP the last two seasons, led Ocean View in scoring  (17.3) and rebounding (14.7). At 6-3, 180 pounds, she did it all, from scoring  to rebounding to shot blocking. She has narrowed her college choices to Loyola  Marymount, Cal State Dominguez Hills and Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> GUARD  </P> <P> Karie Yoshioka  </P> <P> El Toro * 5-4 * Senior  </P> <P> Injuries slowed Yoshioka as a junior. But the point guard was healthy this  season, excelling at the transition game and three-point shooting. She hit  close to 50% from three-point range, led the county in assists (8.4) and  averaged 16.5 points. She led her team to the South Coast League title and was  league MVP.  </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY ROSTER  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.55IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:2.88IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bank seeks to avert bail-out with SKr3bn cash call plan FORENINGSBANKEN, the Swedish co-operative bank, has announced plans to raise nearly SKr3bn (Dollars 373m) in new equity in a bid to remain privately-owned. The move will be supported by a SKr2.5bn government guarantee to ensure the bank continues to meet international capital adequacy requirements. The guarantee can be used if the bank's credit losses prove larger than expected over the next three years. However, if fully utilised, they would leave the state as the bank's majority owner. Foreningsbanken says it will issue shares to members and institutions and convert perpetual debenture loans to equity to raise its capital adequacy ratio above 9 per cent. A consortium centred on the LRF, the Swedish farmers co-operative, will guarantee SKr2.5bn of the issue, while institutions will be offered shares worth SKr400m. The bank will also seek a listing on the Swedish stock exchange. Valmet, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, saw losses after financial items shrink to FM44m (Dollars 7.6m) in the first eight months from FM213m in the same 1992 period. The group attributed the improvement to streamlining and the weaker Finnish markka. Sales rose 40 per cent to FM7.07bn from FM5.03bn and new orders were FM1bn higher at FM7.3bn. Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, has raised FM1.3bn from the sale of 15m shares in Repola, the country's biggest industrial group, to international investors. It retains a stake of 16.6m Repola shares, equal to 11.1 per cent of its capital. The disposal will give Metsa-Serla a FM290m capital gain, reduce its net gearing to 89 per cent, and increase its equity-to-assets ratio to nearly 40 per cent.</p>

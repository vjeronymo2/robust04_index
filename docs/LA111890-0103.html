			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETE WILSON IN SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> I was pleased with the election results. The Democrats wanted badly to win the  governorship and defeat Proposition 140. They lost and I'm glad.  </P> <P> I have been disaffected with my party for some time.  </P> <P> I was outraged by the gerrymander it rammed through the Legislature in 1982. I  thought it was an insult to all voters, especially to people like myself who  are lifelong Democrats. I expect my party to compete with attractive candidates  and programs. Winning this way does not impress me.  </P> <P> It annoys me that after each election cycle, my party chooses the same leaders,  (Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown and (Senate President Pro Tem) David Roberti.  They, in turn, appoint the same committee chairmen. I would like to see some  fresh faces.  </P> <P> Last but not least, I am disgusted with my party's approach to politics. It is  totally Republican. Raise big money and run for public office. With two parties  like this, what hope is there for representative government?  </P> <P> ERIC STEEL  </P> <P> Oakland  </P></p>

It emerged earlier this week that bank creditors have asked for 60 per cent of their loans to be converted into fixed-rate 'par bonds', with only 18 per cent in the form of floating-rate 'discount bonds'. Brazil has indicated that it wants each class of bond to comprise around 40 per cent of the final deal, with other types of debt making up the rest. The banks' preference for par bonds puts Brazil in the same position as Argentina last year, which also had to persuade banks to accept fewer fixed-rate bonds than they had requested. After tense negotiations, the Argentine Brady-style debt reduction deal was finally completed on April 7. The preference for par bonds has been prompted by the continuing rise in the US Treasuries market. The 30-year bonds, which are repaid over an extended period, carry a fixed coupon of 4 per cent in the first year, rising to 6 per cent after the sixth year, with the principal fully collateralised by US zero-coupon bonds. Discount bonds, by comparison, pay a floating rate, and carry a 35 per cent reduction from face value. The discount, and the better collateral on the par bonds, explains the banks' choice so far, according to one banker in London. Analysts of the secondary market for lesser developed country debt said that banks would have to accept a higher proportion of discount bond for the deal to go ahead. Mr Arthur Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, said: 'We and the banking committee have submitted what we would like to do, but an agreement has to be based on what is possible to do.'</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE DEPT. SEEKS TO BLUNT ATTACKS ON IRAQ  </P> <P> Despite the seizure of nuclear weapons triggers from a plane bound for Baghdad,  the State Department is trying to minimize damage to the U.S.-Iraq relationship  by toning down official government criticism of President Saddam Hussein's  regime.  </P> <P> A Pentagon official said Friday that the State Department -- alone among U.S.  agencies -- opposed the elaborate sting that resulted in the arrest of four  Iraqis and the export manager of a London company on charges of trying to  smuggle 40 of the devices to Iraq.  </P> <P> The official said State Department representatives wanted to work quietly to  discourage Iraq from trying to produce nuclear weapons without creating a  public furor by allowing the Iraqi representatives to buy the devices and then  arresting them.  </P> <P> Moreover, the State Department recently pressured the Voice of America to tone  down a broadcast editorial accusing Hussein of using police-state methods to  defend his regime.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the U.S. Information Agency, the VOA's parent organization,  said that John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South  Asian affairs, complained about the editorial during a State Department staff  meeting. The spokesman said the USIA representative at the meeting promised to  look into the matter.  </P> <P> "We decided we were not happy with the editorial," the spokesman said. He said  that the order to avoid similar editorials in the future was made by the USIA,  a branch of the State Department.  </P> <P> A State Department official confirmed that Hussein was "upset with something  said in a VOA editorial." He said the matter was handled by the U.S. ambassador  in Baghdad.  </P> <P> The official said the first rule of diplomacy is to avoid needless friction and  that Iraq is being treated no differently than any other country.  </P> <P> "It is not the State Department way to do our finger-pointing in public, except  for countries like Libya and Iran that have track records of targeting American  interests abroad," the official said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, other U.S. agencies seem less reticent about criticizing Iraq.  </P> <P> For instance, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cited Iraq's nuclear program Friday  as a reason to continue the "Star Wars" missile defense plan despite warming  U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> "Just this week, we witnessed Iraq . . . trying to smuggle 40 detonation  devices that would be used in a nuclear weapon," Cheney said in a speech to the  Assn. of American Publishers.  </P> <P> "While certainly today Iraq does not represent a threat directly to the United  States, down the road there's every reason to expect any number of nations to  have that (nuclear) capability," he said.  </P> <P> Therefore, he reasoned, the United States needs a missile defense system for  protection against renegade nuclear powers, even if the danger of an attack by  the Soviet Union is greatly reduced.  </P> <P> U.S. relations with Iraq improved sharply during Baghdad's war with Iran. The  U.S. government tilted toward Iraq in that conflict, primarily because American  policy-makers believed that an Iranian victory would destabilize the entire  Middle East.  </P> <P> The U.S. government kept a tight lid on criticism of Iraq during the war to  avoid damaging Baghdad's military effort.  </P></p>

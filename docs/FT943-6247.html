			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Rowland under threat over Pounds 5.5m costs claim Mr Tiny Rowland will this week be fighting to survive as joint chief executive of Lonrho - the international trading company he has run for 33 years - after the disclosure that he costs the company more than Pounds 5.5m a year in salary, expenses and other charges under his direct control. They include a contribution of about Pounds 500,000 to the costs of his Belgravia home and a mansion at Hedsor Wharf, near Cliveden in Buckinghamshire; more than Pounds 1m in business expenses; and Pounds 200,000 to pay for the education of dependants of African politicians and business contacts. Directors said yesterday that they were so shocked at the magnitude of what Mr Rowland cost the company that they may vote to strip him of his executive duties at a board meeting tomorrow. For the past year, Mr Rowland has been at loggerheads with Mr Dieter Bock, his fellow chief executive, who acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho at the beginning of 1993. He believes Mr Rowland has been frustrating his attempts to reorganise Lonrho's assets. At the board meeting, Mr Rowland will also face criticism about his sale for Pounds 200,000 of a film financed by Lonrho about the Lockerbie bombing to an Egyptian company, the Joint Arab International Investment Company (Jaico), connected to the Libyan Arab Finance Company (Lafico). Directors are concerned that the sale may have breached United Nations restrictions on the sale of investments to Libya. Documentary evidence of a connection between Jaico and Lafico is that Mr Mohamed El Huwej, the chairman of Lafico, signed the sale contract on behalf of Jaico. Under UN sanctions, companies are required to seek permission from the Bank of England before 'parting with . . . investments to . . . a Libyan person'. It is understood that the Bank's permission was not sought in this case. Last night, one Lonrho director described the cost of Mr Rowland to the company as 'outrageous'. According to a Financial Times analysis, the Pounds 5.5m costs include: Mr Rowland's salary of more than Pounds 1.2m; Lonrho's Gulfstream private jet, used almost exclusively by Mr Rowland: about Pounds 2m a year; More than Pounds 300,000 for staff working directly for Mr Rowland. A 51 per cent majority of the 13 Lonrho board members would be required to strip Mr Rowland of his executive status. To remove the 76-year-old Mr Rowland from the board altogether, a 75 per cent majority would be required. It is believed that Mr Rowland can count on the support of only two directors, Mr Rene Leclezio, who retires at the end of October, and Mr Robert Dunlop, who retires at the end of September. More than 20 years ago, Mr Rowland survived a similar attempt to oust him by the so-called Straight-Eight directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice. Mr Bock has been trying to persuade mainstream investment institutions to buy Lonrho shares to gradually replace small investors who until recently have for decades been loyal to Mr Rowland.

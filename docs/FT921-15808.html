			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe hopes to boost equity options trading THE BOARD of the London International Financial Futures Exchange met yesterday to discuss the future of equity options trading after the exchange's merger with the London Traded Options market next March. Liffe appears to have succeeded in persuading more firms to act as market-makers in equity options, needed to boost liquidity in the languishing market. After the meeting, a Liffe official said that 'subject to confirmation from market-makers, there will be adequate market-making capacity to proceed with the provisional allocation of 'D' shares'. In November, about 300 firms applied for 'D' shares which will entitle holders to trade equity and equity index options on the new exchange. The merger was due to take place later this month, but was postponed because of technical problems.</p>

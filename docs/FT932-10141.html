			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Brazilians eager to finalise debt deal BRAZIL begins a new round of talks with its creditor banks today with both sides apparently anxious to finalise a deal restructuring the country's Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.5bn) commercial debt, despite its failure to secure an IMF accord. The eagerness to move ahead with the deal regardless has been partly prompted by Brazil's lack of progress with the IMF; Mr Eliseu Resende, finance minister, was sent away empty-handed from negotiations two weeks ago. IMF officials voiced concern at Brazil's frequent changes of finance minister and the new economic plan, which focuses on growth rather than combating inflation, running at nearly 30 per cent a month. Brazil had been hoping for the IMF accord in order to obtain funds from multilateral institutions to cover half the Dollars 3.2bn needed as guarantees for new bonds to be issued under the debt agreement worked out last July. However, in recent weeks the Brazilians have been sending strong signals that they are willing to put up all the money for guarantees from their reserves, now at a historic high of Dollars 23bn. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, was in Washington yesterday to meet Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, to request American support for the deal's conclusion.</p>

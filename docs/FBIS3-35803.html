Yesterday he left Slovenia after  having been asked by the Foreign Ministry in Ljubljana to leave  the country as quickly as possible. Hinting to the former  Yugoslav republics, he said that every people could not have a  state of its own. He now intends to travel to Serbia. The  following interview with Zhirinovskiy was conducted by Rolf  Gauffin for the Italian geo-political LIMES magazine. The  former French diplomat, who retired in 1991, now works as a  free-lance journalist.    [Gauffin] How important is geography for you?    [Zhirinovskiy] From my early childhood on, history and  geography have been very important for me. In the final years  of my education, I took a particular interest in historical  geography. I was born in deepest Asia, near the Chinese border.  I did my military service in the Caucasus, and then I moved to  Moscow.    [Gauffin] How could Gorbachev hope to liberalize the Soviet  Union without taking territorial and national questions into  account?    [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev's political concept resulted in the  disintegration of the state and the collapse of the economy. He  would have had to implement the reforms differently. He would  have had to use the existing power structures of the Communist  Party, particularly that of the KGB, and advance the  democratization of the economy via these very structures, and,  in a second stage, the democratization of politics.    [Gauffin] Why did the Moscow state coup of August 1992 fail?    [Zhirinovskiy] It was not a state coup in the real sense.  It was a fight of two or three groups from the inner circle of  power. This also explains why the state coup was neither planned  nor carried out like a military operation. This is why it  failed.    [Gauffin] In your book (entitled: "The Last Thrust South?")  you describe a new security system rather than a Russian empire.  This system comprehends the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and  Central Asia. What option do you prefer? A military presence  without occupation? Would Russia then not risk a repetition of  what is happening in Afghanistan?    [Zhirinovskiy] No, one cannot put it that way. The events  in the Caucasus show that without Russia civil war will break  out there: Armenia against Azerbaijan, Georgia against Abkhazia  and Ossetia. The same will repeat along Russia's southern  border. Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs -- they will all fight against  each other. There will not be any Russian troops in those  regions. The only thing we can do is sell arms. If these  people want to buy arms then only Russia can do it. We do not  want a new Afghanistan. Still, what can we witness there now?  No government, no president, cities fighting against cities.  That is the future of Afghanistan: The cities will be  destroyed, traffic will collapse, hospitals will cease to  function, and communication links will collapse. The entire  region will go down. Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan will  intervene, there will be an inferno as in Lebanon or in Northern  Ireland, and then after 20-30 years, they will come back, tears  in their eyes, and beseech Russia to solve the situation --  mainly at a psychological level. Moscow can make sure that the  military operations will stop. The awareness of the strength of  the Russian industry and the power of the Russian Army will stop  all that. These regions and the international community will ask  us, and we will -- with certainty -- stop the disaster, but only  on condition that they pay for it.    [Gauffin] How far would you go in protecting the Russian  minorities in the former Soviet republics, such as in Estonia?    [Zhirinovskiy] First of all, all Russians living outside  Russia should be granted Russian citizenship. We will protect  the Russian minorities mainly through economic measures. If,  for example, the Russians are forced to leave the Baltic states,  thus losing their property, we will add this loss to the price  of goods that we sell there. With this money we will then be  able to pay compensation to the expelled Russians. Take  Estonia, for example: We will impose economic sanctions unless  Russians are granted the right to vote. Considering Russia's  energy resources and its infrastructure, Estonia will completely  disappear as a state. That is the reason why we will never use  military means. We will apply the law and our economy to defend  Russia's interests.    [Gauffin] In an interview with the German NATIONAL-ZEITUNG  you said that the Oder-Neisse line is not yet the last word in  history. Can you define the borders of a future Poland that are  legitimate in your opinion?    [Zhirinovskiy] Estonia should become part of Russia, because  a large number of Russians lives there. Yet, Tallinn should  remain a city state. Latvia should also be part of Russia,  while Lithuania will become a small, independent state, an  enclave. The area around Kaliningrad also belongs to Russia,  and Poland? Well, Prussia was a German state including Wroclaw  and Szczecin, and all these territories should go to Germany  again. Poland can have the area around Lwow in compensation for  its territorial losses. Belarus would like to be integrated  into Russia. All of eastern Ukraine belongs to Russia and so  does Moldova.    [Gauffin] What about Slovakia?    [Zhirinovskiy] One day Slovakia will also belong to Russia  -- and the Czech Republic to Germany. Austria and Slovenia  should belong together, and Germany, Austria, and Slovenia  should have access to the Adriatic. This is what the German  people want. Thus, the Germans would have historical borders in  the east and south.    [Gauffin] What does the future of Kaliningrad look like?    [Zhirinovskiy] One day we can give Kaliningrad back to the  Germans. We want to return everything to the West it would like  to have.    [Gauffin] As it used to be?    [Zhirinovskiy] Exactly as it used to be.    [Gauffin] What about Hungary?    [Zhirinovskiy] The Hungarians would also like to protect  their population in Romania, this artificial state. Romania did  not exist before World War I. This is why the Dobrudja belongs  to Bulgaria. The remainder will stay with Romania. The  population there comes from Italy.    [Gauffin] And what will happen with Yugoslavia?    [Zhirinovskiy] All foreign troops must leave the country.  The Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians should keep the borders that  exist now. The UN Forces should withdraw so that the warring  parties can settle the conflict among themselves.    [Gauffin] What about Bulgaria?    [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria should get back its historical  borders. The Dobrudja also belongs to Bulgaria. And the Greeks  should return Thrace to Bulgaria. But, actually, these are none  of our problems.    Our problems lie in the south. Kazakhstan was never an  independent state, and it belongs to Russia. As far as Japan,  Mongolia, China, and India are concerned, we do not have any  territorial problems.    [Gauffin] Let us take a look at the Caucasus now.    [Zhirinovskiy] Trans-Caucasus. There we have Georgia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia. One day, they will ask to be permitted  to belong to Moscow again.    Yet, we do not want these territories. There are only  criminals there, no reasonable economy, and no opportunities for  profit for Russia. Iran can take over Azerbaijan, while Armenia  and Georgia will go to Turkey. These countries have never been  independent.    [Gauffin] What about Finland and the region there?    [Zhirinovskiy] No problem. Yet, Finland would like to have  Karelia back. All I can say on this issue is that if Finland  wants to have Karelia, all of Finland must go to Russia. We  will not cede one inch in the west. One day, everybody will  return to Russia. Belarus is Russian, Ukraine is Russian, and  the people want to belong to Russia.    [Gauffin] Are you intending to set up a German-Russian axis?  A continental alliance as a counterweight to the Atlantic one?    [Zhirinovskiy] One day, greater Germany, a new Russia, and  India will form a new entente. Then there will be no problems  for the world any more. India and Russia will neutralize China  in Asia; Russia and Germany can control Europe; and Russia and  the Balkan states will solve all problems in the Balkans.</p>

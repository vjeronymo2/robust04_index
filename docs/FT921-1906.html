			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week Helleborus orientalis This is the hardy herbaceous plant which gardeners call Lenten Rose, though it has no connection with true roses. In its numerous varieties it can be in flower from January until May. In fact, Lenten Roses are hybrids between several species of hellebore, which have handsome, evergreen, broadly fingered leaves and cup-shaped flowers, in colour varying from white and cream to deep maroon, often delicately speckled or veined within. However, they have a tendency to hang down so that one must tip the flowers up to appreciate the delicacy of their markings. Lenten Roses make dense clumps of rather tough roots, are best left undisturbed for years, and usually spread by self-sown seedlings, which are likely to vary in colour. They enjoy shady places but will grow right out in the open and are totally unfussy about soil.</p>

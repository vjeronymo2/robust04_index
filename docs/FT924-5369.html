			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / A very Ukrainian reformist: A rocket scientist's way of undoing communism LEONID KUCHMA, the Ukrainian prime minister, built his career at Iuzhmash, the world's largest rocket factory. It is one of the places the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had in mind when he warned the west, whose capitalism he aimed to bury, that 'we can turn out missiles like sausages'. As it turned out, it was communism that Mr Kuchma reluctantly buried in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, last week. Less than a month after becoming prime minister, Mr Kuchma announced a U-turn in Ukrainian economic policy. After denouncing the efforts of his predecessors to shore up the old, centrally planned economy which has produced hyperinflation and recession, Mr Kuchma told Ukrainians in a live television broadcast that their new nation had no alternative but to reform. The importance of Mr Kuchma's message extends far beyond his country's borders, for instability in Ukraine poses a danger to the rest of Europe. The country, which is the size of France, has a 650,000-strong army, the largest in Europe, and 176 long-range nuclear missiles. It flanks four east European states and shares a long border with Russia. But Ukraine has a fragile state structure after centuries as a virtual colony of Russia. It also has a weak economy. Inflation is out of control - consumer prices increased more than 20-fold in the first nine months of 1992  -and sharp falls in consumption and industrial production have prompted an 18 per cent decline in gross national product over the same period. Faced with these bleak statistics, Mr Kuchma unveiled a plan which includes many of the ingredients of the economic reforms pioneered in eastern Europe: an effort to balance the budget, tight control over credit and money supply, and a programme of privatisation. But for all his willingness to borrow from the free market gospel, Mr Kuchma represents a fundamentally different architect of reform from his counterparts in eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. The scientist from eastern Ukraine who has been abroad only four times - twice to China - is a world apart from the young, westernised intellectuals who are bringing the market to other former communist states. Whereas the economic changes in the fast-track reform central European states such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland are part of a deeper commitment to western values and desire for rapid membership of the European Community, Mr Kuchma has a more limited goal - to stave off economic disaster. In practice, this means the prime minister has few reservations about using heavy-handed state intervention to secure his economic goals. Mr Kuchma has proposed a wage and price freeze, strict exchange control and restrictions on imports and exports. He has hinted at limiting the right to strike and the freedom of political parties. Mr Kuchma's hand has been strengthened by an extraordinary political coup last week. Parliament granted the prime minister the authority to rule the economy by decree for the next six months and voluntarily restricted its own right to pass economic legislation. So sweeping are Mr Kuchma's new powers that one Russian newspaper has dubbed him an 'economic dictator'. The first and toughest test of Mr Kuchma's new-found commitment to reform will be whether he sticks to his goals of bringing inflation down from more than 30 per cent a month to between 2 and 3 per cent a year and reducing the budget deficit from 44 per cent of GNP to less than 6 per cent. To do that Mr Kuchma will need to end Ukraine's spendthrift practice of issuing credit to support failing state industry. According to Mr Viktor Penzennyk, the country's young, reform-minded minister of the economy, the government issued Rs800bn of credit to faltering enterprises in May and June alone. The second test of Mr Kuchma's commitment to reform will be privatisation. When he first came to office just a few weeks ago Mr Kuchma said that it was premature even to speak of privatisation of large state enterprises. But the gravity of the crisis has forced him to change his tune. He now wants 'forced' privatisation at all levels. Although Mr Kuchma does not share the ideological commitment to the market of some of his counterparts in eastern Europe, his background in the the government and defence industries could give him the political strength they lack. Mr Kuchma - who has challenged the inner circle of Ukraine's ex-communist elite with his anti-corruption drive - may prove less vulnerable to the attacks of the industrial lobby. One of the biggest dilemmas faced by all reforming ex-communist economies is how to compensate for the closure of inefficient state factories. In Mr Kuchma's view, arms sales may be part of the answer. Syria has already bought tanks from the Ukraine, while China has expressed interest in acquiring its aircraft carriers. And observers suspect that weapons are part of a barter agreement for oil which Ukraine has concluded with Iran. India is purchasing spare parts from Ukrainian arms factories and is considering buying weapons. With so much at stake, the west may be convinced it has to pay a higher price in the future. So far, western aid to Ukraine has come only in dribs and drabs: Dollars 210m worth of credit from the US to buy American grain, a CDollars 50m (Pounds 25.5m) line of credit from Canada, Ecu130m (Pounds 105m) to fund technical assistance from the EC. The prospects for substantial assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have brightened considerably since Mr Kuchma came to office. Yesterday, for example, the World Bank announced it was close to finalising its first project in Ukraine, a Dollars 50m fund to finance institution building.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major Vladimir Knysh, NARODNA ARMIYA </F> correspondent: "`Unknown Troops'--This Is the Way Many Still See  Formations of Civil Defense of Ukraine"]    [Text] Many recall that the civil defense existed in the  former Union. They will probably tell you how they fled from  lectures on protection from a "sudden nuclear, chemical, or  bacteriological attack by the probably enemy." The attitude  toward civil defense, formed on the basis of "brilliant"  training films and busy practical classes was, and in some  places still is, one-sided. Incidentally, there would be nothing  surprising in this if they still practiced that extremely  simplistic, even dilettantish approach to the perception of  everything that was included in the concept of "civil defense."    Today, possibly, such a phrase might seem somewhat  pretentious to some. Others might even doubt the very fact of  the existence of civil defense in Ukraine. Both types should  recall that 3 February 1993 marked the adoption of the Law "On  Civil Defense of Ukraine," which says that "citizens of Ukraine  have the right to protection of their life and health from the  consequences of accidents, catastrophes, large fires, and  natural disasters and to demand of the Government of Ukraine and  other organs of state executive power and the administrations of  enterprises, institutions, and organizations, regardless of  their forms of ownership and management, a guarantee that it  will be enforced.    "The state, as the guarantor of this right, creates a civil  defense system whose objective is to protect the population from  dangerous consequences of accidents and catastrophes of a  technogenic, ecological, natural, and military nature."    During Cold War times some of the most zealous military  analysts of the West tried to include USSR civil defense forces  with the full-fledged infantry troops. They used this as an  argument for letting the appetites of their military department  grow. Still, it was impossible not to advertise the semantic  difference between the words "defense" and "protection"  (contributing to defense, which, undoubtedly, expresses more  precisely the character of the tasks performed by civil defense).    According to the law in our country, "civil defense forces  are troops and specialized and nonspecialized formations. Civil  defense troops are under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet of  Ministers of Ukraine. Their direct leadership is provided by the  chief of staff of civil defense of Ukraine." This is Lieutenant  General Viktor Grechaninov.    The civil defense of Ukraine and its troops are still very  young--they are not even a year old. Nonetheless their "combat  path" began considerably before the official date of the  adoption of the law. The stages of this path were Chernobyl and  work in the "off-limits zone," the rendering of aid to the  population of western rayons of Ukraine which ended up in the  flooded zone, participation in putting out the forest fires in  the Crimea where, largely thanks to the efficient interaction  between civil defense forces and local formations organized by  the State Commission on Emergencies (it included the first  deputy chief of staff of civil defense of Ukraine, Major General  Nikolay Kapustyan), areas where fire broke out were localized  and considerable areas of forest were saved. There was work for  radioactive decontamination of areas in the city of Korostena  and constant excursions for mine clearing. Finally, the last  example: Work in the flooded areas of Transcarpathia. All this  was done by civil defense forces...    But nonetheless, its formations are still "unknown forces"  to  many of us.    A bright burst and the thunder of an explosion--an accident  at a chemical enterprise. It is located on the edge of the city,  which is living its ordinary life and not suspecting that the  countdown to a possible tragedy had already begun.    Major Vladimir Mukhanov's first emergency-rescue battalion  with its attached subdivisions (a fire-fighting company, an  excavator company, and a chemical protection company) arrived in  the region of the accident. The task was to reconnoiter the  site, to rescue and evacuate the wounded, and to localize  individual outbreaks of fire.    Since the source of the explosions was a container of  prussic  acid, the military servicemen of Captain Grigoriy Khablov's  rescue company, the firemen of Captain Grigoriy Piven's  fire-fighting company, and the military servicemen of other  specialties work with individual means of protection.    Evacuation of the wounded was organized immediately. The  firemen of Sergeant Nikolay Prisyazhnyuk's compression section,  Privates A. Kramaranko and I. Pogrebnyak and Junior Sergeant E.  Gavich, had to put out the fires and remove obstructions in  order literally to beat their way through to the victims.    According to information from the enterprise's chief  engineer, a work shift consisting of three people was in one of  the shops. The entrance was blocked. Emergency evacuation was  necessary. And the jack hammers of the compressor team were  again put to work. Within 20 minutes they had drilled through a  concrete structure about 40 centimeters wide and the workers  were released from their captivity.    The troops operate smoothly and efficiently. Excavators and  other specialized equipment are used. The rescue workers  carefully inspect the premises of the shops and conduct searches  for workers who may have fallen under the rubble. The victims  are given first aid and quickly evacuated out of the danger  zone...    This time it was a demonstration class in the organization  and actions of emergency-rescue battalions at the facilities,  which was conducted at the final training sessions for  commanders of civil defense units. But if, God forbid, all this  had really happened, it would be they--the men of the "unknown  forces"--who would be first to enter into hand-to-hand combat  with danger.    As for the officers, warrant officers, and enlisted men of  the first emergency-rescue battalion, they have to their  personal credit participation in the search and rescue work  after last year's well-known disaster with the Ruslan aircraft.  For three months this year the troops worked to decontaminate  areas around the city of Korosten. When there was an accident  with the Kiev purification installations they conducted the  decontamination--they removed the coastal earth to a depth of 40  centimeters, loaded it into containers, and transported it to  the place designated for it. They worked quickly, knowing what  an important task had been assigned to them. Is there any need  to mention that they performed the hardest ecological work on  the Lybed River, on an area of three or four kilometers?    Overall, in Kiev alone there are 47 potentially dangerous  facilities that have been "assigned" to civil defense forces.  They are prepared at any time of the day, under any weather  conditions, to come to our aid and spare us from disaster.    And problems--civil defense forces have them too. They have  inadequate means of small-scale mechanization and sometimes a  very serious shortage. They do not even have enough rack jacks.  Even though in Donetsk there is an enterprise which produces  very good pneumatic equipment--convenient, practical, and small,  which could lift concrete slabs weighing up to three tonnes.  This is something that is needed. But, alas, they are expensive  and there is no money. Just as is the acquisition of new  instruments for chemical reconnaissance. So they use what they  have, or what they have so far. Some are also manufacturing  their own. And they do not complain about life. Even though  theirs is not very sweet. Most of the officers of civil defense  units do not have housing either; they take care of their  families as well as their financial capabilities will allow.  Here in the first emergency-rescue battalion, half of the 14  officers and warrant officers do not have apartments.    It would seem that formations directly under the Cabinet of  Ministers should not have to go begging. Alas, local authorities  at all levels are rather stingy in dealing with their civil  defense.    But if there is ever any natural disaster or large  emergency--the State Committee on Emergency Situations convenes,  possibly headed by a deputy prime minister (the main person in  charge of civil defense) right in the situation room (the  President of the United States in the White House is not the  only one to have such a thing, there is also one in the  headquarters of the civil defense of Ukraine), in order to make  important and crucial decisions. And there they receive  exhaustive clear information about emergency situations.  Incidentally, this room is an object of legitimate pride. And  especially for Grigoriy Dovbysh--the chief of the department for  the automated control system of the staff of the civil defense  of Ukraine. It is equipped with computers, and their memory  contains, for example, a program of the five main  prognosticatory-modeling systems for emergency situations. They  include Proton (nuclear power plant accident), Zaryad (for  chemical facilities), Vulkan (earthquakes and their  consequences), Kaskad (catastrophic floods), and Buran (nuclear  strikes). All these names were given not to frighten people but  as a confirmation of how serious and crucial is the work  entrusted to civil defense. They are the first to be sent to the  most dangerous places--to clean up after accidents,  catastrophes, and natural disasters. And they are frequently  forgotten when the time comes to solve their problems--even the  most immediate ones.</p>

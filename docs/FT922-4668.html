			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE ANNOUNCEMENT that the French Government is to hold a referendum on the Maastricht treaty caused a sharp retreat in the FT-SE future sending it to a discount to the cash market on several occasions during the session, writes Joel Kibazo. An early fall in the June contract on the FT-SE, after it opened at 2,708, quickly gave way to a squeeze which sent the contract climbing to 2,724 by about 11am. However, the mid-session announcement from Paris led to a large sell-off causing June to tumble as it gave up earlier gains. At several points during the afternoon, June was at a discount to the cash market, though a further slide was halted by early firmness on Wall Street. The confidence on Wall Street proved unsustainable and June drifted back again. June closed at 2,680, down 37 on the previous session and below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was high, more than 14,000 contracts were dealt. The day in traded options was reported to have lacked big features. A total of 28,739 lots were traded, of which the FT-SE option traded 10,136. Bid target Midland Bank, once again took the honours for the most traded stock option as some 2,648 lots changed hands. This was followed by National Power at 2,413 lots.</p>

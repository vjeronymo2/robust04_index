			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: i-STAT launches hand-held blood analyser A HAND-HELD, battery- operated analyser that reduces the time needed to perform a blood test to 90 seconds has been launched by i-STAT, a Princeton-based medical diagnostics company. The system - a portable clinical analyser with a disposable biosensor cartridge - will initially be marketed in the US. It is intended to replace laboratory blood tests that can take an hour or more to perform. Mr William Moffitt, president of i-STAT, said the company would target the acute care units of 2,000 US hospitals and hopes to sell between 10 and 20 per hospital, at Dollars 3,000 per analyser. The analyser, which looks like a remote control for a television set, accepts a tiny cartridge containing two drops of blood and produces test results for sodium, potassium chloride, glucose, urea nitrogen and hematocrit. The company, which employs 115 people and has its manufacturing plant in Canada, recently raised Dollars 51m through a share issue on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. The Japanese launch of the analyser, which Mr Moffitt said was the only product of its kind, will take place later this year.</p>

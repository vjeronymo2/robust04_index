			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finishes up 25 points after late burst Wall Street AFTER trading quietly in a narrow range for most of the day amid concern about the economic and earnings outlook, US stock markets ended higher on a burst of late buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.94 at 3,276.26. The index spent all but the last 30 minutes not much more than 5 points above Friday's close, but late demand added almost 20 points at the finish. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.27 at 416.62, while the Amex composite fell 1.24 to 377.25 and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.86 to 575.34. Turnover on the NYSE was 158m shares. Turmoil in European financial markets continued to cloud investor sentiment in the US. Overnight stock prices in Frankfurt, Paris and London all fell sharply amid concern about economic growth and whether the German monetary authorities would lower interest rates. With Europe trapped in a financial and economic quagmire, the chances of an export-led recovery that many US investors had pinned their hopes on now appears less likely. Combined with last week's bad news on durable goods orders and personal income and spending, the outlook for US economic growth remains bleak: US investors can only hope for another cut in domestic interest rates, although analysts doubt that the Federal Reserve will make such a move in the near future. Among individual stocks, BF Goodrich fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 3/4 after the company warned that third-quarter earnings would come in below the 43 cents a share it made in the second quarter, and even below the 30 cents many analysts had forecast. Goodyear fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 after reporting that revenues in the third quarter would be close to the Dollars 3.1bn earned in the previous three months. Investors might also have been unnerved by the resignation yesterday of the company's chief financial officer. Chemical Bank rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 1/8 in busy trading after the broking house Oppenheimer upgraded the stock from 'market-performer' to a 'short-term buy'. Oakwood Homes firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 13 7/8 on reports that analysts expect mobile home stocks to benefit from demand for low-priced housing if difficult economic conditions persist. Gulf Canada, quoted on the American Stock Exchange, jumped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 4 15/16 after the company said that testing confirmed the likelihood of a large gas field in South Sumatra. Gulf has a 54 per cent interest in the field. Canada A WEAK financial sector continued to drag Canadian issues lower. Toronto's composite index lost 17.50 points or 0.52 per cent to end at 3,367.99. Losing issues outpaced gainers 318 to 218. Volume was 23.625m shares worth CDollars 266.6m compared with Friday's 24.012m shares worth CDollars 279.2m. Westcoast Energy said it will offer CDollars 16 a share for Union Energy. Union Holdings will tender its 60 per cent stake in Union Energy for cash. Union Energy stock gained  7/8 to 16 1/8 in heavy trading, while Westcoast shares lost  5/8 to 16 3/8.</p>

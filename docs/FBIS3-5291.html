			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on  Friday [4 March] made into law political reform package  amendments which feature changes in the House of  Representatives' election system and revised regulations on  corporate donations to political fund-raising organizations.  The upper house approved the amendments following passage by  the lower house Tuesday.    Under the amendments, 300 seats will be allocated for  single-seat constituencies and 200 by proportional  representation based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units.  Currently, 511 lower house members are elected from multiseat  constituencies.    The complete reform package will be enforced after enactment  of another law identifying the locations of the 300 single-seat  constituencies.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura has said the  coalition government wants to submit a bill on the  constituencies' locations to the current Diet session ending  June 29. But the presentation may be delayed to autumn if  legislators insist their opinions be reflected on the locations.    The original government-sponsored package called for 274  single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional  representation on a nationwide basis. The original package  banned corporate donations to politicians and their fund-raising  organizations, but the revised bills will allow firms to donate  up to 500,000 yen per year during the next five years as a  temporary provision.    The original package was passed on January 29 at an  extraordinary Diet session shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and opposition Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei  Kono agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement would be  discussed during the current ordinary session.</p>

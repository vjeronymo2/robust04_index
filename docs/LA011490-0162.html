			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TIME FOR THE DREAMERS TO WAKE UP TO UGLY REALITY  </P> <P> Wall Street took a close look at reality on Friday and, boy, was it ugly. The  stock market has been living a charmed life for the past few months. While bad  things were happening to the economy, to the dollar, to interest rates and to  other markets, equities couldn't do anything wrong.  </P> <P> The folks over at the stock exchange looked at things this way: If the economy  was in a recession, that's good because interest rates would soon fall. And if  the economy wasn't in a recession, that too is good because corporate profits  would soon improve. Beside, they were telling themselves, everyone knows that  the program traders who have been holding the stock index futures markets in  Chicago hostage wouldn't let equity prices fall sharply, even if there were  some bad news coming out on the economy.  </P> <P> In other words, the stock pros felt that nothing could go wrong. Prices would  rise no matter what. But on Friday, the stock jockeys learned a lesson -- maybe  only the first of many -- about just how wrong they can be.  </P> <P> The government reported Friday morning that inflation on the producer level in  December rose 0.7%, compared to just 0.2% in November. And even if you take out  the rise in food and energy prices -- one of Wall Street's favorite ways of  pooh-poohing inflation numbers that it doesn't like -- the rise was still 0.6%.  Either way, the number was worse than the 0.5% that Wall Street was expecting.  </P> <P> Just to make Wall Street's life really miserable, the government also announced  that retail sales for December rose just 0.2%. That, too, hit like a bomb. In  short, the two statistics may show that the nation is in the middle of an  economic slowdown, and possibly a recession, that's accompanied by inflation.  </P> <P> "That's not a particularly good combination for anyone who's investing in  stocks," says Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for First Albany Corp.  </P> <P> A few other things didn't go Wall Street's way last week. The Tokyo Stock  Exchange recorded its eighth-worst loss ever on Friday. And discontent in the  Soviet provinces created some investor unrest worldwide.  </P> <P> But none of these was the real reason that the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 71.46 points on Friday. The real reason is that the Dow didn't belong at  near-record levels in the first place. The Dow was kept bloated in the face of  deteriorating economic conditions because the pros who control the stock index  futures markets in Chicago wouldn't let the equities stage a normal, orderly  correction.  </P> <P> Even on Friday, when stock prices were headed for an obvious rout, major  investment firms defied logic by buying large numbers of stock index futures  contracts in Chicago. The heaviest index buying came around 3 p.m., I'm told,  when Salomon Bros., Shearson Lehman Hutton and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. --  three of Wall Street's heavyweights -- made what looked like a concerted effort  to reverse some of the markets losses.  </P> <P> The Dow was down about 70 points at the time, and it did rally temporarily, but  the "intervention" couldn't counteract the economic ugliness that investors  finally noticed. I'd bet Salomon, Shearson and Goldman are already planning  their buying strategies for Monday. And then the volatility will start all over  again.  </P> <P> sg,2  </P> <P> </P> <P> Icahn Finds This Is No Way to Run an Airline  </P> <P> The press has often been accused of publishing stories about situations in  which there are problems and then never following up when those problems get  fixed. But in the case of Trans World Airlines, the opposite has been true.  </P> <P> Investor Carl C. Icahn purchased the airline in 1986 and was widely, and  loudly, heralded in the press as the company's savior. But Icahn has been  lucky, so far, to dodge the blame now that TWA seems to be slipping.  </P> <P> "I think (TWA) is doing poorly," Louis A. Marckesano, an airline analyst for  Janney Montgomery Scott, a Philadelphia brokerage firm. "In (the airline)  business you either grow or you fall behind. And they are falling behind."  </P> <P> Recently, TWA announced that it was selling its Chicago-to-London routes, four  gates and some maintenance facilities at Chicago's O'Hare Airport to American  Airlines for $195 million. That sale came only after Icahn -- one of the  nation's savviest investors but no whiz at running an airline -- tried, and  apparently failed, to sell TWA (see below).  </P> <P> Icahn has hinted in the past that he'd like to merge TWA with another airline.  But informed sources say that was just a smoke screen. Icahn was really trying  to unload the carrier and get his money out of that investment.  </P> <P> Icahn's best opportunity to sell TWA came last summer when airlines were the  hottest property on Wall Street. And that's when my sources tell me that Icahn  was the most active in trying to find a buyer.  </P> <P> Lately, Icahn has been privately voicing his annoyance at the airline business.  And union leaders at TWA, in turn, have been publicly voicing their annoyance  at how Icahn has been treating the airline.  </P> <P> But Icahn is no fool. He may be getting what he can for pieces of TWA -- just  in the nick of time.  </P> <P> According to Timothy Pettee, Merrill Lynch's airline analyst, ridership on TWA  has been dwindling. In November, Pettee says, TWA's all-important revenue  passenger miles fell 4.9%. It was the only airline of the five largest in  America to register a loss.  </P> <P> And TWA's planes went out only 56.5% loaded, Pettee says. That, too, was the  worst of the five. Even beleaguered Pan Am, says Pettee, managed a 5% gain in  revenue passenger miles, and its planes went out 58.4% loaded with passengers.  </P> <P> (A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flying one mile.)  </P> <P> "Yes, he turned it around in 1986 and 1987," Pettee says of Icahn, adding that  the acquisition of Ozark Airlines was probably the investor's most brilliant  move. "But the airline is starved for capital."  </P> <P> TWA is also suffering the consequences of factors not under its control. U.S.  airlines, in general, haven't been able to entice as many travelers to Europe  as they had been. Experts think it is the bombing of a Pan Am jet in Lockerbie,  Scotland, last winter that is causing many travelers to fly on foreign  airlines, especially on the Europe-to-U.S. leg of their journey.  </P> <P> In 1988, U.S. airlines had a 52% market share of traffic between Europe and the  United States. In the first nine months of 1989, that number was just 46%.  Unfortunately for TWA, that's its biggest market.  </P> <P> Janney's Marckesano says Icahn signaled that he's losing interest in the  airline business when he didn't jump at the chance to buy bankrupt Eastern  Airlines. He could have used Eastern to feed passengers onto his foreign  routes.  </P> <P> "When he didn't take advantage of the Eastern situation, he was tacitly  admitting he wasn't in the airline business long term," Marckesano says.  </P> <P> Nobody at TWA returned my telephone calls. But if you know someone who wants to  buy an airline, give Icahn a call.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pan Am Isn't Selling, but It May Be Buying  </P> <P> If you bought Pan Am stock recently on takeover rumors, you might want to know  what's really going on.  </P> <P> Last week, rumors were published that Pan Am might be acquired by either  American Airlines or TWA. There's a kernel of truth in this, but it will  probably never pop. Here's why.  </P> <P> A Wall Street source very familiar with Pan Am tells me that on more than one  occasion American Air has looked at the possible acquisition of Pan Am and  decided -- on more than one occasion -- that it didn't want to make such a  deal.  </P> <P> As far as TWA is concerned, the rumors that have been spreading around Wall  Street are backward. It was Pan Am, I'm told by this source, that was  discussing the acquisition of TWA, which investor Carl C. Icahn desperately  wants to sell. It wasn't the other way around. Pan Am would then have spun off  duplicate operations.  </P> <P> There is some hope for Pan Am investors, however. For one thing, the airline's  operations appear to be improving.  </P> <P> Also, Pan Am's executives still think that an alliance with another airline  would be very beneficial, and they've been talking with any airline that would  listen. (That's how Pan Am came to have discussions with American Air.)  </P> <P> Nobody should be surprised if Pan Am gets into merger/acquisition talks.  </P> <P> New Jersey securities regulators are trying to put Mr. Chutzpah, Barry Davis,  in jail for paying a $15,000 fine with a rubber check. Davis was the  "broadcaster" for a phone-in takeover tip hot line in New Jersey before that  state chased him over the river into New York. Davis is said to be  "broadcasting" his information from a pay phone in a Chinese restaurant near  the George Washington Bridge . . .  </P> <P> A number of Wall Street analysts suddenly reduced their earnings estimates last  week on Delta Air Lines. How did they all come to the same conclusion  simultaneously? Executives of Delta were personally calling the analysts and  suggesting the move. Delta didn't bother to make a public statement until the  next day -- something that should annoy small investors.  </P></p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Bathers paralysed by mystery virus An investigation is being launched into the cause of a suspected virus that partly paralysed bathers at two popular tourist beaches. Two teenagers are confined to wheelchairs after contracting the virus, which attacks the nervous system. Both lost the use of their legs within hours of swimming at Oxwich Bay on the Gower coast, West Glamorgan, in the summer. Bathers at nearby Mewslade Bay were seriously weakened.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES TO PROTECT FLAG  </P> <P> Conservative pundits often justify U.S. support for various brutal right-wing  dictatorships by making a fine distinction between them and left-wing  dictatorships. The key word is always "totalitarian." Communist governments are  totalitarian because they create government-centered societies in which the  state is often accorded semi-religious status. They frequently point to the  huge pictures of Mao and Lenin that constitute the official wallpaper of China  and the Soviet Union. Of course, this kind of thing never happens in right-wing  dictatorships (Hitler clearly does not count).  </P> <P> On Sept. 12, the House of Representatives passed a statute against burning the  flag (Part I, Sept. 13). It seems to me that we are treating the flag with an  idolatrous fervor not very different from those totalitarian societies.  </P> <P> A Buddhist would point out that we have mistaken the finger pointing at the  moon for the moon itself. The flag represents the freedom to live and express  ourselves freely. So, when somebody burns that symbol of freedom, we all get  the urge to throw that person in the slammer.  </P> <P> Am I the only person to see a contradiction here? Are Republicans and Democrats  so afraid of the destruction of a symbol of freedom that they are willing to  destroy freedom in order to protect it? This couldn't bear some resemblance to  that dreaded "T" word, could it?  </P> <P> BOB WESTAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

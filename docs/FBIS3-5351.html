He told KCNA:    The third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is to open before long as  a series of controversial matters between the DPRK and the  United States including the "nuclear issue" have been  coordinated. Japanese politicians including the high-level  authorities, however, are slandering the DPRK, urging it to  accept "special inspection." They seek in this to instigate the  hardline conservatives of the United States to lay obstacles in  the way of the DPRK-U.S. talks and attain their sinister  political and military purposes.    We cannot but watch with vigilance the attempt of the  high-placed officials of Japan to impede the settlement of the  "nuclear issue" with rash acts against the DPRK and find a  pretext for a lawful promotion of their nuclear armament, which  has reached the danger line.    If Japan arms itself with nuclear weapons, the  denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realised, the  inter-Korean joint declaration on denuclearization will be  invalid and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be  virtually meaningless.    If Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula is to be  nuclear-free, not only Asia but also the world must pay due  attention to Japan which is accelerating nuclear armament.    The denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to the  total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide.</p>

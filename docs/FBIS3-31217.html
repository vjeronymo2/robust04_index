"Coordination meetings between NATO  and the UN have sorted out all points," Peter MacFarlane, a  spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR],  told a press conference.    His comments contrasted with reports from Brussels that NATO  was becoming increasingly critical of apparently inadequate UN  plans to monitor the Serb artillery around the city.    "On the broader pinciples I can say that NATO and the UN are  very much of one mind," MacFarlane. He noted that control  involved "monitoring, supervision by UNPROFOR personnel, linked  to the question of where weapons are located at the end" of the  February 21 NATO deadline for the belligerents to withdraw their  heavy weapons or placed them under UN control.    MacFarlane said the issue was being discussed with both the  Bosnian Serbs and the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army.    He added that despite the cancelation of Tuesday's meeting  of  top military officials at Sarajevo airport after the Bosnian  Army comander in chief did not show up, the UNPROFOR commander  for Bosnia, General Michael Rose, "is at this stage fairly happy  with the way things are going."    Earlier in Brussels NATO sources said the head of the  Atlantic alliance's forces in Europe was to meet with the UN  special envoy to former Yugoslavia this week to discuss  differences over enforcement of the NATO ultimatum.    NATO General George Joulwan was to meet with Yasushi Akashi  in Zagreb at a time yet to be decided, to raise problems of  coordination between the two bodies, a NATO military source said.    Separate NATO sources said UNPROFOR plans to have monitors  check on Serb artillery surrendered to UN troops in Serb  barracks under a ceasefire accord implemented Thursday did not  amount to proper control. One anonymous source said: "That's  not a proper control. The control has to be strong enough to  stop the weapons being used."    The Serbs have placed 33 artillery pieces under UN  monitoring  within Serb barracks at Lukavica and Mokro, while the  mainly-Moslem government forces have handed over 10 mortars to  Ukrainian UN forces in Sarajevo.    Bosnian Serb leaders Tuesday rejected demands to withdraw  all  their heavy arms from around Sarajevo. Bosnian Serb military  commander General Radko Mladic told the Yugoslav TANJUG news  agency that his weapons would stay put to protect Serbs against  "fanatical Moslem units."    But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that he was  prepared to order regrouping of "part" of his heavy artillery  "in order to facilitate monitoring" by UN peacekeepers.</p>

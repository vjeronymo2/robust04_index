			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Iran looks to Islamic alliance in west Asia IRAN yesterday said the inaugural summit with Turkey, Pakistan and former Soviet Moslem states was a first step towards an Islamic economic and political alliance in south-west Asia, Reuter reports from Tehran. President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said shortly before opening the two-day summit it was 'natural' for the emerging republics of former Soviet central Asia to turn to the three founder-members of the Economic Co-operation Organisation (ECO). The ECO hopes the inclusion of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and possibly Tajikistan, will inject new life into a group that has existed unobtrusively since its creation 27 years ago by Tehran, Ankara and Islamabad. The leaders of the traditionally Moslem former Soviet states of Turkmenistan, Azberbaijan, Kirgizia and Khazakstan are attending the meeting. Apart from taking in new members, the meeting is likely to approve a 10 per cent lowering of tariff barriers between Turkey, Iran and Pakistan and to discuss steps towards freer trade and movement of people. The meeting will also offer an opportunity to discuss regional disputes such as the civil war in Afghanistan and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Iran, Pakistan and Turkey all say they support United Nations peace efforts for Afghanistan, seen as another potential ECO member.</p>

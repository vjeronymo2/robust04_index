In  principle, this new round of talks, recently described by  Economy Minister Mr. Mourad Benachenhou as an occasion for real  negotiations, is expected to conclude the two consultative  rounds started since the inauguration of Mr. Redha Malek's  government last September on a rigorous financial policy that  Algeria should adopt if it wanted to secure support from the  international financial community.    The signing this month of a letter of intent, i.e. a  document  in which the authorities present the program of economic reforms  for the coming years, is a matter on which Algeria is pinning a  great deal of hope as the sole means of cutting the payment of  its debts so as to start economic revival. The economy minister  did state to THE WASHINGTON POST three days ago that there was  no other way if we wanted to avoid a rise in inflation and a  total collapse of the economic system.    This type of agreement with the IMF imposes, in return for  the rescheduling of debts, a series of conditions which have  adverse effects at the social level. But Algeria hopes to  secure a sort of special treatment, taking into consideration  the political circumstances the country is going through. In  this respect, Benachenhou expressed a great confidence as he  stated in Algiers that the file of negotiations was under  control, and the government was trying to persuade the IMF to  take into account the exceptional situation in Algeria. He had  also already stated at the beginning of the year: we will be  negotiating firmly with the IMF to arrive at a harmonious  financing program without overlooking social repercussions.</p>

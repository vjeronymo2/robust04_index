			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker forecasts tighter sugar market for 1994 The sugar market should tighten somewhat in the new year as demand continues to rise although the current ready supply to the world market and slow import demand has kept prices steady, according to the latest sugar report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London commodities broker. The success of this year's Australian and Philippine sugar crops is currently satisfying short-term demand, but Man suggests that the situation may change early next year. Brazilian exports could be reduced if production in the north-east is lower than last year - fears of a 50 per cent drop in output have been circulated. In addition, the outlook for the Thai and Cuban crops has deteriorated in recent weeks. Cuban exports were 60 per cent lower than last year in August at 132,964 tonnes. Concern over next year's crop has increased following heavy rains causing possible damage and delay in harvesting. Conversely, the Thai crop could be affected by dry conditions during the growing season. A hesitant start to the Thai harvest and rumours of millers buying back some of their earlier sales has added to the market's fears of a poor outcome.</p>

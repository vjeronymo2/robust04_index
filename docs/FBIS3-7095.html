			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun, from Vienna] </F>   [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Director  General Hans Blix will participate in the unofficial UN Security  Council [UNSC] on the afternoon of 24 March to give an oral  report on the results of North Korea's inspection and on the  details of how the IAEA Board of Governors came to adopt a  resolution against North Korea.    At the meeting, Director General Hans Blix will express deep  regret over the fact that North Korea's nuclear issue has fallen  into a deadlocked situation due to North Korea's uncooperative  measures and will emphasize that strong measures at the UN  Security Council level are unavoidable. The IAEA will refrain  from taking independent action regarding future inspections on  North Korea, but will act upon the UNSC's countermeasures.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Ratings cut at Nissan and American Honda Standard and Poor's has lowered the credit ratings of Nissan and American Honda. It has affirmed Toyota's triple A long-term rating and removed the group from creditwatch. S&amp;P said that Nissan's poor financial performance led it to reduce the company's credit rating to BBB+ from A. 'Recovery of earnings will take a few years, as the company's efficiency continues to be affected by excess production capacity domestically and weak performance of overseas subsidiaries,' S&amp;P said. S&amp;P noted that Nissan continued to have a strong market position in Japan, global market presence and 'exceptional product development abilities as a full line producer of passenger cars'. American Honda had its credit rating lowered to A-2 from A-1. Honda's liquidity levels were low while earnings continue to be under pressure, the agency said. Toyota had its triple A credit rating affirmed, as a result of its dominant share of the Japanese market, strong presence in overseas markets and strong financial profile.</p>

It was the martyr-leader Abu al-Mundhir and  the Khalil al-Rahman martyrs' session held in the period between  16 and 17 May. The council heard the report of the central  committee, read out by brother Abu al-Lutf, as well as the  reports of the committees related to various activities.    Brother President Yasir 'Arafat spoke in detail about what  happened from Madrid to Cairo, and what has been realized, the  entry of the Palestinian security forces to the homeland and the  popular welcome accorded to these forces, as well as about the  need for the solidarity of all to care for the newly-born  Palestinian Authority which needs the arms of all cadres and  leaderships. 'Arafat spoke also about the importance of the  historic step achieved as a result of the sacrifice of thousands  of martyrs, injured, prisoners, and detainees. [passage omitted]</p>

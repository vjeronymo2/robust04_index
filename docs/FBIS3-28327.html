			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] While discussions are starting anew on the concept  of reducing the income tax and instead instituting a public  welfare tax as a source of revenue to cover the shortfalls  resulting therefrom, the coalition parties started the work of  finalizing key points of the 1994 budget in a policy meeting  this morning.    The coalition parties held a meeting of the Policy Affairs  Council at the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  headquarters and began a final review of ministries' budget  requests and details of the tax revenue plan, while excluding  from it the matter of reducing the income tax and covering the  shortfalls therefrom. The government is hoping to have a  Finance Ministry draft of the 1994 budget completed [for  submission to the cabinet] by 10 February.    Party officials in charge of taxation are due to join this  meeting in the afternoon.    In the afternoon meeting, the parties are expected to  exchange views concerning how the government and the ruling  parties should adjust their stands on the question of financial  resources to fund the cuts in revenue.    Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], when speaking on a commercial television  program this morning, said that even though the mass media have  claimed that the public welfare tax came out of nowhere, it has  been discussed time and again in following the appropriate steps  in the coalition parties. He said that people should stop  speaking out emotionally and instead should start discussing the  substance of the matter in a calmer manner.    On the other hand, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet  Affairs Committee, spoke on a different television program and  said: It is all right to discuss sources of revenue necessary  for welfare, but the party's view is that two to three years  should be allotted to such discussions. He said that the SDPJ  has no choice but to quit the government should the latter  insist on pushing ahead and going ahead with the plan.</p>

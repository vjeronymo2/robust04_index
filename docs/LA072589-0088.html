			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: TEKELEC QUARTERLY EARNINGS DROP 57%; REVENUE UP  </P> <P> Tekelec, a Calabasas maker of equipment used in testing telecommunications  products, said its second-quarter earnings tumbled 57% from a year earlier  despite a 12% increase in revenue.  </P> <P> Tekelec's net income for the three months that ended June 30 dropped to  $563,000 from $1.3 million a year ago, but its revenue climbed to $8.25 million  from $7.40 million. For the first half of this year, Tekelec's profit fell 25%  to $1.81 million from $2.40 million, and its six-month revenue rose 23% to  $17.4 million from $14.1 million.  </P> <P> Tekelec blamed the reduced earnings on higher costs and less than expected  growth in revenue. The costs were associated with the introduction of a  product, and higher engineering and customer service expenses.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The decision whether Russia will construct its own  launch site on the basis of a strategic missile division  stationed in the Far East will probably be made before the end  of 1994, a spokesman for the Russian space forces told Interfax  Thursday.    According to the U.S.-Russian Strategic Arms Reduction  Treaty, a center for testing and use of space equipment is to be  set up on the basis of the strategic missile division near  Svobodny-18, Amur region. In the division's silos, most of  which have been dismantled, there were 60 NATO class SS-11  missiles.    Experts believe that the first launch from the site will  quite possibly take place in 1996 as projected. Nevertheless,  the only work currently in progress in Svobodny-18 is aimed at  maintaining the city's infrastructure and the remaining silos.  Looking for ways to launch the Rokot carrier rocket from both a  silo and a pad is also going on.    According to the officer, Rokot may be used both for  military  and research purposes. The modification of the launch pad for  Rokot had virtually not been started, he added. "If the order  were given, it would take no longer than six months to  accomplish the task," he said.    The three-stage light carrier rocket Rokot was designed by  the Salyut bureau on the basis of a combat missile RS-18, due to  be dismantled under the START-2 treaty. Rokot is capable of  taking space equipment weighing up to two tonnes to a near earth  round- circle orbit with an apogee of about 1,000 kilometers and  that weighing less than 300 kilograms to an elliptic orbit with  an apogee of up to 40,000 kilometers above the surface.    Rokot has a launch weight of 106.7 tones and is 24.6 meters  long, with a maximum diameter of 2.5 meters. The Khrunichev  State Space Research and Industrial Center is now developing  booster stages for Rokot.</p>

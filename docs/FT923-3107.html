			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: British companies display little determination to export Sir, In Britain we are rightly concerned at our negative trade balance, but even a serious recession doesn't seem to have significantly blunted our thirst for imports. Much is made of the relative strength of sterling, the quality of our products, R&amp;D, delivery service, etc. but, important as all these may be, I suggest that there is another, rather simpler, explanation for our success in importing rather than exporting. Importing is so much easier. As a British but bilateral Chamber of Commerce we do our best to help British companies export to Italy and, committed to the concept of trade, we also help Italian companies export to Britain. When we receive a request for information we write in reply stating exactly what we can supply and how much we will charge for it. This information is usually quite simple and the amounts charged are extremely modest. So far this year only 14 per cent of British companies have taken up our offers and this compares with a much more positive 52 per cent response from Italian companies. And this despite the fact that, from long and negative experience, we charge UK companies less than those in Italy. As a result our income from Italian companies for this type of service is over five times as much as that from British companies. Our experience is shared by local, Italian market research organisations which have great difficulty in persuading potential British exporters to pay more serious sums of money for more profound research. I believe our experience as a chamber is similar to that of other British chambers in Europe and wonder if we have given up the belief that 'one has to spend money to make money'. Or is it simply another symptom of our lack of determination and tenacity in increasingly competitive world markets? If I were chairman of a UK company and worried about results I would have a good, hard look at the export department.

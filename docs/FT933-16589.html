			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Leading French food retailer reduces deficit SODIAAL, one of France's leading food groups, yesterday said it had cut its net loss last year to FFr36m (Dollars 6.31m) from FFr272m in 1991 despite a heavy deficit from its Spanish subsidiary. However, Mr Nicolas Le Chatelier, chief executive, criticised the 'crazy trend' for big French food retailers to try to compete on price against the German-style discount outlets that are now expanding aggressively in France. He said Sodiaal, which is best known for its Yoplait yoghurt and Candia milk brands, was willing to increase its output of cheaper unbranded products, particularly in the fresh foods sector. But he stressed that the group was also determined 'to protect its brands'. The French food market has had a tough time in the past year due to the parallel pressures of economic recession and a stream of mergers among the powerful hypermarket chains. French producers, such as Sodiaal, have also faced stiff competition from the fast-expanding European groups including Nestle of Switzerland and the Anglo-Dutch Unilever. Sodiaal suffered a fall in turnover from FFr17.6bn (Dollars 3.08bn) in 1991 to FFr16.3bn in 1992, due to exchange rate fluctuations after the September currency crisis. The group's Spanish business was in the red with a FFr167m loss. Mr Le Chatelier said it had reorganised its activities in Spain, by buying out its local partner to take full control, in the hope that the business would break even this year. The Spanish loss cancelled out a net profit of FFr130m from Sodiaal's French interests, which have benefited from restructuring.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    We welcome the fact that the combat operations in the  confrontation zone have been suspended. The agreement for a  cease-fire has rarely been violated, but Azerbaijan has to be  blamed for the violations of the agreement. That Republic's  military units have intermittently fired on various points of  the Armenian front line. The NKR defense units have refrained  from returning the fire.    Regrettably, Azerbaijan has violated the cease-fire. The NKR  Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that  Azerbaijan's military units tried to capture a strategically  important hill in the Gadrutskiy and Fizulinskiy sector of the  front line at about 0300. The NKR defense units repulsed the  attack. No one was hurt on the Armenian side.    The Armenian Ministry of Defense Information Center has  informed us that the situation on the border between Armenia and  Azerbaijan has been relatively peaceful. No incident has  occurred in that region.    We hope that a completely peaceful situation will be  established on the border as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: There's more to culture than a visit to the palace Sir, Taking nothing away from Mr Ted Turner, founder of CNN ('Poised for a home run', September 20), he has built an impressive news network that has come to dominate the world stage. Only CNN reaches 200 countries and more than 16 per cent of the world's 800m TV homes. However, I think that Mr Turner should be careful in making such statements as: 'They've (the French) got this bee in their bonnet about French culture. They've got great culture, I've been to Versailles.' As Mr Turner should have learned in June when Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network, decided not to renew its five-year contract with CNN and instead teamed up with Reuters and the BBC, in order to be successful globally he must work with an appreciation for diverse cultural backgrounds and not assume that the world is an American ball-field.

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Brussels confidence in EMS THE European monetary system is so strong that it would easily survive French rejection of the Maastricht treaty in the national referendum on September 20, Mr Henning Christophersen, the European commissioner for economic affairs, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. 'It is my opinion that there is both the liquidity and the political will to maintain the EMS system,' Mr Christophersen, a Dane, said at a seminar arranged by the Danish financial daily newspaper Boersen. 'The EMS has proven to be so strong that it will easily be able to survive a French 'no' vote,' he said. There have been fears that a French rejection might not only sink European Community plans for economic and monetary union outlined in the Maastricht treaty, but also threaten the system of exchange rate management within the EMS which imposes strict limits on the extent to which member currencies can fluctuate. The Maastricht treaty on political, economic and monetary union in the Community has already been narrowly rejected by Danish voters in a June referendum, and a 'no' vote by France would effectively kill it.</p>

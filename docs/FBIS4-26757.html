			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  has decided to arrange record-breaking preferential loans -- 6.5  billion yuan in all -- to 523 big grain producing and 150 big  cotton producing counties annually for five years, starting this  year.    Liang Tiangeng, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture,  said that the counties, selected by the central government from  among over 2,000 counties across the country, are in 29  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.    "Such an amount of loans for agriculture is really  unprecedented," Liang said in an interview with XINHUA.    The move was designed as part of the efforts to boost the  country's grain and cotton production. The selection was made  mainly according to the total annual output of their grain and  cotton, the official said.    The annual loan for the 523 counties totals five billion  yuan  (574 million U.S. dollars), while the 150 cotton producing  counties will be given 1.5 billion yuan (nearly 200 million U.S.  dollars) of loans each year.    The annual interest rate for the loans will be eight  percent,  a discount of about two percent, he said.    The actual loans for each of the 673 counties will be linked  to the amount of grain and cotton they produce and sell to the  state.    The provinces, cities and counties involved are themselves  required to finance 20-30 percent of the total investment needed  for the programs.    The official said that the 673 counties are also required to  ensure a stable increase in grain and cotton output and sell the  amount of grain and cotton set by the governments.    The 673 counties are encouraged by the central government to  develop a diversified rural economy, including production of  high-yielding and profitable farm produce, livestock and aquatic  products, after they have produced the set amount of grain and  cotton.    East China's Jiangsu Province holds 60 of the 673 counties,  followed by the country's other leading grain and cotton  producers -- the Provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei,  Heilongjiang, Sichuan and Hebei.    One hundred and twelve of the 150 cotton-producing counties  are in Shandong, Henan, Hubei or Jiangsu Provinces and Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region.    In another development, the central government has also  earmarked one billion yuan (114 million U.S. dollars) for loans  each year for five years to support the development of  high-yielding and better farm produce across the country.    The central government's aim with those loans is to make  efficient use of resources and increase farmers' incomes, as  China is in the process of adopting a socialist market economy  and the demand for better farm produce is on the increase.    The plan is for about 30 demonstration areas for such farm  produce to be chosen, about one for each of the 30 provinces,  municipalities or autonomous regions, and several big cities  such as Chongqing in Sichuan Province and Qingdao in Shandong  Province.    The demonstration areas will be of different types, such as  export-oriented agriculture areas, hi-tech or ecological ones,  and will serve as examples for farmers elsewhere.    Experts say that the move, together with a package of other  agriculture-related steps this year by the government, such as  the raising of grain and cotton prices, will make grain and  cotton production much more profitable for farmers, particularly  in the leading grain and cotton producing areas.    Analysts believe that all these moves will boost grain and  cotton production and increase farmers' incomes.</p>

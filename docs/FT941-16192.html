			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Italian car sales plummet 20% Italian car sales slumped a record 20 per cent last year and the market is unlikely to see any significant pick up in 1994, the industry association, Anfia, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Turin. New car registrations in Italy, the world's fourth largest car market, dropped to 1.89m in 1993, down from 2.37m the year before. It was the first time since 1988 that deliveries failed to reach 2m cars and exceeded the previous sharpest decline in sales, seen in 1975, when registrations dropped by 17.9 per cent.</p>

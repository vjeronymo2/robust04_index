Lin Liyun, head of a Chinese congressional delegation, made  the commitment in her speech at the second general meeting of  the Asia- Pacific Parliamentary Forum which opened here today.    Lin, member of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress of China, said many Asia-Pacific countries  have proposed to set up an Asia-Pacific security mechanism which  fully demonstrates a cherished aspiration of various countries  to maintain peace, stability and security in the region.    However, she said, China holds that the establishment of any  security mechanism must be in line with the regional diversities  and complexities.    "Only such an initiative proceeds from the actual conditions  and special characteristics in this region, can it enjoy the  support by the most of the countries," she added.    The congresswoman said China will "continue bilaterally and  regionally multi-tier, multi-channel and multi-form  consultations and discussions with the parties concerned on this  issue."    As for the economic development, Lin said the rapid growth  momentum of Asia and the Pacific region had not been strangled  by the dramatic changes of the world's political pattern.    With the sustained economic growth for many years, the  average increase this year for the whole region is still  estimated above 7 percent, much higher than the projections for  the rest of the world.    Lin said the rapid development of different kinds of  economic  cooperations would enhance the stability in the region and lay a  solid foundation to a comparative stability in the whole Asia-  Pacific region.    While recognizing that peace, stability and economic  development will remain a main stream of Asia and the Pacific,  Lin warned against the continued existence of unstable factors  in the region such as hegemonism, power politics and wilful  interference in others' internal affairs.    "It is imperative that all the countries concerned shall  make  arduous efforts to maintain comparative stability and preserve  high- speed economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region in the  1990s and even in the next century," she stressed.</p>

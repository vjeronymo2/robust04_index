			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: Chip off the old (Doric) block CAESAREA is the only golf club in the world where Roman relics and ancient obelisks are deemed an integral part of the course. Whereas other golf courses have deep gorse, heather and lakes to gobble up your shots, Israel's first - and, so far, only - golf course has strategically placed and immovable Doric columns. Get behind one of them and you will have to chip sideways. There is no sidestepping history in Israel. Two miles from the Mediterranean, on the coast road between Tel Aviv and Haifa, Caesarea is an unusual and relaxing starting point if you intend driving into the 2nd century. Self-drive holidays like the ones excellently organised by Twicker's World, which will organise all your accommodation en route, are becoming increasingly popular. When Palestine was under British rule there was a Sodom and Gomorrah golf club near the Dead Sea. Opened in 1961, Caesarea was built by an Englishman, Fred Smith of Carter Seeds, and funded by the Rothschild family. The course is a demanding par 73, and clubs are available for hire. The best places to stay are at the Dan Caesarea or, nearer to Tel Avi, the luxurious Daniel Tower hotel in Herzylea. Two other golf courses are planned in Ashkolen and Eilat, both to be designed by Gary Player. Israel is perhaps the only country where you are actively encouraged to pick-up hitchhikers with guns. Israeli soldiers thumb lifts everywhere. This can be useful, for you have to take advice about where to go in Israel and how to get there. The standard of driving is what you might expect: it shows great faith. Israeli lorry drivers, especially, are not frightened by death. Drive in the Holy Land, therefore, like you would in Naples or Marseilles. It is not as bad as Portugal: people actually drive with their eyes open. Avis provides a Fiat Uno for Dollars 37 a day (unlimited mileage). Truck stops offering basic meals prive the best-value lunches. Take into account the three sabbaths - Friday (Moslem), Saturday (Jewish) and Sunday (Christian) when planning your itinerary. The Kibbutz Hotel chain of Israel offers excellent four-star B &amp; B and farmhouse accommodation all over Israel for around Dollars 45 per single room per night. In turn, the Kibbutz hotel at Nof Ginosar, on the edge of the Sea of Galilee, offers a memorable breakfast buffet. The Galilee region in the north of Israel is the perfect place to savour spiritual tranquility and recover from the tackiness of some of the country's other sacred sites. People who visit Israel - more than 1m - are divided into those who experience an overwhelming sense of religious significance and those who experience overwhelming disappointment. Naturally, you have to visit the over-commercialised and squalid little town of Bethlehem. Unfortunately it is not a particularly moving experience when you share the little crypt in the Basilica of the Nativity with about 300 other people, and there is not much sanctity on offer when you have to endure a fairly explicit body search trying to enter the town. Twickers World is at 22 Church Street, Twickenham, Middlesex TW1 3NW. Tel: 081-892-7606.</p>

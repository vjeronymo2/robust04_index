			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ERROR-PRONE WEST PICKED CLEAN BY EAST IN SOFTBALL  </P> <P> How much fun are seven errors and an 8-3 loss?  </P> <P> That was the question of the day Saturday at Cal State Northridge, where the  East squad, aided by six West errors, scored two earned runs en route to a  lopsided victory in the Daily News all-star softball game.  </P> <P> While the West dismissed the game as a meaningless, rollicking outing, East  Coach Al Weil thought that excuse was as poor as some of the plays in the  field.  </P> <P> "Sure, you play to have fun," the coach said, "but if you're not going to play  to win, why play?"  </P> <P> Kym Weil, who plays for her father at Hart High, struck out the first five  batters she faced and had a perfect game when she was taken out after four  innings.  </P> <P> The right-hander, who was 26-3 with an 0.33 earned-run average this season,  returned in the eighth to pitch another perfect inning. Weil, the game's most  valuable player, then gave up five singles and two earned runs in the final  inning.  </P> <P> She finished with 12 strikeouts in six innings.  </P> <P> "Everyone feels that the City and (Southern) sections are the same, but they're  totally different," the Southern Section 4-A Division co-Player of the Year  said. "There's a lot more talent in the (Southern) Section. It's a lot harder  to win the (Southern Section) title than it is the City."  </P> <P> Most of the victorious East players are from Southern Section teams, and most  of the West players represented City schools.  </P> <P> While Weil was using her rising fastball to strike out nine in the first four  innings, throwing only 42 pitches, her teammates staked her to a 3-0 lead  behind one infield single -- one of two hits surrendered by El Camino Real  pitcher Chrissy Peck in five innings.  </P> <P> The decisive run scored in the bottom of the sixth when Brandy Rico of Saugus  hit a two-run double to center field off Chatsworth pitcher Kathy Regan. Those  were the East's only earned runs.  </P> <P> "You can't think of reasons for errors," West Coach Neils Ludlow of El Camino  Real said. "We made a lot of mistakes that we normally wouldn't make. But the  main things are that everybody got a chance to play and that the girls had fun.  Not the outcome."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 12 -- "We are creating a party to defend  future Russia and its dignity, turn it into a country of free  and well-off people, "said leader of the "Russia's Choice" Yegor  Gaydar, as he outlined the tasks of the party, addressing its  founding congress today. The congress, which will continue for  two days, is being held in the Russian parliamentary center.    Gaydar pointed out that one of the main tasks of the new  party is to bring the truth home to the people and oppose  demagogy and lies advocated by political adversaries. "We need  a strong political organization, and therefore, we are creating  a party," Gaydar said.    The pointed out that the fundamental task of the party is to  create prerequisites for stable economic development. In his  opinion, the economic course which has been pursued in Russia  over the past 1.5 years is a course of compromise and  fluctuations, which is, in fact, a departure from the solution  of existing problems. "It is dangerous to repudiate a challenge,  since this creates an instable environment which is a nourishing  media for extremists' experiments, Gaydar said. If this  tendency continues for another 3-5 years, the country will find  itself under a colonial rule, Gaydar said.    Among cardinal tasks needed for Russia's normal development  Gaydar mentioned defense policies and problems of security. He  pointed out the importance "of conducting a consistent and  steadfast military reform, which fully meets servicemen's  interests". In his opinion, the existing army is "a too heavy  burden for Russia and it needs reorganization." Gaydar said  that it is necessary to reduce the number of the army personnel,  saying that this does not mean any disrespect towards the army.    Another "colossal problem" faced by Russia is an enormous  and  inefficient state mechanism and an unnecessary large "army of  officials," Gaydar said. In his opinion, one of the most  important problems is the agrarian reform which has been  practically frozen today. Gaydar pointed out that the agrarian  reform should enter a new stage and that attempts to maintain  the collapsing system of collective and state farms should be  rejected.    Touching upon foreign policy problems, Gaydar said that  relations with "near abroad" are the most important task. He  pointed out that "it is necessary to work steadfastly for the  creation of a single market on the territory of the former  Soviet Union and the creation of the customs and currency  unions. However, advocating the comprehensive development of  integration on the territory of the former Soviet Union and the  defense of the Russian-speaking population, Gaydar categorically  came out against political scheming and the solution of other  problems at the expense of Russian taxpayers.</p>

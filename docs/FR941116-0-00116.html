Additionally, participants agreed that (1) in the case of target price participation, the total of the premium subsidies received under the options program and the deficiency payments received under the annual acreage reduction programs will not exceed $50,000 per person; and (2) in the case of price support participation, the total of premium subsidies received under the option program and loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains and ``Findley'' deficiency payments received under such price support programs will not exceed $75,000 per person. A ``person'' will be determined in the same manner as a ``person'' is determined for payment limitation purposes for such annual programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Incentive Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Incentive payments made under either participation level are not subject to any payment limit, except to the extent that the total number of bushels any one producer may enroll in the options program is limited to 50,000 bushels for corn and 15,000 bushels for wheat and soybeans. In the event that CCC made disaster assistance available with respect to the 1993 crops of wheat, corn, or soybeans to producers participating in the options program at the target price level, such producers must refund any premium subsidies and incentive payments received on any enrolled commodities in order to receive disaster assistance from CCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CCC will be operating a similar program in 1994, with the following changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1413.13&blank;Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The number of States and counties participating in the options program has been increased.

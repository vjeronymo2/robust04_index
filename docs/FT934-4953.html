			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: USX agrees to pay LTV Dollars 375m LTV, the US steelmaker which emerged from bankruptcy protection this summer, is to receive Dollars 375m from rival steel group USX in settlement of a long-running lawsuit. The money will be used to reduce LTV's massive pension fund deficit, which has been put at over Dollars 2bn. The payment follows allegations of anti-trust activities against Bessemer and Lake Eerie Railroad, formerly a subsidiary of USX and now owned by Transtar, in which USX holds 45 per cent. The railway company was charged with monopolising the dock handling and inland transportation of iron ore from Lake Eerie ports from the mid-1950s to the early 1908s, USX said. USX said its potential liability had been as much as Dollars 500m, and that it continued to appeal judgments of Dollars 210m made in favour of other companies. LTV's pension fund deficit has been put at Dollars 2.1bn by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, making it the third largest in the US, behind General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. Assets in the fund before the Dollars 375m contribution announced yesterday were sufficient to cover only 38 per cent of the company's pension liabilities. The payment, which has been agreed in principle by both companies but has yet to be finalised, will be made in two instalments, one later this month and the other by the end of February.</p>

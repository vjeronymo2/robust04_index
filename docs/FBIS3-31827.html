			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nis, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- The signing of the peace  agreement between the Srpska republic and the autonomous  province of western Bosnia was a result of the situation where  both peoples needed peace rather than war, Momcilo Krajisnik,  the Srpska parliament speaker told Nis radio "Radio about  politics" program.    "We have nothing against the other people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is the Croats, organizing themselves  the way they find best," Krajisnik said.    Commenting on the establishment of a Confederation of  Muslims  and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said such a  confederation was not an expression of the will of the Muslim  and Croat people in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a result  of great pressure by the mentors who are helping the Muslims and  the Croats.    "The [mentors] objective is to prevent the formation of a  Muslim state and to prevent the area, which is under the  influence of the western powers, from becoming split and from  falling under somebody else's influence in the near future,"  Krajisnik said.    "The Muslims are much more closely linked with the Serbs  [than with the Croats], and perhaps they would opt for an  association with Serbia," Krajisnik said, adding that this was  obviously against the interests of certain strong forces in the  West, which use the United Nations to achieve their objectives.    Referring to the demands for the opening of Tuzla airport  Krajisnik said: "We will be cooperative and we will make maximum  concessions, but only up to a limit that does not threaten the  interests of the Serb people."    "We have achieved our objective in Sarajevo, although the  Muslim side had set a trap for us. They wanted to disarm us and  win in that way. Instead of bombing the Serbs they have now got  the Russians in -- this is a joke now circulating both among our  soldiers and among the Muslims," Krajisnik said in "Radio about  Politics" program.</p>

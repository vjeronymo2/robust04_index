			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 12 (AFP) -- Ukraine agreed Tuesday  [12 April] to pay its huge debt for gas deliveries with cash  payments and by offering Russia part ownership of pipelines and  other facilities on its territory, officials said here.    The head of the Russia's giant Gazprom company, Rem  Vyakhirev, said following talks here with an Ukrainian  delegation that Kiev would pay 600 million dollars by June.    Ukrainian Deputy Premier Valentin Landik said that Kiev  would  privatise gas pipelines, port facilities in Odessa and other  installations to allow Gazprom to buy stock in the  newly-privatised companies.    Details of the plan have yet to be hammered out and the two  sides agreed to establish working groups to determine how the  shared ownership would be implemented.    "I guarantee deliveries for the summer," Vyakhirev said,  adding: "We'll have to wait and see what happens for this  winter."    Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over payment for gas  deliveries, and the dispute forced Moscow to drastically cut the  gas flow to Ukraine in March.    Gazprom has maintained that part ownership of the pipelines  would allow it to better control deliveries to its European  clients including France, Italy and Germany.</p>

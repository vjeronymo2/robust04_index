			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Tension foreseen on Dublin link Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, will today underline his party's opposition to joint authority between London and Dublin over Northern Ireland's affairs. He will use a speech in Larne to say joint authority would be 'a recipe for increased instability and tension' and that the UUP is 'not prepared to tolerate the establishment of the structures for the severance of the union which joint authority would impose'. In negotiations with Dublin, Britain is understood to have rejected any suggestion that new north/south institutions could imply joint authority over the province. It is prepared, however, to sanction cross-border executive boards to oversee a common approach in some areas. Whitehall officials are optimistic that the UUP will not reject such boards out of hand. Their powers would be decided in consultation with the constitutional parties. Mr Molyneaux will say that his party wants the articles in the Irish constitution enshrining Dublin's territorial claim over Ulster to be removed  -'but not if it means selling the horse to buy a saddle'. He will praise Mr Major as 'a prime minister who, more than any other since the late 1960s, is prepared to listen to the parties and to act on their advice.'</p>

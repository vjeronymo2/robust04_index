			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): A question of timing for interest rate hopes HOPES of a further interest rate cut from the Bundesbank this week were behind yesterday's European gains, writes Our Markets Staff. However, Mr Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, described the interest rate prospect as a 'red herring'. The Bundesbank might well cut rates this week, he said, but the cut would have to be one of 100 basis points to underpin, for example, the French franc. Morgan Stanley is overweight in Europe, likes it a lot on the triple prospect of a stronger dollar, lower interest rates and, it hopes, resumed growth in 1994. But its time horizon is over twelve months, not four days. FRANKFURT saw a four-year low in bond yields and the DAX index, 16.60 higher at 1,700.95, at its highest level since last July 17. Turnover eased from DM7.9bn to DM7.5bn. The Bundesbank's average bond yield fell another 7 basis points to 6.44 per cent but, as with equities, investors were beginning to see the market as a little overbought by the afternoon, when German inflation figures came in a little worse than expected. In equities, banks moved up strongly on the interest rate speculation, the critically acclaimed Commerzbank and Dresdner putting on DM6.50 to DM289.50, DM8.30 to DM404.80 respectively. Carmakers and their component suppliers were more mixed, above average gains for Daimler and BMW being offset by a DM4.10 fall to DM274 for Volkswagen after a German weekly reported that VW could incur a first quarter operating loss of more than DM1bn. PARIS broke the 2,000 barrier during the day on futures-led activity and strong foreign demand, especially from the US. However, some late profit-taking saw the CAC-40 index lose a little of its strength, closing 15.09 higher at 1,998.80 in turnover of some FFr3.7bn. Construction and finance stocks were encouraged by the prospect of lower European interest rates with Bouygues gaining FFr20 to FFr658, SocGen FFr5 to FFr650, Suez FFr6.40 to FFr302.90, also ahead of tomorrow's results, and Axa FFr22 to FFr1,200. With further warnings about a decline in European car sales Peugeot lost FFr1 to FFr638 and Michelin eased FFr4.90 to FFr186.20. MILAN returned to insurers, which had closed strongly last week, on expectations that a cabinet meeting later in the day would approve plans for the introduction of private pension funds. Some observers believe that if the funds are created, possibly by the third quarter, the fresh inflow of funds into the equity market could amount to as much as L4,000bn. The Comit index closed up 17.98 at 531.19. Generali led the way with a rise of L2,190 to L37,000 while Alleanza moved ahead L550 to L16,662. Elsewhere, Fiat maintained its impetus with a gain of L160 to L6,000, and L6,060 on the kerb. Foreign interest in telecommunications was also seen with Stet fixing L146 higher at L2,399 and L2,405 after hours and Sip up L54 at L1,778. ZURICH, too, featured financials on interest rate speculation, with insurers in the lead. The SMI index closed 21.1 higher at 2,120.5 with Winterthur bearers SFr70 better at SFr3,360 and Swiss Re certificates SFr14 higher at SFr604. AMSTERDAM was flat, the CBS Tendency index closing at 99.9; but among the actives Unilever built on last week's solid gains following the release of a positive earnings statement, adding another Fl 3.20 to Fl 211.70. Heineken, which issues 1992 results on Thursday, was another gainer, up to a record high during the session of Fl 188.50 before slipping back to finish up Fl 1.90 at Fl 187.60. MADRID extended Friday's gains, banks leading with gains of 2 to 3 per cent in several, and the general index putting on another 3.77 to 236.66 in brisk turnover of Pta17.35bn, down from Pta5bn previously. The run of corporate results continued, with no shocks as yet to brake the market. STOCKHOLM lost some its early gains on late profit-taking but the Affarsvarlden general index still managed a gain of 18.00 points to close at 1,018.10. Turnover was high at SKr873m after Friday's SKr807m. Astra continued to recover some of last week's losses with a SKr7 rise in the B shares to SKr692. In the banking sector, Handeslbanken advanced another SKr3 to SKr72. VIENNA finished at its highest close since last July with a rise in the ATX index of 20.21, or 2.4 per cent to 857.33. The construction sector led the day's rally with Universale up Sch59, or 6.6 per cent at Sch949. COPENHAGEN was pushed lower by reports that Carlsberg might be overvalued, and by losses at Unidanmark. The brewer's B shares fell DKr12.55 to DKr266 while Denmark's second largest bank group rallied to close unchanged at DKr135 after DKr132. The KFX index closed 0.69 lower at 81.48. ISTANBUL fell 4.6 per cent as overnight and short term bond rates reflected the banks' need to meet some TL16,000bn in treasury bill auction payments on Wednesday. The market index was 273.52 lower at a provisional 5,650.09, taking its losses to 7.25 per cent since last Wednesday's record high.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 1                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1161.81     1161.26    1161.47    1160.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1214.41     1214.75    1215.03    1214.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1161.09     1161.06    1159.02    1158.20 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1215.91     1215.79    1212.13    1213.57  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 26    Feb 25    Feb 24    Feb 23    Feb 22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1139.80   1125.06   1116.05   1119.41   1132.76 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1194.07   1178.13   1172.14   1178.69   1190.84  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1162.89; 200 - 1217.16 Low/day: 100 - 1157.66 200 - 1211.60.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

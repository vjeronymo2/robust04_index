			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY PUTS ANOTHER 59 S&amp;LS ON BLOCK  </P> <P> Federal regulators hung out "for sale" signs Wednesday on 59 more failed  thrifts, including four in Southern California.  </P> <P> The four are First Network Federal Savings Bank and Westwood Savings, both in  Los Angeles; Western Empire Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Yorba Linda, and  Investment Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> The aggregate amount of deposits held by the latest batch of thrifts for sale  is $8.2 billion, though none of them has more than $500 million in deposits.  </P> <P> A week earlier, regulators put 14 large institutions with combined assets of  $39.8 billion on the block. Those thrifts included Mercury Savings &amp; Loan  in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> By the end of this week, the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency  managing and selling failed thrifts, hopes to sell three more failed  institutions. If it does so, it will reach its goal of 141 sales for the third  quarter of the government's fiscal year, which will end Saturday, said Kate  Spears, an agency spokeswoman. Since it was created last August, RTC has sold  190 failed thrifts with total assets of $50.7 billion, she said.  </P> <P> One other California S&amp;L is among the thrifts put up for sale Wednesday. It  is Westport Federal Savings in Hanford, Kings County.  </P> <P> Western Empire, which now has total deposits of $317.8 million, was a failing  thrift that was rescued from the regulatory death knell in late 1988 when the  New York investment firm of Castle Harlan Inc. bought it without federal  assistance and based its revival on trading in high-risk, high-yield corporate  securities known as junk bonds.  </P> <P> Last August, Congress ruled that thrifts would have to divest their junk bonds  within five years as part of its massive thrift industry restructuring law. The  junk bond market fell, sinking Western Empire. Regulators seized the thrift  Feb. 16.  </P> <P> First Network, which now has $412.6 million in deposits, was seized April 20.  Regulators promptly asked the FBI to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing  at the thrift. The S&amp;L was headed by Carl M. Rheuban, a Westside  businessman with close ties to Democratic politicians.  </P> <P> Westwood Savings, which has been in the hands of federal regulators for more  than a year, was seized Feb. 17, 1989. The thrift now has $357 million in  deposits.  </P></p>

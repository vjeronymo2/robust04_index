			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Barbican triumphs for Rattle and Uchida At the Barbican on Saturday, Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony enjoyed another of their resounding triumphs. The piece de resistance was Szymanowski's Violin Concerto no. 1, with Thomas Zehetmair as a superb soloist, but the other performances on offer were anything but mere fill-ups. In particular Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, nowadays a familiar war-horse, galloped into newly vital life. Rattle had ensured maximum horsepower for it: twelve cellos, for example] - which paid sonorous dividends in the crucial low-string recitatives. His own imaginative wrestling with Bartok's score secured prizes beyond the merely aural. I should reckon Rattle's account of Mozart Symphony no. 39 as carrying roughly 2 1/2 times the communicative power of Previn's performance with the LSO a week earlier. That was 'respectful'; by contrast Rattle and the CBSO were lithe and constantly alert, every movement stamped with muscular character. As for the Szymanowski concerto, Zehetmair and Rattle gave it the rapturous shove it deserves toward the permanent repertoire. Some years back, William Mann described it as the most sheerly beautiful music ever written. In a performance like this, it seems just about that: not only because Szymanowski's opulent orchestra is so exquisitely balanced against the soloist's exacerbated lyricism, but because the score is so cogently knit around its hyper-poignant harmonic nodes. Zehetmair was cagey about those. With the recurring 'motto' theme - a descending five-note phrase which takes a heart-stabbing upward wrench toward its sixth note - he played mock-innocent: no freighting of the final note, which he left the orchestra to colour. Otherwise he sang out with thrilling confidence, eloquent in the high ledger-lines and commanding in throaty, rough-bowed passages at the lower extreme, appealingly frail in pianissimo confessions. Under Rattle the orchestra matched him, though in a bright-eyed, hard-edged focus that lost the ultimate degree of heady suggestiveness. We ought to be seduced, not rampantly overwhelmed. Yet Rattle remains our leading advocate of Szymanowski's cause - for he gives the music full value as music, and not just as a musical equivalent of nitrous oxide.                            *      *      * The Barbican Hall remains an unfriendly place in which to hear pianists, diffuse and hard to focus, but Mitsuko Uchida's recital there on Sunday afternoon was an unqualified delight. There are few contemporary pianists whose encounters with untried works are so eagerly awaited as hers; every item she adds to her programmes becomes a voyage of discovery which carries its own invitation. On this occasion the unknown territory was the expanses of Schubert's G major Sonata; Uchida's performance, complete with exposition repeat, was the focus of the second half of her recital. It was unfolded as a sequence of beautifully fashioned panels. The first movement, taken at a very broad moderato (though with nothing like the slowness of Richter's famous performance), emerged with perfect naturalness, the Andante stirred into fierce life for its central section, the minuet enclosed a trio of musical-box delicacy; each reprise of the final rondo offered a different perspective, a change of lighting and emphasis. Immediately before the Schubert Uchida had played Webern's Variations Op. 27, gradually building the tension until she could diffuse it all magically in the coda, and after it offered as an encore another perfectly chiselled miniature, the second of Schoenberg's Op. 19 set. The first half of the recital had been devoted to Beethoven and Schumann - the E minor Sonata Op 90, launched with tremendous elan and carried along in a series of bold imaginative sweeps, and +Carnaval+ conceived, it appeared, as a single seamless span that scarcely paused for reflection. On this kind of form Uchida is the most irresistible Schumann player imaginable, every musical image burnished bright and laced through with the most intense threads of lyricism.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLUME OF CRIME ALLOWS MANY SUSPECTS TO GO FREE;  </P> <P> LAW: POLICE BLAME D.A. FOR NOT PRESSING CHARGES. PROSECUTORS CITE POOR POLICE  WORK, CROWDED COURTS.  </P> <P> Last year, four in every 10 adult suspects arrested by the Los Angeles Police  Department for the most serious crimes had either felony or misdemeanor charges  filed against them.  </P> <P> A decade ago, the filing rate was double that, department records show.  </P> <P> Discretion exercised by prosecutors, The Times found, is a major factor.  </P> <P> Certain felonies that once were tickets to state prison today are rejected for  prosecution by the district attorney's office. They are sent instead to the  city attorney as possible misdemeanor filings -- for which the guilty usually  serve no more than a few weeks in jail.  </P> <P> Similarly, the city attorney's office has become more selective, pursuing with  less vigor many minor violations of the law -- from bounced checks to the theft  of video rental movies.  </P> <P> With the number of arrests on the rise, many prosecutors say they must exercise  greater discretion when choosing which criminal cases to file in court and  which to discount or dismiss altogether.  </P> <P> The bottom line, court and police records show, is a boon for many who break  the law.  </P> <P> In 1970, 30% of all adult suspects arrested in Los Angeles for so-called Part I  crimes -- homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and  vehicle theft -- had felony charges filed against them. By 1980, the rate  dropped to 21%. By 1989, it was 17%.  </P> <P> The percentage of misdemeanor charges resulting from Part I arrests has  declined even more dramatically -- from 60% in 1980 to 23% in 1989, Police  Department records show.  </P> <P> Neither Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner nor City Atty. James K. Hahn could explain the  declines.  </P> <P> Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, meanwhile, said he was "perplexed and disturbed"  after being shown computer-generated charts prepared by The Times, based on  annual Police Department statistics, demonstrating the decline.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize the data had changed that much," Gates said. "That's a real  indicator to me that either we're not doing the job in providing good arrests  or good investigators, or we're not getting the attention from the prosecutors  that we should be getting. . . . "  </P> <P> Gates has ordered an internal inquiry.  </P> <P> A Police Department statistician last week theorized that a 1986 change in the  department's methods of tabulating arrest data may be skewing the filing rates.  A police spokesman said that percentages also may have been affected by a 1986  law requiring officers to make arrests in domestic violence situations, even  when prosecution is unlikely.  </P> <P> Several deputy district attorneys, however, said that if anyone or anything is  to blame for the decline in criminal filing rates, it may be the police  themselves.  </P> <P> With arrests increasing, the quality of many Police Department investigations  has declined, prosecutors said, leaving them little choice but to reject  outright or try to settle by plea bargain a growing number of cases that cannot  be won in court.  </P> <P> Last year, the district attorney's office filed a case in which a convicted  robber on parole, Orlando Hawkins, was accused of aiming a shotgun at a retired  Los Angeles police officer and his son, then robbing them of their sports car.  When the case was assigned to Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Latin, he said he soon  discovered that the investigation was "kind of screwed up."  </P> <P> Latin said the police had shown the victims a photographic lineup of six  suspects known as a "six pack." Both victims picked Hawkins. The photo of  Hawkins' head, however, "was three times as big as everybody else's," according  to the prosecutor.  </P> <P> As other weaknesses in the case became apparent, Latin said, he tried to avoid  a trial by offering Hawkins progressively lower prison terms. The initial offer  was 28 years in prison, according to Hawkins' lawyer, Richard Millard. Latin's  last offer would have required Hawkins to do about a year in custody.  </P> <P> Hawkins rejected each offer, insisting he was innocent. The case eventually  went before a jury, and he was found not guilty.  </P> <P> "The detective in that case was horrible," Latin said. "He left town (on  vacation) with a bunch of unanswered questions, went to some lake somewhere  with no telephone, and just kind of left everything hanging."  </P> <P> The detective assigned to the case, Jerry Anslow, disputed Latin's assertion.  </P> <P> "That's bull crap," said Anslow, a 29-year police veteran. "I've never been  inaccessible for any case. I've (cut short) vacations because of cases."  </P> <P> Anslow acknowledged that the mug shot he used of Hawkins was larger than other  photographs shown to the victims. The photo, which was the only one available,  came from another police agency whose mug shots "were a little bigger than  ours," Hawkins said.  </P> <P> "These D. A.s are just looking for ways to get out from under the tremendous  amount of work they have," Anslow said. "There's no preparation for  three-quarters of the cases because they have too many cases."  </P> <P> Other detectives bristle at assertions that they have slacked off.  </P> <P> "Prosecutorial discretion is the biggest problem in the system today," snapped  Detective Zvonko G. (Bill) Pavelic of Southwest station. "They will only file  cases that my 10-year-old son could successfully prosecute."  </P> <P> In May, Pavelic investigated a case in which two 13-year-old girls walking to  the Crenshaw Mall accepted a ride from three men in a passing car. The girls  were driven to an apartment, ordered to strip and robbed of their jewelry,  police said. One of the girls was raped by one of the men. The other was  ordered to perform fellatio but fled the apartment.  </P> <P> Both girls were later able to identify all three suspects. When officers  searched the apartment, they found jewelry belonging to the girls.  </P> <P> Pavelic interviewed one of the suspects, Travis Lane, 20, who admitted that he  had sex with the 13-year-old, but said it was consensual.  </P> <P> When the case was submitted to the district attorney's sex crimes unit for  prosecution, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lydia C. Bodin declined to file charges,  records show. On her "charge evaluation work sheet" Bodin wrote that the  13-year-old alleged victim ". . . appears to be 20 yrs. old. Both victim and  witness appear to be lying. I now have four versions of this case."  </P> <P> Pavelic, however, said there were no inconsistencies when he interviewed both  victim and witness.  </P> <P> "There is no question in my mind this girl was raped," Pavelic said. "And what  difference does it make how old somebody looks? She's a 13-year-old girl!"  </P> <P> Even though Lane admitted to having sex with a minor, which in itself is a  felony, the prosecutor told The Times that she decided not to file charges  because of inconsistencies in the case.  </P> <P> The alleged victim, Bodin said, "laughed during the course of the interview. I  see victims come in here with nervous laughter, but this was problematic. . . .  I can't file charges if I don't have a clear idea what happened."  </P> <P> Weeks later, other Southwest station detectives presented Bodin with another  case in which a 14-year-old girl had been raped at gunpoint before Pavelic's  investigation. The victim in the second case also identified her assailant as  Travis Lane.  </P> <P> This time, Bodin filed rape charges against Lane -- not only in the case of the  14-year-old, but in the matter of the 13-year-old girl whose case she had  rejected earlier.  </P> <P> Lane in September agreed to plead guilty to the charge of lewd and lascivious  acts with a child under the age of 14 and received a maximum 8-year prison  term.  </P> <P> Why did Bodin wait until she reviewed the second rape to file charges against  Lane? With the second rape, Bodin said, she was able to establish a pattern of  behavior that strengthened both cases.  </P> <P> Bodin said her decision to reject Pavelic's rape case had nothing to do with  the fact that she was handling more than a dozen others at the time. "It has to  do with the quantum and quality of the evidence," she said.  </P> <P> Pavelic is hardly convinced. The district attorney's office, he said,  increasingly finds excuses to reject sex crime cases outright or refer them to  the city attorney's office for possible filing as misdemeanor sexual battery.  </P> <P> Police Department records show that 44% of suspects arrested 10 years ago for  rape were charged with that crime or other felonies. By last year, the filing  rate had dropped to 28%.  </P> <P> "Nobody," said Pavelic, "cares about victims anymore."  </P> <P> Bodin disputed the detective's assertion.  </P> <P> "Rape is a tremendously devastating crime," she said. "If we get a fileable  case, we file it."  </P> <P> On the 17th floor of the Criminal Courts Building outside the district  attorney's offices, Los Angeles police detectives sit in a waiting room,  flipping impatiently through home improvement magazines, talking shop or simply  staring at their shoes.  </P> <P> Like patients dreading their turn in the dentist's chair, some detectives  squirm as they wait for the next available deputy district attorney to consider  their cases.  </P> <P> It can sometimes be a long wait -- and a fruitless one.  </P> <P> Many detectives complain that these prosecutors, called "filing deputies," who  do nothing but review case files, are increasingly reluctant to file felony  charges against suspected criminals arrested by the Police Department.  </P> <P> Several months ago, waiting to have a $400,000 forgery case considered for  filing, Detective Tony Sanchez rolled his eyes when the D. A.'s receptionist  told him that Allen S. Tyson was the next available filing deputy. "Great,"  Sanchez muttered.  </P> <P> Tyson has such a reputation for turning down cases that some detectives have  dubbed him "Mr. Reject."  </P> <P> Inside his small office, Tyson was kicked back in his desk chair, talking on  the telephone to a friend. He did not bother glancing at Sanchez or a Times  reporter accompanying him that day. The detective opened his briefcase and  handed over five copies of his report, the number required by D. A. policy.  </P> <P> Without looking up, Tyson casually flipped through the paper work while  chatting on the phone about his girlfriend, his 11-year-old son and scuba  diving in the Caribbean.  </P> <P> Sanchez grew so frustrated with waiting that he left to smoke a cigarette.  Finally, after more than 15 minutes, Tyson hung up the phone, then looked up  and demanded, "How in the world could somebody issue four $100,000 cashier's  checks without asking for any ID?"  </P> <P> When informed that he was asking the question of a reporter and not a  detective, Tyson said, "Oh," and appeared to blanch.  </P> <P> Upon Sanchez's return, Tyson filed charges in the case.  </P> <P> Tyson, who said that he is proud to be known as "Mr. Reject," readily  acknowledged that he has "a tendency" to reject many cases that might be filed  by other deputy district attorneys.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in filing a case just because the cop thinks that the guy's  going to plead (guilty)," Tyson said. "If we can't make the case, I don't file  it. It means I'm doing my job, that I'm not a rubber stamp for the cops."  </P> <P> Many detectives say the district attorney's office today almost routinely  declines to file charges in so-called "one-on-one" cases -- where there is a  victim and a suspect but no evidence or witnesses to substantiate either side.  </P> <P> "We had one case," said Lt. Richard A. LeGarra at Northeast station. "Maid sees  a guy coming out of the house next door with a VCR. She jots down his license  plate. Police respond, check the plate. The guy's a burglar. The D. A. says  one-on-one -- no corroborating evidence, no fingerprints, (stolen) property is  not found. No case. So now the guy's back out on the streets.  </P> <P> "How do you explain that to a citizen?"  </P> <P> The explanation offered by prosecutors is that crimes without evidence or  corroborating witnesses can be extremely difficult to prove in court. Why waste  time with a weak case, they say, when there are so many others where the  chances of securing a conviction are greater?  </P> <P> "We're going to file cases where we believe we can win it and where we have the  right guy," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman J. Shapiro, who supervises that  section of the D. A.'s office through which criminal cases are filed in court.  </P> <P> Officers complain that a suspect arrested today while driving a stolen  automobile in Los Angeles need only claim that he "borrowed" it from a stranger  to avoid felony vehicle theft charges. Invariably, they say, the district  attorney's office will reject the case and refer it to the city attorney's  office for possible filing as a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> Filed as a felony, vehicle theft is punishable by as many as three years in  state prison. As a misdemeanor, it is good for no more than a year in county  jail.  </P> <P> Shapiro denied that the district attorney's office routinely rejects car theft  cases. He acknowledged, however, that in some instances, cases are rejected  when it cannot be proved that a suspect took the car or drove it knowing it was  stolen.  </P> <P> Cases involving car break-ins, officers say, are given even less attention by  prosecutors.  </P> <P> Officers assigned to the Police Department's K-9 unit tell of an August, 1989,  incident in which they arrested a suspect caught burglarizing a vehicle in a  West Los Angeles towing yard.  </P> <P> When officers checked records, they discovered that the suspect, Alejandro  Chavez, had been arrested three weeks before in the same lot for the very same  crime but that the district attorney's office had declined to file charges for  unspecified reasons.  </P> <P> "The D. A.'s office should be commended for their total lack of integrity or  job performance," Officer Larry Mallet wrote in a report after the arrest.  "Their inability to exercise their responsibilities has become nothing less  than a joke."  </P> <P> Even after the second break-in, there are no court records indicating that the  district attorney filed charges against Chavez.  </P> <P> A person who steals anything worth more than $400 in California can be charged  with grand theft, a felony that carries a maximum three-year prison term.  </P> <P> But in Los Angeles, officials in the district attorney's office say they have  neither the time nor the attorneys to pursue grand theft cases unless the item  that has been stolen is worth more than $1,000. Moreover, if it is a suspect's  first theft-related arrest, they say, the loss generally must exceed $2,000  before grand theft charges will be filed.  </P> <P> "If it's his first offense and it's a $4,000 loss," said R. J. Fox, a burglary  detective supervisor in the Rampart area, "I know it's going to go to the city  attorney as a misdemeanor."  </P> <P> California law also allows those who have been previously convicted of theft to  be charged with "petty theft with a prior," a felony that carries a maximum  three years in prison.  </P> <P> The district attorney, however, generally will not file those cases, referring  them instead to the city attorney, according to Shapiro of the D. A.'s office.  </P> <P> "Twenty years ago, if somebody committed a $500-to-$1,000 theft, they would  have likely gone to prison," he said. "There are felonies that citizens  probably think should be treated as felonies that we don't deal with anymore.  What can I say? It's not like the D. A. can do any more than we're already  doing."  </P> <P> In the last 10 years, the district attorney's caseload has more than doubled.  Last year, more than 51,000 felony cases were filed in Superior Court.  </P> <P> Police officers have become so familiar with what felonies the district  attorney will and will not not accept, that they routinely "bypass" the D. A.'s  office, submitting to the city attorney hundreds of cases each week that are  then prosecuted as misdemeanors in Municipal Court.  </P> <P> "We are," said Deputy City Atty. Jacquelyn R. Mason, "a trash can for the D.A."  </P> <P> Of 173,327 misdemeanors prosecuted by the city attorney's office in fiscal  1988-89, 38,976 began as felony arrests referred by the district attorney or  the Police Department. Many of those cases included sexual assaults, robberies,  shooting into inhabited dwellings, vehicle thefts, narcotics violations and  burglaries.  </P> <P> "If your grandfather's watch is stolen, it should be treated as a felony," said  Assistant City Atty. Maureen R. Siegel, acting head of the city attorney's  central trials section. "But if it's stolen in Los Angeles, it'll probably be  filed as a misdemeanor. . . . The system is under a lot of pressure and has had  to adjust."  </P> <P> Misdemeanors generally are punishable by no more than a year in county jail.  </P> <P> City Atty. Hahn, however, pointed out that it is often more worthwhile to  prosecute "wobblers" -- crimes that can be either felonies or misdemeanors --  in Municipal Court because judges there are inclined to take such cases more  seriously.  </P> <P> "A Superior Court judge may have just finished a death penalty case," Hahn  explained. "You bring him a wobbler and he's going to say, 'Hey, what's the big  deal?' He might give (the defendant) straight probation."  </P> <P> Like the district attorney, the city attorney's office has been hard pressed to  keep up with its yearly caseload, which has grown by more than 50% since 1980.  The number of city attorney prosecutors, meanwhile, stands at 347, about 30%  more than a decade ago.  </P> <P> "We're trying to lessen the number of cases that we are dealing with that are  no big deal in the scheme of things -- cases where nothing's going to happen to  the people even if we get a conviction . . . ," Hahn said. "We have to draw the  line somewhere. We only have so many attorneys."  </P> <P> Thus it is, Hahn said, that his office usually declines to prosecute accused  shoplifters unless the items that they are suspected of having stolen are worth  more than "$10 or $15."  </P> <P> In addition, if a person walks into a movie rental shop in Los Angeles today,  checks out an armful of videocassettes and never returns them, the city  attorney will not file misdemeanor theft charges unless the combined value of  the tapes exceeds $400.  </P> <P> "We used to play collections agency," said Assistant City Atty. Alice Hand, who  helps shape the office's filing practices, "but we don't have time anymore.  </P> <P> "When I started 11 years ago as a filing deputy, I would spend all my time  processing gamblers, beggars, drunk in public, blocking public sidewalks. Now,  we hardly ever prosecute for those crimes."  </P> <P> Instead, many suspects are issued citations and not taken into custody.  </P> <P> Moreover, Hand said, the city attorney's policy is that suspects convicted  today of nonviolent misdemeanors, ranging from car theft to trespass, are not  required to serve any jail time if they have posted bail or otherwise been  released from jail before sentencing.  </P> <P> "You probably aren't going to get them to plead guilty if you say, 'Come back  (to court) so we can put you back in jail,' " Hand said. "You have to have an  incentive to get them to come back and plead guilty."  </P> <P> People who write checks without sufficient funds in their bank accounts also  get a break today from the city attorney. Victims who have been defrauded must  first show that they have received at least two bad checks from the suspect,  and those checks must total $200 or more before the city attorney will file  charges, Hand said.  </P> <P> In addition, according to city attorney filing policy, the checks cannot be  more than a year old. The hitch, Hand and others say, is that after a victim  complains to the Police Department, a year or more can pass before fraud  detectives can get to the case and seek charges.  </P> <P> "We're being very selective in the cases we work because we just can't handle  them all," said Lt. Fred Reno, who commands 20 detectives assigned to the  Police Department's fraud section.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, I felt I had a sufficient number of people. Today, I don't. Our  problem is the same as everyone else. We need more people."  </P> <P> Many of the cases handled by Reno's investigators are filed by the district  attorney's major frauds unit, whose job is to ensure that sophisticated, white  collar criminals receive maximum prosecutorial attention. However, the district  attorney's unit has become more selective in which cases it will accept and, in  the process, has devalued many crimes.  </P> <P> Reno said that 10 years ago the D. A.'s special unit would take on a case if  the fraud involved $20,000 or more. Today, Reno said, the minimum is usually  $100,000.  </P> <P> Even when cases end up in criminal court, victims often achieve little  satisfaction in the end.  </P> <P> With prosecutors concerned about more serious offenses, suspects accused of  these so-called "paper crimes" often end up having to do little or no time in  custody, records show.  </P> <P> That was the bottom line in the case against James L. Dunson, the former  manager of five Popeye's Chicken restaurants, records show.  </P> <P> In February, 1989, Dunson began submitting the names of fictitious employees to  Mangen Enterprises, the company that owned the restaurants. The company issued  payroll checks, which Dunson then forged and deposited in his own bank account.  </P> <P> When owner Howard Mangen uncovered the fraud after five months, he said he  fired Dunson and called the Police Department. The response, Mangen said, was  not quite what he expected.  </P> <P> "It took them quite a while to get to it and then I had to do all their work  for them -- up to and including finding the guy," Mangen said. "There are more  important, more pressing problems -- the courts are crowded with bigger cases.  That's what I was told constantly."  </P> <P> Finally, in November, 1989, Dunson was arrested and charged with forgery and  grand theft, each charge punishable by a maximum three years' in prison. He was  released on bail.  </P> <P> Six months later, Dunson worked out a deal with the district attorney's office  and agreed to plead guilty. Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan placed Dunson  on probation and ordered him to pay back Mangen.  </P> <P> The only time Dunson would serve for his first felony conviction would be the  few hours he spent behind bars before posting bail the day of his arrest. For  soliciting a prostitute in 1982, a misdemeanor, Dunson got 14 days in jail,  probation records show.  </P> <P> "You have to look at the big picture," Tynan said of Dunson's most recent  sentence. "If you look at what's being tried . . . you understand why we really  can't waste a whole lot of time on these kinds of cases. We are so burdened  with serious crime that the smaller property crimes simply cannot be processed.  </P> <P> "The only way to make the system work is to negotiate pleas and give the  defendant something for his plea," the judge said. "Somebody's got to bite the  bullet."  </P> <P> As of Tuesday, Mangen had not received a dime in restitution from Dunson.  </P> <P> "The system is so bogus, it's ridiculous," Mangen said. "You're better off  being the criminal than the victim."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Likelihood of Charges Being Filed.  </P> <P> Homicide suspects arrested by Los Angeles police received fairly consistent  treatment over the years 1980-1989, but those suspected of other serious crimes  were increasingly likely to be released without being charged.  </P> <P> Rape: An equal number of suspects were charged with felonies as were released  at beginning of period, but by 1989, more than twice as many were released as  were charged with felonies. Misdemeanor filings dwindled, too.  </P> <P> Robbery: Releases increased in early 1980's as misdemeanor filings fell. After  1986, felony filings also fell and releases grew proportionately.  </P> <P> Vehicle theft: A slight trent toward increased felony filings during the period  is overshadowed by dramatic drop in misdemeanor filings and increase in  releases.  </P> <P> Homicide: About twice as many suspects were charged with felonies each year as  were released. AFter 1982, fewer were charged with misdemeanors instead of  felonies.  </P> <P> Assault: Misdemeanor filings plummeted beginning in 1984. Police officials say  the decline may be partially explained by a 1986 law requiring that officers  make arrests in domestic violence situations even when it is unlikely that any  criminal charges will be filed.  </P> <P> Burglary: Suspects could expect fairly consistent treatment until 1987 when  releases soared and misdemeanors plummeted while felony filings dropped  slightly.  </P> <P> Larceny: Misdemeanor filings were high throughout period, but decreased from  1986 with corresponding increase in releases.  </P> <P> Source: Los Angeles Police Dept.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Times Poll: Filing Charges  </P> <P> A majority of Los Angeles' police officers are finding it increasingly  difficult to get prosecutors to file charges in criminal cases, according to a  Los Angeles Times Poll.  </P> <P> Slightly more than half said they believe that prosecutors usually have good  reason to reject cases; more than one-in-three officers said prosecutors seldom  express valid reasons when declining to file charges.  </P> <P> Of police officers questioned, 54% said that it has become more difficult to  have prosecutors file charges, while 8% said it has become less difficult and  27% said there has been no change.  </P> <P> At the same time, only 6% of prosecutors surveyed said that increasing  workloads are forcing them to reject more criminal cases. But twice as many  said that they are more inclined today to plea bargain with accused criminals  so the cases can be disposed of faster than if the cases were taken to trial.  </P> <P> One in five prosecutors -- and the same proportion of public defenders --  acknowledged that with increasing caseloads they are taking less time preparing  cases.  </P> <P> Has it become more difficult or easier to have the District Attorney and City  Attorney accept cases for filing in court?

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALY, U.S. TO COOPERATE ON TETHERED SATELLITE PROJECT  </P> <P> Italian scientists unveiled plans Friday for the first satellite that will  connect by cable to a NASA space shuttle orbiting in the upper reaches of the  earth's atmosphere.  </P> <P> At a press conference held at the Italian Cultural Institute, Learco Saporito,  Italy's undersecretary for scientific research, and Luciano Guerriero,  president of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) outlined plans for launching the  world's first tethered satellite from a U.S. space shuttle in 1991.  </P> <P> "For the first time, this project will realize the concept of two objects  connected in space by a cable of more than 100 kilometers," Guerriero said.  </P> <P> Scientists believe that the dynamics of two moving bodies connected in space by  a thread could be used in future development of a space station, in propelling  future satellites, in generating electricity and in creating artificial  gravity.  </P> <P> On the first of two planned missions together, the shuttle will carry the  satellite into orbit aboard its payload. Once in orbit, the shuttle crew will  release the satellite connected by a 20-kilometer cable so that it will be  suspended above the shuttle.  </P> <P> Scientists will attempt to use the tension in the cable connecting the two  spacecraft to slingshot the satellite into a higher orbit.  </P> <P> With the cable, the shuttle crew will be able to retrieve the satellite once  the experiments are completed.  </P> <P> Because the upper reaches of the earth's atmosphere is filled with charged  particles, scientists said they also will attempt to generate electricity from  the motion of the connecting cable.  </P> <P> On the second mission, scientists will hang a satellite by a 100-kilometer  cable below the shuttle. By dangling a satellite, they say they will be able to  study conditions under which satellites would normally fall to earth.  </P> <P> "This is all theory. It must be tested," said Stefanos Santonico, one of 10  Italian astronaut candidates. One Italian astronaut will be chosen to fly with  six American astronauts on the shuttle and will help carry out the experiments.  </P> <P> An Italian firm, Aeritalia, and an American firm, Martin Marietta, are  cooperating in building the satellite and deployment device.  </P> <P> NASA has carried other foreign mission specialists in the past. In December,  1985, for example, Mexican astronaut Rudulfo Neri flew on the shuttle Atlantis  to help in the launch of the Mexican communications satellite Morelos B.  </P> <P> In 1974, Italian physicist Guiseppe Colombo first conceived of the idea of  using tethered satellites.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Helder Maquequene: "At Last Territorial </F> Integration Has Begun!"]    [Excerpt] Chimoio -- Machote is the first area under the  control of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] to be  integrated into the territorial administration, the only one in  Manica Province, as part of the administrative reunification of  the Mozambican territory. This took place last week when one of  the three Renamo advisers to the Manica provincial government  "delivered" the area to Sussundenga Administrator Antonio  Moulinho. Next week it will happen in the Dombe administrative  region, also in Sussundenga, a populous area of the district,  where corn is produced abundantly and where there are diverse  wildlife species.    Dombe has been under Renamo control since late 1990, when  its  men entered without considerable resistance and occupied its  capital. [passage omitted]</p>

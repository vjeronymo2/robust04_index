After the death of the surviving spouse, amounts withheld due to the surviving spouse's foreign residence and deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3330(b), and amounts not paid as a result of 38 U.S.C. 5308 (which bars payment of non-contractual veterans' benefits to aliens located in the territory of an enemy of the United States), may only be paid in accordance with the accrued-benefit provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5121. Those provisions require that an application have been filed within one year of the surviving spouse's death. They also limit benefits to those to which the surviving spouse was entitled at death based on existing ratings or decisions or on evidence in the file on the date of death and only authorize payment of benefits due and unpaid for a period not to exceed one year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective date: February 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> O.G.C.

As a practical matter, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5110(g) and 38 CFR 3.114(a) permitting payment of retroactive benefits for periods prior to the date of receipt of a claim under certain circumstances could not be applicable in determining the effective date of an award of service connection under &sect;3.313 because no one could have met all eligibility requirements for benefits under &sect;3.313 on its effective date of August 5, 1964. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective date: February 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> O.G.C.

Prior to March 10, 1976, did Diagnostic Code 5296 contain a system for rating skull loss under which single skull holes were rated exclusively by comparison to coin size and multiple skull holes were rated exclusively based on reference to a specified area in square inches? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. If so, what was the rationale for such a system and was it legally supportable? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Held <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Former Diagnostic Code 5296, as in effect prior to March 10, 1976, established a bifurcated system of assigning disability ratings for partial skull loss, under which ratings could be assigned either on the basis of the aggregate of two or more areas of skull loss or on the size of a single area of skull loss. Prior to the 1976 revision, this diagnostic code provided for assignment of a 50-percent rating where: (1) There were two or more areas of skull loss whose aggregate area exceeded 2 square inches, or (2) there was a single area of skull loss which was greater in size than a 50-cent piece. Similarly, the prior provisions of the diagnostic code provided a 30-percent rating where: (1) There were two or more areas of skull loss whose aggregate area exceeded 1 square inch, or (2) there was a single area of skull loss which was greater in size than a 25-cent piece. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

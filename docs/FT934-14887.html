			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Attwoods loses Pounds 91m on Mindis ATTWOODS, the waste manage-ment company where Laidlaw of Canada owns a 38 per cent stake, has sold Mindis, its US recycling business and made a Pounds 91m provision to cover the loss on disposal. The sale of the loss-making subsidiary is confirmation of the difficulties recycling companies have faced in the US and Europe in finding markets for recycled materials. The subsidiary is being sold for Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.4m) to a company in which Mindis's chief executive and chief operating officer - who sold the company to Attwoods in 1989 for Dollars 45m - have a significant interest. Attwoods had invested more than Dollars 100m dollars in Mindis since the purchase. Mindis has suffered for two years from weak markets for recycled materials and a collapse in prices for the base metals it recycles. The announcement comes only days after the announcement of the resignation of Laidlaw's chief executive, Mr Donald Jackson, whose tenure has been dogged by the group's investments in Attwoods and its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the security and car auction company. Laidlaw last night announced the appointment of a chief executive, Mr James Bullock, formerly chief executive of Cadillac Fairview, a Toronto-based property developer. The changes at the top of Laidlaw have prompted speculation that the group, which is 47 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific, might now consider selling its stake in ADT and restructure its waste management interests in North America. As a result of the provision for Mindis, Attwoods reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 62.21m in the year to July 31, down from a profit of Pounds 25.10m, on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds 409.97m. The loss per share was 25.25p, compared with earnings of 6.84p, and the group is paying a 3.25p final dividend, giving a maintained 5p for the year. Attwoods said its ongoing businesses were doing well and would have led to an increase in earnings per share before Mindis, if an exceptional Pounds 5.4m foreign exchange gain was included. Pro-forma gearing after the sale of Mindis will be 49 per cent excluding the preference shares which the company says its bankers consider as equity - up from 36 per cent a year ago.

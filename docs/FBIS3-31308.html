On the plateau located between the Gorj Prefect's Office and  the aforementioned Public Corporation, over 2,000 employees,  particularly from the coal basins Jilt and Mehedinti and from  Pesteana and Farcasesti mines, remained faithful to Miron Cosma,  leader of the Mining Trade Union Confederation of Romania, who  advised them to wait for messages calmly. However, at around  1530 local a part of the demonstrators tried to force their way  into the Prefect's Office. As a result of the incident, nine  people who belong to the law enforcement bodies were injured.  Further, the entrance to the headquarters of the Brown Coal  Mining Public Corporation was opened by force.    According to our correspondent's report, the result of the  telephone discussions held by Miron Cosma with the minister of  industry, Dumitru Popescu, and with the president of the Chamber  of Deputies Adrian Nastase, did not satisfy the demonstrators.  At 1830, Miron Cosma read an ultimatum, which says, quote: If  by 1500 tomorrow a government team is not sent to Targu Jiu  Municipality for negotiations, I personally, accompanied by  leaders of trade union and demonstrators, will go to Bucharest,  unquote.    In a declaration published by the local weekly MESAGER,  Victor Murea, mayor of Targu Jiu Municipality, stressed that the  miners' actions are illegal and the demonstrators should have  asked three days before the outbreak of the strike for  authorization to occupy the area neighboring the Brown Coal  Autonomous Public Corporation, which is public property. The  mayor of Targu Jiu Municipality said that appropriate legal  measures will be taken against organizers of the strike.</p>

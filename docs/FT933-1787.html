			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Historic cruise helps to soften up canal rebels MANCHESTER Ship Canal's minority shareholders yesterday agreed to sell their stock to Peel Holdings for: Pounds 23 a share, a Pounds 7 loan note, a cruise down the canal next year - and a commemorative medal showing Queen Victoria making a similar trip in 1894. The deal values the ship canal company at nearly Pounds 240m. Peel, a Rochdale property company chaired by Mr John Whittaker, already owns 82 per cent of the stock. Mr Whittaker's private interests won control in 1987, after a bitter two-year fight, in a bid then valuing the company at Pounds 37m. A handful of resistant shareholders, who inherited their ship canal shares as family heirlooms, were overwhelmingly defeated at a general meeting at Manchester's Free Trade Hall. They will be allowed to keep their share certificates for sentimental reasons. Under the deal, all shares will have to be sold to Peel, which will absorb the canal company, ending its quotation on the Stock Exchange 99 years after the waterway opened. The same price will be paid for both ordinary and preference shares. The original offer valued the ordinaries at Pounds 7 and the prefs at Pounds 3. The bulk of the latter are already owned by Peel. Since they have equal voting rights with the ordinaries, they provided a cheap way to gain control. The rest are held mainly by Mr Nicholas Berry, the largest ordinary minority shareholder, who was defending chairman of the company in the last months of the battle. Since the company has statutory powers, the High Court has to approve the deal. The court required a simple majority of shareholders and 75 per cent majority by value of holdings - criteria which were easily achieved yesterday. The Pounds 7 loan stock, to be redeemed for Pounds 10.50 in five years' time, represents the potential value of 300 acres of land which Peel hopes to develop as a retail centre, in spite of legal obstacles it has yet to surmount. Mr Berry said shareholders' patience had been rewarded. He criticised financial institutions which had sold earlier to Peel for short-termism and being run by 'grey men'. Observer, Page 25</p>

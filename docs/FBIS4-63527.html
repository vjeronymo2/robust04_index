			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 19 May at the evening session of  Ukraine's Supreme Council after Oleksandr Moroz's insistence to  register, only 198 people's deputies agreed to do so and this  prevented the session from opening. As Vyacheslav Chornovil,  head of the Rukh deputies' group explained, members of the Rukh,  Reform, Statehood, and some deputies from the Center group  decided to refrain from registering following a joint meeting of  group leaders under the chairmanship of Oleksandr Moroz.  Vyacheslav Chornovil said that Petro Symonenko (from the  Communists of Ukraine in support of social justice and democracy  group), Serhiy Dovhan (Agrarians of Ukraine group), and a  representative from the Center group, said that Oleksandr  Tkachenko, one of the leaders of the Agrarian group and former  agriculture minister, was a realistic candidate for the post of  deputy speaker of the parliament.    The national democrats made a final decision to block the  work of the session after Oleksandr Moroz said Vasyl Durdynets  had no chances of becoming first deputy speaker and this was why  he was supporting Oleksandr Tkachenko's candidacy. At a meeting  of the Rukh group, held in the chamber immediately after the  registration, the view was expressed that a tough position with  regard to the communist majority must continue to be maintained.  The start of a campaign to gather 112 signatures to recall  Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Supreme Council, was also not  excluded.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Oslo may have to vote again VOTERS in Oslo may have to go to the polls again after a computer failure in last week's general election, Reuter reports from Oslo. But officials said that any rerun was unlikely to weaken the ruling Labour Party's grip on power. Oslo's electoral committee said a study of the September 13 election, when the computer crashed after an overload, turned up irregularities which meant it could not recommend that parliament accept the result of the vote in Oslo. 'We don't think the result and the mistakes which have been discovered affect the share-out of seats (in parliament), but there were so many mistakes that it makes it difficult to approve,' Oslo's mayor, Ms Ann-Marit Saeboenes, said. A final decision on whether to rerun the election in Oslo, which elects 15 of 165 seats in parliament, will be taken by the new parliament on October 8.</p>

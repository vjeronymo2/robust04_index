			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Utd Biscuits US offshoot chief 'agrees to resign' UNITED BISCUITS last night announced a management shake-up at Keebler, its Chicago-based subsidiary which is one of the largest cookie and snacks manufacturers in the US. A terse release said that Mr Tom Garvin, who has been president and chief executive of Keebler for the past 15 years, had 'agreed to resign to pursue other interests'. He will be succeeded immediately by Mr Brian Chadbourne, previously managing director of McVitie's Group, UB's European biscuit division. At McVitie's, Mr Hartwig Conzelmann, formerly director of central and southern European operations, will step into Mr Chadbourne's shoes, also with immediate effect. Mr Chadbourne and Mr David Hearn, who heads KP Foods, UB's European salty snacks division are also joining the United Biscuits board. The upheavals at Keebler follow a sharp deterioration in its performance last year. In the first half of 1992, trading profit fell from Pounds 29.7m, to Pounds 12.1m, on sales of Pounds 508.8m (Pounds 512.5m). UB, which suffered a 17 per cent fall in group pre-tax profits as a result, blamed unfavourable market conditions and tough price competition. The problems cookie company prompted a review of all Keebler's operations. There have been suggestions that it would be kept on a tighter leash in future. This appears to have galled Mr Garvin, a feisty native from Chicago's south side.</p>

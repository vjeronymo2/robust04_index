			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure over Jubilee line deal MINISTERS have come under pressure from both Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs over the question of government guarantee or underwriting as a result of the deal by which the European Investment Bank agreed to provide Pounds 98m towards the extension of the Jubilee line. The EIB is a public sector institution owned by the European Community member states, which usually lends to public sector projects underwritten by governments. Mr Steven Norris, the junior transport minister, said yesterday that the detailed arrangements were still being discussed and were subject to commercial confidentiality. There were signs, however, that once the negotiations had been concluded ministers would be more forthcoming about the arrangements between London Transport, London Underground and the parties involved in financing Canary Wharf which should allow the Jubilee line extension to go ahead.</p>

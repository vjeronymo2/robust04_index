			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> WE CAN'T HAVE THIS  </P> <P> There are very few things left in the country that are considered sacred. Some  things just need to be preserved. You're brought up to believe in God and  country, and I think the best symbol of our nation is the American flag.  </P> <P> There can't be any other way to go except a constitutional amendment. Leaving  it up to the state legislatures, you're going to have the ACLU behind it, or  the real liberal legislators -- people like Ted Kennedy, who are saying, "I  don't personally believe in flag burning, but it's freedom of expression."  </P> <P> I don't see what flag burning proves. It's just something that really grips  you. We had to endure that when we had hostages in Iran. But to see it in our  own back yard, and to have Americans burning the flag, it really turns my  stomach. That's one thing that I would have thought that our country could  stand behind and stand up and say, "No we can't have this, something's got to  be done about it, we need a constitutional amendment."  </P></p>

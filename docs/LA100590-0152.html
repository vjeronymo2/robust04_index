			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREATING BONDS THROUGH MUSIC;  </P> <P> PROFILE: TO THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY'S NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR, DEVELOPING TIES WITH  OTHERS THROUGH MUSIC IS IMPORTANT. HIS DOWN-TO-EARTH APPROACH AND SINCERITY  HAVE IMPRESSED MANY.  </P> <P> Carl St. Clair, the new music director of the Pacific Symphony, can drop some  heavyweight names.  </P> <P> Conductor Leonard Bernstein, New York Philharmonic music director Kurt Masur,  Boston Symphony music director Seiji Ozawa -- St. Clair says he can "pick up  the phone at any time (and) have a question answered or talk with them about  this or that."  </P> <P> But there are other names he'll mention, nowhere near as familiar, that can  tell you a lot more about this 38-year-old Texan.  </P> <P> Take Robert S. Pool, for instance. Or Donn Laurence Mills.  </P> <P> Who?  </P> <P> Pool gave St. Clair a job in the governor's office when he was in college.  </P> <P> "He hired me because I had blisters on my hands," St. Clair recalls. "He looked  at my hands and said, 'What's wrong with your hands?'  </P> <P> "I said I had blisters from building a fence, digging post holes and things  like that. And he told me, 'That's why I hired you. Anybody who could work that  hard and do this kind of labor certainly could work in the governor's  correspondence room. . . .'  </P> <P> "Mr. Pool always helped me when I was a starving student at the University of  Texas. He helped me, and all he ever asked was that when I had the opportunity,  I would help somebody else.  </P> <P> "And I remember that, and I try to live that because he lost nothing by helping  me, but I gained everything. I always feel that if I can help other people, I  only gain from that."  </P> <P> Then there's Mills, chairman of the music department at Chapman College in  Orange and founding director of the fledgling Capistrano Valley Symphony who  died of meningitis in February.  </P> <P> Mills had conducted the Texas All-State Orchestra in which St. Clair, then a  17-year-old from the tiny farm community of Hocheim, Tex., played trumpet.  </P> <P> It was not only the first orchestra St. Clair ever played in. "It was the first  orchestra I ever heard," St. Clair told The Times in January, when he came to  guest-conduct the Pacific as one of eight who were trying out for the music  director's slot.  </P> <P> "I often wanted to tell (Mills) how important that was to me," St. Clair said  at the time. Last month he said he had been happy to learn that the remark got  back to Mills before his death. St. Clair said he returns to conduct the  All-State Orchestra "whenever they ask."  </P> <P> St. Clair's first concerts in his new position will be Tuesday and Wednesday at  the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> He was the youngest of the eight announced candidates, and his appointment  ended a search that began in February, 1988, when founding music director Keith  Clark resigned after a bitter power struggle with the orchestra's board of  directors.  </P> <P> Another candidate, Lawrence Foster, claimed to have been the front-runner and  said the Pacific had offered him the job in December but withdrew the offer  after talks broke down over salary, rehearsal demands and residency  requirements. The orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's  claims.  </P> <P> St. Clair has declined comment on the Clark and Foster episodes.  </P> <P> St. Clair's guest-conducting stint began under particularly trying  circumstances, as he faced last-minute changes in program and soloist. Only  days before the concert, soprano Benita Valente was engaged to replace Jill  Gomez, a British soprano who could not enter the country because she lacked a  visa. (Gomez and her British agent later would fault the Pacific management for  the problem. The management would blame her American agent and the heavy  workload at the Los Angeles immigration office.)  </P> <P> At any rate, St. Clair had to make some fast adjustments.  </P> <P> Gomez was to have sung selections from Joseph Canteloube's "Songs of the  Auvergne" and "Dove sono" from Mozart's "Le nozze di Figaro." Instead, Valente  chose to sing Mozart's "Exsulatate, Jubilate" and three of Mahler's  "Ruckert-Lieder" -- none of which St. Clair had prepared.  </P> <P> There was yet another surprise waiting for him: St. Clair had expected to  conduct the Overture to Mozart's "Die Zauberflote." But when he got on the  podium to start the rehearsal, he found the score for "Figaro," the result of  some apparent miscommunication between his agent and the orchestra.  </P> <P> "Maestro," one of the musicians ventured hesitantly, "we have the 'Figaro'  Overture. . . ."  </P> <P> St. Clair reportedly responded: "Even though I'm upset, that doesn't mean you  can't call me Carl."  </P> <P> Several musicians cite that response as part of what most impressed them about  the candidate. As it turned out, St. Clair would conduct both the Overture and  the Ruckert Songs from memory.  </P> <P> He continues to insist that the musicians call him by his first name.  </P> <P> It was a long but steady road from southwestern Texas to Boston, where until  this summer St. Clair was one of two assistant conductors of the Boston  Symphony -- and from playing first trumpet in a high school band to sharing the  prestigious, $150,000 1990 Seaver/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors  Award with Florida Symphony music director Kenneth Jean.  </P> <P> St. Clair studied conducting with Walter Ducloux at the University of Texas at  Austin and taught music for 10 years at Southern Illinois University at  Edwardsville and for eight years at the University of Michigan.  </P> <P> In 1985, he became a conducting fellow at Tanglewood, Mass., the summer home of  the Boston Symphony, and the following January he became one of the orchestra's  assistants along with Pascal Verrot.  </P> <P> In the summer of 1989, he toured with Bernstein and conducted various  orchestras in East Berlin, Leningrad, Milan, Paris and Rome, among other  cities. This past August, he stepped in to take over for an ailing Bernstein at  Tanglewood and later conducted in South America, Vancouver and Houston, among  other places.  </P> <P> St. Clair has a three-year contract with the Pacific and will lead six pairs of  classical concerts each season at the Performing Arts Center and two concerts  each summer season at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> He holds two other positions as music director -- of the Ann Arbor (Mich.)  Symphony and the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. -- one of which he  must drop this year because of his contractual obligations to the Pacific. He  says he has not yet decided which will go.  </P> <P> He has not made radical departures in programming for the new season, but he  has experimented a bit in rearranging traditional order.  </P> <P> "I find it's very boring to have an overture, a concerto and symphony;  overture, concerto, symphony," he said. "Standard, I think, is a dangerous word  when it involves an art form which is always changing.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to make each program a little different so that every time that  someone comes to the hall, it's not, 'If I'm five minutes late, I'm going to  miss the overture.' You might miss a whole Mozart symphony if you miss the  first piece."  </P> <P> Recent local press stories have chronicled his arrival in Orange County --  buying a townhouse in Turtle Rock, purchasing furniture -- in almost painful  detail. St. Clair said he hasn't read them. And while he doesn't "avoid press,"  he added that "most of the time," he doesn't read reviews.  </P> <P> "If the performance is good or not good, I'm usually the first one who knows  that," he said. "If (a critic) doesn't or does agree, then that's (his or her)  job. It's not my job. My job is to know whether I did a credible job or knew my  music, knew the music as well as I could and conducted it as well as I could. .  . .  </P> <P> "But I'm always listening to things. If someone says this or that, I'm always  aware, and I would think through it. Learning is important to me. I'm not  beyond learning."  </P> <P> He said he's particularly looking forward to learning with the Pacific.  </P> <P> "I need to develop a musical relationship with the musicians of this  orchestra," he said. "And that's about to happen. It takes time. It has to  happen as it happens. It's like a relationship with a person, place. This just  happens to be a group of people.  </P> <P> "But through music we will find one another, and that will begin to be the  relationship which will help us take future steps. The first thing is to meet  one another in the music. That's always a tremendous thing. It creates  tremendous emotion."  </P></p>

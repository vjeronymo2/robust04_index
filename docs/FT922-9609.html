			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Proms 1992 season announced Eleven overseas orchestras, seven BBC commissions plus another ten premieres, works by 104 composers of whom 23 are living and 22 (including Handel) are British - the statistics of the 1992 Proms came spilling forth from director John Drummond yesterday. There will be 66 concerts (all at the Albert Hall) in the 58 eight day season. It all starts on July 17 with the Princess of Wales in the audience for a Verdi Requiem and it ends on September 12 with Dame Kiri singing operatic arias - and 'Rule, Britannia ]'. Among the highlights are the visits by the Vienna Philharmonic, under both Abbado and Pierre Boulez, and the St Petersburg Philharmonic also with two conductors, Jansons and Temirkanov; new works by Richard Rodney Bennett and John Tavener; plenty of Rossini, including arrangements from his operas by jazzman Mike Westbrook; and the British premiere of William Walton's suite Christopher Columbus. There will be more early music, slightly less opera this season, although Glyndebourne will bring a semi-staged version of The Queen of Spades. Ticket prices are only marginally higher than last year but the top price for 55 of the concerts remains a reasonable Pounds 15.</p>

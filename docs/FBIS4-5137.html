			<p>BFN     [Text] Langkawi, Mon -- The navies and marine police units  of Malaysia and Thailand today began a five-day joint training  exercise with the main objective of ironing out communication  difficulties.    The manoeuvres, the 21st in the Seaex Thamal series, will  take place off Langkawi in Malaysia and Satun and Phuket Island  in Thailand.    About 300 personnel and eight vessels -- four from each  country -- are taking part in the exercise launched by Malaysian  Internal Security and Public Order director Ghazali Yaacob at  the Bukit Malut Marine police base.    The joint forces will also test their co-operation in  patrolling formation, enforcement and search-and-rescue  operations, as well as technical matters.</p>

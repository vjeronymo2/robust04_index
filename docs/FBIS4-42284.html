			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Martin Pollack </F> and Olaf Ihlau in Vienna; date not given: "Joy in Complaining"]    [Excerpt] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Chancellor, what is Austria  getting as a result of membership in the European Union [EU] --  more unemployment, more foreigners, a sell out of real estate,  and meat contaminated with hormones?    [Vranitzky] None of the above is the most important thing.  One cannot rule out that one thing or the other might happen  occasionally. Occasionally we have found bad meat in our shops  even without EU membership.    [DER SPIEGEL] We are just quoting a few provocative  catchwords used by Austrian EU opponents, who hope to triumph in  the referendum on 12 June.    [Vranitzky] I believe that these catchwords are  characterizing the domestic discussion about the EU rather  precisely. When we concluded our negotiations with Brussels on  1 March, the major issues were primarily agriculture, the  budget, second homes, and the transit agreement. However, the  more political the discussion becomes, the more emotional topics  and slogans are coming to the surface.    [DER SPIEGEL] "Austria first" your right-wing populist Joerg  Haider demands.    [Vranitzky] This is precisely where we are now. In the  remaining days until the referendum we must draw a clear line  between the political goal, which is the issue, and the slogans  to create uncertainty and fear.    [DER SPIEGEL] Most recent poll results signal a narrow  result. Is Europe no longer attractive in Austria?    [Vranitzky] I expected the mood to go down after the  euphoria  at the beginning of March. One cannot constantly be under such  high tension. In 1993 we had a pronounced recession. Many  people say that European integration is to be blamed for that.  Others are worried about the situation in ex-Yugoslavia and  say: Look at the EU, it is not even able to make peace. Others  still say: In our country the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent,  which is not even half as high as the EU average -- why do you  now want to push us in there? We need an enormous effort to  explain matters and to convince people.    [DER SPIEGEL] Some people, not just Haider, also think that  your government should have gotten more out of the membership  negotiations in Brussels or should have waited for a more  favorable time.    [Vranitzky] It is simply not true that we have not achieved  enough. [Bavarian] Minister President Stoiber recently told me  that he does not know at all how he should explain to Bavarian  farmers that the Austrians got far more for their farmers in the  mountain regions, e.g. regarding EU aid for environmental  protection.    [DER SPIEGEL] At least, you also got a concession in  Brussels  that in the future you may continue to use specific Austrian  terms for certain foodstuffs.    [Vranitzky] We are also rather proud of that, but this is  not  the only thing.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will the referendum be repeated if the vote is  negative, as it was in Denmark in 1992?    [Vranitzky] I do not believe that the referendum will be  negative. However, we would then certainly face a serious  situation, both in terms of domestic policy and in terms of  European policy. And we would certainly not resign ourselves to  the fact that the European issue is dead once and for all.    [DER SPIEGEL] For Austria, EU membership is the most  important historical event since it regained sovereignty through  the State Treaty of 1955. However, is not also a de facto  annexation to a greater Germany under different conditions,  which would have been horrible for your predecessor Bruno  Kreisky?    [Vranitzky] I think that it will be precisely the opposite  that will happen. Let us look at the economy, at foreign  trade....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...two-thirds of which you conduct with the EU  anyway.    [Vranitzky] Quite so. Now the EU is moving closer together,  and anyone who stays outside will be at a disadvantage. What  would be the alternative? We would have to come to a bilateral  agreement with our strongest trading partner, namely Germany.  Thus, we would be all the more dependent.    [DER SPIEGEL] Some francophone members of the European  Parliament already see Austria as a "vassal" of the Germans.  Will the EU become more northern, not to say more Germanic,  because of the accession of the four new members?    [Vranitzky] Let me tell you a little story: When I visited  the French president in summer 1989, that is, before the fall of  the Berlin Wall, Mitterrand told me: Well, you are very welcome  to us, and I take note of the fact that the third German state  will join the EU.    [DER SPIEGEL] Did you protest against this classification?    [Vranitzky] I told Mitterrand: Dear friend, I do not  represent the third German state, but the first and only  Austrian state. He quickly said that he did not mean any harm  by saying this. One or the other person might feel the same  today. But we are all old European states with long common  relations.    [DER SPIEGEL] Bonn's Foreign Minister Kinkel was  particularly  supportive of Austria during the membership negotiations -- do  you not feel a bit that you owe him something?    [Vranitzky] Kinkel supported us just as much as Belgium's  Willy Claes, as [EU Commission President] Jacques Delors during  the final state, and he cooperated just as much as Spain's  Gonzalez. Perhaps one should also respect the different  temperaments. Kinkel's temperament is different from that of  France's Balladur.    [DER SPIEGEL] What will happen to the permanent neutrality  of Mozart's country after it joins the EU? You seem to shy away  from definite statements in this respect.    [Vranitzky] Neutrality has really been strained by too many  comparisons, just as Mozart has been. Neutrality is a legal and  not a political instrument; probably only Austrians really  understand that.    [DER SPIEGEL] We are obviously talking about a sacred cow?    [Vranitzky] You know, from the end of the 19th century to  1955, this country was constantly shaken, trampled on, and  abused, certainly also because of its own actions. The State  Treaty in 1955, after 10 years of occupation, and the neutrality  that was adopted by the Austrian Parliament finally meant  stability. Thus, the term neutrality is a very emotional one  for us.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, in light of the new geopolitical  realities in Europe, this is an increasingly dubious status.  Even the neutral countries Sweden and Finland have meanwhile  joined the NATO Partnership for Peace. Why does Austria not  join, too?    [Vranitzky] I think the basic concept of neutrality, which  is  not to participate in wars, is not a bad principle. By joining  the Partnership for Peace, the Swedes and the Finnish did not  join a military alliance. This is a platform for information  and training, something which we have long been doing with the  countries of East Europe.    [DER SPIEGEL] How does Austria want to contribute to a  common  European defense policy?    [Vranitzky] The establishment of a common security system is  possible for a neutral state just as for any other state. And  whether or not we have observer status in the Western European  Union, we have said repeatedly: We are open in this respect.    [DER SPIEGEL] But joining NATO is not possible?    [Vranitzky] No.    [DER SPIEGEL] Even though NATO is currently the only  institution that effectively guarantees security in Europe?    [Vranitzky] For whom?    [DER SPIEGEL] For everyone who joins in.    [Vranitzky] NATO membership is not a topic for us at the  moment, not even in the medium term. However, if NATO rethinks  its own future, one will have to examine later on what was the  result of this rethinking.    [DER SPIEGEL] For 1996, the EU is planning a large  government  conference to reform the European institutions. What should be  reformed?    [Vranitzky] There are extensive debates in the EU about the  so-called democractic deficit. We have established pluralistic  parliamentary systems in our countries. In the long run, the  peoples will not be willing to accept a decline in democracy  policy at the next higher, the European level. This  relationship between the European Parliament, the EU Commission,  and the EU Council of Ministers will have to be institutionally  clarified.    [DER SPIEGEL] You see already now how the British, for  instance, are blocking this. This will hardly be different in  1996.    [Vranitzky] You are right. I have never said that this will  be an easy task.    [DER SPIEGEL] In addition, by deciding in favor of  enlargement, the EU has, for the time being, decided against a  deepening of supranational relations.    [Vranitzky] I reject this as regards Austria. The big  problems of the future, such as the environment, stability, and  peace cannot be solved on the basis of a free trade zone. This  means I am a member of the school of the political union.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the war in Yugoslavia, West Europe has  proved to be disunited and helpless. Would a common foreign  policy with majority decisions in the Council make the EU more  able to act?    [Vranitzky] In some fields the instrument of majority  decision would ensure flexibility and efficiency. If one wants  to prevent a disaster such as the one in the former Yugoslavia  in the future, a common political will and, afterwards, common  action are necessary.    [DER SPIEGEL] Austria finds itself in a turbulent  neighborhood: To the east of you former communists are on their  way up again in many places; the civil war in the former  Yugoslavia continues; and your Italian neighbors have the  neofascists back in the government. Are you worried about the  advance of extremism?    [Vranitzky] Yes, but I am worried even more about the fact  that many of my fellow citizens have noticed this very little so  far.    [DER SPIEGEL] There we are back with Joerg Haider.    [Vranitzky] No, I am thinking of those who close their minds  to new things, because they think that everything can continue  as it was in the 1970's and 1980's. But the foreign policy  framework conditions have changed. So far, we West Europeans  have neglected helping the reform states in the East with models  of cooperation and further improving their economic framework  conditions with investments in infrastructure, technical  knowledge, and administration. The lack of social and economic  progress has led to many people being disinterested in these  developments. But we must not turn away, we must not isolate  these peoples -- this would be fundamentally wrong.    [DER SPIEGEL] Peace researcher Johan Galtung sees what is  happening in East Europe now as economic colonialism by the  West, which is creating a second Third World there.    [Vranitzky] This threat is very real if we in the West do  not  pay more attention to it. I still hear what my former colleague  Margaret Thatcher used to say, namely that, first of all, those  in the East must develop free market economy systems and then,  as soon as they have them, we will invest in their countries. I  told her that this will not be possible without Western  cooperation; no free markets will develop there, unless they are  organized black markets.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will Austria get involved as an advocate for  the acceptance of the reform states in the EU or do you rather  see competition developing in this respect?    [Vranitzky] One must take the factor of time into  consideration. The economic constellations in these countries  show that immediate membership of the reform countries is not  possible. Transition solutions, however, are certainly useful.    [DER SPIEGEL] Austria, which has so far been relatively  liberal, has also adopted stricter immigration laws, which are  applied consistently, sometimes even brutally. You are closing  your borders. Is this advance obedience for joining the  fortress West Europe?    [Vranitzky] We were forced to adjust our legal situation to  the fundamentally changed structure of migration in Central  Europe within the shortest possible period. In individual  cases, authorities have certainly acted improperly. And as  regards dealing with people who come to us from other countries,  we, like many other Europeans, are in the middle of a learning  process.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Austrians are probably right in the  European trend with their widespread aversion against foreigners.    [Vranitzky] I do not to downplay anything and I cannot deny  what you are saying for every single case. However, one has to  add that this is really a tough piece of political work that has  to be done -- there, where concentrations are permitted or  promoted, such as in some schools, where there are already 60  percent are foreigners. This is were policy must become active.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is your government again permitting itself to  be influenced by Mr. Haider?    [Vranitzky] No, Haider is not influencing anything. The 60  percent of foreign children are in these school classes with or  without Mr. Haider. [passage omitted]</p>

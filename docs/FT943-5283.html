			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Observer: Sickening Ben Cohen, 43, co-founder of the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream chain, is getting a reputation for quitting. First, he announces that he wants to step down as chief executive of his socially responsible US business, which gives free back massages to its employees and 7.5 per cent of its profits to charity, now he has resigned from the advisory board of Business Ethics, the US magazine just because it has been criticising Anita Roddick's Body Shop. Although Ben &amp; Jerry's environmental credentials have not come in for the same sort of flak as Body Shop's, Cohen's wacky image is starting to look a bit suspect. Since the firm launched its 'Yo] I'm your CEO' essay contest to find Cohen's successor it has been flooded with applicants explaining in 100 words or less why they wanted to head the firm. Over 200 animals - including monkeys, horses, dogs and cats - sent in an application as well as hundreds of children, the youngest just 11 weeks' old. Most applicants said their first decision would be to give everyone a pay rise. No wonder the firm has quietly hired Russell Reynolds, one of the world's biggest head-hunters, to find the right person.</p>

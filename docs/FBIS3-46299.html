The economic development plan, which was submitted by the  State Council to the Political Bureau of the party Central  Committee for discussion on the basis of deliberations at the  end of 1993, has the following main contents: The GNP growth  rate will be set at about 9 percent, that of total industrial  output value at about 15 percent, and that of total agricultural  output value at about 3.5 percent. Investment in fixed assets  throughout society is set to be 1,300 billion yuan. In import  and export trade, goods worth $100 billion will be imported,  while the same value of goods will be exported. Society's retail  price index is set to be in the range of 10 percent. Moreover,  arrangements on the quantity of currency issued and the loans  scale for 1994 have been made. Growth rates in the economic  plan for 1994 have been readjusted from 13 percent GNP growth  and 22 percent growth in total industrial output value in 1993.    The top central leadership have deemed the above-mentioned  readjustments necessary. This is the concrete embodiment of the  idea of grasping opportunity, promoting development, keeping a  sober mind, and squarely facing problems cropping up in the  course of advancement, which the central authorities have  repeatedly stressed. Only in this way can sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development be maintained. The top leadership  maintain that in the second half of 1992, the central  authorities urged guarding against overheated economic  development, and, in July 1993, the central authorities again  made a decision to strengthen macroregulation and control of the  national economy. These policy decisions were made to counter  difficulties in economic work. If they had not been promptly  made, an economic situation such as that in the second half of  1988 would have occurred or there would have been big ups and  downs, as Deng Xiaoping stated, and tremendous losses would have  been incurred. Thanks to several months of efforts, positive  results have been achieved in macroregulation and control as one  may well say and big fluctuations have been rigorously brought  under control. As a result, the economy has maintained a  relatively good momentum of development and the international  community has given quite a favorable response to China's  macroregulation and control efforts. The Chinese economy grew  by 13 percent in 1992 and its GNP topped the 3,000 billion yuan  mark in 1993, or another rise of 13 percent from 1992 in terms  of constant prices. After the economy grew at a rate of 13  percent for two consecutive years, the conditions for economic  growth in some aspects have been strained and the restraining  role of "bottlenecks" and inflationary pressures had begun to  build up gradually. Moreover, we have to create conditions for  maintaining rapid growth in the years to come. Compared with  previous years, the greatest number of reform measures will be  introduced in 1994, the tasks of reform will be the heaviest,  and the widest range of interests of various sections will be  affected. The top leadership holds that in making plans for  economic work, we must give consideration to reform,  development, and social stability. Plans should not be too  rigid. We must create more favorable conditions for  accelerating reform. Therefore, the central authorities set a 9  percent growth rate, a rapid growth rate with an appropriate  margin left for unforeseen circumstances, as General Secretary  Jiang Zemin put it.    The authoritative source stressed that the central  authorities set a 9 percent growth rate in terms of the national  situation. When its comes to the economically developed eastern  coastal regions where conditions are quite good, the central  leadership urged them to make full use of their own favorable  conditions and existing foundations for development and to  develop a little faster if conditions permit so as to bring  along and promote the development of less developed regions. If  regions with relatively poor foundations for development cannot  achieve such growth rates, they should not necessarily feel  pressured. We must proceed in all cases from actual conditions  and forge ahead steadily and surely.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MALAYSIA 'CATWOMAN' PAMPERS 48 FELINES  </P> <P> Pearly (The Catwoman) Chong's love affair with cats began a decade ago when she  took in a family of strays.  </P> <P> Today Chong's bungalow on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur vibrates to the purring  of no fewer than 48 cats, ranging from pure-bred Persian, Siamese and Burmese  to common strays.  </P> <P> Chong dotes on them all, pedigree or not.  </P> <P> "There should have been 52 of them but four died of kidney failure recently,"  said Chong, her eyes watering as she recalled the burial of her pets in a  sprawling garden that now holds the remains of 10 of her furry companions.  </P> <P> "They are my children and it's a full-time job," said the petite 40-year-old  housewife, who also keeps 13 dogs.  </P> <P> The wife of a commercial pilot, Chong said her collection of cats grew as more  strays, some of them pregnant, found their way into her home and heart over the  years.  </P> <P> As her interest in cats grew, she decided to breed and sell Persians.  </P> <P> "But soon I found it too painful to sell them. I cried each time I sold one.  Besides, I feel it is unfair to the cat to give birth so often," she said.  </P> <P> "I had to part with the kittens within three months of their birth, otherwise I  would grow too attached to them. I interviewed each client and later visited  them to check if the cats were all right," she said.  </P> <P> "I couldn't sleep if I found they were not."  </P> <P> All six cats she entered in a major Malaysian competition last September won  prizes, including Pein Pein (Flat Nose), a 4-year-old Persian who took the  "Best Malaysian Bred Cat" and two other titles.  </P> <P> Another of Chong's cats, Tassy Star, took the "Best Siamese" title and was  named Grand Champion for consistently winning that category in Malaysian shows  since 1985.  </P> <P> Chong also owns Paprika Panter, a light-brown Persian bearing a remarkable  resemblance to the cartoon character Garfield. It has retired from competition  after being crowned "International Grand Champion" for winning titles at nine  shows.  </P> <P> Chong said she was offered $740 for Pein Pein. "But I won't sell her or any  other of my cats. They are all valuable, even the strays I picked up."  </P> <P> Some of the cats live in the Chongs' air-conditioned, marble-floored bungalow  decorated with an assortment of items bearing cat motifs -- ashtrays, posters,  dolls, clay figurines and paintings.  </P> <P> "If burglars ever break in, they may take away any items but not my cats,"  Chong said as she sat surrounded by a multicolored platoon of animals purring  around her for affection.  </P> <P> The rest of the cats are kept in a "cattery," a huge shed with rooms for  different breeds.  </P> <P> It is guarded by 12 dogs, some of them German Shepherds, prowling outside the  chicken-wire fencing.  </P> <P> Chong's 13th dog, a tiny, five-pound Chihuahua that looks as delicate as one of  the cats, eats and sleeps with the felines.  </P> <P> "She can't stay with the bigger dogs or she will be eaten up," Chong said. "But  she is as cunning and lovely as any of the cats."  </P></p>

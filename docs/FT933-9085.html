			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Hangzhou on his mind - A Georgia developer's plan to build a Chinese city MR John Portman, a renowned Atlanta architect and developer, is credited with having built the downtown area of his native city nearly single-handed. But he is now making a significant mark on turf very far from home. John Portman &amp; Associates, his international architectural and engineering company, has won the design and master plan contract for a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 870m) project to create a city in China. The massive project will cover 356 acres on the southern banks of the Qiantang River, near the eastern coastal city of Hangzhou. The developer is a consortium called Hangzhou Qiantang River City, whose leading partner is Mr Ho Iat Seng of Hotin Industries, a manufacturing and property developer based in Macao. It also includes industrialists, academics and businessmen from Hong Kong and Macao. The new city, which will take seven to 10 years to complete, will accommodate 34,000 people and include villas, high-rise residential apartment buildings, office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, international schools, clinics, hospitals and government offices. Mr Portman claims it is the largest investment ever undertaken by foreign interests in Hangzhou. It took 'patience and perseverance', says Ms Danielle Martin, spokeswoman for Portman. Those qualities will be much in demand again for Portman and other companies working on Chinese projects if the dour real estate market projections of KPMG Peat Marwick hold true. According to Mr Winston Elton, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick who specialises in the Chinese market, China's real estate market is in a nosedive. Mr Elton says the overheated market 'has cooled off and will do so considerably more'. The frenetic rush to build over the last decade has recently been brought to an abrupt halt with the decision last month by the central government to shut off credit to provincial governments. Mr Elton, who recently returned from six weeks in China, said, 'Real estate deals have been hung out to dry.' Some projects, particularly those near Shanghai, are still likely to go forward, in part because of substantial investment already made by the government. Projects in the interior are likely to be put on hold. On the brighter side, Mr Elton believes the downturn will be temporary because the long-term demand is there. Nonetheless, he says the market has tremendous risk, not least because of political uncertainty. 'You're kind of rolling the dice,' he said. This is the fourth big contract for Portman in China. The best-known of its predecessors was the first, the Dollars 200m residential and commercial Shanghai Centre, completed in 1990. The company also designed the Dollars 100m, 565-unit resort community of Dream Lake Villas in Hangzhou. And it provided the master plan for a less plush residential and vacation resort called Taihu Garden at Wuli Lake in Wuxi, which will include 560 villas, a conference centre and multi-storey apartments. The prominent Shanghai Centre is home to many foreign businesses, with a waiting list for its commercial and residential space. Portman also plays a management role in the project's Shangri-La Hotel. The Atlanta company began concentrating on the Far East in the 1980s. It has designed projects in Hong Kong, where it has had offices since 1980, Kuala Lumpur, Japan, Singapore and Indonesia. Thanks largely to Mr Portman's son Jack, who began travelling to China in the late 1970s, Portman &amp; Associates is reaping the fruit of having doggedly built relationships with the Chinese. The younger Mr Portman's success can be measured in part by the fact that when Chinese leader Mr Deng Xiaoping visited the US in 1979 to seek closer ties, one of his stops was the Portman firm in Atlanta. 'The key to business in China is guanxi, or relationships,' says Mr Elton. 'You need internal political clout.' Not least, he adds, to ensure that you are paid. Another requirement is a commitment to the long term. When China was just beginning to open in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Portman officials believed the country, and particularly Shanghai, would develop quickly. But, says Mr A J Robinson, president of Portman Overseas, a Portman affiliate, the boom came much later than the company had initially thought. 'We knew if we could just hold on long enough, it would happen,' he says. And the quality of Portman's guanxi can expect to be tested for the new Hangzhou city.</p>

He emphasized that Israel is  determined to complete the withdrawal on the fixed date, that  is, 13 April.    He said that discussions "are still continuing to determine  the the size of the Jericho area -- a difficult point requiring  great efforts."    He announced that "the U.S. Administration is seeking to  achieve tangible progress before before the U.S.-Syrian summit  scheduled for Sunday [16 January]." He pointed to "Egyptian  efforts being made to advance the negotiations, with constant  follow-up of the negotiation process."    Sha'th disclosed to AL-HAYAH that the Israeli delegation  presented several maps: one containing new areas added to the  Jericho area, one concerning Israeli settlements, and one  containing layouts for the crossings. He said that these maps  "reflect an advanced position, but it does not fulfill  Palestinian demands."    He said: "I believe that there is an Israeli change in terms  of the security concept." He cited the statement issued by the  U.S. State Department urging the Palestinian and Israeli sides  to achieve progress. He said that it "is aimed at pushing the  negotiations forward before the meeting between Presidents Bill  Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva on Sunday."    Sha'th pointed out that the Palestinian side may seek the  intervention of the United States or Egypt "if the situation  continues as it stands." [passage omitted]</p>

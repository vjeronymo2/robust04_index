			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRE ENGULFS 2 BUILDINGS AT NORTHRIDGE LUMBERYARD  </P> <P> A greater-alarm fire raged through a Northridge lumberyard Thursday night in an  area where an arsonist had set more than 25 small fires since Sunday, the Los  Angeles City Fire Department reported.  </P> <P> Two buildings at the Terry Lumber Co. complex at 18300 Parthenia Street were  engulfed by flames, said Greg Acevedo, Fire Department spokesman. Thirteen  engine companies and a Fire Department helicopter were battling the $1-million  blaze which started about 9:15 p.m., he said.  </P> <P> No injuries had been reported, and no neighboring structures or houses were  reported threatened, Acevedo said. A smaller fire was reported at the lumber  company Tuesday night, authorities said.  </P> <P> Thursday night's fire started about an hour after two burning trees were  reported only a few blocks from the lumberyard.  </P> <P> Those fires were similar to a string of about 25 fires in trees and rubbish  piles that were believed to have been set by one or more arsonists Sunday and  Monday nights in the same area. One of the fires damaged the roof of an  apartment complex on Napa Street.  </P> <P> A car parked under a burning palm tree also was damaged, authorities said.  </P> <P> About 13 of the smaller fires were set Sunday, and at least 12 were reported  Monday, officials said.  </P> <P> Fire Department arson investigators and four engine companies were patrolling  the area for possible arsonists when the lumberyard fire broke out. Acevedo  said the cause of the fire was unknown.  </P> <P> The fire was contained about 10 p.m., but it was not expected to be fully  extinguished until later Thursday night, authorities said.  </P></p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Coats makes agreed offer for Youghal Coats Viyella yesterday announced terms of an agreed bid for Youghal Carpets, valuing the Irish group at IPounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.67m). Coats already owns or has options over 90 per cent of Youghal's shares and says that whatever the outcome of the bid Youghal's shares will be delisted. The offer is 5p a share. Last week Coats took an option to buy 8.7m shares in Youghal from Jaykeel Investments, a Channel Islands-based investment group, for 3p a share. Coats said that Youghal, for which it originally bid in 1987, had only been able to trade because Coats had guaranteed some of its borrowings and 'to survive at all it will require a significant injection of capital'. Youghal's properties have been valued at Pounds 5.9m.</p>

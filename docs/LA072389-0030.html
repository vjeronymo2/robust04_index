			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL'S PEACE PLAN  </P> <P> Aharoni's article is so filled with hatred and anti-Arab racism that it is  pointless to rebut in detail his opinions. A man with his opinions is not  interested in discussion, just transferring Palestinians.  </P> <P> And, as usual, Paul Conrad's political cartoon, which depicted a bus being  driven by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir going over a cliff, was on the  mark. Likud's four restrictions on Palestinian elections destroy the prospects  for peace between Israelis and Palestinians and set the stage for the transfer  of Palestinians.  </P> <P> If the Israeli people and their government decide to implement an expulsion  policy, then the American people and our government must remain committed to  our values and principles and suspend both military and economic aid to Israel.  </P> <P> That some Israelis and Jewish-Americans would even consider the idea of a mass  expulsion of Palestinians should give us pause.  </P> <P> ARCH MILLER  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Jawad </F> al-'Anani, in Amman, by Shadiyah Riyad, in Cairo, from the "The  Talking Newspaper" program; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, what is Jordan's assessment  of the Palestinian-Israeli achievement evident in the agreement  signed by Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres in Cairo a few days ago?    [Al-'Anani] We hope that this agreement will be a step  toward  a comprehensive solution that will enable the Palestinian people  to enjoy their full rights on their national soil and establish  peace and future regional prosperity. Of course this step  required much discussion and passed through many stages. I  believe that the signing of the agreement in Cairo, with the  backing of Egyptian foreign policy and political assistance at  the highest Egyptian levels, constitutes an important step that  gives us fresh hope that the peace negotiations will eventually  produce practical results. Although some problems exist and some  people take a different view of the matter, we see it as a good  step and as a prelude to better future steps, God willing.    [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, as Your Excellency noted, these  negotiations took a long time and some problems remain  unresolved. However the major issues pertaining to the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles have been settled  and solutions satisfactory to both sides have been found.  Negotiations on other points and details will resume in Taba  and Paris. Do you believe that the time factor is important at  this stage?    [Al-'Anani] The time factor is certainly important because  the people must be continuing to hope that the entire peace  process is proceeding toward practical implementation. I  believe that a long time has passed since the Madrid conference.  Additionally, the Declaration of Principles of 13 September  1993 specified a timetable for actual measures. The specified  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho should have taken place  in December 1993. Delay produces frustration among the people  and encourages the feeling that the peace process is slow and  might lead nowhere. However, this recent and specific  achievement bodes well, shows that matters are proceeding toward  actual implementation, and that people will regain their lawful  rights.    [Riyad] Do you believe that progress on the  Palestinian-Israeli track will give impetus to the negotiations  on the other tracks, particularly the Syrian track?    [Al-'Anani] In Jordan we always believe that progress on any  track will eventually have a positive impact on the other  tracks. In the short term, this might not appear true because  the so-called Israeli public opinion does not appear able to  cope with progress on more than one track at a time. This gives  the impression that progress on one negotiating track might be  at the expense of another. I believe, nevertheless, that any  success must necessarily produce hope and reinforce the  credibility of the negotiations on the other tracks.    [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, perhaps there is stagnation now on  the  Syrian track, contrary to what was expected immediately after  the Clinton-al-Asad Geneva meeting. Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres is urging that the level of talks with Syria be  raised. He believes it is necessary to hold a summit between  Rabin and al-Asad. Do you think the time is propitious to hold  such a summit?    [Al-'Anani] Of course we leave the answer to this question  to  our brothers in Syria. They know better. I believe they have  given a reply to this Israeli proposal. Certainly it is not a  question of raising or lowering the level of the talks.  Everything has its own symbols and significance. We believe  that the negotiations conducted by the Syrian and Israeli  delegations for two years in Washington did not produce definite  results. As a result of Israel's intransigence, the talks fell  into a vicious circle. We believe it is time to get things  moving. The heads of the delegations will hold consultative  meetings starting next Tuesday [15 February]. If Rabinovich, the  head of the Israeli delegation, is willing to make constructive  proposals to Mr. al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation,  and the Syrian leadership judges that these proposals need to be  discussed at a higher level and that a possibility exists to  make definite progress, then I believe that the Syrian  leadership will decide to raise the level of negotiations. If  things remain unchanged, however, I do not believe there will be  sufficient reason to raise the level of negotiations.    [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, one last question. Do you expect  progress on the Jordanian negotiating track at this stage?    [Al-'Anani] At this time?    [Riyad] Yes.    [Al-'Anani] According to the statements we heard from  Israeli  officials, it appears that, following the progress on the  Palestinian front, they are focusing on the Syrian track. We in  Jordan have no objections at all. We believe that progress on  any Arab negotiating track is an achievement serving the  objective of the comprehensive peaceful solution that we  constantly advocate. It is still possible for progress to occur  on the Jordanian track. Our position is perfectly clear. It is  necessary to begin by solving the water and border issues. So  far, the Israelis do not seem willing to discuss these issues  with sufficient clarity. They might be somewhat flexible on the  water issue, but we have seen no movement on their part in  connection with the border issue. If they show a willingness to  make progress on this point and expedite measures to return the  occupied Jordanian territories, this will open the way to  reasonable solutions on the other points on the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda.    [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, thank you.    [Al-'Anani] You are welcome.</p>

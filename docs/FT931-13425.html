			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Park Foods reduces loss to Pounds 3.69m Park Food, which sells Christmas hampers through freelance agents, has reported a lower than expected interim loss, incurring Pounds 3.69m pre-tax for the six months ended September 30 1992. Mr Peter Johnson, the chairman, was confident, however, that full-year pre-tax profits would show a significant improvement over the Pounds 6.89m of 1991-92, after a half-time deficit of Pounds 4.39m. Analysts are forecasting between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9.2m, increasing to between Pounds 9m and Pounds 11m in 1993-94. The annual dividend cover of 2.5 times was felt to be excessive and the interim dividend is doubled to 2p. Sales of continuing businesses came to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.95m), after disposal of the drinks and frozen foods divisions which made Pounds 6.75m last time.</p>

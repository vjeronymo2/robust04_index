			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bouncy Bruce belches forth in Grosvenor expansion MR DAVID BRUCE, the brewer with a mischievous sense of humour who founded the unusually named Firkin pubs chain, is aiming to repeat his original success for the recently floated Grosvenor Inns as head of its new subsidiary, Belcher Pubs. Grosvenor announced yesterday that Mr Bruce would join the board as an executive director under a three year consultancy agreement. Mr Bruce will be responsible for setting up a pub franchise operation to complement Grosvenor's Slug &amp; Lettuce and High Street and City Taverns businesses. Mr Tim Thwaites, Grosvenor's chairman, said the group planned to buy freeholds in the south-east which could be franchised. The shake-up in the brewing industry presented 'real opportunities' for acquiring reasonably priced freeholds, Mr Thwaites said. In many cases, prices had halved in the last three years. Grosvenor announced the acquisition of two pubs to kick off the division. As part of the deal, Mr Bruce will sell The Water Rat, his freehold pub in Newbury, to Grosvenor for shares worth Pounds 500,000 at 123p. Mr Bruce will be Grosvenor's third largest shareholder, with a 5 per cent stake. Grosvenor has also purchased the Pavilion freehold at Waterloo, south London, for Pounds 300,000 cash.</p>

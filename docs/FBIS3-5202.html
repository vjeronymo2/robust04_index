He also laid a wreath at the unknown  soldier monument and visited the Gallipoli section of the war  monument in that city.

An agreement was signed  on the exchange of criminals between the two countries. Hikmet  Cetin and Gareth Evans later held a joint news conference.  Cetin disclosed that bilateral and regional issues, including  the developments in the Balkan region, the Caucasus, and the  Middle East, were discussed in the official talks.

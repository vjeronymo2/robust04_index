			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A MIDSESSION boost given to the derivatives market by the reduction in German interest rates soon faded as dealers once again decided to go in for profit-taking, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, early selling of the September contract on the FT-SE 100 saw it drift lower to the 3,026. This proved to be a solid support level and September traded just above that level until the Bundesbank's reduction in interest rates. That announcement appeared to surprise the market and the ensuing demand developed into a squeeze that sent the contract to a day's high of 3,057. However with a feeling that UK base rates were unlikely to be reduced in the near future, together with caution about the US markets with the current weakness in the dollar, traders chose to consolidate earlier gains. September drifted lower for the rest of the day and closed at 3,039, just a point ahead of its opening level and at an 8 point premium to the underlying cash market. Volume was particularly heavy with a substantial amount generated by rolling forward from September to December. Some 14,864 contracts were dealt in the near month contract and just over 4,000 traded in December. Strong activity continued in the traded options and total turnover reached 41,557 lots, though volume in the FT-SE 100 option fell to 10,188 contracts.</p>

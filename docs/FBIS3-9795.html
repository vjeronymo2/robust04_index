The new Slovak Government today  abolished the resolution about special protection for the  ex-premier till the end of the electoral term.    "We came to the conclusion that there are no reasons for  special protection of Deputy Meciar," Slovak Deputy Premier Ivan  Simko told journalists today. He said that under the law Meciar  had the right to a personal bodyguard for three months and after  that he could ask new Premier Jozef Moravcik to confirm the  permission for his personal protection.    The Slovak Government today dismissed Anna Nagyova, Meciar's  close co-worker, from the post of the head of the premier's  Secretariat.    The cabinet also approved the proposal by Vice Premier  Brigita Schmognerova for the dismissal of Chairman of the Slovak  Statistics Office Rudolf Krc. Stefan Condik was proposed as new  chairman. The proposal of Krc's dismissal and the appointment  of his successor now has to be approved by the president.</p>

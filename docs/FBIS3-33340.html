			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 22  February.    The Central Bank of Nicaragua announced that annual  accumulated inflation reached 10.58 percent during the last 12  months and that the cordoba had fallen 6.55 percent with respect  to the U.S. dollar. According to the Central Bank, the  aforementioned levels are in accordance with monetary adjustment  policies applied by Violeta Chamorro's administration to control  inflation, which reached 55,000 percent in 1990, the highest in  the world. In January 1993, Nicaragua's economic authority  decided to implement a 20.34-percent "macrodevaluation" of the  cordoba and establish a 1 percent monthly fluctuation mechanism.  (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2105 GMT 15 Feb 94)    Oscar Aleman, director of the Foreign Trade department of  the  Economic and Development Ministry (MEDE), announced that  Nicaragua had decided to stop granting licenses for the  importation of Costa Rican dairy, canned, and grain products  until that country decides to lift its import restrictions on  similar items from Nicaragua. Aleman said the decision does not  constitute a trade war but is a "tit for tat" situation because  while Nicaragua allowed the unrestricted entry of Costa Rican  goods, that country did the opposite. The foreign trade  director added that before making the decision, the economy  minister had contacted his Costa Rican counterpart and requested  unrestricted passage for Nicaraguan goods. The Costa Rican  minister explained that the call for restrictions was made by  the private sector for reasons of competition. (Managua  BARRICADA in Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 1, 8)</p>

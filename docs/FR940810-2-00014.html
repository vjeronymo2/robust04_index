			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We then compared the adjusted U.S. export price to the price Pequiven charged for orthoxylene in the month that orthoxylene was exported from the United States. Based on this comparison, we found that Pequiven's price was greater than the price of imported U.S. orthoxylene. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a final check on the validity of the single importation as a benchmark, we averaged U.S. export prices (adjusted for freight and insurance as well as the difference between the spot and contract prices) for the three months in which we had data (one within the POI and two outside of the POI). For the two exports occurring outside of the POI, we added the average spread between spot and contract prices for the POI to the export prices because monthly data on the difference between spot and contract prices outside of the POI was not available. We compared the average of the adjusted U.S. export prices to the average price Pequiven charged in the same three months and found that Pequiven's average price was greater than the average price of the imports from the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we find that the GOV, through Pequiven, did not provide orthoxylene to PA producers at preferential rates. Accordingly, we determine that no benefits which constitute bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing duty law are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters of PA from Venezuela. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II.

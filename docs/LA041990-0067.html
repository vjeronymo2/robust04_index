What's the trick?  </P> <P>  -- TOM, Sausalito, Calif.  </P> <P> DEAR TOM: Harvest herbs early in the morning before the sun evaporates their  oils. This way their flavor will remain strong.  </P> <P> Wash and rinse them well and dry in a warm, dark, well-ventilated place. You  can lay them on a screen or tie small bunches by the stems and hang them upside  down. Drying time will depend on the thickness of the herbs.  </P> <P> A microwave oven also works well. Rinse the herbs, pat dry and place several  sprigs at a time between paper towels. Microwave on the lowest setting for two  or three minutes or until the herbs are brittle.  </P> <P> Some herbs, such as basil, mint, parsley, chives and tarragon, can be frozen,  then thawed and used as fresh. Freeze small amounts in freezer-safe plastic  bags.  </P> <P> Store dried herbs in glass containers with tight-fitting lids and they'll keep  their flavor for up to a year. Be sure to label and date them.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I was making a lemon cake and realized the peels were still good  after I used the juice, so I put them in plastic freezer bags and froze them.  The next time I needed lemon peel, I just took one out, grated it and had fresh  lemon zest.  </P> <P>  -- EVA, Granite City, Ill.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I like the quickness of heating rolls and pastries in the  microwave, but sometimes they come out hard and dry. How can I get them hot but  still edible?  </P> <P>  -- M. W., New York, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR M. W.: Tough or dry bread and rolls usually mean you've heated them too  long. It takes only a few seconds. Put them on a paper towel to absorb moisture  so they won't be soggy, then heat for about 15 seconds per item.  </P> <P> Hope they're all edible from now on.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Since frozen foods should be used within a certain amount of  time, I would mark the date when I put food in the freezer, but I was always  having to refer to my freezer chart to see what I needed to use first.  </P> <P> Now I put the use by date on foods rather than the date I freeze them. This way  I don't have to guess.  </P> <P>  -- BETTY, Waco, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: After a recent back injury, I found that I couldn't stand for  very long, which was a problem when I cooked. My husband built an additional  kitchen counter at table height. With a comfortable chair to sit in, I can now  cook without further stress to my back.  </P> <P>  -- JANE, Chula Vista, Calif.  </P></p>

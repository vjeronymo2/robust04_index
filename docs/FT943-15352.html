			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: Jobs data keep interest rates on the boil - Wall Street The Wall Street market ended a difficult, holiday-shortened week well aware that if the weakness of the dollar was not enough to prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates, the surprisingly strong June employment report released yesterday might just do the trick. The Labor Department's announcement that non-farm payrolls had risen by 379,000 last month, and that the national unemployment rate had remained steady at 6.0 per cent, stunned economists and sparked an immediate retreat in bond prices. Forecasters had been looking for a gain in payrolls of around 280,000, and for a rise in the unemployment rate to 6.2 per cent. The data, which showed how Wall Street continues to under-estimate the strength of the economy, sent dealers in the Treasury market rushing to off-load bonds in the expectation that the Fed would be sufficiently concerned by the pace of growth in jobs to sanction another tightening in monetary policy. The selling of bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond close to 7.7 per cent, its highest level since the bear market in Treasuries began earlier this year. While the bond market expressed its unhappiness with the jobs figures, the reaction of the stock market was puzzling. After posting an immediate 15-point decline on the news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied quickly, and by late morning was up almost 20 points. Other, secondary, indices also recovered from early weakness, although they failed to match the Dow's performance. At first, analysts struggled to explain the stock market's insouciance, but it soon appeared that equity investors had latched on to a qualification in the June jobs data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In response to questioning from a congressman, a BLS official said about 100,000 of the increase in non-farm payrolls could be attributed to the June reporting period being spread over five weeks instead of the usual four. Investors reassured themselves that if those 100,000 extra jobs were removed from the numbers, the increase in non-farm payrolls last month would have been bang in line with forecasts. This, however, was clutching at straws. Even taking into account the extra reporting week in June, the breakdown of the employment data still pointed to a rapidly-expanding labour market. The BLS also revised upwards its estimate of growth in May non-farm payrolls, from 191,000 to 252,000. From almost every angle, 'the numbers were extremely, extremely strong for the economy', said an analyst at Daiwa Securities in New York. Strong enough, at least, to convince many analysts that the Fed would raise interest rates next week to slow down an economy that may now have grown by as much as 4.5 per cent or 5 per cent in the second quarter. So, why did the stock market - which normally turns tail at the first hint of higher interest rates - rise after the jobs data were released? Well, any evidence of economic growth is, traditionally, good news for stocks because it means higher earnings for public companies, especially those with profits tied closely to the economic cycle. This explains why the shares of companies like Caterpillar, International Paper, and General Motors were all up handily yesterday. Cyclicals, in fact, were in demand all week, outpacing every other sector in the market. Investors' renewed interest in cyclicals was the result of a shift in sentiment about second-quarter earnings. Last month, the perception in the market was that the expected slowdown in the economy during the quarter would produce disappointing corporate earnings for the period. Yet, recent evidence that the economy was stronger between April and June than widely-realised persuaded many investors that second-quarter earnings might not be so bad after all. So, but still playing it safe, they moved back into cyclicals, providing the Dow with a lift this week that other indices, such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the American Stock Exchange composite and the Nasdaq composite, were unable to enjoy. Next week, however, investors may come to regret their enthusiasm for cyclicals. The June inflation figures will be released on Tuesday and Wednesday - and it is possible that the only reason the Fed refrained from raising rates this week was that policy-makers did not want to make a move until they saw the June producer and consumer prices data. If there is any hint of a resurgence in inflation, it is likely the central bank - with the weak dollar and the strong jobs market fresh in its mind - will again push the 'higher interest rates' button.  ---------------------------- Monday       Closed Tuesday     3652.48  +  05.83 Wednesday   3674.50  +  22.02 Thursday    3688.42  +  13.92 Friday      3709.14  +  20.72  ----------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AEROFLOT TO BUY WESTERN JETS  </P> <P> The West European airplane consortium Airbus Industrie said today it has  reached a preliminary agreement with the Soviet state airline Aeroflot on the  purchase of five Airbus A-310 airliners and options for five more.  </P> <P> A banking source said the preliminary agreement was dependent on Aeroflot  obtaining bank financing for the purchase from the consortium of aerospace  firms in West Germany, France, Britain and Spain. The source said Aeroflot  would need to obtain a servicing agreement with a Western airline.  </P> <P> An Airbus sale to East Germany's Interflug airline last year was cleared by the  West's export control body COCOM on condition the planes were serviced in West  Germany. The Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls scrutinizes  all exports to the East Bloc to prevent the diversion of sophisticated  technology to military ends.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Inflation nears 30-year low: Sterling gains against dollar and D-Mark as hopes are raised for sustained recovery INFLATION DROPPED to its lowest rate for almost 30 years last month, stimulating hopes that the UK can sustain economic recovery while keeping price rises under control. Retail prices fell 0.1 per cent in June to bring the headline inflation rate down to 1.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent in May. This was the lowest year-on-year rate of inflation since February 1964. Underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - was steady at 2.8 per cent, the lowest 12-month rate since the series began in 1975. The sluggishness of price rises, along with robust manufacturing output, announced earlier this week, appeared to offer Mr John Major, the prime minister, a chance to achieve low-inflation growth and revive his government's fortunes. The figures, which boosted the pound, will also support the government's contention that the UK will be able to hold on to the competitive gains of devaluation. However, economists warned that inflation does not have much further to fall. Although few expect underlying inflation to breach the ceiling of the government's 1-4 per cent target range before the end of the year, many believe that price pressures are starting to build slowly as demand for consumer goods recovers and the higher cost of imports is passed on by retailers. The figures, which followed a string of encouraging economic data, boosted the spirits of the Tory government and raised expectations of an early cut in interest rates. However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said it would be wrong to leap to any conclusions about further monetary easing. 'At the moment, the economy is recovering perfectly sensibly. I don't expect us to have good news all the time but at the moment the recovery isn't looking fitful,' he said. 'In the last day or two it looks as though it is strengthening a little.' The Central Statistical Office said the latest fall was mainly due to an early start to the summer sales. These were brought forward from July in an attempt to underpin weak retail sales. There were also drops in telephone and electricity charges. Inflation has rarely been lower than 1.2 per cent since the end of the 1950s. On two occasions in 1963 it dropped below the current figure, and it was once lower in 1964. The City reacted well to the news, which came only a day after the announcement that manufacturing output rose 1.8 per cent month-on-month in May. Long dated bond yields, which reflect the market's expectations of future inflation, fell below 8 per cent for the first time since early 1972. The pound climbed against the D-Mark, closing up  3/4 of a pfennig at DM2.5775. It was also slightly stronger against the dollar, ending the day at Dollars 1.5025 compared with a previous close of Dollars 1.4935 and trading later in New York at Dollars 1.5035. The figures had little impact on share prices, however. The FT-SE share index closed down 4.8 at 2,832.3. Commenting on the results, Mr Major said: 'The figures, taken together, show we are in sight of our long-term goal: growth without inflation.'

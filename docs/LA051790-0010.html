			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> OWNER VOWS TO KEEP MINIATURE HORSES  </P> <P> The owner of two miniature horses said Wednesday that he has changed his mind  and will fight to keep the 33-inch-tall geldings in his back yard after all.  </P> <P> Greg Bowlay-Williams of Thousand Oaks had agreed Tuesday to remove the  miniature horses, Chips and Apache, from his home. Ventura Municipal Judge  Barry B. Klopfer on Tuesday continued Bowlay-Williams' zoning violation trial  until June 19 to give him time to move the unusual pets.  </P> <P> However, Bowlay-Williams, a state Corrections Department officer, said he plans  to hire a new attorney and defend himself. "I'm going to fight this thing to  the finish," he said.  </P> <P> He added that he hasn't had the heart to tell his daughter, Rachelle, 6, that  she may be separated from her pet, Chips. Apache is Bowlay-Williams' pet, he  said.  </P> <P> Bowlay-Williams said he is especially determined to retain the horses despite a  city ordinance against keeping livestock on a lot smaller than 20,000 square  feet. His property totals about 13,000 square feet.  </P> <P> Bowlay-Williams said he agreed Tuesday to remove the horses from his home  because his attorney, Philip R. Dunn, told him that there was no chance of  successfully defending himself against the charges.  </P> <P> Bowlay-Williams said Wednesday: "I'll get a new attorney. I may even sue the  city.  </P> <P> "They're like members of the family," he said, referring to the horses.  </P> <P> Nancy Schreiner, a Thousand Oaks deputy city attorney who was to prosecute the  case, said a number of neighbors have complained about Chips and Apache since  Bowlay-Williams acquired them last year. "It isn't just the smell," Schreiner  said. "One woman is allergic to horses."  </P> <P> In a similar Thousand Oaks case that attracted wide attention, charges against  Patty and Richard Fairchild were dismissed in 1987, allowing the Fairchilds to  keep their miniature horse, Ragtime, at their home on Shady Brook Drive. In  that case, the judge found that the zoning code dealing with horses was poorly  worded.  </P> <P> Since then, Schreiner said, the code has been tightened, and even tiny horses  are classified as livestock.

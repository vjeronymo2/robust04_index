			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Extra help for war widows urged Mr Alf Morris, Labour MP and parliamentary adviser to the Royal British Legion, yesterday wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging him to mark the 50th anniversary of D-day next week by giving widows of men killed in the Second World War a Pounds 2,000 one-off payment. He pointed out that last year's budget of Pounds 1.2bn for war pensions was to be cut to Pounds 1.1bn. 'The total of 51,300 war widows in 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, must mean that today there will be no more than 50,000 still alive. I am not asking you to increase expenditure, but simply to maintain it.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RAY/MAR: "Crisis: Belgium Grants 100 </F> Million Francs Aid to Rwandan Refugees"]    [Text] Brussels/Kigali, 5 May (BELGA) -- The government  decided to grant emergency aid of 100 million Belgian francs to  Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, Burundi, and possibly in Rwanda  itself, the Foreign Ministry announced in a communique on  Thursday [5 May].    Granted following a proposal by Foreign Minister Willy Claes  and Erik Derycke, secretary of state for development  cooperation, this aid will be distributed through  nongovernmental organizations, principally the Red Cross and  Doctors Without Borders, the communique states.    Mr. Claes also welcomes the decision by Ayala Lasso, UN high  commissioner for human rights, to visit Rwanda shortly to look  at how the United Nations could help safeguard human rights, the  communique continues.    The high commissioner's proposal to devote a special session  of the Human Rights Commission to human rights violations in  Rwanda, which had also been suggested by Amnesty International,  is supported by Belgium together with the decision to send  permanent human rights observers to the region.    Finally, Belgium is examining with its European Union  partners what concrete measures could be taken to aid Rwandan  refugees and protect threatened persons in Rwanda.</p>

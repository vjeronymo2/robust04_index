			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: Retiring the workhorse - Richard Waters reports on a uranium producer facing the task of replacing its obsolescent equipment The US's sole producer of enriched uranium - the fuel which feeds nuclear power stations - faces one of the classic dilemmas for a technology-based company. The US Enrichment Corporation (USEC) produces nearly half of the world's supply of enriched uranium in two plants which are 40 years old. This old technology (based on a process known as gas diffusion) is still working effectively and is in no immediate need of replacement - although maintenance costs are relatively high. The plants have already been fully written down, so the company faces no depreciation costs. Meanwhile, a new generation of technology, known as gas centrifuge, has been in use by competitors since the mid-1970s. Since gas centrifuge uses far less power, the fuel produced is generally reckoned to be cheaper on a marginal-costed basis (though more expensive if the depreciation cost of the newer plant is added in). The dilemma: should the USEC scrap its existing plant and make the multi-billion dollar investment in the next generation of laser-based technology with which it could leap-frog its competitors? The decision is complicated by three factors. First, the world faces a glut of enriched uranium. Only East Asia is building nuclear power stations at a faster rate than it is retiring them; the demand for enriched uranium, variously estimated at an annual 30m-35m swus (separative work units, the standard unit for the fuel), is expected to rise only marginally over the rest of the decade. Yet commercial uranium enrichment capacity continues to rise. This reflects in part a desire by governments to ensure a steady supply of what is in some countries a strategically important fuel. France, for instance, generates nearly three quarters of its electricity using nuclear power. In Japan, the figure is lower, but still significant, at 28 per cent. USEC currently uses only around two-thirds of the capacity of its two plants. Adding to this over-supply in the coming years will be fuel which is created out of old nuclear warheads. The US company is due to receive the 500 tonnes of weapons-grade uranium which the US has agreed in principle to buy from Russia. According to some estimates, this uranium would produce enough commercial-grade fuel to keep all the world's nuclear power stations running for some eight years. Weapons-grade material is as high as 97 per cent pure, compared with the 4 per cent purity of the uranium used in nuclear power plants. Breaking down this highly enriched material is technically far easier than creating commercial-grade fuel from scratch. Second, USEC's share of the world market for enriched uranium has fallen fast in the past decade and may still be shrinking. At the start of the 1980s, it had a monopoly on the process by which the naturally occuring uranium-235 isotope is 'enriched' to push its concentration up to the 3-5 per cent level at which it can be used in nuclear power plants. Its share of the annual Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) market for the fuel has now fallen to 46 per cent. Tim Timbers, an investment banker appointed this year to run the USEC, blames its falling market share on the fact that, as an arm of the US Department of Energy, it had not been subjected to commercial disciplines. The price at which it sells fuel has in the past been published, making it easy for competitors, he says. The company has now been given the power to act more commercially. Following last year's Energy Policy Act, the USEC, which had been an arm of the Energy Department, was set up as a separate corporation at the beginning of July. Its brief is to make profits - and it will no longer publish its prices, says Timbers. The third complicating factor; the company has been lined up for privatisation (its Dollars 1.5bn of sales a year will put it among the US's top 300 companies). Would outside investors put their money into a company which operates with obsolescent equipment in one of the world's most technologically advanced industries? The new technology which could reshape the uranium enrichment process is based on lasers. Known as atomic vapour laser isotope separation (Avlis), it would reduce the cost of producing enriched uranium by more than a third, estimates Timbers. Others in the industry are more doubtful. Urenco, a joint UK/German/Dutch company which claims a market share of around 10 per cent, says it has studied laser enrichment but decided not to proceed with the technique. 'It's extremely complex and difficult - we couldn't see any foreseeable success,' says the company. Laser-based technology involves the vapourising of uranium, and then using a laser to ionise the U-235 atoms in the vapour. The charged atoms can then be separated from the rest. Enrichment techniques based on lasers have been under development in the US for 20 years. Only at the end of last year, says the USEC, did tests establish that the process was practical on a commercial scale. Studying the technical and business case for switching technologies is expected to occupy the company for the rest of this year. Should it decide to take the leap, plant which has operated since the beginning of the nuclear age will finally be retired.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PHOTOS OF 4 SUPERVISORS STILL MISSING  </P> <P> The county is on a picture hunt, seeking photographs of four former members of  the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> If found, the missing photos will complete a "Supervisors Picture Project" that  was started several years ago and now includes about 50 former and present  members of the board -- all but four who have served since the county was  founded in 1873.  </P> <P> The missing supervisors are:  </P> <P> * H.L. Atwood, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1877.  </P> <P> * Robert Ayers, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1885.  </P> <P> * Charles C. Perkins, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1915.  </P> <P> * Edward S. Pierce, who served four years starting Jan. 1, 1949.  </P> <P> "We would like to ask your board and members of the public to put out the word"  that the pictures are needed to complete the collection, Susan Van Abel, the  county's principal administrative analyst, told board members Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The pictures, which are truly amazing, along with a map of the county, will  depict the historical perspective and hairstyles of the county," Van Abel said.  </P> <P> With or without the missing photographs, the collection will go on display  starting next month on the fourth floor of the Hall of Administration in the  County Government Center in Ventura.

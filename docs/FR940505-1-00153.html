			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the second and third possible control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches, several additional issues have been identified if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military aircraft operations are included within the scope of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bubble program. EPA requests comment on the following issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If emissions from aircraft are included, a fee system based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on an emission rate target (i.e., the third approach), consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the proposed strategy for commercial airlines, or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variation of the second approach but with a fee for emissions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess of the cap, may be more equitable and desirable than an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absolute emissions cap that applies uniquely to military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation. Emissions that exceed the emissions target would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to emission fees instead of an enforcement-related fine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or penalty. The emission target would apply to air emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only during the ozone season in each FIP area. The method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the excess emissions and the resulting fee would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in subsequent rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another issue identified involves the method of allotting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission caps or emission rate targets by the EPA. To be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most effective, the DOD Working Group recommends that any caps on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total emissions, targets for total emissions, or emission rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targets which include aircraft emissions be allocated to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual Military Departments. Each Military Department will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be responsible for attaining the target for installations under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its control. This system is consistent with existing DOD command  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure and can be readily implemented. Trading between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Military Departments and between installations is proposed. Trading is applicable only to installations within the same FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To reduce the potential impact on aircraft operations of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions cap or emission rate target which includes aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, the DOD working group identified as essential the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to trade excess emission reductions between stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and mobile sources. Maximum flexibility and minimal operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts can be achieved by allowing trading between stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and mobile sources, in addition to trading between all types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military installations within the same FIP area. In other words,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major reductions or elimination of a stationary source may allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued essential flight operations. EPA acknowledges this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern and supports such trading programs as created by State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and local governments as discussed elsewhere in today's proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of particular concern to the Navy with respect to the second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and third options identified above is the inclusion of Naval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Auxiliary Landing Field San Clemente Island (SCI) in the list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> military air installations regulated by the FIP. SCI is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolated and remote area, with few emissions sources, either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile or stationary, other than aircraft. The impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft operations will be substantial, as almost the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of required reductions will have to be a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreased aircraft operations. SCI is the primary training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location for Navy pilots prior to carrier deployment. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training is vital and represents a significant military readiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. SCI is located 55 miles southwest of Long Beach. Meteorological data indicates that SCI emissions do not impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast Air Basin, and at best the contribution of air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from SCI to the South Coast air quality is not well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined. Consistent with EPA's request for comment on exempting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento and Ventura areas from the FIP commercial airport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, EPA also requests comments on exempting emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from on or near San Clemente Island from the FIP control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy, if aircraft are ultimately included in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed emission reduction requirements under a bubble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept for military air bases_regardless of whether it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes aircraft emissions_would be generally consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission cap requirements for stationary sources in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. Although not firmly decided, the current stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source control strategy for the South Coast requires that VOC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions be reduced by 20&hyph;45 and 30&hyph;45 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, from the 1990 baseline inventory by 2005, through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series of uniform annual reductions of baseline emissions of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutant: 4&hyph;9 percent per year for VOC and 6&hyph;9 percent per year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , both starting in 2001. Stationary source requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the 2006&hyph;2010 period have not been established at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until modified in a future rulemaking, the 2005 cap will apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 2010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements for Ventura from 2001&hyph;2005 are identical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that for the South Coast. For Sacramento, the strategy requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a VOC reduction of 20&hyph;45 percent, with uniform annual reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 4&hyph;9 percent. The timeframe for achieving this reduction is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same as for the South Coast and Ventura areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

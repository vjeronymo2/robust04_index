			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Zaripov and Igor Yavlyanskiy report under the </F> "Visits" rubric: "Final Parade Imminent"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- You will not believe it but Yeltsin  brought good weather with him to the banks of the Rhine. As the  government airplane approached the Bonn-Cologne airport, the fog  which until then had formed a thick shroud over the  Siebengebirge drifted off somewhere.    Boris Nikolayevich alighted from the airplane when the sky  had already cleared and a gentle sun was shining. We, of  course, are no experts in physiognomy but will make so bold as  to assert that the Russian president stepped onto German soil in  a good frame of mind. He even found an opportunity to give a  short interview by the steps of the airplane, though this was  not stipulated by the protocol.    "I want to sum up with my friend Helmut the results of the  two-year period since my last official visit to Bonn. We will  discuss -- what is more for the final time -- the arrangements  for withdrawing our troops from the FRG. Right down to the last  soldier. We intend to firmly insist that the celebratory  ceremony be held in Berlin."    Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces,  is  one of those who intend to insist to the end that Berlin is the  location. In addition to the arguments which have already been  presented, he added his own simplehearted soldier's argument:  "But 31 August (the completion date for our troops' withdrawal)  is a working day in Germany. Who will we have to take our leave  of? It is necessary to organize the send-off on a nonworking  day so that people come. It would be desirable to hold a  meeting in the Reichstag."    During the current visit, the heads of state will not sign  agreements and protocols. The only exception that has been made  is for the so-called "red" telephone -- the direct link between  the Kremlin and the Federal Chancellery. Foreign Ministers  Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel will confirm its right to exist  by adding their signatures.    Informed sources in the FRG Ministry of Foreign Affairs tell  us that the German leadership views this visit as an opportunity  to give Boris Nikolayevich "moral support." Bonn officials will  do all they can to make the high-ranking Russian guest feel that  he is head of a great power. [passage omitted]</p>

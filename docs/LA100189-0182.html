			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The six-month jail term of Christina LoCasto, a New York woman who gave birth  in a jetliner restroom then abandoned her newborn infant in a wastebasket, has  been delayed because she is expecting again. LoCasto, 27, of Staten Island, was  scheduled to begin serving time in Redwood City on Oct. 14 after she pleaded no  contest earlier this year to child endangerment. She was on a flight from  Newark, N.J., to San Francisco in 1988 when she went into labor and delivered a  baby girl, Alyssa, in a DC-10 restroom. She wrapped the infant in paper towels  and abandoned her in a waste basket beneath the sink, where it was later  discovered by a cleaning crew. LoCasto, who has two older daughters, ages 8 and  2, is expecting her fourth child at the end of October, after which she will  begin serving her sentence.  </P></p>

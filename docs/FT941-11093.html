			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / The Nature of Things: DNA, the case for the prosecution Our system of justice evolved at a time when people believed in absolute values. It works through an adversarial process to discover the truth about the defendant's guilt or innocence. Science operates quite differently. For all its competitiveness, it is essentially cooperative - and researchers are used to working with probabilities rather than absolute truths. The different processes and values of the two systems are now causing unprecedented tensions between criminal justice and science. The immediate issue is DNA profiling - perhaps the most powerful forensic technique discovered this century. Although everyone in the world has different genes (apart from identical twins) it is not yet technically feasible to produce an identifying print-out of an individual's genetic code. Instead, DNA profiling is a way of showing up differences in particular genetic sequences that vary to an extraordinary extent from one person to the next. Sir Alec Jeffreys invented the technique in 1984 at Leicester University. His laboratory procedure has 11 steps, including extracting DNA from a forensic sample such as blood or semen, slicing it up with special enzymes, separating the DNA fragments in an electric field and making them visible with radioactive probes on X-ray film. The resulting 'DNA fingerprint' is a pattern of bars or stripes reminiscent of a supermarket bar code. Within a year DNA profiles were being used to prove family relationships in paternity and immigration cases. The technique's first forensic triumph came in 1986 when Leicestershire police used DNA fingerprints to track down Colin Pitchfork, who had raped and murdered two 14-year-old girls. Over the following three years, police forces in the US and UK took up DNA profiling with enthusiasm and secured many convinctions with its help. But by 1989 critics were raising doubts about its validity and reliability; in several well publicised cases during the early 1990s, they convinced US judges not to allow the prosecution to present DNA evidence. Some of the early problems resulted from sloppiness and poor quality control in commercial testing labs that had introduced DNA profiling too rapidly. Most of those shortcomings have now been put right. At the heart of the current tensions between forensic science and the law is the way DNA evidence is presented in court. The point is that DNA profiling is not an absolutely precise technique; it is an indirect visualisation of genetic markers rather than a direct reading of genetic code. Even with a perfect match between a suspect and an incriminating sample, the forensic scientist can never be 100 per cent sure that this did not occur by chance. The degree of certainty about the suspect's guilt depends on a variety of technical factors, notably the amount of blood or semen available for testing and its quality. Under favourable conditions the odds may be billions to one on the match; with a tiny spot of dried blood, they may only be thousands or hundreds to one. The critics say that some over-enthusiastic forensic witnesses, egged on by the prosecution, have overstepped their proper role as providers of DNA evidence and have given what juries took as definitive statements of guilt. There is now a vigorous debate between lawyers, geneticists and statisticians about the correct basis for calculating probabilities of a match between a forensic sample and a suspect - and how to present these in court. In the US the National Academy of Sciences, which brought out an influential report on DNA profiling in 1992, is under pressure from the FBI to carry out a new study. In the UK the Court of Appeal has ordered the re-trial of a convicted rapist because of the way DNA evidence was used in his original trial. Statisticians are concerned that courts have been confused over two quite different probabilities. One is the chance that an innocent individual selected at random would have a DNA profile matching the forensic sample. In principle, an expert can estimate this from a technical knowledge of DNA profiling and population genetics. The second probability - the one that actually matters in court - is the chance that the suspect is innocent even though his DNA matches the sample. This is far harder to estimate because it depends on the circumstances of the case and the number of other potential suspects who might have carried out the crime. If there is no supporting evidence and the suspect was picked out from a mass DNA screening programme, the risk of convicting someone innocent will be far higher than the first probability would suggest. To illustrate the two probabilities, imagine that a rape suspect is arrested after genetic screening of 100,000 men in a particular city, simply because his DNA profile matches the forensic sample. Then, if one man in a million has this pattern - and no other evidence implicates the suspect - there is a 10 per cent chance that he is innocent. Such calculations highlight the dangers of what some statisticians call the 'prosecutor's fallacy' - the suggestion that the first probability is the same as the second. They also show how dangerous it is to convict someone on the basis of DNA evidence alone. DNA profiling is quite rightly becoming a routine tool of forensic science. It is probably used in about 1,000 forensic investigations a year in the UK  -to rule out innocent suspects as well as to convict the guilty. Most of these cases never come to court but, when they do, it is vital that all concerned should treat DNA evidence in a truly scientific way. In other words, lawyers have to become more familiar with thinking about probabilities rather than certainties.</p>

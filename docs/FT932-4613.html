			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (9): Freedoms, but no bonanza - Single European Market ALTHOUGH the Single European Market in air transport has now been in place since January 1, its effect to date has been less dramatic than many people both inside and outside the airline industry had hoped. There have been few 'new entrant' airlines and few new routes and services. Most of the activity on fares has been in reductions in a battle for the premium fare business class passengers, rather than the major cuts 'across the board' that many passengers had been led to expect. The 'Third Aviation Package,' giving effect to the SEM in air transport gave airlines three significant new 'freedoms'. First was the right to set their own fares, subject only to tightly drawn safeguards against unfair or predatory pricing, with the Commission itself having the right to arbitrate in the case of disputes. Second was that any airline meeting common safety, nationality and financial fitness criteria would be entitled to an operating licence anywhere in the Community (with restrictions on charter airlines being swept away) - the so- called 'freedom of access'. Member countries could still regulate access to domestic services for their own airlines, but only on a non-discriminatory basis - they could not do so just to protect national flag-carriers. Member-states also retained limited scope for restricting access where congestion or environmental problems could be demonstrated, but again only in a non-discriminatory way. Third was the introduction of 'consecutive cabotage' - the right of an airline from one country to operate limited capacity on onward domestic route sectors in other member countries (ie London to Frankfurt and then on to Berlin). Full cabotage - the right of any airline to fly anywhere in the Community - becomes effective only from April 1 1997. Earlier hopes that all this would amount to a bonanza for airlines and air travellers have foundered so far, with the European airline industry plagued by serious operating difficulties. These have been complicated by the airlines' efforts to achieve cross-border mergers or alliances so as to become larger and stronger players in the international aviation arena. One of the most difficult problems has been the persistence of the economic recession, which has savaged airline balance sheets - overall worldwide industry losses over the three years 1990-1992 are estimated at over Dollars 10bn, and will be further increased by end-93. A substantial proportion of those losses has been incurred in Europe. The result has been a paucity of new entrants to the industry. One has been Air Russia, in which BA has a 31 per cent stake, along with Aeroflot and other Russian aviation interests holding the other 69 per cent. Formally created last year, Air Russia is expected to start services to Europe next year at the latest. But the emphasis has been on the introduction of new routes by existing airlines (and even those have been comparatively limited), or increasing frequencies on existing services. Some routes have even been axed - for example, some European scheduled operations by Dan-Air were eliminated when British Airways acquired that airline last autumn. BA's German venture, Deutsche BA (formerly Delta Air), in which BA has a 49 per cent share, has introduced several new routes, including Berlin to Moscow, Munich to Ankara, Stuttgart to Venice and Munich to Dresden, while the French-based TAT, in which BA has a 49.9 per cent stake (with an option on the other 50.1 per cent), has also launched new services. By far the most active development has been in adding frequencies to existing routes to meet traffic growth. That occurs where the airlines concerned have either already been in possession of the necessary 'slots' - take-off times - or have been able to gain additional ones, often by juggling schedules to enable them to transfer less busy services to off-peak periods, thus releasing precious peak-time slots for more profitable operations. Apart from the economic climate, the slots problem is probably now the most serious constraint on the development of European air transport. Increasing traffic, the lack of adequate ground infrastructure (not only runways but also terminals), and the need for extensive improvements in air traffic control throughout Europe (because of not only past inadequate investment but also lack of harmonisation and integration of facilities throughout Europe) are all part of the problem. Efforts by the EC itself to solve the problem by preferential treatment for new entrants, stricter rules to deal with airlines failing to use allocated slots, and introducing more scheduling committees to control slot distribution at major airports, can be only temporary palliatives. Until increased infrastructural investment results in more runways, more terminals and fully harmonised and integrated air traffic control, the slots problem is likely to remain. The most evident effect of the SEM so far has been in the fares arena. But although Lufthansa cut fares early in the new year, and was followed by other airlines, in recent weeks the activity has been focused more on airlines' efforts to generate higher-yielding business class traffic, leading to a 'class war' throughout Europe, with Aer Lingus, Air France, British Midland and KLM among those involved, while other carriers have introduced reduced-rate season tickets, or improved the quality of cabin service. All this, however, has stemmed more from a desire to win back the many business travellers (and their employers), who in a recessionary economic climate were rebelling against the high costs of business class travel in Europe and trading down to economy class, than from a genuine desire on the part of the airlines to use the SEM fares freedom to generate overall traffic growth. European air transport has not been a money-spinner for some time. BA's 1991-92 annual report showed that Europe (including the UK) generated turnover of over Pounds 3.3bn (Pounds 911m of it from continental Europe), but produced an operating surplus of only Pounds 20m, the airline's strong profits in that year coming from other parts of the world. Many other airlines are in a comparable, if not a worse, position. This indicates that signif- icant cuts in European economy fares will do nothing for airline balance sheets, and will only be sustainable if accompanies by rigorous cost- cutting. It remains to be seen just how many EC airlines will be in a fit financial state by April 1 1997 to take advantage of the totally liberalised European air transport market that then becomes effective.</p>

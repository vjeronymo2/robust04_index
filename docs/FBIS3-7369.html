Tangun is the father of the Korean nation who was the first  king of Kojoson (ancient Korea) (3,000 B.C.-108 B.C.). Situated  in Kangdong County, Yongyang municipality, the 22 meter high  tomb will occupy an area of over 800,000 square metres when  reconstructed.    The great leader President Kim Il-song personally studied  the  legend of Tangun and materials about his tomb and saw to it that  the tomb was excavated. After the remains of Tangun and relics  were excavated and identified scientifically, President Kim  Il-song went out to the spot and gave instructions to rebuild  the tomb splendidly to be handed down to the generations to come.    Thus, Tangun who had long been known to be a mythical man  was  proved to have been a real man and the history of Kojoson  distorted by the Japanese imperialists when they occupied Korea  was established correctly.    Under the wise guidance of President Kim Il-song, cultural  heritages which had been severely destroyed by the U.S. and  Japanese imperialist aggressors have been reconstructed to be  preserved as treasures of the country and the nation.    In recent years, the tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder of  the Koguryo Dynasty (277 B.C.-668 A.D.) which was the strongest  country in the East, the tomb of King Wang Kon, the first king  of Koryo (918-1392) which was the first unified state in Korea,  the tomb of King Kogukwon (a king of Koguryo in the middle of  the 4th century), the tomb of King Kongmin (the 31st king of  Koryo) and tombs of other kings have been restored to their  original state.    The Kwangbop temple in Mt. Taesong (392), the Pohyon temple  in Mt. Myohyang (1042) and the Pyohun temple in Mt. Kumgano  (670), Buddhist temples showing the equisite architecture of the  Korean nation, and the wall on Mt. Taesong belonging to the  Koguryo Dynasty and the wall on Mt. Ongbang belonging to the  Koryo Dynasty and many other architectural heritages have been  splendidly rehabilitated.    The Songgyungwan Academy of Koryo (992), one of the first  universities in the world, was recently rebuilt on an expansion  basis to be turned into a university training light industrial  technicians.    The chronicles of the Yi Dynasty of 900 books in 1,763  volumes, the world largest governmental diary covering over 500  years of the feudal state of the Yi Dynasty, not omitting a  single day, has been published in modern Korean language.    The bibliographical book (25 volumes) of the "80,000 Blocks  of Complete Collection of Buddhist Scriptures" of 6,793 volumes,  a library of Buddhism belonging to the Koryo Dynasty, and the  selected translation of major sutras of the collection have been  published and a modern house for preserving the collection was  built in the scenic Mt. Myohyang.    Many classical books of history, culture, medical sceince  and  other fields such as "Tonguibogam", an encyclopedic book of  Koryo medicine, "The History of the Three Dynasties" "History of  the Koryo Dynasty", and "The Tale of Chun Hyang" have been  collected and arranged.    The Korean Central History Museum, the Korean Folklore  Museum  and Provincial History Museum are crowded with youth and  children and working people everyday.</p>

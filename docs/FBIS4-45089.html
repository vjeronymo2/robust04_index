			<p>CSO     [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE New Delhi -- The  Government is hoping to tighten the enforcement of copyright  laws against pirated video films and audio cassettes through new  training programmes to educate police and customs officials  about the intricacies of intellectual property rights.    Come November, a series of seminars will be held in Delhi in  collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organisation  in Geneva for senior levels of the police and customs  departments.    These seminars will shift later to the states for the  benefit  of junior officials.    The Centre is also planning to request the states to set up  a  Copyright Enforcement Cell which will oversee the enforcement of  the copyright laws.    Briefing mediapersons on the amended Copyright Law passed by  Parliament last week, Additional Secretary in the Education  Department, Y.N. Chaturvedi admitted that the Law was a  "brain-twister." Its implementation was faulty, he said, mainly  because the police, which is the enforcing agency, did not have  a basic knowledge of its provisions.    Regarding the recent Amendment, Chaturvedi said it would  have  "far reaching effects" in protecting the intellectual property  rights of creative artists, particularly the poorer and more  vulnerable ones.    One of the important changes introduced by the Amendment is  redefining what constitutes a copyrighted musical work. The  Amendment moves away from the traditional British definition  that musical compositions had to be written or notated to  warrant copyright protection.    "Since much of Indian music is not in the form of graphic  notations, the identity of a musical composition will now be  through its author," Chaturvedi said.    In addition, the Amendment for the first time gives rights  to  performers such as snake charmers, acrobats, conjurers, actors  and singers, making it mandatory for anybody to seek their  permission for a video or audio recording.    Computer programmes, cinematography films and sound  recordings have also been brought under the purview of the Act.</p>

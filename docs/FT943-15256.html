			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / US takes tough line on Haiti regime Mr William Gray, President Bill Clinton's adviser on Haiti, yesterday said resolution of the republic's crisis had now become 'a vital interest' to the peace and stability of the western hemisphere. In an interview on ABC TV, Mr Gray gave a firm warning that the military dictatorship - from which 10,000 Haitians fled last week - would not be allowed to remain in power. To allow the return of a dictatorship in the 1990s 'sends the kind of signal to potential dictatorships in our hemisphere that cannot be tolerated because of the instability that it would cause', he said. Administration officials interviewed yesterday had much the same message to deliver. Mr Gray, Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, stressed the endorsement of US policy towards Haiti at the G7 summit, and US efforts to work with the United Nations, and the Organisation of American States.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Ashot Aznuni report: "The 'Human Face' and the 'Fists' of </F> the Reforms"]    [Text] The economic situation in the republic underwent no  appreciable changes in the past week, which cannot be said about  its perception. I refer to a demonstration organized by the  republic Confederation of Trade Unions on Friday, which was  conducted to the accompaniment of socioeconomic slogans. There  are, truly, limits to society's patience and understanding of  the severe conditions under which the republic finds itself. The  government must clearly recognize that hungry people are  extremely unreceptive to reforms and that the efficient reform  of society is possible only under the conditions of the  assurance of minimum conditions for society's subsistence. The  demonstration also showed that the unions are not entirely happy  with their present relationship with the government.    The currency rates in the republic continue to be controlled  with a "firm hand" by the Central Bank, and the prices of the  basic consumer goods remain practically unchanged. A reduction  in prices has been recorded even in respect to a number of  commodity groups. True, the shortage of eggs had initially led  to a doubling and tripling of their price: from 400 to 800-1,200  drams. But a carton of eggs now costs 600-650 drams. The price  of cucumbers, tomatoes, and strawberries--all that has already  ripened and produced its first harvest--is gradually acquiring a  "human face."    The situation in the energy sphere has remained practically  unchanged (thank God!). The public is receiving its daily  four-hour electricity "ration"--even more, should there be any  surpluses.    Certain hopes are being linked with Fourth Armenian  Businessmen's Forum Conference, which is taking place at this  time in Yerevan and in which entrepreneurs from many countries  are participating. The minimum result of the forum will be, I  believe, the creation in our republic of a new international  bank and an open stock company--the Armenian Businessmen's  Corporation.    The final preparations for the start of privatization are  being made. Last week the government confirmed the list of the  first "small" facilities to be transferred to private ownership.  In June, according to the president, the sales assistant will,  finally, obtain his own set of scales, the tailor, a needle and  scissors, and so forth. Privatization certificates--vouchers  that should clearly identify each citizen of the republic's  share of the former general property--will, finally, arrive in  the republic this same month, the Ministry of Finance promises.</p>

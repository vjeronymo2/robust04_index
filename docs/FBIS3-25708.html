The opposition  is neck and neck with President Eyadema's party, but there have  been cries of foul over the conduct of the poll in the remaining  four seats, which were regarded as in the bag for the  opposition. Now the electoral commission has handed it all over  to the Supreme Court for ratification. But it seems some of the  commissioners are far from happy. From Lome, Ebow Godwin  reports:    [Begin Godwin recording] Togo's National Electoral  Commission waded into deep crisis today following decision by  four opposition members serving on the commission to resign  their posts. The resignation of the four follows the delay by  the commission in releasing results of voting in five  constituencies in which voting was disrupted by violence during  last Sunday's second round of voting. A spokesman for the  opposition representative, Pastor Lawson, told reporters that  they were pulling out of the commission because of intimidation.    Yesterday, Togo's electoral commission said it was  withholding results from the five disputed constituencies  pending a ruling by the Supreme Court. That decision came only  a few hours to the 72-hour deadline within which the commission  was required by law to publish all provisional election results.  Yesterday's statement said that the commission has submitted  all 19 results out of the outstanding 24 constituencies to the  Supreme Court for ratification. But opposition sources said they  have no confidence in the country's constitutional chamber of  the Supreme Court which has to determine petitions, because it  is filled with appointees of President Gnassingbe Eyadema.  Currently, the constituencies under litigation include two in  Wawa, in the north, one in Haho in southern Togo, one in Sokode  in central Togo, and one in the Lome metropolis.    Under Togo's electoral laws, Togo's Supreme Court has 15  days  within which to make a ruling on the petition. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Metal Exchange COPPER market continued to be supported yesterday by technical tightness, which showed no sign of easing. The cash position reversed the week's downtrend to close Dollars 17.50 higher at Dollars 1,942 a tonne, while three months delivery metal was up Dollars 5 at Dollars 1,897.50 a tonne. In the ALUMINIUM market the decline of the previous few days was arrested in the afternoon and the three months position closed Dollars 4.75 up at Dollars 1,199.50 a tonne. Dealers said the upturn was in response to a US option enquiry that caused some to speculate that a North American production cut might be in the offing. Solid support prevented the NICKEL market from extending an early fall to fresh six-year lows. The three months price steadied to close at Dollars 4,825 a tonne, still Dollars 56.50 down on the day, and moved up to Dollars 4,830 in kerb trading. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures closed with small gains, boosted primarily by the weakness of sterling against the dollar. Dealers said the medium-term outlook appeared constructive, aided by expectations of another deficit in 1993-94. Compiled from Reuters</p>

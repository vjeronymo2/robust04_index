			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Textile industry attacks 'cynical' tariff plan THE US textile industry, a key and unwilling participant in the Uruguay Round, is denouncing a reported European Community proposal to cut US and European textile tariffs to zero as a 'cynical and transparent attempt to divert blame for the impasse in the negotiations to the US', writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Mr Carlos Moore, executive director of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, said the EC was reported to be backing elimination of textile tariffs in both the US and Europe and a 50 per cent cut in all apparel tariffs. 'This is a ploy, because we have spoken with our counterparts in Europe and they oppose what the EC has put on the table,' Mr Moore said. A phasing out of textile tariffs would go well beyond the already steep cuts reportedly backed by Mrs Carla Hills, the former US trade representative, who 'agreed on some body of tariff cuts by 50 per cent', he said, adding that industry officials had concluded the EC wanted to cut US textile tariffs to divert production from the developing countries to America. 'Our industry and the European industry are already making an enormous contribution to trade liberalisation by honouring demands by developing countries to phase out the quotas,' Mr Moore said. Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general, has proposed eliminating quotas over 10 years; Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has indicated US support for a longer quota phase-out - perhaps as long as 15 years. In Washington, trade lobbyists have been speculating that once Congress gives President Bill Clinton a renewal of his Gatt fast-track negotiating authority - due to pass this week - Mr Kantor will feel considerably less constrained about making concessions on textiles. However, the Senate finance committee last week sent a letter to Mr Clinton restating Congress' negotiating objective for the round. This included a request to negotiate tariff cuts only 'where our private sector favours such an action and significant trading partners concur'. Mr Moore seemed confident Mr Kantor would not call on the industry to make additional contributions to the round's success. 'Kantor is very concerned about the damage to this economy if an enormous number of textile and apparel jobs are lost. I don't think he finds enormous employment benefits in reducing low tariffs in Europe to zero,' he said. 'It could cost us more than 1m jobs. Does the US gain 1m jobs in semiconductors and pharmaceuticals? Not hardly.'</p>

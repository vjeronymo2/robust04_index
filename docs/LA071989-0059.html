			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD OKS CRITERIA FOR COUNCIL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education has approved guidelines for selecting  district representatives to a new central committee that will oversee  decentralization efforts.  </P> <P> Under the teachers' contract ratified last month, the district agreed to  establish a 24-member council that would supervise the district's move into new  forms of school governance that give teachers and parents a larger role in  running schools. The committee will oversee new neighborhood school "shared  decision-making councils," which were among the most controversial features of  the contract.  </P> <P> According to guidelines adopted Monday, five of the district's 12 appointees  will be named by Supt. Leonard Britton and will include Deputy Supt. Sidney  Thompson, a parent or community member and two principals. The other seven  appointments will be made by board members and must be parents or community  representatives. Under terms of the contract, the district must name its  appointees by July 31.  </P> <P> The remaining 12 council seats will be filled by members of United Teachers-Los  Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tradition takes a back seat in mozzarella market - A victory for cows over buffaloes THE MOZZARELLA cheese business has become one of the fastest growing agricultural foodstuff sectors in Italy. Production has increased threefold in the past five years and now sales are generating an annual turnover of about Ll,950bn (Pounds 820m). The growing popularity of mozzarella inside Italy and abroad has placed the bulk of new demand on fior di latte - the cheaper and more industrially produced cows' milk version. Only about 10 per cent of the market is held by what Italians consider the real mozzarella, made from buffalo milk. This differs from the cows' milk product in its more pronounced flavour and softer, fattier texture, as well as its porcelain white colour. Such special characteristics do not come cheap. Mozzarella made from buffalo milk costs roughly twice as much as ordinary mozzarella: usually L20,000 to L23,000 a kilogram, compared with L12,000 or less for the best cows' milk cheese. Only as a result of intense lobbying was the cows' milk product allowed to call itself mozzarella in 1987. Buffalo milk producers bitterly resent this broadening of the product name and have been fighting a rear-guard action ever since. With more than 90 per cent of buffalo-milk mozzarella produced in southern Italy, mostly on small-holdings, it is perhaps not surprising that the lobbying of the bigger and better organised northern dairy farmers won their case. Within the industry, it is also said that the growing mozzarella business was one element encouraging farmers to over-produce on Italy's European Community milk quota. The limited amount of buffalo mozzarella produced each year will probably prevent it ever proving a serious threat to fior di latte's dominance. This is partly the result of natural factors: buffalo give most milk in winter, when mozzarella is not much eaten, and much less in summer when fresh cheeses are popular. This has led to a great deal of fraud, with cow's milk being substituted in summer in order to satisfy demand. Buffalo farms are generally small - only about 100 have more than 200 animals - and as 75 per cent of buffalo mozzarella is made in the farm, the small scale of operations makes mechanisation expensive. Larger dairies have mechanised the entire process of cheese-making, as well as packaging, but if many small dairies have a machine for moulding the cheese, they carry out most other operations manually. The fragmentation of production of the buffalo milk cheese inhibits a national network of distribution - in any case complicated because of the need for the product to be sold fresh. Between 30 and 35 per cent of buffalo mozzarella is sold directly to consumers at the dairy. Only 10 per cent reaches the north of Italy. Mozzarella using cow's milk has been much more successful in establishing mass production, and 90 per cent of the market is held by four large companies: Galbani, Invernizzi, Locatelli and Kraft. Its production is almost entirely mechanised, while distribution is so efficient that a consumer survey by Largo Consumo found the cheese present even in small supermarkets 100 per cent of the time. Nevertheless, according to Mr Alfredo Jemma, a big independent buffalo producer near Naples, 'buffalo mozzarella may take only a small slice of the market, but she is queen'. When the buffalo product is present, consumers are apt to pick it instead of ordinary mozzarella. Its craftsman-like quality is attractive to the modern consumer, keen to indulge in and prepared to pay substantially for the riches of what the Italian Ministry of Agriculture calls 'a society immersed in alimentary well-being'. Even the large buffalo dairies, which use machines, continue to make a certain quantity of cheese by hand to cater for this demand. Mr. Jemma explains: 'It is an unbeatable method as far as quality is concerned'. As a result, even without the help of government or EC subsidies, small businesses have been able to survive through the popularity of the quality, high-value food they produce. Scale of operation is not so important. 'You can make a good living with a dairy, even with 200 kg (per day),' comments Mr. Michele D'Amato, who sells mozzarella in the town of Eboli, just south of Naples. The government has recognised the special qualities of buffalo mozzarella, even if it gave way on the trade denomination of mozzarella to include fior di latte. Negotiations are under way for the cheese to go a step further from its current status as a 'typical' product and become a 'DOC' (controlled origin) one. More important from the standpoint of the Italian dairy industry's fortunes within the EC, buffalo mozzarella will probably qualify as a DOC cheese. Italy imports L1,665bn worth of cheese, but exports only L521bn worth because local production costs are so high. This also applies to fior di latte. At present, in fact, Luxembourg exports more mozzarella per head of population than Italy. Buffalo mozzarella on the other hand falls within the bracket that constitutes the country's strength in the export field: typical, quality cheeses difficult to imitate abroad. The passage of mozzarella into EC consciousness will not be without problems, however. Popularity has brought problems in the form of hygiene regulations that seem to militate against traditionalism. The EC is now pressing for the pasteurisation of buffalo milk, to the dismay of producers. Says Mr Jemma, who himself pasteurises his milk: 'The best, the pure type of mozzarella is made with unpasteurised milk - what does the EC know about mozzarella?' Exports of buffalo mozzarella require air transport to ensure top quality. This is particularly expensive because of the need for the cheese to be transport with liquid - at least a kilogram to every kilogram of mozzarella. Producers argue that in order to export successfully they will need a subsidy, and an application for this is now in progress. Machine-made buffalo mozzarella lasts about five times longer than hand-made. Transportation without liquid also extends its shelf-life. Some companies vacuum pack their exports, in which case the mozzarella will last for more than 30 days. However, producers tend to turn up their noses at the consumers of this type of product. In the south, mozzarella is considered no longer edible after two days and is used for pasta and pizza recipes. One producer who vacuum packs his cheese for consumption in the US, commented: 'As far as I'm concerned, they're not eating mozzarella at all'. It seems then that buffalo farmers will aim for the top section of the market, and leave the bulk to the cheaper cows' milk product. In spite of the complaints of producers, the widespread use of ordinary mozzarella has probably helped the buffalo type. Now the lesser product has been thoroughly absorbed into eating habits, people will be prepared, perhaps, to pay dearly for the very best.</p>

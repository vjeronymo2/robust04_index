			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Books: View at Narni View at Narni by Camille Corot - taken from Corot in Italy: Open-Air Painting and the Classical-Landscape Tradition by Peter Galassi (Yale Pounds 35, 258 pages, 284 illustrated in colour and black and white). This picture was exhibited at the Salon of 1827 and is one of his most striking Italian landscapes, painted nine or ten months after arriving in Rome. It was once owned by Degas and is now in the National Gallery, London. Mr Galassi argues not only that Corot's open-air studies point forward to Impressionism but also that they marked the culmination of the earlier classical landscape tradition. A major Corot exhibition is to be held in Manchester City Art Gallery from May 18-June 30, to be accompanied by another book - Corot and the Art of Landscape by Michael Clarke (British Museum Press Pounds 19.95, 160 pages with 135 colour and black and white illustrations). This book provides an Anglo-Saxon perspective on the artist, examining Corot's life and work, and his influence on a generation of painters after him.</p>

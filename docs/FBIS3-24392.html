			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by M. Petrova and N. Manzhurin: "And No Loose Ends"] </F>   [Text] Our correspondent asked Senior Counselor of Justice  V.N. Chichayev, a senior assistant to the Maritime Kray  procurator, for comments on everything that took place in the  mayoralty:    "On 15 March a decision was made to initiate criminal  proceedings against City of Vladivostok Mayor V.I. Cherepkov.  And since he is a candidate for a deputy to the kray duma, in  keeping with the Temporary Statute on the Elections to the  Maritime Kray Duma, he cannot be the subject of criminal  proceedings or subjected to administrative punitive measures  imposed by the court, without a concurrence of the kray  procurator. A measure to secure the appearance of the accused  and other criminal process measures may be applied to a  candidate only by the ruling of the kray court; therefore, the  kray procurator did grant his consent. There is also a kray  court ruling."    This is the process basis. The requirements of the law  formally have been observed in this case.    "But was it necessary to do it all so crudely, with the help  of the OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments]?"    "Having received the procuracy investigator's decision, the  kray administration had all the grounds to carry it out. In what  form to conduct this action is no longer the issue of a legal  process, but a purely administrative one. If the law has been  violated in the process of carrying out this decision, then the  procuracy will look into it. Meanwhile, one side is standing  there with posters, while the other guards the mayoralty; we do  not have any problems with either. Problems will come up when  unlawful actions are committed on one or the other side. So far  we have not received such information.    "This is all I can say regarding the events around the  mayoralty."  <H6>  * * * </H6>   To the question whether it would be possible to review the  kray procurator's decision--which, by the way, had been read  over kray radio--Veniamin Chichayev replied that he does not  have this document in his possession and does not even know its  registration number.    Just as fruitless turned out the search for a copy of the  decision by A.I. Vysotskiy, a deputy procurator and an  investigator of the Frunzenskiy Rayon Procuracy. Like kray  procurator V.V. Vasilenko, he also took sick and was not in the  office. As to Aleksandr Ivanovich's colleagues, they said that  they do not have any documents relevant to this case.    No documents in which we were interested were at the kray  administration's press service. Neither were we able to meet  with deputy head of the kray administration I.P. Lebedinets, who  had signed the decree on I.V. Cherepkov's dismissal and directed  the operation on the seizure of the "Gray House." We were told  that he probably had gone on a trip to Ussuriysk.    An interesting kind of glasnost. For the chosen only.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   We telephoned the kray court chairman, N.S. Vinogradova, and  asked her to comment on the events that had taken place on the  night from 16 to 17 March in Vladivostok.    "No comment; all questions should be directed to the kray  procuracy," said Nina Sergeyevna. And confirmed at the same time  that the court is aware of the happenings and has given its  permission for such measures, based on some local-level  documents....    Nina Sergeyevna refused to show the newspaper any official  court document on the subject.</p>

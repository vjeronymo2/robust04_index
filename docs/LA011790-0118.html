			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: PATIENCE IS A NECESSITY, NOT VIRTUE FOR RAMS  </P> <P> Three days after the Rams burst and we're still bailing . . .  </P> <P> Steve Young picked up 40-some sympathizers to the cause Sunday after San  Francisco out-zeroed the Rams, 30-3.  </P> <P> Waiting for Joe Montana to retire is now a Ram concern.  </P> <P> Young has been waiting since 1987, when he thought it was a great time to leave  the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and become a 49er. Remember the back surgery that  ended Montana's quarterbacking career back in '86?  </P> <P> Reincarnation has been wonderful to Montana, who, post-op, is three-for-three  in NFC West championships and bidding for a second consecutive Super Bowl  title. Young, meanwhile, has become his generation's Earl Morrall -- backup to  a legend -- and will probably be Steve Old before Montana calls it quits.  </P> <P> How long will the Rams have to wait on the sidelines of the Super Bowl? The  early prognosis isn't bright. The rest of Montana's body is 33, but his back is  only 3.  </P> <P> More than that, Montana is 8-0 against the Rams at Anaheim Stadium, a big 1-0  against them in NFC championship games and commander of the same type of  damn-him respect the Rams used to have for Roger Staubach and Fran Tarkenton.  </P> <P> As long as Young remains the odd man out, figure the Rams to be the awed men  out.  </P> <P> Play of the game? How about Ronnie Lott's great retreat on Jim Everett's  underthrow to Flipper Anderson as play of the year?  </P> <P> Before Lott's startling recovery, Everett looked his normal self against the  49ers -- five of eight for 61 yards to five receivers.  </P> <P> After the deflection, Everett's next eight passes produced three completions,  three incompletions and two interceptions, leading to a 14-3 49er lead.  </P> <P> Everett appeared rattled the rest of the game, the confidence that had carried  him through the Philadelphia and New York games was ebbing with each dropback.  And with their leader shaken, the Rams didn't need long to follow suit.  </P> <P> Thanks a Lott.  </P> <P> The name is Harold Jackson. The date was Dec. 26, 1976. The play was a  five-yard pass from Pat Haden.  </P> <P> The significance?  </P> <P> Jackson is the last Ram to score a touchdown in an NFC championship game. Since  that reception, which closed the Rams' scoring in a 24-13 loss to Minnesota,  the Rams have been to four NFC title games -- and have come away with four  field goals.  </P> <P> 1978: Dallas 28, Rams 0  </P> <P> 1979: Rams 9, Tampa Bay 0  </P> <P> 1985: Chicago 24, Rams 0  </P> <P> Last Sunday: San Francisco 30, Rams 3  </P> <P> And they somehow got to one Super Bowl through all of that.  </P> <P> Lucky team.  </P> <P> Most valuable Ram: Everett. We saw what happened when he was off his game.  </P> <P> Most improved Ram: Anderson. And to think Terry Donahue once had Anderson, Troy  Aikman and Gaston Green in the same offense.  </P> <P> Rookie Ram: Mike Piel. The winner by technicality -- he was drafted in 1988 but  spent all of that season on injured reserve -- and by default. Piel started six  regular-season games and all three playoff games, filling one of the Rams'  chasms at defensive end. The only other rookies to start at least one game were  linebacker Frank Stams (three starts) and defensive tackle Bill Hawkins (one).  </P> <P> Underrated Ram: Buford McGee. Did a little of everything and everything well.  Sunday, he was about the only receiver Everett could get the ball to.  </P> <P> The Rams' top five needs for 1990:  </P> <P> 1. A cornerback.  </P> <P> 2. A pass rusher.  </P> <P> 3. A cornerback.  </P> <P> 4. A pass rusher.  </P> <P> 5. A punter.  </P> <P> They'll probably draft a quarterback.  </P> <P> Five reasons for Rams to believe in 1990:  </P> <P> 1. The comebacks against New Orleans, Dallas, New England and New York. Yes,  the Rams can play clutch football.  </P> <P> 2. Bill Hawkins, Clifford Hicks, Anthony Newman, Doug Reed and Vincent Newsome  will be healthy again.  </P> <P> 3. Everett, Anderson, Robert Delpino, Fred Strickland, Larry Kelm and Cleveland  Gary will be a year wiser.  </P> <P> 4. Jerry Gray moves to free safety, closing the Ronnie Lott gap.  </P> <P> 5. The 49ers could get bored with Super Bowls.  </P> <P> Things we'll miss by the Rams missing New Orleans:  </P> <P>  -- The LeRoy Irvin Show going national. A loss for all humanity.  </P> <P>  -- Seven days of John Robinson recounting the Dickerson trade.  </P> <P>  -- Seven days of John Robinson recounting the Everett trade.  </P> <P>  -- "So, Willie, why do they call you Flipper?"  </P> <P>  -- Rammy Whammy II towels and other great souvenir possibilities. Fritz Grits,  anyone?  </P> <P>  -- A Ram victory over Denver. It would've happened. The NFL championship was  decided last Sunday at Candlestick.  </P></p>

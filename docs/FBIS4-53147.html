			<p>BFN     [Text] HANOI, May 17 (AFP) -- Vietnam denied Tuesday that  four monks imprisoned last year following protests in the  central city of Hue are on hunger strike and are seriously ill.    A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed as "totally false" a  report by the Paris-based International Buddhist Information  Bureau (IBIB) that the four members of the dissident Unified  Vietnamese Buddhist Church were on a hunger strike to protest  their conditions at the Ba Sao re-education camp south of Hanoi.    The monks were arrested and charged with "disturbing public  order" after demonstrations in the former imperial capital of  Hue last May 24. They were sentenced to prison terms of three  to four years after a trial in November.    In a statement released in Paris, the IBIB called on the  Vietnamese government to allow representatives of the United  Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to  visit the monks.    Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the repair or  renovation on nearly all the country's more than 4,000 pagodas  in the past three years and the increase in the number of monks  and nuns from 17,000 to more than 20,000.    They maintain, however, that all Buddhist "sects" should be  integrated into the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was founded  in 1982 under the umbrella of the Communist Party's Fatherland  Front.    Authorities also refused access to French lawyers who  applied  to defend the three monks at their trial and has not allowed  journalists or human rights groups to visit the re-education  camp where they are held.    The leader of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Church, the  Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, is also believed by human rights  groups to be held under house arrest.    The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated Hanoi's stance  that  the monks were tried legitimately for causing public unrest.  The protest flared after monks thought police had come to  arrest the head of the Link Mu pagoda in Hue.</p>

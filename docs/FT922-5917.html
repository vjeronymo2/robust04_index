			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 7% rise pushes Carlton over Pounds 49m CARLTON Communications, the television production and services group, announced slightly better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 49.4m for the six months to end-March. Mr Michael Green, chairman, said the group had 'confronted successfully' trading conditions which he described as uncertain and demanding. Analysts are suggesting full year profits of some Pounds 103m. The shares rose 19p to 667p. Carlton, which takes over the London weekday licence, the largest in the ITV system, from Thames on January 1, produced a a 13 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 324.7m; profit showed a 7 per cent rise over the corresponding Pounds 46.3m. Earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 16.85p (15.13p), and the interim dividend is increased 10 per cent to 6.7p (6.1p) reflecting Mr Green said, 'a cautious reaction to a welcome recovery in our main markets.' Mr Green said the group remained financially strong with net cash of Pounds 146m, excluding the indebtedness of Pickwick, the video group acquired in March. The group also announced yesterday that Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, will become a non-executive director from the beginning of June. Mr Green had long been an admirer of the business skills of Sir Derek, who has in the past attended an occasional Carlton board meeting in an informal capacity and provided background advice on big deals. Video and audio production and distribution increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 12.5m). Growth was expected in the second half as Hollywood studios moved towards announcing their latest 'sell-through' videos in advance. That, Carlton said, would help planning at its Technicolor subsidiary. Profits at video and sound products - the sophisticated editing and recording equipment provided by subsidiaries such as Quantel and Abekas  - fell from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 8m, but were up on the preceding six months. Television and film services produced flat profits at Pounds 13.7m. Mr Green said last night he was not over-concerned if Premier League football was shown live on Sky Television next season. ITV would still show quality football. 'We know how to operate in competitive markets. If Sky is showing a London derby match we will not be scheduling Sooty against it,' Mr Green said last night.</p>

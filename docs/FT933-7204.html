			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: BNP, Dresdner confirm Russian deal DRESDNER Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris have secured a licence to set up a joint bank in Russia. Mr Volker Burghagen, head of Dresdner's international division, said yesterday the partners would open the offices of BNP-Dresdner Bank Rossiya in St Petersburg on September 10, regardless of whether parliament passed a new law limiting foreign banking activity from next January until 1996. BNP and Dresdner have hired a staff of 80 and spent around DM2m (Dollars 1.19m) on setting up the operation, which will have a capital of Dollars 10m. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, last week sent back to parliament a law which would restrict foreign-owned banks established in Russia to dealing only with non-residents. The government has told parliament the law, which would reverse the terms of licences already given, would damage Russia's shaky investment environment. Mr Burghagen expressed confidence that the law would 'not survive, at least in its present form'. He noted that the government, the central bank, and even parliament's own banking commission were opposed to it. 'This law is outright nonsense and must be changed in the interests of the development of the Russian economy. But we shall see.' The law, passed at a second reading by deputies with the support of Russian banks, would mean that foreign-owned banks in Russia could not take deposits from Russian companies, including joint ventures, which account for most of the foreign investment in the Russian economy so far. But although President Yeltsin has attached four pages of objections to the proposed legislation, it will become law if parliament passes it at a third reading. Mr Yeltsin, who is currently pressing for new elections to usher in a new parliament and constitution, does not have the right to veto a law a second time. Despite answering to parliament, the central bank has defended giving licences to foreign banks by saying foreign competition is needed to improve the standards of Russian commercial banking, and to encourage foreign investment. Before giving a licence to BNP and Dresdner - which also plan to set up a joint bank in Poland as part of an international alliance - the central bank had given a similar go-ahead to Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, and the Bank of China. Bank Austria has a more limited offshore banking licence, which would be within the rules proposed by parliament. Other western banks, including two US banks, are waiting in the wings. Although foreign banks do not plan to take rouble deposits to start with, the Russian banks say they are afraid the foreign banks will steal their prized hard-currency deposits. They say they need time to prepare for competition, but many Russian enterprises are naturally inclined to trust renowned foreign banks more than the vast majority of Russia's 1,800 institutions calling themselves commercial banks. Part of the problem is that they are under little pressure to perform from domestic authorities, which lack supervisory skills and have yet to start badly-needed restructuring of the Russian banking sector.</p>

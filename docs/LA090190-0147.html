			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER KILLS PIT BULL AFTER ATTACKS ON PETS;  </P> <P> ANIMALS: THE DOG KILLED A NEIGHBORHOOD CAT, ATTACKED A TERRIER AND THEN TRIED  TO COME AFTER THE POLICEMAN.  </P> <P> A Newport Beach police officer shot and killed a pit bull Thursday night after  the dog killed a neighborhood cat, attacked another pet and then tried to come  after the officer, police reported.  </P> <P> Police said the dog broke through the fence at the residence where he was being  kept while his owner was out of town.  </P> <P> About 6:45 p.m., a resident of the 1200 block of Devon Lane called police to  report that a loose pit bull had attacked and killed his 14-year-old cat,  police department spokesman Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> "At this point, the officer realizes that this is a very violent animal," Gonis  said. He added that an animal control officer was called to the scene as well.  </P> <P> The officer was trying to contain the dog in one of the yards when it attacked  another pet.  </P> <P> "Two people were walking on the public sidewalk, walking with a smaller  Airedale terrier," Gonis said. "Then the pit bull bolts across the street and  starts attacking the terrier."  </P> <P> To break up the dog fight, the officer hit the dog on its head with his baton,  momentarily stunning the animal.  </P> <P> But as the officer backed away, the dog came toward him, Gonis said.  </P> <P> With about 2 feet between him and the dog, the officer fired two rounds at the  animal, fatally wounding the dog with the second shot, he said. The terrier  survived the attack.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed in the incident, and there were no injuries to the  people involved.  </P> <P> Gonis said the owner of the pit bull, a Costa Mesa resident, was out of town at  the time of the incident.  </P></p>

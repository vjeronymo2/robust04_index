			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Councils doubt adequacy of age funding provisions: Today sees the implementation of the government's care in the community initiative which moves the onus on to local councils FEW POLICY changes have been heralded with a more potent cocktail of goodwill and doubt than today's care in the community reforms. Politicians of all parties, doctors and social workers applaud the central objective - to care for elderly and handicapped people in the community rather than in institutions. That is the goodwill. The doubt arises over finance. One of the political objectives of the reforms is to end a bias in public funding arrangements that has encouraged the growth of residential care because social security benefits have been available to pay for it. From today local authority social services departments will be responsible for deciding how individuals' needs should be met, either in residential care or at home. The previous system was demand-led - people who qualified for social security support could use their entitlement like a residential care voucher when looking for a home. The system's replacement will be cash-limited within the overall local government financing structure. In 1993-94, Pounds 399m will be transferred from the social security budget to local authorities - based on calculations of the number of new residents who would have entered homes this year had the old system continued - plus an additional Pounds 140m in start-up costs. The social security transfers will rise to Pounds 1.05bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.56bn in 1995-96. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, squeezed more money from the Treasury than her critics expected in the current difficult public spending climate. Doubts still remain about whether the money is enough. The Commons health committee said last month that its efforts to judge the adequacy of funding had been 'hampered by a lack of transparency about the assumptions used by the Department of Health'. Some local authorities believe the government had under-estimated the number of people who would have entered homes this year under the old system. People living in homes before today's changes are excluded from the new arrangements, but many already suffer from a shortfall between levels of social security payment and residential home fees. Ministers hope local authorities will use their bargaining muscle as bulk purchasers of residential care to drive prices down. Some local authority leaders and home operators are not as optimistic. Mr David Wigley, chief executive of Methodist Homes, one of the biggest charitable residential care providers, says his charity already spends Pounds 400,000 a year subsidising social security-financed residents in its homes. A Methodist Homes' survey of 41 English and Welsh local authorities revealed that more than one third would limit expenditure on residential care under the new system to social security levels. For elderly people without personal resources, the gap between income support and home fees is sometimes met by relatives. Others depend on charities, but a number of these are withdrawing from topping-up payments. Mr Geoff Smith, general manager of the charity Counsel and Care for the Elderly, says: 'We will meet existing commitments, but have concluded that it is not an appropriate use of charitable funds to subsidise the social security system. The reforms will not work properly unless they are adequately funded. But the problem is that inadequate funding will not necessarily show in a coherent way. Poverty often just disappears into individual misery.'</p>

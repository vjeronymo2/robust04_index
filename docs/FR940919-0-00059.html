			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The universal treatment standards, described in detail in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next section, greatly simplify both compliance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement with the LDRs, without sacrificing protection of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment or human health. In particular, the rule replaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the myriad constituent concentration levels in the LDR treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for most hazardous wastes with a uniform set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent levels. Thus, the treatment standard concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a constituent in waste A will be the same concentration as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for that constituent in waste B. As a result, hazardous waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generators and treaters should be able to save money and effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in treating hazardous wastes. These facilities will be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate more efficiently by consolidating treatment activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One facility, for example, estimated an annual savings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $750,000 from not having to campaign treat their wastes with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varying limits. The consistency provided by universal treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards will make it easier to comply with the LDRs. Likewise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the universal treatment standards will make the job of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement easier for state governments. With universal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards in place, it will also be easier and quicker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for EPA to set standards for hazardous wastes identified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future (assuming those standards are feasible and appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly identified and listed wastes). The end result for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated community, states, and the EPA will be to save  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources for other pressing tasks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While establishment of universal treatment standards is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary improvement, other improvements are also included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule. In particular, the Agency is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consolidating three separate tables containing treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards into a single consolidated table;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reducing the information required on notification forms;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Simplifying the regulations for treatment of lab packs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Providing easy-to-read flowcharts and a simple guide to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paperwork requirements in order to make the rule's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements clearer and easier to implement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although today's rule takes significant steps in improving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Land Disposal Restrictions program, the Agency recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that further, in fact continuing, improvement is necessary. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the universal treatment standards (such as cyanide) will need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be reassessed upon completion of Agency efforts to improve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytic test method. HWIR will need to be integrated into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Land Disposal Restrictions. The Agency is also on a firm track  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of pursuing other avenues for continuous quality improvement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program. Ideas and suggestions for improvements have, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will, come from: (1) Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published by EPA in order to acquire as much information as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible from the public about treatment options; (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communications between EPA and its customers representing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental groups, generators, and treaters; and, (3) the LDR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program evaluation that is currently being conducted, which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiated by a public roundtable discussion with a large number of customers. Consequently, the Agency will continue to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantage of opportunities to streamline and improve the LDR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Universal Treatment Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is promulgating a single universal treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard (UTS) for each constituent in nonwastewater form and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single UTS for each constituent in wastewater form, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazardous waste containing the constituent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Identification of Wastes to Which Universal Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards Apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The universal treatment standards apply to all listed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic wastes for which treatment standards have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated, with two exceptions. The first exception is the TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metal wastes (D004&hyph;D011). These metal wastes will be addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the future Phase IV LDR rule. (It should be noted that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral processing wastes which were formerly excluded from RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle C regulation under the Bevill Amendment are considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be newly identified and will also be addressed in Phase IV.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second exception is those for which the treatment standard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specified method of treatment. Most of these wastes must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be treated using those required technologies. For a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small number of wastes with previously specified methods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, the universal standards are an alternative, i.e.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either use of the specified method or the universal standard will satisfy the LDR requirement. For those few situations where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture of wastes may be subject to different standards for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same constituent, the more stringent standard continues to apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See &sect;268.41(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the proposed rule excluded F024 from the UTS, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is applying UTS to F024 in today's rule. The existing standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which were unique among standards set for F- or K-listed wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated numerical treatment standards and also mandated a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific technology_incineration. The original F024 numerical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for metals were also exceptionally low, reflecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact that F024 contains only low levels of metals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, comments from Dow Freeport indicated that the low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F024 metal limit needlessly prevented them from co-treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, a process that could save the facility $750,000/year, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that application of UTS solved this problem without diminishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent of treatment. EPA agrees, and is applying UTS to F024  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rule while continuing to require incineration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTS apply to underlying hazardous constituents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic wastes that are subject to LDRs. Apparent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion in several comments leads the Agency to clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTS will apply to the F039 waste code, the code for multi-source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leachate. EPA used the F039 levels in the May 1993 Interim Final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule as treatment standards for underlying hazardous constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in certain decharacterized D001 and D002 wastes (58 FR 29885).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, UTS levels and F039 standards are identical, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exception of those few constituents regulated in F039 but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in UTS. This means that the Interim Final Rule requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying hazardous constituents in certain D001 and D002 wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet F039 levels is now one and the same thing with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that underlying hazardous constituents meet UTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The term ``underlying hazardous constituents'' is defined at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.2(i)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Differences in Universal Treatment Standards and Previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In most cases (59%), UTS are the same as the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards. Thirty three percent of the standards went  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up or down within a factor of ten of the original standard, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8% underwent larger changes (3% of the total number of UTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becoming significantly more stringent). The following table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lists the differences between the UTS and previous standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BEGINNER'S PLUCK  </P> <P> Marcia Dinneen concedes that she's a bit naive about the ways of the film  industry. The Minneapolis writer -- currently working there as a shipping clerk  -- only discovered that her original screenplay for "An Unremarkable Life" had  started filming when star Patricia Neal called to chat -- six weeks into  production.  </P> <P> "She said, 'This is Patricia Neal -- I'm starring in your movie,' " recalled  Dinneen, who added, "This is my very first attempt at writing a screenplay, so  I'm learning the ropes. When it was sold, I just assumed it would automatically  be produced."  </P> <P> The recently released pic is about two small-town Pennsylvania sisters --  played by Neal and Shelley Winters -- whose self-protective routine is upset  when a local auto mechanic (Mako) begins courting Neal's character.  </P> <P> After selling her script to producer-director Amin Q. Chaudhri, Dinneen wasn't  involved in revisions, and is vague about her reaction to the movie. She's just  completed her second screenplay and is talking with L.A. agents.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think it's a glamorous life," she said of her years of writing  -- from articles to radio scripts. "They don't know how much work goes into  it." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

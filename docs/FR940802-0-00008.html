			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1427.1 (b) is amended to clarify what information is available in State and county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1427.3 is amended to: (a) correct a typographical error; and (b) add the definition of ``warehouse receipt''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1427.4(b) to add references to receivers, guardians, or trustees which were inadvertently omitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1427.5(b)(1)(v)(B)(4) to clarify that certain extra long staple cotton is ineligible for CCC price support loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1427.5(c)(2)(ii) by removing the reference to incentive payments and thereby allow purchases of cotton to make such payments to a producer without affecting the ability of the producer to obtain a price support loan with respect to such cotton.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule amends &sect;1427.6(b) to clarify who may disburse loan proceeds to approved cooperative marketing associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1427.11 refers to warehouse receipts that may be used as collateral for CCC price support loans. This section has been revised to recognize the existence of electronic receipts by removing specific statements such as ``stamped'' and ``initialed''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions for taking administrative offsets are provided in part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this chapter. Accordingly, this interim rule removes and reserves &sect;&sect;1427.14 and 1427.168.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CCC has determined that the liquidated damages can be reduced without affecting the administration of the cotton price support programs. Accordingly, this interim rule amends &sect;1427.18 and &sect;1427.175 to: (a) decrease the liquidated damages amounts; and (b) add provisions that provide that any or all of the liquidated damages may be waived under certain conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1427.23 is amended by removing paragraph (f) and redesignating paragraph (g) as paragraph (f). The removed provision was originally included to allow upland cotton producers who lost beneficial interest at the time of ginning an opportunity to file for a LDP on the day such upland cotton was ginned. This required producers to report ginning to the county office on a weekly basis. Since this provision was implemented, CCC developed a more workable procedure that allows producers to request LDP's in advance of ginning with the LDP rate based on the loan repayment rate announced and in effect on the day the upland cotton is ginned in accordance with redesignated &sect;1427.23(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1427.171 is amended to clarify provisions relating to locations that are approved for the storage of CCC loan collateral by removing the reference to commercial warehouse houses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1427.174 is amended to correct a spelling error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1427  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cotton, Loan programs_agriculture, Packaging and containers, Price support programs, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surety bonds, Warehouses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1427 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1427_COTTON  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

TANJUG has learned in Zagreb that the two sides have agreed  that Bosnian Moslem Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic meet  instead in Geneva on February 9. It is only if the  Silajdzic-Granic talks produce some results that a decision on a  Tudjman-Izetbegovic meeting will be taken. The venue and date  of the meeting would be subsequently set.</p>

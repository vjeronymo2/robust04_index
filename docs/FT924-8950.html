			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Yamaha cuts payout after plunge YAMAHA, the world's largest musical instruments manufacturer, yesterday confirmed the force of the downturn hitting Japanese manufacturers by announcing its first dividend cut in 38 years. Reporting a 43.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y3.87bn (Dollars 31m) in the six months ended September, Yamaha said it would cut its interim dividend from Y5 to Y3. The dividend for 1992-1993 would be cut to Y6 from Y10 last year. The company's pre-tax profit fell to Y3.87bn from Y6.87bn in the first half of last year, on sales of Y180.9bn, about 11.2 per cent down on 1991. Yamaha has been hit by a sharp downturn in consumer demand in Japan which has been compounded by the recent strength of the yen. However its capacity to weather the downturn in its consumer markets has been diminished by a sharp fall in the value of its securities holdings reflecting the fall in the Tokyo stock market. Post-tax profits fell by 39.7 per cent to Y1.7bn. Earnings per share declined to Y8.89 per share, down from Y14.75 per share in the first half of last year. Kao Oil, the Japanese affiliate of Caltex petroleum, reports modestly lower pre-tax profits with recent yen strength offsetting a fall in demand. Pre-tax profits fell 1.6 per cent from a year earlier to Y889m on sales of Y115.19bn, down 7.8 per cent. Net profit more than doubled to Y616m, the company said.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Olives at Pounds 224,000 Olives Property, the property investment and development company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 224,404 on turnover of Pounds 753,558 for the six months to June 30. The outcome compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 720,392 on turnover of Pounds 1.34m last time, although that was bolstered by exceptional income of Pounds 812,952 relating to settlement of a legal dispute. Earnings per share came out at 0.46p (4.2p). Rental income was running at Pounds 1.86m a year, said Mr Tony Grant, chairman and joint chief executive, and the company was now achieving sufficient revenue to cover ongoing overheads. Net assets increased from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 15.5m, principally because of the rights issue associated with the acquisition of Huby Estates, which raised a net Pounds 9.79m. A capital reorganisation has been approved by the High Court and the cancellation of the capital redemption reserve and part of the share premium account had been effected. The board intends to recommend payment of a final dividend in respect of 1994.</p>

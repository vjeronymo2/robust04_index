Kerry, member  of the U.S. Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and his party here  this afternoon.    The two sides exchanged views on topics of common interest.    Li noted that as two influential countries on the Pacific  Rim, China and the U.S. share many common interests and their  economies are highly complementary.    The two countries should keep their eyes on the future and  intensify their cooperation on the principle of seeking common  ground while laying aside differences, Li said, adding that this  is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples and conducive  to world peace and development.    Kerry noted that he was pleased to be here and hoped to see  bilateral ties improved.    After the meeting, Zhu Qizhen, vice-chairman of the NPC's  Foreign Affairs Committee, held working talks with Kerry and his  party.

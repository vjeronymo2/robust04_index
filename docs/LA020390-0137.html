			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 400 IRAQI KURDS POISONED BY BREAD  </P> <P> About 400 Iraqi Kurdish refugees have been treated in Diyarbakir hospitals  after eating poisoned bread, hospital officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Physicians said a possible cause was the use of poor yeast to make bread for  some of the 11,500 Iraqi Kurds given temporary shelter in the southeastern  city.  </P> <P> There are more than 30,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees in Turkey.  </P> <P> A similar poisoning outbreak was reported among Iraqi Kurds in southeastern  Turkey last June.  </P> <P> Turkey said it was caused by tainted food. But British scientists who analyzed  blood samples of the victims said they believe that many Kurds had been  deliberately poisoned with a toxic nerve agent, possibly by Iraqi agents.  </P></p>

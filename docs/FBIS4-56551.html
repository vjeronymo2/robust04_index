			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President William Clinton gave a detailed  explanation of the priorities of U.S. foreign policy during a  journalists forum organized with CNN in Atlanta, Georgia. In  this regard, Clinton talked about current areas of tension such  as Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti. He also talked about the  elections held in South Africa, among other topics. As for  Haiti, Clinton said that Washington does not exclude the  possibility of military intervention based on the facts that  this Caribbean country is a separate case and that there is a  need to stop the killings and restore democracy.    Clinton spoke in favor of not lifting sanctions on Serbia  until the negotiations for a peaceful solution in Bosnia begin.  As for Bosnia, Clinton announced new interventions by NATO  planes if the Bosnian-Serb forces attack UN-protected territory.    The head of the White House saluted the agreement signed on  Wednesday between the PLO and Israel and praised the results of  the elections in South Africa saying it opens up the possibility  of contributing to this country's development, which could be  the key to the African continent because of its capability,  according to Clinton.    As for Cuba, William Clinton reiterated his support for the  trade and economic blockade of the island. Regarding the ties  with the PRC in the last two decades, he said that Washington  will work hard to iron out the differences between the two  nations.</p>

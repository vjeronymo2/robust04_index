			<p>BFN     [Text] The Seimas [parliament] has decided that the  self-government elections will be held according to the  proportional system. Members of local councils will be elected  for two years, while their current term in office is four years.    The election date has not yet been set. According to  unofficial reports, the elections should take place this fall.    One article in the law on elections for local government  councils, approved by the Seimas, states that representatives to  election commissions can be nominated only by those parties and  political organizations, which have received Seimas deputy  mandates according to party lists.    The entire law on elections to local government councils  will  be adopted next week.</p>

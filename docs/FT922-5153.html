			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: US financier claims to have taken stake in Dollars 1bn WPP debt MR GARY KLESCH, a London-based American financier, has announced that his company, Klesch and Company, has 'within the last 10 days' bought an unspecified amount of the bank debt of WPP, the troubled international marketing services group which owes Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). However, WPP expressed surprise at the suggestion that Mr Klesch had bought some of its debt - Dollars 1bn spread across a 28 bank syndicate - since the company had not been informed that debt had been consigned to another holder. This is normally a technical requirement for such debt sales. Mr Klesch said he had not yet bought the debt 'under assignment' which he said 'would require WPP's consent not to be unreasonably withheld' but on a 'sub-participation basis'. He suggested that a contract between himself and a selling bank does not require prior WPP approval. He declined to say which of WPP's banks have sold him WPP debt, what amount of debt had been sold or at what price. WPP said Mr Klesch might have a 'phantom' arrangement with some of the banks to eventually purchase WPP debt, but that actual purchase of the debt could not go ahead without WPP's approval. WPP added that 'it would be most unlikely' for the group to agree that any of its debt eventually be reassigned to Mr Klesch. Mr Klesch said that he intended to seek to have the debt fully assigned to him eventually, but probably not in the next two weeks. He added that it was normal practice for his company - which deals in corporate restructures and value-impaired assets - initially to buy secondary bank debt on the 'silent' sub-participation basis before going fully public. There have been signs for some time that some of the smaller banks in the syndicate are unhappy with their WPP loans and wish to withdraw from the syndicate. Mr Klesch yesterday declined to say whether his purchase of WPP bank debt was intended to enable him to take a stake in the group or for trading on at a future date. WPP is currently in the midst of discussions with its banking syndicate on a refinancing proposal which would see the banks subscribe for a rights issue of Pounds 150m, which would be used to reduce the group's debt by 25 per cent. In exchange, the banks would agree to subscribe for up to 55 per cent of the enlarged equity. In turn, such a proposal would require shareholder approval; there have been indications in the last two weeks that some shareholders are dissatisfied with the terms on offer.</p>

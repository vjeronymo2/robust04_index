			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LONG RUNS BY SANTA CLARA DROP USD TO 0-4 IN WCAC  </P> <P> Two dry spells, one in each half, choked the University of San Diego men's  basketball team and led to a 64-58 West Coast Athletic Conference loss to Santa  Clara Saturday.  </P> <P> The Toreros fell to 5-11 with their fourth loss in four conference games.  </P> <P> The first drought came in the first half, beginning with 6:30 left. USD was  leading, 19-16, but Santa Clara scored nine consecutive points and went on to  take a 27-24 halftime lead.  </P> <P> With 15:06 to play, USD again went cold. Ahead, 34-32, the Toreros allowed  Santa Clara to score 10 consecutive points. Melvin Chinn's 3-pointer put Santa  Clara ahead, 42-34.  </P> <P> Santa Clara eventually increased its second-half lead to 13 points, and USD  couldn't come all the way back. Down, 53-40, with 6:18 to play, the Toreros  made their final run and closed to within 60-58 on Danny Means' 3-point jumper  with 10 seconds to play. But four Santa Clara free throws put the game away.  </P> <P> "We're a young and struggling team," USD Coach Hank Egan said. "We're on a  death struggle every time out, and that is what we have to understand. We  played hard tonight and hung in there, and hopefully that will help us when we  get home. We've got to continue to keep making progress."  </P> <P> The Toreros outrebounded Santa Clara, 40-21, but turned the ball over 26 times  to Santa Clara's 10.  </P></p>

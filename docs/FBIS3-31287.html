			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text]  <H5>  The President Signed the Law </H5>   Today, the President of the Republic of Poland Lech Walesa  signed the Law on Copyright and Related Rights of 4  February 1994.    The law, which has been enacted by the Sejm, is the result  of  legislative measures undertaken four years ago. The law's first  draft was submitted by the government before the First Term Sejm  on 11 March 1992, but work on the law was not finalized due to  the Sejm's having been dissolved. A new draft of the law was  submitted by the government in front of the Second Term Sejm on  6 November 1993, with a motion to have the law enacted urgently.  Representatives of scientific, creative associations, and  authorship organizations, as well as producer organizations,  took part in the Sejm's work on the draft. Opinions and  comments by these groups regarding specific provisions of the  law, were debated upon and, in a majority of cases, taken into  account. The final text of the law enacted on 4 February 1994  is the result of a compromise that takes into account the  interests of all those concerned with the copyright law, of  authors, performers, video and audio [fonogram] producers,  computer software producers, and radio and television  organizations.    The law will replace the Copyright Law of 1952, which was in  effect up to now and whose provisions are inadequate to suit the  country's new economic conditions, or to the new world system  for protection of intellectual property.    The legal provisions of 1952, given the enormous development  of new areas--for instance, video, audio, and computer software  production--are obsolete under today's conditions and are not  suited to the existing international standards.    The necessity of enacting the new law was also a result of  Poland's international obligations in the area--in particular,  the treaty on trade and economic relations between Poland and  the United States of 21 March 1990. Under the treaty, Poland  obliged itself to adapt its copyright law to existing  international conventions by 1 January 1991.    Apart from that, the phenomenon of piracy of intellectual  property, which has been increasing radically in Poland and  which was pointed out by authors and international opinion  demanding that firm, legislative measures be undertaken to  counteract the piracy, was another incentive for initiating  urgent legislative proceedings concerning the new law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The deputy prime minister  and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) said on  Monday that the government will press for reunions of dispersed  families in South and North Korea at their working-level contact  on exchanging special envoys.    Minister Yi Yong-tok told the National Assembly's committee  on foreign affairs and unification that the urgent problem of  separated families should be solved along with the North Korean  nuclear issue.    North Korea, in talks with the United States on Saturday,  agreed to permit inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) on March 1 on condition that South-North contacts  on exchanging special envoys are held in early March.    During the 1950-53 Korean War, about 10 million people were  separated from their families and have since not been able to  meet with relatives on the other side of the divided peninsula.    Yi also said the government will strive to solve pending  inter- Korean issues like the nuclear problem through direct  talks, considering public opinion which holds that South Korean  efforts alone have been insufficient.    The special envoys to be exchanged will deliver personal  letters from their respective presidents and discuss major  issues and the holding of an inter-Korean summit, according to  the NUB minister.    In particular, the envoys will seek a breakthrough in the  nuclear problem, normalized implementation of the South-North  basic agreement and a joint declaration on denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula, Yi said.    On the possibility of an inter-Korean summit, he said:  "There  is no change in the government position that the nuclear problem  should be solved first. The summit meeting will discuss broadly  all issues including the nuclear problem, but this means basing  such discussion on prior settlement of the nuclear problem."    Yi expected that the third round of high-level talks between  North Korea and the United States may focus on North Korea's  complete return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and  Pyongyang's demand that Washington refrain from using nuclear  weapons first.    "Conclusion of a peace treaty between Pyongyang and  Washington and improvement of bilateral relations are also  expected to be dealt with at the third round of talks," Yi added.    But North Korea, Yi said, will likely try to retain its  "special position" of having suspended its withdrawal from the  NPT while trying to use the IAEA's special and routine nuclear  inspections and complete return to the NPT as negotiating cards  at the talks with the United States.</p>

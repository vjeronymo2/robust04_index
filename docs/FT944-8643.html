			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Dollar issues feed continuing demand Another wave of US dollar bonds swept the eurobond market yesterday, feeding continuing investor demand for dollar paper. While retail investors are said to be keen buyers of two to five-year bonds, institutional investors were reported to be moving down the yield curve into the 10-year sector. 'Following the latest US rate hike, a lot of people expect the long end to perform better as the curve flattens,' said one dealer. However, some warned that the weight of new supply might lead to saturation of the market. 'There has been enough volume to satisfy what demand there is, but if there is much more I fear the market's underwriting capacity could come under strain,' said another trader. Japan's Electric Power Development Company made its eurodollar debut with Dollars 300m of 8 1/8 per cent five-year bonds, priced to yield 23 basis points over the five-year Treasury note, via IBJ and JP Morgan. While some said the pricing was rather generous for a government-guaranteed issuer, most dealers welcomed the terms of the deal. 'It was well priced and well handled - they did the right thing given that they're not that well-known,' said one dealer. Since the EPDC plans to return regularly to the dollar sector, 'it was strategically important for the issuer to do a deal which was well-received,' said one of the lead managers. After the bonds were freed to trade, the yield spread tightened slightly to around 21 basis points over Treasuries. Capitalising on demand for medium-dated paper, L-Bank issued Dollars 400m of 8 per cent five-year bonds priced to yield 20 basis points over Treasuries via J. P. Morgan. Although the deal saw interest from UK, Swiss and Benelux institutional investors, it was somewhat eclipsed by the EPDC issue and is expected to be placed more slowly. In the 10-year sector, KfW, the German reconstruction agency, issued Dollars 500m of 8 1/4 per cent 10-year bonds via joint leads Dresdner Bank and Goldman Sachs. Yielding 27 basis points over Treasuries at the re-offer price, the bonds were deemed fairly priced; indeed, some felt the spread could have been a few basis points tighter.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / People: Fry moves up as Burmah Castrol splits role Jonathan Fry (right), managing director of Burmah Castrol and chief executive of Castrol, will succeed Lawrence Urquhart as Burmah Castrol's chief executive on June 1. Urquhart, 57, will continue as chairman of the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, on a non-executive basis. Tim Stevenson, 44, currently chief executive of Burmah Castrol Fuels group, will join the main board in March and take over from Fry, 55, as chief executive of Castrol in August. Analysts say Fry's step-up had been expected, as he had recently been taking an increasingly high-profile role. He joined the group in 1978 as planning director and won his spurs as chief executive of the chemicals group by integrating acquisitions. He has been chief executive of Castrol since 1987, a period which has seen the lubricants business build on its strong brand identity. Splitting the role of chairman and chief executive does accord with recommended practice in the City, but Burmah Castrol says this development had been under consideration since the group was reorganised in 1990 - before the Cadbury report was published. Stevenson, described as 'one of the group's best strategic thinkers', has been chief executive of Burmah Castrol Fuels since 1990, having previously been chief executive of Burmah Castrol Chemicals' sealants division.</p>

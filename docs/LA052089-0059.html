			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: A REMARK TO PLAYER IS HAUNTING WATSON  </P> <P> Tom Watson probably wishes he could change a few things in his career, but  nothing more than his controversial accusation that Gary Player cheated in the  1983 Skins Game.  </P> <P> If Watson could do it over again, he would have kept the matter between himself  and Player. Watson told Golf magazine that even when he accused Player of  improving his lie by removing a growing leaf, he was upset that it became  public.  </P> <P> Dave Anderson of the New York Times had overheard Watson tell Player he thought  he had cheated. In retrospect, Watson said there was one thing he might have  done differently.  </P> <P> "I would have walked farther away from Anderson," he said.  </P> <P> Is this important?The Lakers have more years of National Basketball Assn.  playoff experience than any team that made the playoffs, 67.

Dunn has 10 of  them.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Besides it being the first, what is another distinction held by  Super Bowl I at the Coliseum?  </P> <P> Bake a bigger pie: If the Detroit Pistons win the NBA title, each player will  get $57,000. When the original NBA playoff pool was established in 1951,  players and coaches divided $50,000.  </P> <P> The bus stops here: John Madden, who was booed from coast to coast as the coach  of the Oakland Raiders, said he now receives flattering mail from NFL fans but  suspects it is because they "miss somebody to yell at."  </P> <P> Madden, who left the Raiders after 1978, said he enjoys being a television  announcer and riding around the country in his customized bus, called the  Madden Cruiser.  </P> <P> "I don't miss coaching," he said. "I've had a good life and I've never really  had to work."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: It's the only one that didn't sell out.  </P> <P> New listing: Need a place to live while in New York? For $3.5 million, John  McEnroe's apartment can be yours, according to the New York Post.  </P> <P> Chopping spree: The Minnesota Vikings plan to enroll 10 to 12 players in karate  classes, buoyed by the success of Joey Browner, the Vikings' All-Pro strong  safety who credits his martial arts training with making him a better tackler  and improving his confidence.  </P> <P> "A person's assignment out there is to destroy you," Browner said. "This is a  way to protect yourself.  </P> <P> Short story: Letter writer Ken Weigel swears that television fight commentator  Ferdie Pacheco said this during a Kelcie Banks' fight, after Marv Albert had  remarked that Banks' opponent spoke five languages: "That is impressive, since  he's so short."  </P> <P> Quotebook: From Henry Aaron: "It took me 17 years to get 3,000 hits. I did it  in one afternoon on the golf course."  </P></p>

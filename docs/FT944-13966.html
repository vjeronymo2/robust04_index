			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury long bond yield holds above 8% The yield on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond held above the 8.00 per cent mark yesterday, after flirting with that psychological barrier for the past two weeks. Late in the session, the long bond was  23/32 lower at 93 27/32 , with the yield rising to 8.04 per cent, its highest level in about 2 1/2 years. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 1/2 , to yield 6.795 per cent. There was no fresh economic news to influence sentiment, but concerns over monetary policy, a weak dollar and the imminent influx of fresh supply meant that the bearish tone established last week would not budge. In light of last week's data, the market was convinced the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates at its November 15 policy-making session, and they were trying to gauge how that would affect their commitments. Those calculations had a negative impact on trading on the day before the Treasury is to auction Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes. The auction will be followed by the sale tomorrow of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. The new issues may prove difficult for the market to absorb. Some analysts were betting that the Fed will decide to lift rates aggressively in the coming weeks, a development which would undercut the value of the new securities. A fresh decline in the dollar against the D-Mark and yen reinforced the pessimism. The selling yesterday came across the board, not just at the short end. As the long bond's prices fell, the yield climbed back over the 8.00 per cent mark, where it has attracted buying interest in the past. But yesterday, the higher levels prevailed. Shrugging off encouraging inflation data in Germany, European government bonds were depressed by continued weakness in US Treasuries and ended a listless session weaker across the board. In addition to the bearish sentiment spreading from across the Atlantic, the prospect of fresh supply this week in the German, UK, Japanese, Italian, Ecu and US markets, and continued investor abstinence, put a damper on prices. German government bonds ended the day about 1/3 point weaker, unimpressed by reports that consumer prices in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg rose by only 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-October. Although the news gave bunds a brief lift, the gains were not sustainable. 'When you get good news and prices don't rise, that usually indicates that a market wants to go down,' said a Frankfurt bund dealer. In after-hours trading, the December bund future on Liffe breached key technical support at 89.50, which does not bode well for the near term, a dealer said. It ended at 89.46, down 0.36 points on the day. In spite of their unimpressive performance, bunds are still the best bet in current bond market conditions, said Mr Adrian James, bond strategist at NatWest Markets. 'Bunds may not necessarily do well in absolute terms, but they still tend to outperform in this environment,' he said. Sweden was one of the few markets which managed to out-shine bunds, lifted by the unexpected success of the government's latest bond auction, where all the paper in both tranches offered was snapped up by a single buyer. This sparked another sharp rise in prices, pushing the yield on the benchmark nine-year bond down 16 basis points to 10.71 per cent. The yield gap over bunds narrowed 22 basis points to 316 basis points. It was as wide as 360 basis points in the middle of last week, but has been sharply eroded by the Swedish market's strong performance in recent days. After its speedy contraction, the spread looks 'dangerous,' warned Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. 'We have entered the red zone,' he said, pointing to the risks facing the Swedish market: the European Union referendum on November 13, another increase in interest rates, and continued uncertainty on the fiscal front. UK gilts fell by more than  1/2 point, dragged lower by the US market and weighed down further by the prospect of Pounds 2.5bn of new supply at tomorrow's gilt auction. However, dealers said they expected the issue to meet solid demand since it was next year's new five-year benchmark. The December long gilt futures contract slipped by points to 101 15/32.</p>

After the incident, the ABB  called a radio station to claim responsibility for the bombings.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Noel Perfecto] First, the  terrorists bombed Petron's main office in Makati at 6:15 a.m.  this morning. The security guard on duty was slightly injured  in the blast. Police said that the blast did not cause serious  damage to the Petron building, but damaged some windows in the  adjacent Mandarin Oriental Hotel building. Five minutes later,  the ABB bombed Shell House on Paleros Street in Legaspi Village.  There was not much damage from the explosion, because the bomb  fell in front of the powerhouse.    Makati Chief Remy Macaspar said that the bombs used were  strong enough to kill people and damage property:    [Macaspar, in English] Regional Director General Sarmiento  ordered to intensify our intelligence efforts as well as  repressive patrolling, such that last evening he was also out  there in the field. He really checked the prevailing situation.  We concentrated on gasoline stations, but with this development  we have to consider everything now.    [Perfecto] According to reports, the bombing of  Caltex-Philippines in Manila came five minutes after the bombing  of Shell House. Colonel Macaspar disclosed that police had  brought the driver of the taxi used by the bombers in for  questioning. The driver was identified as Abunjon Dabat. He  said that he was forced out of the taxi after the bombings were  completed:    [Dabat] Before making a U-turn into the Mandarin Hotel, he  told me to pull over in front of the Petron Building. Then he  said that he was going to get out and drop something off. When  he got out of the taxi cab, I saw him holding something round.  Then he lit it and hurled it at Petron's door. Then he  returned to the cab and I started driving again. He told me to  turn right at Paseo Roxas and right again at Citibank. When we  were at the corner near Citibank, he told me to stop because he  was going to throw something again. That is what he said.    [Perfecto] Shell House's security guard, identified as  Rogelio Valdes, said that the bombers appeared to be youths.    Is this what the object that was thrown at your building  looked like? [video shows Perfecto holding several sticks of  dynamite wired together]    [Valdes] Yes. It looked like this, but it was wrapped in  brown paper.    [Perfecto] Do you think there were also as many sticks as  this?    [Valdes] Yes. I think there were as many sticks as that,  because it was as big as that.    [Perfecto] But you did not notice that they were using a  taxi?    [Valdes] No. I did not notice whether the taxi that passed  by my post was the one that the bombers used.    [Perfecto] As of air time, the Capcom [Capital Command] had  alerted all of its centers and placed a tight guard on all vital  government offices and buildings that are potential bombing  targets. [end recording]    In a related development, strict security measures are being  implemented at the Energy Regulatory Board [ERB] and Land  Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The ERB office  received a bomb threat after the bombing of the three oil firms'  offices. Strict security is also being enforced at the offices  of the National Power Corporation and the Metropolitan  Waterworks and Sewer System. Meanwhile, the Philippine National  Police call on the public to support the security measures that  will be put into place at all sensitive government offices and  some private companies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xie Yong, vice chairman of the provincial people's  congress standing committee and secretary of the provincial  commission on politics and law, was interviewed by reporter of  Heilongjiang Radio Station during the time when he attended the  second session of the eighth National People's Congress [NPC]in  Beijing. He said: Public security comprehensive management  work, whether good or bad, will directly affect the success or  failure in reform. Without stability as a guarantee, nothing can  be accomplished.    According to Xie Yong's introduction, our province will base  on the guidelines of the NPC session and the national Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference session to strengthen  public security comprehensive management work and proceed the  work from six aspects in an effort to guarantee the creation of  a good social environment for reform and economic construction.  These six aspects of work are: 1. Urge leaders at all levels to  assume responsibility over public security comprehensive  management work, define the specific responsibilities on  grasping public security comprehensive management work of the  party and government leaders at all levels and the specific  methods of supervision, restraint and award in line with the  specific rules issued by the province earlier this year. 2.  Enhance the degree of dealing blows to criminals and strengthen  its social effect. This year Heilongjiang province will  continue to carry out the work of dealing strict blows to  criminals with an emphasis in cracking major cases, dealing  blows to criminal cliques, and capturing escaped criminals in an  effort to check the upward trend of major and appalling cases.  3. Eliminate repulsive social phenomena and consolidate the  cultural markets. 4. Strengthen control over the crime  development trend, intensify socialized security defense work,  and further raise the level of socialized security defense in  all places across the province. 5. Strengthen education and  settlement of people who have been reformed through labor or  education, and help and educate delinquents who have done  misdeeds. 6. Give priority to improving areas and neighborhoods  with disorderly public security situation.    Xie Yong said: To fundamentally guarantee social stability,  it is not realistic to rely only on the efforts of the public  security, judicial, and procuratorial departments. All social  sectors, particularly the party and government leaders, should  also exert efforts, set examples with their own conduct and with  the work of their own departments and units, and strive to  eliminate all sorts of corrupt and unfair distribution problems  which the people are much concerned about. In addition, we must  proceed the work from the formulation of systems and establish  and improve supporting reform measures to promote social  stability. The establishment of the socialist market economic  structure is a profound social reform, which will inenvitably  bring some social vibrations. In order to reduce  contradictions, we must step up efforts to establish and improve  all supporting reform measures.    Xie Yong believed that it is necessary to encourage all  social sectors to use funds at their disposal to run all kinds  of economic entities and industries, to gradually set up and  develop all forms of labor markets, and to establish a complete  set of social security systems, such as the unemployed insurance  system, old-age pension insurance system, medical insurance  system, and workers' injury insurance system, which are well  coordinated with the new labor and distribution system so as to  eliminate people's trouble back at home.    Xie Yong said at the end of his speech: It is also necessary  to try by all possible means to consolidate the mass security  defense teams in the urban and rural areas, resolutely solve the  issue that the formulation of laws can not catch up with the  public security situation, and form a situation in which all  levels and sectors jointly grasp and manage public security work  in line with law.</p>

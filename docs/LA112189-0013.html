			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A Baby Beast: CBS' "Beauty and the Beast," which returns to the network Dec. 12  in a special two-hour episode, will feature the birth of a baby beast to  formerly-chaste lovers Catherine and Vincent. It is expected viewers will  understand that the child was conceived during a certain cave encounter between  Cathy and Vincent in last season's final episode. Linda Hamilton, who plays  Catherine to Ron Perlman's Beast, is being written out of the show so she can  spend more time with her own baby; no word yet on whether the on-screen  beastlet will be a boy or a girl.

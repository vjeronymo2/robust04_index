			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP shares open at 18% premium SHARES in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the French government's first privatisation candidate, yesterday closed at FFr283.90, an 18 per cent premium over the original FFr240 offer price, at the end of the first day of official trading on the Paris stock market.

However, it still rationed the number of shares given to individual investors. Banking analysts attributed the strong demand for BNP shares to heavy buying from institutions that had been disappointed by their allocations in the original issue. Some individual investors seized their chance to make quick profits by selling their shares. 'The offer price was so low that subscribing for BNP shares almost looked like a licence to make money,' commented another analyst. 'But the French government wanted to make sure that the first privatisation was a success - and it's done it.'</p>

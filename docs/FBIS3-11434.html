The political agreement between the parties which will  form the new government in the Netherlands Antilles, will be  signed in Willemstad next Tuesday.    Negotiator Pourier is conducting the final discussions about  the division of powers and about the candidates for the cabinet  positions, but he does not expect any problems which might  jeopardize the political agreement.    The new government will be made up of the Antillean  Restructuring Party (PAR) [Partido Antia Restruktura] and the  New Antilles Movement (MAN) from Curacao, the Democratic Party  (DP-B) from Bonaire, the Sint Maarten Patriotic Alliance (SPA),  the Democratic Party (DP-StE) from Saint Eustatius, and the  Windward Islands People's Movement (WIPM) from Saba.    The coalition relies on a comfortable majority of 16 out of  the 22 seats in Parliament, called the "States." Former Prime  Minister Maria Liberia-Peters' National People's Party (PNP) is  going into opposition in Parliament.    The government program deals with the reorganization and its  consequences for the central administration's restructuring.  Pourier aims at organizing a referendum on the islands'  political future next September on all islands at the same time,  as was already the case on Curacao last November.    In addition, the Pourier cabinet will also pay much  attention  to improving education, reducing public health expenditure,  reorganizing the civil service, as well as drug and crime  prevention.    Relations with the Netherlands will also be reviewed by the  new cabinet. The Netherlands' involvement will have to change,  Pourier says. The Netherlands will have to play a more  complementary role.    The Antillean Government has a responsibility of its own.  Only in fields where it cannot assume this responsibility on  its own authority, will Pourier call upon the Netherlands for  assistance. He wants, for instance, that Sint Maarten be placed  under the high supervision of the Antillean Government, rather  than of the Netherlands Government in the Hague.    As soon as possible after the cabinet's inauguration,  presumably on 31 March, the new prime minister wants to consult  with the Netherlands in order to reach an agreement on the  financial relationship, on relations between both governments  and between the various islands and the Netherlands, on youth  problems and on development aid.</p>

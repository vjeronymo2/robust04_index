			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Italian prices edge upward Italian consumer prices grew 0.3 per cent in April giving an annualised inflation rate of 4.1 per cent. The monthly rate was marginally up on March largely due to a rise in cigarette prices. But so far this year the biggest single rises have been in housing and health. The rise in housing costs in particular has almost doubled the index average. The prospective rate for the year as a whole is now running at 4 per cent against 4.2 per cent for 1993. The outgoing government hoped to have a year-end inflation rate running at an annualised 3.5 per cent. Economists indicated yesterday that the new government would inherit inflation rates still relatively high by EU standards and this made cautious management of Italy's timid recovery essential.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Auditor denies trying to shield firm AN AUDITOR who advised NatWest Investment Bank over the accounting treatment of its Blue Arrow holdings taken in the 1987 rights issue yesterday denied to the Blue Arrow trial that his explanation of events was an attempt to protect his firm. Mr Paul McNamara, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, rejected a suggestion from Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC, that, in an account to Sir Philip Wilkinson, the NatWest deputy chairman, he had not told all he had known of the holdings. Mr McNamara, Mr Roberts said, had told Sir Philip in April 1988 that Mr James Riddell, County's finance director, had informed him the previous November of the holdings taken by County, County NatWest Securities and Phillips &amp; Drew. He had told Sir Philip that he had been given no details about the transaction, Mr Roberts added, but he had been told the size of the holdings. Mr McNamara denied that. Mr Roberts was representing Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County NatWest chief executive and one of the defendants. He suggested that Mr McNamara's account was an attempt to 'cover the backside' of his firm, then called Ernst &amp; Whinney. Mr McNamara rejected this, saying his firm had acted with the 'highest possible standards'. Under cross-examination by Mr Roy Amlot, QC, for Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor who advised County over the issue, Mr McNamara later agreed he had known the stake held by County's corporate advisory department was worth Pounds 60m. However, nobody at Ernst &amp; Whinney had calculated from that figure what proportion of Blue Arrow's share capital it represented, Mr McNamara said. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue. The trial continues today.</p>

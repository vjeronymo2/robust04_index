			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Winner of Competition IT'S a whale of a jumbo, as conceived by a 12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl. She has won a competition sponsored by All Nippon Airways (ANA), the country's largest airline, and her reward will be to see her design painted on one of its latest Boeing 747-400 jets, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. ANA saw its domestic passenger numbers decline in the financial year just ended for the first time since 1985. It has also just cut its dividend. Two years ago, it asked its 14,000-strong workforce for ideas on how to improve competitiveness and attract more passengers. One favourite suggestion was to invite the public to draw a new colour design for ANA's aircraft. So, the airline asked Japanese children up to the age of 15 to submit designs. The winner was chosen from more than 20,000 entries. The repainted jumbo will enter service in September to coincide with the opening of a new passenger terminal at Tokyo's Haneda airport.</p>

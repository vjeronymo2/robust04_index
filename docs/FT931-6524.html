			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: Time for west to help Russia's transformation The impression in the west that chaos and confusion are overwhelming both Russian politics and the economy is only partly true. The paradox is that in spite of its mounting troubles, Russia has perhaps come closer to grappling with crucial reforms than ever before. The west, which has much to lose if attempts at a relatively peaceful transition to a market economy collapse, also has a good opportunity to help the best reformist government that Russia is likely to get in the foreseeable future. For in spite of the drama surrounding the power struggle between President Yeltsin and the parliamentary chairman, the threat of hyperinflation is helping to focus at least some minds on the need for painful macroeconomic stabilisation. An unprecedented growth of money supply - culminating in the issue of Rbs1,600bn of central bank credit in December alone, or 60 per cent of national income - helped push weekly price increases to hyperinflationary heights of 10 per cent a week in January. With inflation back down to 5 per cent a week, the government on Wednesday finalised a plan to restrict money supply growth to 7 per cent a month. This would be accompanied by selective support for state-owned enterprises, and continuing to build badly-needed market institutions. Many of the pre-conditions for effective reform which were missing last year are also now in place. As inflation fuelled by an unprecedented growth in money supply has ravaged living standards, the government no longer needs to justify financial austerity as part of a comprehensive reform package it is now trying to implement. The government is also finally forcing other former Soviet republics to drop the rouble as their currency unless they co-ordinate monetary and credit policy with it. Bankruptcy and other key legislation is in place. The country is now even building proper borders with other republics which should help it implement foreign exchange controls. And in spite of dismay over the fall of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the reformist prime minister who launched economic shock therapy but abandoned it under political pressure, the government itself has become more effective since his departure. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new deputy prime minister for economics and finance, has both the expertise and the time which Mr Gaidar never had as prime minister, to focus on what he calls the 'elaboration and detailisation' of the Gaidar strategy. For this he has the support of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister who has the advantage of being elected by parliament and therefore does not need to constantly fight for his political survival. What happens next largely depends on talks between the government and the central bank, described by a government economist as 'a lengthy persuasion process'. The central bank has come back with counter-proposals to those of the government which include setting money supply growth at 20 per cent a month. But the bargaining has only just begun. Previously, the government engaged in political polemics by blaming the central bank for the failure of last year's stabilisation attempts. Now, Mr Fyodorov is working hard to reform the relationship so that both sides recognise their responsibilities: the central bank to defend the currency, and the government to implement the economic reform it has talked about. Mr Fyodorov also wants the central bank to restrict the government to commonly agreed credit expansion limits. And he believes the government should pay a higher interest rate for central bank credits. At present it has paid just 10 per cent a year, compared with 80 per cent paid by commercial banks. Such a practice would in turn mean admitting to a much bigger budget deficit than the 5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product proclaimed last year and planned in earnest for this year. If cheap credits to the government were factored into the calculation, the deficit would be closer to 30 per cent . This is where the west, which last year found a convenient excuse to wait and see about financial aid as Mr Gaidar failed to live up to promises made to the IMF, can make a big difference. Tied to specific conditions such as the selective distribution of credit to enterprises and the building of a social safety net, western transfers would lessen the hyperinflationary pressures caused by printing money to cover spending which cannot be cut overnight. Continued technical assistance is also vital, with focus on the provinces rather than Moscow, which is already saturated with foreign advice. While some of Russia's problems are connected to internal politics, including the present conflict between the executive and the legislative branches, fear and ignorance over what should be done is even greater. A few regions of Russia are boldly pressing ahead with reform with the help of western advisers. Others, though, fearing unpopularity and not knowing any better, are falling back on the even more dangerous formula of half-baked reform. Another danger is Russia's old habit of preferring talk over action, and setting up new rules and superfluous structures to tackle old problems. Typical is the recent establishment of a new presidential body to attract foreign investment (duplicating an existing government agency which itself replaced a committee), when what is really needed is the removal of very basic obstacles to investment. It is more important than ever that the west should not be cowed by the confusion in Russia, but should declare itself ready to provide targeted assistance as soon as the authorities produce some proof of their resolve. President Bill Clinton, who has some well-informed Russia experts in his administration and meets President Yeltsin on April 4, would do well to consider providing the leadership for a concerted western aid policy whose time has now come.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Quotes of the day 'The essential question is simply: are we or are we not in this country to play a central role in Europe's development?' John Major 'If we had any doubts about what this debate is all about, we could have it resolved by looking at the terms of the motion. No ringing declaration about the future of Europe, which would rally the troops under the Maastricht banner. No declaration of any discernible kind' John Smith 'You are seeking to hide behind Denmark and the splits in your party' John Major to John Smith 'This debate and the ambiguous and anodyne motion upon which it proceeds has no formal parliamentary status. It is a device; a happening; a political event justified by the government at different times and on very different grounds, to very different people as both expediency and the tide of war within the Conservative party dictated' John Smith 'By your tactical ineptitude you have provided the circumstances in which the pro-Maastricht majority in this House can be dissipated.' Giles Radice Labour MP for Durham North to John Major 'Today, for the sake of plaudits from some of your backbenchers, you have forsworn your integrity. Having done that, you will find that you will never be able to regain it' Sir Edward Heath on John Smith 'I have to confess, however, that I don't relish the prospect of being skinned alive on Parliament Green if the prime minister wins by one vote and I have abstained' Andrew Faulds Labour MP, Warley East 'Unless the house comes to order, I cannot hear members who are screaming points of order' Betty Boothroyd Speaker 'If members want to diminish our capacity to negotiate what is right for this country, then vote for the Opposition amendment and against the government today' John Major 'Another ordinary night's work: I gave them a problem and they solved it, and I have to thank them' John Major emerging from whips' office</p>

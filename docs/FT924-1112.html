			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Asda Group Mr Archie Norman must be something of a local hero in Asda's home town of Leeds. In little more than a year he has turned round a grocery chain that was heading for severe financial trouble. As yesterday's interim figures revealed, Asda's trading decline has been halted, its debt mountain reduced, and its profitability restored. Shareholders who backed Asda's emergency rights issue at 35p must be feeling smug: the shares closed yesterday at 61p. Sceptics will mutter that it is all too good to last. And they may well be right. Although Mr Norman has undoubtedly made an impressive start, he has yet to show a strategy for reviving long-term growth. It will be hard to pay down borrowings of Pounds 472m from normal trading activities. A capital expenditure budget of Pounds 130m looks inadequate to launch a discount chain such as Dales. A further Pounds 200m of sales will be lost to competitor openings this year. The company's management may seek to exploit its shining reputation by staging a second rights issue. The City may be inclined to back it. But Asda's long-term survival is still not secure. That overhanging doubt may takethe wind out of the share price's recent rise.</p>

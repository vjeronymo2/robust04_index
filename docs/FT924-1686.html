			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Ford of Europe to shed 10,000 jobs next year: UK and Germany worst hit - Renault and VW to cut workforces FORD, the US carmaker, is to reduce the workforce of its European automotive operations by 11 per cent, cutting more than 10,000 jobs by the end of 1993 in a further heavy blow to employment in the European motor industry. The sharpest reductions will be in the UK, where the workforce has already been more than halved in the last decade, and in Germany. They are part of restructuring moves aimed at staunching Ford of Europe's mounting losses. The company said in Detroit last night it would take a one-time Dollars 419m (Pounds 266m) after-tax charge as a result of the European job cuts. Mr Harold Poling, Ford group chairman, said this charge and additional one-off charges relating to US accounting changes would result in a net loss from worldwide operations for the whole of 1992. Additional accounting charges in line with those of other big US companies include a Dollars 440m write-off related to 1992 and a separate Pounds 7.5bn charge. Car and truckmakers in Europe are under increasing pressure from declining sales, overcapacity and intensifying competition from Japanese carmakers. Yesterday, Renault Vehicules Industriels, the loss-making French commercial vehicle maker, said it planned to cut its workforce and heavy job losses are expected at Volkswagen. In contrast, Toyota, the leading Japanese car producer, opened its first European car plant in the UK at Burnaston, near Derby. Ford said it planned to reduce the workforce of its European automotive operations, excluding Jaguar, to 83,000 by the end of 1993 from the present level of 93,000. The workforce has already been cut by 19 per cent from 115,000 in 1990. About 80 per cent of the latest job cuts will be made in the UK and Germany, with each operation equally affected. The salaried workforce in Europe will be reduced by 14.5 per cent from 17,550 to 15,000 by mid-1993, while the hourly-paid workforce will be reduced from 75,200 to 68,000 by the end of 1993. Some 1,180 hourly-paid jobs in the UK and 1,500 in Germany are to be eliminated by April as a result of cuts in production capacity, with the rest to go through improved efficiency measures by the end of 1993. About 1,200 salaried jobs are to be cut in the UK, mainly at Ford's Dunton engineering operations and the Warley headquarters, both in Essex. A further 1,000 salaried jobs in the UK have already been eliminated by using excess volunteers to the earlier redundancy programme launched in September. A further 1,350 salaried jobs will be cut in Germany, mainly in Cologne. Responding to the UK job losses Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator and executive council member of the AEEU electrical and engineering union, said: 'Three months ago, Ford announced compulsory redundancies and said they were cutting lay-off pay from 100 per cent of basic to 60 per cent. Today there are no compulsory redundancies and they have reinstated lay-off pay in full.' Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'If one Ford worker is made compulsorily redundant next year, we shall ballot our members with a recommendation for industrial action.' Ford's UK workforce has already fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to 33,000 by the end of this year, an average reduction of more than 3,600 a year. With new car sales forecast to decline further next year Ford is cutting production capacity sharply in the UK and Germany. Capacity is being increased at Genk in Belgium for production of a new model, while Valencia in Spain, Ford's most cost-effective plant in Europe, largely escapes the cuts. Fiesta output at Dagenham in the UK will be reduced by 18 per cent to 740 a day and production of Fiestas and Scorpios at Cologne will be cut by 23 per cent to 1,020 cars a day. Capacity will also be reduced at Halewood in the UK and Saarlouis in Germany. Further cuts in the workforce will follow in later years as a result of other measures announced yesterday. Mr Bill Fike, president of Ford of Europe, said the company would concentrate on the design, manufacture and sale of cars and light commercial vehicles. Ford's European operations have collapsed into loss in the second half of this year 1992 after struggling back into profit in the first six months. from record losses last year. The European automotive operations suffered a third quarter loss of Dollars 479m (Pounds 304m). in the third quarter. In yesterday's other developments: Volkswagen, the leader of the west European car market, said it had fallen into loss in the last quarter of this year. VW is expected shortly to announce further restructuring, including heavy job cuts. Renault Vehicules Industriels said it was planning to cut 1,348 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce, in France.

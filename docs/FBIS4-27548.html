			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa told a senior Chinese official Thursday [2 Jun] the  situation regarding North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons is at a critical stage, ministry officials said.    "Inspections (of North Korea's nuclear facilities) are  becoming increasingly difficult. The situation is at an  important stage and is tense," the officials quoted Kakizawa as  telling Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.    In a 15-minute meeting with the Chinese visitor, the  Japanese  foreign minister repeated calls for China's cooperation in  solving the problem, adding he wants to hold close consultations  with China.    Tang told Kakizawa China has been making efforts to seek a  breakthrough on the problem and will continue to make its utmost  efforts to peacefully solve it through dialogue, adding China's  approach to North Korea has limits, the officials said.    The resumption of dialogue among North Korea, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States  is important in seeking a breakthrough to the standoff, Tang was  saying.    He also reiterated China's basic stance that it supports  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and maintenance of  peace and stability in the region.    China played a "constructive role" in compiling the UN  Security Council's presidential statement issued Monday, Tang  said.    The council statement "strongly" urged Pyongyang to  cooperate  in pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA  inspectors could determine if any material has been diverted for  nuclear weapons.    Tang delivered an invitation from Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen for Kakizawa to visit China.    If unable to make the trip, the two foreign ministers may be  able to meet at a meeting of foreign ministers from the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialogue  partners in July, or at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) meeting in Jakarta in November, Tang quoted Qian as  saying.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Boeing in super jumbo talks with two Airbus partners BOEING, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, is negotiating with Deutsche Aerospace and British Aerospace over joint development of a 550 to 800 seat super jumbo aircraft which could enter service early in the next century. The move poses a significant threat to the European Airbus consortium, Boeing's principal rival, which is also studying the development of a large capacity airliner. Deutsche Aerospace, part of Daimler-Benz, and BAe are partners in Airbus with 37.9 per cent and 20 per cent shares respectively in the consortium. If successful, the discussions with Boeing could lead to a sweeping realignment in the commercial aerospace industry and undermine the cohesion of the 20-year-old Airbus consortium. Mr John Hayhurst, vice-president of large aircraft development at Boeing, yesterday said the company expected to sign an agreement soon with Deutsche Aerospace to launch a joint feasibility study for a new generation super jumbo. BAe said it would be 'a willing partner' to enter a broad dialogue with Boeing and other manufacturers on the feasibility of a super jumbo, which would be expected to involve more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in research and development costs. Mr Hayhurst said Boeing has also had discussions on the project with several other companies including the three big Japanese manufacturers, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The three Japanese companies already co-operate with Boeing on the 777 and 767 widebody programmes but were approached by Airbus to consider joining it in the development of a large capacity airliner. Boeing started studying the development of a super jumbo 18 months ago. Mr Hayhurst said preliminary studies suggested room did not exist for more than one viable super jumbo project. Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine maker, said last night it was in talks with both Boeing and Airbus about powering future 550 to 800 seat aircraft. The two big US aero-engine manufacturers, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, have also been studying new heavy thrust engines to power super jumbos. By attempting to lure Airbus partners in the joint development of a super jumbo, Boeing is seeking to consolidate its dominant position in the large aircraft market. Mr Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, said: 'We'll take whatever actions necessary to do that, whether that means making major investments in research and development, or looking at possible international alliances.' Boeing has a 55-60 per cent share of the world airliner market. Airbus, its main competitor, has 26 per cent. Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group with a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus, said it had not had talks with Boeing over a new large aircraft. However, it indicated it was interested in taking part in any industry-wide feasibility study to develop a super jumbo. The other partner in Airbus is Casa of Spain with a 4.2 per cent stake.

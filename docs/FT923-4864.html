			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / South Africa to trim civil service MR DEREK KEYS, the South African finance minister, yesterday announced plans to cut central government employment by up to 5 per cent next year, a significant step toward tackling the bloated civil service as part of a structural adjustment programme for the economy. Moves to trim the civil service, which has been used by National party governments since 1948 to provide near-guaranteed employment for white Afrikaners, have always been fiercely resisted. But faced with the prospect that a multi-racial interim government would expand the bureaucracy further, Pretoria has clearly decided to try to get staff numbers under control before such a government comes to power. The move could prove politically controversial. South Africa's central government and provincial administrations employ some 750,000 people, out of total public sector employment (including state enterprises) of 1.7m. Some 600,000 of these employees are white, and most of those are conservative Afrikaners. Mr Keys said yesterday it was essential to 'restrain the growth in the consumption spending of general government in favour of a much higher rate of fixed investment in new productive capacity'. Toward that end, the cabinet had set new spending guidelines for government departments for the 1993-94 fiscal year involving a 3 per cent real spending cut. He said President F W de Klerk had challenged heads of government departments to achieve this goal through productivity improvements, including staff cuts. Mr Keys painted a bleak picture of the state of government finances for the current financial year, which ends next March. He said he expects the government deficit before borrowing to equal at least 6 per cent of gross domestic product, 1.5 percentage points above the budgeted figure and nearly twice the 3 per cent figure used as a guideline by the International Monetary Fund. This is partly the result of a shortfall in revenues due to South Africa's economic recession, the longest since 1908.</p>

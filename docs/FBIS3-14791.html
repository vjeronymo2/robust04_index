			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz February 28 TASS -- President Akhsarbek  Galazov of North Ossetia has reiterated his decision to meet  Ingush President Ruslan Aushev for discussing problems dealing  with the settlement of relations between the two republics.  Speaking today at a meeting with members of the government, the  presidium of the republican Supreme soviet (parliament) and  heads of local government bodies, he stressed, however, that the  meeting should be carefully prepared, and questions to be  discussed by the two sides should be thoroughly analysed. In  his opinion, the return of refugees to the populated localities  of the Prigorodnyy district is the most complicated of them. It  should be tackled in a comprehensive way on the basis of  Kislovodsk accords.    "The presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia will be able  to tackle their problems by themselves, without intermediaries,  to decide matters dealing with the settlement of relations  between the two nations and to make all the problems clear. The  negotiating process between the republics has been started, and  it should be continued," Galazov said.    Speaking about the current situation in the part of North  Ossetia, where a state of emergency will be in effect until  March 31, Galazov pointed out that it continued to be  comparatively stable. Russia's peace-making forces in  cooperation with local law-enforcement agencies are keeping the  situation under control.</p>

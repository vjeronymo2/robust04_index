Gunmen have been bringing in from neighboring  Afghanistan not only assault rifles and ammunition. Mines have  been brought over by the hundreds, as have mortars, recoilless  guns, and even probable "Stinger" surface-to-air systems. The  Islamic gunmen soon moved from the tactics of "quiet  infiltration" to blatant armed breaches of the border.    This situation could not be tolerated any longer. Russia's  repeated proposals to strengthen the border details with  military subunits from neighboring countries in the region have  finally met with a response. Initially 500 men were allocated  per country. Then, on 24 September 1993, the heads of the  parties to the Collective Security Treaty signed an agreement on  the creation of Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] in  Tajikistan. Colonel General Boris Pyankov was appointed  commander of the CPF.    The agreement signed 24 September envisaged that the  necessary military contingent would be set up by 15 October last  year. This task was carried out. Subunits arrived in good time  from Russia and the Republic of Uzbekistan, as did subunits  allocated by the Republic of Tajikistan. Certain subunits from  the Tajik Defense Ministry were made operationally subordinate  to the CPF command. The question of the Kazakhstani battalion  has been virtually resolved, although, because of certain  differences of opinion in that country's parliament,  participation by Kazakhstani servicemen in the CPF system has  been somewhat delayed.    The CPF are quite an impressive military force. They  comprise ground force units and various kinds of aircraft. They  also have tanks and artillery, air defense, engineering, and  communications systems. Their main task is, together with the  Russian border guards and the subunits supporting them from  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the Tajik Government  troops, to close off the border as tightly as possible and to  ensure reliable protection and defense of it.    Everything necessary has been provided to this end. The CPF  Headquarters is staffed with generals and officers from all the  member states, many of whom have combat experience. Moreover,  there are representatives in Tajikistan from each defense  ministry. This makes it possible to rapidly solve all the  problems that arise.    Unfortunately there are plenty of those problems. This was  confirmed yet again by the joint session of the Commonwealth  foreign and defense ministers during the recent Ashgabat summit.  The session heard a report from Colonel General Boris Pyankov,  commander of the CPF. He stressed yet again that the main  problems continue to be inadequate force staffing and funding.  Moreover, there is a need to redeploy certain CPF subunits to  allow them to carry out their missions more effectively.    As of today a reinforced Uzbek battalion is located near the  population center of Shaartuz, in direct proximity to the  Tajik-Afghan border. It covers the most likely avenues for  armed incursions by gunmen into the Russian Pyandzh Border  Detachment's sphere of responsibility.    The Kazakhstani military contingent, originally sent to  reinforce the Khorog Border Detachment (Gorno-Badakhshan), is  protecting Khorog Airport, accompanying convoys, and taking part  in patrols.    Some forces from Kyrgyzstan are being deployed in the town  of  Murgab (Gorno-Badakhshan), and others in the population center  of Sary-Tash. A battalion is protecting the East Pamir Highway.  One other battalion from Kyrgyzstan is operationally  subordinate to the chief of the Ishkashim Border Detachment.    During the discussion of Boris Pyankov's report the  Kazakhstani side expressed doubt about the expediency of  transferring its forces to the Komsomolbad region deep within  Tajikistan. The reasoning is simple -- the peacekeeping forces  are supposed to be used to protect the border. But the  Komsomolbad region can hardly be considered quiet. As is clear  from the map, it is from here that the hardline opposition plans  to launch one of its strikes against Dushanbe. Moreover,  Kazakhstan believes that the 500 men previously sent to  reinforce the border detail do indeed represent national  peacekeeping forces. That is why it would not be expedient to  send yet another battalion to Tajikistan.    After a brief discussion of these and other problems the  decision was made to take additional measures to stabilize the  situation on the state border. I think that this will solve  many of the problems mentioned in Boris Pyankov's report. After  all, with the coming of spring -- which is not far off in  Tajikistan -- the situation on the border could deteriorate  sharply.    The situation in the republic remains complex. That is  recognized by everyone. But the main thing -- stopping a civil  war -- has been achieved. There is a chance for political and  military reconciliation. The Commonwealth "Blue Helmets" are  extending that chance and giving the Tajik people an opportunity  to forget about the horrors of civil war and start organizing a  peaceful life.</p>

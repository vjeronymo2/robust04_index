			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> CHARGES FILED AGAINST MAN IN RANCH SHOOTING  </P> <P> Matthew G. Kaufman, the 25-year-old man wounded in a shoot-out with Orange  County sheriff's deputies Monday, was charged with attempted murder, assault  with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm, auto theft, receiving stolen  property and resisting arrest, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office filed the charges against Kaufman in the  attempted murder of Sheriff's Deputies Steve Ripple, Wayne Peters and John  Heppert Jr.  </P> <P> Kaufman, whose last known address was in Portland, Ore., was originally  approached by a deputy in Mission Viejo for driving a car reported stolen from  San Francisco last month, police said. After the suspect led deputies on a  5-mile chase from Mission Viejo to a residential cul-de-sac in the Nellie Gail  Ranch area of Laguna Hills, a gun battle took place.  </P> <P> A bullet grazed Ripple's forehead when Kaufman shot at the officers who had  pursued him, authorities said. The other officers were not injured.  </P> <P> Kaufman, a fugitive wanted in Nevada for parole violation, was wounded in the  chest, and a second bullet grazed his forehead when deputies cornered him on  the front steps of a home he was trying to enter.  </P> <P> He was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center where he was listed in  satisfactory condition Friday morning. When discharged, he will be in custody  at Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. Ripple was discharged from the  hospital earlier this week.  </P></p>

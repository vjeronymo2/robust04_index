In the conversation with reporters, Prime Minister Hosokawa  denied a press report that he may reshuffle the cabinet as early  as 15 February. When asked about the possibility of a cabinet  reshuffle after the enactment of the 1994 budget, he said he has  no idea unless the budget is approved.    In a 12 February news conference in Washington, Prime  Minister Hosokawa said he intends to devote himself to the Diet  deliberations on the budget for the time being; the reshuffle of  the cabinet is not on the agenda. It is believed he meant he  would determine if he would reshuffle the cabinet after the Diet  approval of the 1994 budget.    In connection with this, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura said in a news conference this morning that the prime  minister has the authority to determine when to reshuffle the  cabinet. Then, he stated as follows:    [Begin Takemura recording] In my understanding, I did not  feel it was the intention of the prime minister when I met with  him yesterday and today. I guess the prime minister currently  has no plan for a cabinet reshuffle, as he said at yesterday's  news conference. [end recording]</p>

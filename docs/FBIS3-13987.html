Most of  the vehicles seen on the roads belong to the security forces who  have their bunkers after nearly every 300 metres. They have also  taken on lease most of the cinema halls, hotels and commercial  establishments in the towns.    The strength of the security forces deployed in the state  has  doubled between 1989 and 1991, after it was decided to seal the  porous borders. In the three-tier system of defence, army jawans  man the forwardmost areas; the second line is looked after by  the BSF [Border Security Forces] while the BSF and the CRPF  [Central Reserve Police Force] are deployed in the towns and  villages.    The first success came when the infiltration of about 3,500  Pak-trained militants was thwarted. They were forced to spend  the winter across the border, with the cordon and search  operations in full swing. The crackdown led to the nabbing of  Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, the supreme commander of Al Umar. Altaf  Qureishi, chief of the Ikhwan-ul-Musalmeen, was killed. And then  came Sopore, supposedly a "liberated zone," which has been won  back by the security forces, forcing many militants to flee the  valley.    Around the same time, stray reports of the atrocities of  militants on fellow Kashmiris started trickling in. The number  of such complaints is on the rise. "A seven-year-old girl and  five married women walked into a BSF bunker to escape some  militiants who tried to molest them. We were able to catch the  culprits and the women became our `cats' (informers). Two of  them were later killed but we have given protection and jobs in  the CRPF to the others," said an officer.    In Srinagar city, as in Sopore, it is the men of the BSF who  are "holding on to the land." The bunker walls are made of sand  bags, the roofs of tin. The flooring is generally the  waterlogged slushy roadside and the air inside stinks, whether  it is Chhattarbal, Saida Kadal or Karan Nagar. The freezing  temperatures add to the woes of the security forces who have to  keep a constant vigil. The shots can come from a window or door  of any of the three-storeyed houses in all the four directions.    More than the cruel weather, it is the `virtual abandonment'  by the government that the security forces lament about the  most. "When our soldiers are killed by these cowards who use  human shields there is no human rights violation. There is no  good word for the restraint shown by us to ensure that no  civilian is killed. And then to expect us to sit back and watch  our men being fired at, whether in Bijbehara, or Kupwara! Where  are our human rights?" asked an officer.    The recent killing of Maj Bhupender Singh of the Border  Roads Organisation is cited as an example of the government's  callous attitude to the man in the bunker. "When the government  releases some guys it demoralises us. The pain becomes worse  when we see that there is no consistent policy. For five days  they were negotiating and bargaining over the life of Bhupender  Singh. But he did not seem to matter," said a colleague of his.    The manner in which the Hazratbal incident was allowed to  drift to has upset the forces. While it may have helped the  government as far as world pressure was concerned, it was a  setback for them. The militants used the 32-day siege to effect  large-scale transfers of their men from one district to another.  The `cats' or mukhbirs, who help identify the  militants from the suspects rounded up, became helpless after  that.    The security forces also feel that the government has not  planned the anti-militancy drive well. The Punjab government,  they point out, had announced big awards on the heads of wanted  men, giving a share to the informers as well. Such an incentive  would increase the list of informers, they argue.    Despite the strong resentment against the government, the  forces have been moving around, trying to win back the  Kashmiris. The BSF set up a clinic and posted a doctor to  provide medical care to women and children in the downtown  areas. But those who turned up were threatened by the militants.    For the security forces, it is a plain and simple war, where  the enemy is well-armed, well-trained and well-funded. "If we  die, we may get only an award," lamented a jawan.    It was clear that unless other inputs went into solving the  Kashmir problem, the majority of the jawans posted to internal  security duties would put in their papers at the earliest  pensionable opportunity. "Given the fact that 45 battalions are  posted in J&amp;K and that we have a two-year posting now  (earlier  it was four years), we will be back here after four years. For,  a third of the BSF is deployed here," explained an officer.  *</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: Man with the millions - Sport Have you just played badminton in a hall with a leaky roof? Swum over the weekend in a pool that could do with the boiler turned up a notch or two? Then write to Rodney Walker, the man who needs your help in giving away several million pounds a week to sport's good causes. After decades of being strapped for cash, British sport will soon be awash with the stuff, courtesy of the new national lottery, which starts next month. According to Walker, newly appointed to the role of sport's Santa Claus, the most conservative revenue forecasts will provide him with Pounds 100m in the first year, rising to a minimum of Pounds 250m in 1997. This sort of money represents a four-to-fivefold increase on current spending by the Sports Council, where Walker is both the new chairman and new broom. Anyone who has sat on a charity or trust and tried to give money away will know how hard it can be. Often there are too few applicants, and the body handing out the cash is not sufficiently well organised to go out and find suitable recipients. Or the claimants that do step forward are pushy, noisy and ill-deserving. Walker is under no illusions about his task. 'Giving it away effectively and hitting the target consistently is going to be difficult. It's an onerous responsibility', he said from the office of the construction business he founded in Wakefield, Yorkshire. His previous biggest job in sport was chairing the Rugby League, a role he came to via the boardroom of Wakefield Trinity, the local professional club. In chatting to Walker it seemed both essential and tactless to point out that the Sports Council has become a byword for profligate bureaucracy. Indeed, rigorous analysis of the malaise in many British sports would conclude that the Sports Council is part of the problem, rather than the answer. Luckily, its new chairman is temperamentally inclined to vigorous cutting and pruning, an approach discreetly backed by sports minister Ian Sproat. However, the new boss has to square a difficult circle. He cannot start handing out big sums with the help only of a secretary and an answerphone. His own guess is that he'll need around 100 people spread across the country to scrutinise applications for money, which are already flooding in at a rate that could reach 30,000 a year. 'I'm committed to reducing bureaucracy at the Sports Council, so in a sense it's a wonderful opportunity to transfer people across to the lottery unit and give them something worthwhile to do,' he told me. Whitehall's guidelines for lottery proceeds stipulate that grants be made for capital projects rather than current spending. At first glance this seems understandable, even laudable. On reflection, however, I have huge doubts about its wisdom. After all, a running track or a sports hall sounds tangible and reassuring - money well spent. But many elite sports are short of day-to-day cash. When the British rowing crews did so well at the world championships in the US recently, the oarsmen had to spend around Pounds 800 each on air fares to Indianapolis, causing considerable individual hardship. A new boat-house at Putney or another racing shell is almost the last thing they need. Walker is sympathetic, but says that his team must accumulate respectability and credibility with the brief they have been handed before they can start re-writing the rules. 'As the government's confidence in the operation grows, I'm sure they'll be able to give us more discretion,' he predicted. Initially, his biggest concern is to ensure that organisations qualifying for large capital grants will have enough income to run their new assets. 'I don't want to put Pounds 2m into a wonderful new facility and then find we've been pouring money into a black hole that's got no chance of becoming self-funding in future,' he says. This has been a problem with some of the projects funded by the Foundation for Sports and the Arts, the charity set up to recycle about Pounds 40m a year from the promoters of commercial football pools. For example, three years ago the FSA handed over Pounds 1m to a group planning a racing yacht for the 1994 Whitbread round-the-world race. Dolphin &amp; Youth was duly built, but was desperately strapped for operating cash as the race progressed. Today, there is little money to maintain her, but the terms of the gift preclude a sale. 'There have been disappointments for the FSA, but I applaud what they've achieved,' says Walker cautiously. His own game-plan seems to be two-fold. First, to lean towards commercially viable projects capable of creating their own revenue base. Community swimming pools would be a classic example. Second, to create income-producing 'endowments' that will accompany major grants of a type that might otherwise take years to become self-supporting. This has echoes of the National Trust. For years this most ruthlessly efficient of British charities has refused gifts of land or houses unless accompanied by an endowment sufficient to cover running costs. In this way it has avoided the financial swamps and opprobrium it would have attracted if it had accepted roof-less country mansions or neglected woodlands. Walker's other line of thought is to encourage applications from commercial providers of sports facilities. It may take a little swallowing for the traditional sports bureaucracy to see quasi-public sector money going to those who build marinas or golf courses for profit. But he does not hesitate. He knows he has no alternative if he is to hand out that mountain of cash 'effectively'. 'Personally I have no trouble recommending giving the money to a successful commercial enterprise,' he says. 'I'm a great believer in rewarding success and effort, wherever you find it.'</p>

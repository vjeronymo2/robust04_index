			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: DC Cook jumps 55% to Pounds 1.57m DC Cook Holdings, the motor retail group, saw interim pre-tax profits surge 55 per cent from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 1.57m on turnover 15 per cent up at Pounds 86.7m, against Pounds 75.1m. Mr Derek Cook, chairman, said: 'the performance of the motor division has once again been outstanding and fully justifies the decision to concentrate on this our core activity.' The division had performed better than at any time in the last five years, he added. New car sales were up 31 per cent on last time, when sales were already 61 per cent higher than the previous year. Used car sales rose by a further 13 per cent this year, following last year's 40 per cent increase. The after sales contribution had also shown a significant rise of 29 per cent. Earnings per share in the six months to October 31 grew from 1.71p to 2.46p and the interim dividend was stepped up 50 per cent to 0.45p (0.3p). Mr Cook said a non-executive director would be appointed in January and a further appointment would be made by the spring.</p>

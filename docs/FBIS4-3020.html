			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev left here Saturday [16 April] for  Belgrade to discuss Bosnian settlement, according to Russian  Foreign Ministry sources.    In Belgrade, the capital of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, Kozyrev "will take part in talks on Bosnian  settlement," the sources said.    The talks will also be attended by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's special envoy in the region Vitaly Churkin, who also  is deputy foreign minister.    According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, both Kozyrev and  Churkin persuaded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  to cancel plans for new air strikes on Bosnian Serbs who, as  NATO said, had shelled the town of Gorazde in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the six former Yugoslav republics.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned  Kozyrev  on Saturday morning to tell him that NATO aircraft were ready to  launch new air strikes on Bosnian Serbs, the ITAR-TASS said.    Kozyrev immediately informed Churkin, who was in the Serb-  controlled city of Pale near Sarajero, about his telephone talk  with Christopher. The Russian envoy soon contacted Bosnian Serb  leaders and reported back that there was no artillery shelling  of Gorazde.    In addition, Bosnian Serb army commander General Radko  Mladic  assured Churkin that his troops will not storm Gorazde or shell  it.    Moscow quickly relayed this information to Washington and  preparations for new air strikes were cancelled, the ITAR-TASS  said.    However, the news agency reported, Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka on Saturday that Serb troops  have not entered Gorazde but have seized all strategic heights  around it.</p>

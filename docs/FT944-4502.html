			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / CAA attacks use of private finance The Civil Aviation Authority has expressed deep scepticism about the government's determination to use private finance to fund capital investment programmes for air traffic control services. It has reluctantly accepted that private finance will be used to create the new Scottish air traffic control centre at Prestwick in Ayrshire. But it says that the use of private finance may result in higher charges to airlines and says it does not believe private funding to be appropriate for many other air traffic control projects. The CAA, which has made its views clear to the Department of Transport, expressed its reservations about the private finance initiative (PFI) in a submission to the Commons transport committee. The Prestwick project includes new buildings, computers, software and radar to replace the existing Scottish centre for the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) - a joint venture between the CAA and the Ministry of Defence - which covers the airspace over Scotland and part of the North Atlantic. Under the private finance initiative, which the government wants to apply to most capital projects, a private consortium would build and equip the new centre, whose cost was last year put at Pounds 148m, and lease it to the CAA. The CAA says that air traffic control in the UK is a complex integrated operation from which it would be difficult to separate a single project. After nearly a year's discussion the Treasury has agreed, however, that NATS will have a bigger role in managing the Prestwick project than would be the case in a normal PFI project. It says the PFI method may result in higher charges being asked of airlines because private finance costs more than government-borrowed money. The CAA says that if PFI were used to finance a number of smaller projects there would be a risk of creating a system with multiple suppliers and equipment types, which would be expensive to maintain. The Prestwick project was scheduled for completion in 2000 but has been delayed by at least a year because of the need to process tenders from private sector consortia.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Craxi receives 11th warning of investigation THE central position of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, in Italy's corruption scandals was underlined yesterday when Milan magistrates issued him with an 11th separate notice that he was under investigation for alleged illicit funding of political parties. The latest notice was part of a batch affecting seven deputies and senators served by Milan magistrates. Apart from alleged illicit party funding, the magistrates are seeking to investigate allegations of corruption and the illegal receipt of money relating to contracts from Anas, the state roads authority, and Acea, the Rome electricity company. All but one of the seven parliamentarians are already involved in one or several corruption scandals. Mr Craxi received his first notice of investigation on December 15, and on March 9 the parliamentary commission responsible for immunity issues agreed to waive his immunity to face corruption charges relating to the first seven requests by Milan magistrates. Mr Craxi has consistently denied any wrong-doing and claims the magistrates have deliberately sought to destroy him and the Socialist party. However, both Mr Giorgio La Malfa and Mr Renato Altissimo have been forced to resign respectively from the leadership of the Republican and Liberal parties because of allegations they received illegal funds. Also yesterday, Mr Severino Citaristi, the former treasurer of the Christian Democrats, was served with his 21st notice of investigation for alleged corruption. This is almost double the number of notices served on Mr Craxi, and by a long shot the record number in the current scandals. The Christian Democrats now have 31 parliamentarians caught up in magistrates' investigations. The party yesterday sacked most of its national executive to try to clean up its image. The executive was cut from 48 to 15 permanent members. To underline the reforming nature of the meeting of the council which voted in the new executive, party president Rosa Russo Jervolino told members touched by the scandal to stay away.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: New FT-SE index rule on stapled units The following announcement was made yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee. The Committee has today approved a new rule governing the treatment of stapled units. The effect of the new rule is that SmithKline Beecham Units will remain a constituent of the FT-SE Indices and that Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group will be eligible for inclusion in the FT-SE Indices at the end of 1994. The weighting of the SB Units in the indices will, based on information provided by the company, remain unchanged, although subject to annual review following the publication of the company's audited accounts beginning in 1995. The weighting of Rothmans and Vendome will be determined by the UK Indices Committee in December this year after the publication of the audited accounts of the two companies and reviewed annually thereafter. Rothmans and Vendome have informed the Steering Committee that under the new rule, they believe approximately 30 per cent of the market value of the Rothmans Units and approximately 10 per cent of the market value of the Vendome Units would be eligible for inclusion in the indices. These proportions may change when the audited accounts of the two groups are finalised. A stapled unit is a unit which comprises shares in two separate companies (often of different nationalities) which are twinned in the form of a single indivisible unit for the purposes of trading and for which a single price exists for the unit rather than the underlying shares. A share index is calculated from the share prices of its constituent companies each weighted to account for the company's relative importance in the index. In the FT-SE Indices, the weighting factor is derived from a company's issued equity share capital. The problem posed by multinational stapled units, for a UK index, is determining how much of the combined unit's capitalisation is attributable to the UK company. Once this is done, the required weighting can be calculated. The new rule provides a way of arriving at this weighting. The weighting of a UK company, traded as part of a stapled unit, will be based on the equity share capital where this matches the attributable earnings and dividend flows. Otherwise, the economic value of the eligible (UK incorporated and tax resident) company will be assessed by comparing the asset values of the eligible and ineligible companies within the unit.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Anxiety over job loss fades Anxiety among part-time workers about the prospect of losing their jobs fell sharply in April, the latest MORI survey for the Financial Times says. This compares with a levelling out among full-time workers about whether they are very, or fairly, concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12 months. The results will bring some small comfort to the government, coming together with indications that people are slightly less pessimistic about the economic out-look. However, a fifth of working people remain very concerned about losing their jobs, thereby hindering a consumer-led recovery. Forty-four per cent of full-time and part-time workers questioned in April by MORI were either very or fairly concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12 months. This compares with 46 per cent in March and 48 per cent in February. The greatest boost in confidence came from part-time workers. The proportion who were either very or fairly concerned fell to 35 per cent, compared with 46 per cent in March when part-time and full-time workers were equally anxious. The proportion of full-time workers expressing concern remained unchanged, at 46 per cent. The most pessimistic about their prospects remained male manual workers. People in the north of England and Scotland were also negative about prospects. The monthly series began in April last year. Pessimism about job prospects in-creased consistently until July, since when there has been much volatility. However, April is the second successive month in which there has been a downward trend. MORI had face-to-face interviews with 1,034 people aged 18 or over who worked full or part-time.</p>

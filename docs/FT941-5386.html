			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Welcome deal in Germany The last-minute agreement to avert a German engineering strike shows that both employers and trade unions are making a serious effort to restore competitiveness in Europe's largest economy. A strike this week in the northern state of Lower Saxony to support a claim for a country-wide pay rise of up to 6 per cent would have severely damaged Germany's efforts to climb out of recession. With unemployment now above 4m, and inflation probably falling below 3 per cent later this year, a labour stoppage would have started a battle the IG Metall union could not have won. The weekend deal contains positive elements for both sides. As compensation for a wage rise of only 1.2 per cent for the whole year, the union has won employer approval for specific job guarantees at companies that reduce pay and working hours because of falling orders. After a cumulative rise in German unit labour costs of 15 per cent in the past four years, the wage accord gives employers the opportunity to make badly needed cuts in unit costs as they improve productivity. It could be argued that the agreed increases in labour market flexibility should have been more radical. Some details of the package of wage and job cutting options look unhelpful. Additionally, the country-wide engineering pay bargaining structure, one of the main sources of wage rigidity in recent years, has survived intact. A strike could have weakened the system by encouraging more plants to agree wage deals on a company-by-company basis. However, an accord which unambiguously favours competitiveness while preserving Germany's consensus-based social partnership is still welcome. The outcome will strengthen the government's chances of pushing through necessary pay restraint in forthcoming public sector pay talks. In a country still struggling to come to terms with many economic challenges, one pay deal cannot transform the industrial outlook. Germany must make a more determined effort to tackle the non-wage costs which have had a still greater impact than high wages in lowering industrial performance. Reflecting the consequences of recession and reunification, social security payments in Germany, according to OECD figures, are likely to make up 22 per cent of GDP this year, up from 15.2 per cent in 1990 - a much larger increase than in any other big industrialised country. Finding methods of satisfying welfare demands without heaping job-killing financial burdens on enterprises will be a principal task for the government that emerges from the October elections. Germany needs to maintain its traditional consensus between labour and capital, yet in a manner more responsive to economic realities than in recent years. The metalworkers' deal demonstrates that both sides of industry can adopt constructive policies. If they can build on this approach, confidence in German recovery will grow.</p>

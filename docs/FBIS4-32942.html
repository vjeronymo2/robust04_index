			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has  asked the Mexican National Congress for permission to pay an  official visit to Cuba next month. Salinas will travel to  Havana and then to Cartagenas de Indias to attend the fourth  Ibero-American summit.    Salinas' request to the Mexican parliament notes that Mexico  and Cuba maintain respectful diplomatic relations and highlights  that Cuba is part of Mexico's Caribbean border. Furthermore,  throughout history and in the context of respectful bilateral  relations and profound ties of appreciation between the two  peoples, Cuban-Mexican ties have made room for international  cooperation, which can be interpreted today as an agenda that  merits contacts. The presidential request concludes by pointing  out that the Mexican head of state's presence in Cuba will help  boost bilateral relations, the evaluation of the bilateral  agenda, and the exploration of new ways to diversify and  strengthen those relations.</p>

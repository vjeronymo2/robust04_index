			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: The re-design that changed the original nature of Milton Keynes Sir, Colin Amery's acute review of Milton Keynes after 25 years ('Milton Keynes, the view from the grid', January 27) is a telling diagnosis. But he is wrong to say that 'what you see derives strictly from the plan created in the late 1960s . . .' The actual development departed from the initial plan right from the outset in some crucial respects - which helps to explain why it is not '. . . of the calibre needed to make it a city'. The plan envisaged that the densities of housing and services would be at their highest along the grid roads. Every kilometre or so, at the points between the main intersections, you would come to dense housing, bus stops, schools, shops, bars and other services and feel you were moving through a city. Main road traffic would go at about 30mph so it would be safe to pull up. Built areas would only be separated from the roads around (noisy) main junctions. One of the first things the development corporation did was to redesign the roads for high speeds. This entailed more noise (thus the hills and forests to absorb it) and made it too noisy and unsafe for buildings to adjoin roads or for kerb-side parking. Thus housing and work areas are cocooned in hills and forests, local commerce is largely invisible to passers-by and Mr Amery misses an urban feeling. He is not alone. Some of us who worked in the original planning team remonstrated against this change, but to no avail. Perhaps we can try again in the Thames corridor.

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Elkem shares tumble on disappointing results SHARES in Elkem, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, fell sharply yesterday when the company announced a pre-tax loss before extraordinary items of NKr367m (Dollars 59.72m) - the same as for the previous corresponding period. The depth of Elkem's problems were highlighted after it was disclosed that the company has approached the industry ministry to help strengthen its capital base. Elkem is seeking exemption from Norway's electricity tax and new taxes on electricity production or use. The group's equity-to-debt ratio has weakened to 20 per cent from 22 per cent since January. The company last month sought postponement by the government of a NKr270m loan used to acquire a 45 per cent stake in former state-owned Norsk Jern Holding, which controls steel production and distribution companies. Elkem announced its nine-month figures three days earlier than originally planned in order to stem speculation in its shares. The A shares closed NKr5.50 down to NKr21.50 yesterday as Free shares shed NKr4 to NKr28. Elkem blamed its troubles on a weak market but said it is taking measures to strengthen long-term financing. Group sales fell by NKr423m to NKr5.44bn but operating losses narrowed to NKr20m from NKr97m. Pre-tax losses after extraordinary items widened to NKr307m from NKr188m last year. The company made a NKr60m profit on the sale of Elkem Eiendom, a real estate subsidiary. In the same period last year, it returned a NKr179m profit on the disposal of its 50 per cent stake in Alcoa Nederland Holding.</p>

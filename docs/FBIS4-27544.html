			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  reported progress in revived trade talks on Thursday [2 June]  but said they remain apart on key issues in the insurance sector  negotiations.    "The mood was not that the two sides are in dispute" in the  two-day insurance talks in Tokyo, said a senior Japanese Finance  Ministry official. "Both sides appear to favor a quick  settlement."    A U.S. trade official called the talks "successful meetings,  but just one step in what are going to be difficult  negotiations."    "We obviously still have considerable work ahead of us  before  we complete our agreement," he said. "We are anxious to  conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible."    No deadline has been set for the insurance sector, but the  official said the two sides were "adjusting their schedules" to  finish before a July summit of major industrial nations.    They agreed to start drafting an accord when they meet again  late this month, but they have yet to delve in detail on the  sticky issue of "objective criteria" to gauge progress in  opening Japan's markets, he said.    Most of the meetings consisted of catching up on events  since  bilateral trade "framework" talks broke down in February and on  confirming the progress they made before the rupture, said the  Japanese and U.S. officials separately, each declining to be  named.    Negotiators were halfway to agreement when talks broke down  over other sectors and neither side is making new demands, the  Japanese official said.    But serious differences remain, with the U.S. continuing to  press for what the U.S. official called its most important issue  -- deregulation of prices, terms and conditions of insurance  policies in Japan.    Washington insists that Japan allow competition in prices  and  innovative policies in the life and nonlife sectors, saying  Japanese consumers have essentially no choice in either area,  the U.S. official said.    Negotiators have not attempted to define objective criteria  to measure progress in opening Japan's market, as called for in  the framework accord signed last July, the Japanese official  said. Both sides cited earlier commitments that such criteria  will not become "numerical targets."    Such wrangling in the two other key sectors -- government  procurement and autos and auto parts -- scuttled the framework  talks in February.    The issue of instituting a system of insurance brokers to  help Japanese consumers get the best policies is "still  unresolved," the U.S. official said. Japan has agreed in  principle to the system but the official said there is no point  in having a broker if there is no real choice among policies or  prices.    The U.S. also wants simpler, clearer licensing procedures.    On the other hand, Japan is seeking uniformity in licensing  in the U.S. insurance market, complaining that state-by-state  regulatory jurisdictions block foreign firms from entering.    The Japanese official said the U.S. agreed to negotiate on  access to its own market, but the U.S. official refused to  confirm it. He indicated, however, that U.S. negotiators  responded to Japanese questions by explaining voluntary measures  being taken by state insurance commissioners for more uniform  standards.    The U.S. official denied the U.S. is trying to make Tokyo go  slowly in liberalizing the foreign-dominated "third sector" that  includes disease and nursing coverage and stands outside of life  and standard nonlife insurance.    But freeing that area ahead of the others would mean "the  wiping out of many companies in the third sector without any  opportunity for them to compete in the life and nonlife  sectors," the U.S. official said.    The Japanese official said there were "no particular  discussions" on the third sector.    Bilateral talks were to start Thursday in Washington on  autos  and auto parts and Friday in Tokyo on Japanese Government  procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina to woo mining investors ARGENTINA WILL shortly be putting forward a new draft law to encourage foreign investment in the mining industry, probably this week. Mr Erman Gonzalez, the defence minister, said in an interview that the law would be along the lines of the Houston Plan, which has opened up Argentina's oil industry to foreign capital. The defence ministry is closely involved in the government's plans to liberalise Argentina's industry and natural resources because these sectors were previously under state control, partly for military reasons. Mr Gonzalez said the new law would grant investors a ten-year tax holiday and eliminate curbs on foreign capital. He added, however, that the state would preserve a stake in the country's mineral reserves to retain a measure of control. Although Argentina's mineral assets are thought to be considerable , there has so far been little exploration activity because of the high level of state control and inadequate infrastructure. One feature of the new mining law will permit companies to deduct any money spent on environmental protection from corporation tax payments. Mr Gonzalez also confirmed that the first stage in the privatisation of YPF, the state oil company, would begin in the first quarter of next year. The government will retain 20 per cent of the company for itself. Argentina is also in the process of privatising the domestic gas distribution network. Bids are due in by the end of the year. So far, 21 companies have expressed an interest, many of them foreign.</p>

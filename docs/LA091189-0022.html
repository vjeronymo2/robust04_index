			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: 'TWAS A LOWLY JEEP THAT WON WORLD WAR II  </P> <P> My indefatigable correspondent Duke Russell has sent me a clipping from the New  York Times reporting that the Army is going to replace the Jeep with something  called the Hummer.  </P> <P> This should twang the strings of nostalgia for every man and woman who served  in uniform in World War II. The Jeep was ubiquitous. It was the most useful and  beloved of military vehicles. It was more crucial, in the long run, than mobile  guns, tanks or even, I suspect, the battleship.  </P> <P> I'm sure the Jeep was involved in many actual combat situations, and I have no  doubt that it served with honor. But to most GIs it will be remembered with  affection as the vehicle of leisure, of liberty, of non-military but  life-enhancing missions.  </P> <P> Anybody who has ever seen a war movie is familiar with the Jeep, that sturdy  little boxlike vehicle with two seats front and back, no top and a snub nose.  It is the vehicle U.S. generals are shown riding in when they visit the field.  (German generals ride in Mercedes phaetons.)  </P> <P> It was the vehicle in which John Hodiak, as a major, entered the war-stricken  Italian village of Adano, in "A Bell for Adano," and the vehicle in which,  having angered higher-ups, he left.  </P> <P> In the TV series "MASH," Hawkeye and Hotlips had their only romantic clinch  when they were out riding in a Jeep and were forced to take cover from enemy  fire.  </P> <P> As a mere noncom in the Marine Corps, I did not often have access to a Jeep.  But once on Maui, when I was doing public relations for the Fourth Division, I  was assigned a Jeep and a photographer and told to find a model young Marine  and a pretty girl from one of the nearby towns and show them romancing at  Maui's picture places.  </P> <P> I found the Marine, and I found the girl in Wailuku, and we drove them in our  Jeep from the Fourth Division camp, in the valley below Haleakala, to Hana,  which was said to have the island's most beautiful beach. There was then no  real road -- only a roadbed that had been dynamited out. It was full of holes  and boulders. It was a bone-jarring trip. The model Marine and I rode in back,  which bounced harder. We posed the Marine and the girl on the pristine beach --  there was nothing there then but an agricultural station -- and then drove  back. I was so shaken up by the ride that I had to spend three days in sick  bay.  </P> <P> On about D-plus-5 on Iwo Jima I was holed up in a wrecked Japanese concrete  bunker when an enlisted man came by in a Jeep. He was lost. I persuaded him to  drive me over the battlefield to Fifth Division headquarters, at the foot of  Mt. Suribachi, on the promise that I could get some booze there. I was a friend  of the Fifth's medical officer, and I knew that he would have an oversupply of  medicinal brandy, if I could find him.  </P> <P> Fifth Division headquarters was merely a number of shell holes covered by  tarpaulins. I asked from one to the next until I found my friend. He was  sitting alone in his hole, surrounded by medical supplies. He appeared to be in  shock, but he revived and greeted me warmly. I explained my mission and he gave  me an armful of brandy in two-ounce bottles. The driver was well rewarded for  driving me, and that night I shared the rest with my companions in the bunker.  </P> <P> After the war I was stationed for a while in Pearl Harbor, writing stories  about Marines who had been imprisoned throughout the war by the Japanese. I  wanted to go home. I had a son I hadn't seen. I kept bugging the colonel. He  finally told me, "I want to go home, too, Smith."  </P> <P> "But you have a Jeep, colonel," I told him. "And a girlfriend," I added  maliciously. Two weeks later I was on a midget aircraft carrier, headed toward  San Diego and home.  </P> <P> The Army says the Hummer is "substantially larger and far more versatile than  the Jeep," and "the troops love them."  </P> <P> "I weepeth," Duke says, "but that's good enough for me. Survival is the name of  the game."  </P> <P> Oh, well, we still have those old movies.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / South Africa in bank debt talks THE SOUTH AFRICAN government has held discussions in London with creditor banks in an attempt to negotiate a final arrangement of the debt standstill that has been in place since 1985. The third interim arrangement between the government and creditor banks, regulating repayment of loans frozen since 1985 when the government declared a moratorium on capital repayments of over half of its outstanding debt, expires at the end of 1993. The talks are aimed at deciding terms for the repayment of the remaining Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn), still subject to the standstill agreement, which comes due then. A final arrangement will have a beneficial impact on bankers' and investors' perceptions of South Africa's creditworthiness. However, any pressure it may put on the country's balance of payments could undermine an economic recovery vital to underpinning the transition to democracy. Those close to the talks, which took place over the past two days at Standard Chartered Bank, say South African has proposed a final arrangement, which would run to the year 2000. At the end of this seven-year period South Africa would have fully repaid all amounts owing since 1985. The offer is reported to be that principal repayments will continue to be made for the first four years at about Dollars 385m a year - about the same rate as under the existing arrangement. The remaining Dollars 3.9bn will be repaid over the last three years in equal semi-annual instalments. Early indications are that the government's terms have been fairly well received among European banks but it is understood that certain US banks are reluctant to accept a final arrangement unless it has the approval of the African National Congress. Mr Jonathan Leape of the London School of Economics said a seven-year repayment schedule implied a doubling of the average annual repayment under the third interim arrangement. This places a potentially heavy burden of capital outflows on the economy during the transition period. South Africa's total foreign debt is about Dollars 18bn, in current exchange rate terms, compared to Dollars 23.7bn when the standstill was declared.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China will tighten macro-level control over the  economy to ensure a "stable environment" for its bold drive for  a socialist market economy, according to a report by State  Planning Commission (SPC) Minister Chen Jinhua. The report on  economic and social development, to be tabled by Mr Chen at the  National People's Congress (NPC) this morning, laid down a  detailed strategy to introduce macro-level adjustment and  control over the economy through economic and legal tools, as  well as "the requisite state fiats".    The preservation of social stability is a must in the  process  of further seeking economic growth and pushing forward the  reform programme for a market economy, Mr Chen said in his  29-page report. "Nothing can start without a stable social  environment," he said. Adjustment and control over the economy  must be strengthened and further improved to ensure targets of  economic and social development for 1994 will be realised, said  Mr Chen.    The major targets listed by Mr Chen included:    -- GNP growth rate of nine percent.    -- Total fixed asset investment of 1,300 billion yuan  (HK$1,154 billion) for 1994.    -- A deficit forecast of 66.9 billion yuan. Together with  domestic and foreign debts and loans, total debts will reach  129.2 billion yuan this year.    -- A ceiling of 470 billion yuan for new bank credit.    -- A total value of imports and exports of US$200 billion  (HK$1,544 billion). Imports of US$100 billion and exports of  US$ 100 billion.    -- An increase in retail prices will be kept within 10  percent.    Speaking yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli explained  that the total estimated deficit was much higher as a result of  the introduction of a new budget auditing system in order to  keep inline with international practice. He put the estimate of  deficit at about 30 billion yuan based on last year's accounting  method which is significantly higher than the 20.5 billion yuan  deficit last year. The country's financial situation, described  by Mr Liu as "severe" in his budget, will also be reported on at  today's NPC session.    The macro-adjustment and control was to "mutually  coordinate"  and "harmonise" with the need to maintain "reform development  and stability". Although "development is the rigorous test of  reason", the SPC head said the pursuit of development should  have "new ideas". The crux is to focus on optimising economic  structure, speed up technological improvement, strengthen  management and boost efficiency," he said. "Only by doing this  can development help create a better economic environment for re  form and be beneficial to social stability." Mr Chen maintained  that the enforcement of major fiscal, taxation, investment,  foreign trade and enterprise reforms should be closely  monitored. Any new problems should be solved promptly, he said.  All regions and departments should make efforts to contain  inflation by co-ordinating all economic and legal tools and the  necessary administrative measures, he said.    The senior official, seen as a close ally of Vice-Premier  Zhu  Rongji, indicated that the major task of macro-adjustment and  control was to balance the overall supply and demand. The task  must begin with strict control over fixed assets investment, he  said. In addition to the ban on fixed assets projects, Mr Chen  ordered banks at all levels to strictly follow the loan plan for  such projects. Inter-bank loans should be scrutinised and any  illegal raising of funds should not be allowed to revive, the  official said. The focus of real estate should be placed in  co-ordination with the Government's housing reform, he said,  warning against any move to expand capital investment under the  disguise of building more residential flats.    Mr Chen revealed that the SPC and relevant departments and  regions would tighten up supervision over the planning of  projects of some special "popular products and projects". This,  he maintained, will avoid blind and repetitive construction  plans and maximise the use of resources. On the demand side, Mr  Chen has vowed to strictly control the growth of the level of  wages. Unregulated payment of bonus and subsidies will be  stopped, he said. The central Government would also promote  frugality and resolutely oppose the prevailing phenomenon of  extravagance, he said. Mr Chen said the central bank would be  strengthened to control on the growth of money supply and  credit. The revamp of the fiscal order will continue, he added.    In the face of the high inflation last year, the SPC chief  admitted that the inflationary pressure this year remained  strong, citing plans to readjust the prices of daily necessities  including energy, grain and cotton. A series of measures have  to be taken to ensure price rises are being kept at an  acceptable level. These included the increase of supply by  boosting the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, sugar and  meat; cracking-down against illicit raising of prices; and the  establishment of a comprehensive supervisory and controlling  mechanism on prices.    Mr Chen disclosed that the State Council had decided to  launch two nationwide inspection on prices in the first and  second halves of this year to crack down on price hoarding and  activities that disrupt market order.</p>

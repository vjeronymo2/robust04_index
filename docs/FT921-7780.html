			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Cash boost for building training THE Construction Industry Training Board will offer larger grants this year to employers willing to take on or retain trainees. The initiative includes a rise of nearly 20 per cent in grants to employers who provide craft and technician training under the auspices of the Youth Training scheme for first-year entrants to the industry. Grants for employers whose trainees pass an approved skills test or gain one of the new level three National Vocational Qualifications will rise by 40 per cent and 60 per cent respectively. The increased payments, which have to be approved by the government, are part of a Pounds 45m CITB grants package for 1992-93. Course fees at the four CITB training centres have been frozen for 12 months. There are about 8,700 YT trainees in the industry, compared with about 10,500 last summer.</p>

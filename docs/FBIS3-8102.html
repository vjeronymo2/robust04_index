			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> Dragan Colovic; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, we are talking about  Croatian-Muslim agreement reached in Washington between the  Croats and Muslims about a joint federation and a confederation  with Croatia. This agreement, which was reached under the  auspices of the United States, has been interpreted differently.  Moreover, there are many reserves about its feasibility  considering the fierce Muslim-Croatian clashes that have been  underway for several months already. However, some dilemnas  still remain and are still appearing. Where, in fact, lies the  final [words indistinct] when Serbs are completely ignored in  all this?    [Jovanovic] First, this is a bilateral agreement, and the  war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a (?trilateral) civil war. This is a  bilateral agreement that was reached with the active help of a  foreign power, which also sets certain limitations. Finally,  this is an agreement that, in the way it works, is virtually  suspending, if not disregarding, the tripartite agreement on the  union of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was reached at the Geneva  conference. These are three facts that represent [word  indistinct] objective limitations on the agreement and cast a  certain light on the agreement as an independent action that has  been developing while disregarding, and often contrary to, what  has so far been done within the Geneva conference and in the  ancillary efforts, be they within the European Community, by  Russia, or by some other countries.    However, if this bilateral agreement is aimed at a humane  goal, that is, to extinguish the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  at the moment, the only form of real civil war in Bosnia is the  war waged between the Muslims and Croats, and if on the basis of  that result it wants to regulate relations between the Muslims  and the Croats in a permanent way, not touching on the interests  and rights of the third, Serb, side, then there will be nothing  to object to in such an agreement. However, if it has some  other aims, if it not only left the third side unconsulted, but  even faced it with an impossible choice between accepting and  rejecting the agreement -- albeit in case it fails to accept it,  it would have to be punished for its alleged uncooperativeness  -- then this agreement could be qualified as the agreement of  two sides against the third, with the assistance of a major  power. I would not like to forecast that this may come true,  but if it nevertheless happens, it will be a big step backward  in comparison with the present situation and the efforts made  within Geneva conference for a tripartite, just, and permanent  end to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In this agreement, we have several elements that warn that  this offer will be of very little attraction to the Bosnian  Serbs. The setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being returned to the  canton concept, a concept of several cantons to boot. Central  authorities are essentially strengthened compared to what was  envisaged in the constitutional arrangement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three republics. And finally,  what is most important, the question of territorial borders has  not been mentioned at all, and this setting of borders should be  done, above all, in close cooperation with the Serbian side.  The fact that this most-important question, without which there  is no further work, [words indistinct] in this (?bilateral)  agreement, is the greatest drawback of this agreement as it  points to its basic weak point, that is, that it is an agreement  of two sides and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a war of three  sides. And the third side, which was probably the most  significant in this situation, was not included in the process  of agreeing and decision making, so that it remains completely  unclear as to what further attitude the authors of the agreement  and the people interested in its implementation are going to  have toward the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, how could all that reflect on the  current state of Serbian-Croatian relations? What I have in  mind is what has been reached in Geneva in the agreement on the  beginning of normalization of relations between Belgrade and  Zagreb?    [Jovanovic] The decision of the two sides, Serb and  Croatian, to make the first step in the process of normalization  represents the result of awareness that without settling  Serbo-Croatian relations on the whole, there can be no mention  of any permanent settlement of the situation and stability in  the Balkans. This awareness is not only this on the Croatian  and Serbian sides, but also on the side of all other factors who  are involved in solving the Yugoslav crisis. Therefore,  logically, this Washington agreement should not suspend the  agreement between the governments of the FRY and the Republic of  Croatia on opening offices on both sides, nor should its  provisions, and particularly its unexpressed aims, confront the  aims that the opened process of normalization of relations  between FRY and Croatia wants to reach.    However, many unclear points in the Washington agreement,  above all the unclear point on the question of the further  treatment of the Serbian side in Bosnia and also the ambiguity  regarding the attraction [privlacnost] that made Croatia accept  something it has always categorically rejected so far, commands  caution as well as an increased carefulness. For any attempt to  put this agreement into practice or to interpret it as an  agreement against overall Serbian interests may not only  aggravate the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also call into  question the very process of normalization between the FRY and  the Republic of Croatia.    [Colovic] Some people fear that the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina could soon become -- if it is not exactly  that already -- an arena of competition between the United  States and Russia for the division of spheres of interest, not  only in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia, but, also, starting  from the war in Bosnia, the competition would spread to the  entire Balkans. How would you comment on that?    [Jovanovic] Well, it cannot be good if the crisis in Bosnia  would last longer or if it was complicated further. It cannot  be good for the peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for the interests  of the neighboring states, and certainly not for the peace and  stability in the region as a whole. Everybody who thinks  responsibly about politics is doing everything with a view to  ending this war as soon as possible and finding a complete,  just, and permanent solution.    However, there are a lot of foreign interests that have,  after all, brought about the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  pushed its people into the civil war, that have still not been  satisfied, and that can also expand and be realized only with  the continuation of the crisis. A quick end to the crisis does  not suit many of these interests, and particularly not an end  that would cap the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina and accelerate  the solution of other aspects of the overall Yugoslav crisis.    What is alarming, even after this Washington agreement,  even though there is plenty of talk about the end of war, peace,  and political cooperation between some entities, is that we are  still not close to this goal and that, perhaps, we should fear  that we will not get all that close to it if the suspicions that  this agreement means the reanimation of a Muslim-Croatian axis  against the Serbs on the territories of the former Yugoslavia  and against the FRY prove to be true.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, finally, can you say a few words  about the future of the international conference on former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and former Yugoslavia? Can the latest  development of events threaten it? Is its mandate changing? I  am referring primarily to the new initiatives. There has been  talk about the summit of the five, which, as it is alleged,  would also be open to others?    [Jovanovic] The peace process has so far evolved within the  framework of the mandate and support of the UN, the European  Union, and other relevant international factors, primarily the  Bosnia-Herzegovina factors, understandably. The Washington  initiative and its fruit, however, are a result of an entirely  separate treatment of the important segments of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, independent of the framework of this  peace process and even contrary to the hitherto joint stance and  of the outcome that was particularly pronounced in the  constitutional document about the regulation of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina union. In this sense, and bearing this in  mind, it is difficult to reconcile all these contradictions and  see a future for the work of the Geneva conference on the basis  of the Washington document. One thing should have been  clarified beforehand, namely, either to establish the end of the  so-called Owen-Stoltenberg plan or to announce the birth of a  new plan, a new method, and a new approach that is expressed in  the Washington document.    On the other hand, there is the Russian initiative, which  departs from the responsibility of the five biggest states and  does not negate and oppose the results of the Geneva process,  but, on the contrary, wishes to accelerate the completion of the  construction of peace on the basis of these results. However,  the United States' reserve toward the Russian initiative has now  materialized and it is now evident why the United States failed  to support this initiative -- because it was preparing to launch  its own initiative without the participation of others, and, in  our case, without consulting the Serbian side.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, in the name of the listeners of the  Argument Vise [Argument More] program, thank you very much.    [Jovanovic] Thank you, too.</p>

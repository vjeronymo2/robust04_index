			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHANAHAN OFFERED JOB AT KENTUCKY, NEWSPAPER REPORTS  </P> <P> Mike Shanahan, fired nine weeks ago as head coach of the Raiders, reportedly  has been offered a five-year contract for $600,000 a year in salary and perks  to become head coach at the University of Kentucky, according to a newspaper  report.  </P> <P> Kentucky Athletic Director C.M. Newton denied publicly that Shanahan has been  offered the job, the Denver Post reported. But, the newspaper continued, "It  has been learned that a five-year offer totaling about $600,000 per year in  salary and perks is Shanahan's for the taking."  </P> <P> The newspaper said an official announcement is expected this week.  </P> <P> Shanahan, quarterback coach for the Denver Broncos, returned to Denver late  Saturday from a two-day visit to the Lexington, Ky., campus, during which he  met with Newton.  </P> <P> Interviewed by reporters at the Lexington airport, he said: "It was a great day  for me. I was very impressed. At the same time, no commitment was made by  them."  </P> <P> Asked how interested he is in the job, Shanahan said: "If it wasn't something I  was generally interested in, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't take off with a  game tomorrow and come down here if I wasn't generally interested in the job."  </P></p>

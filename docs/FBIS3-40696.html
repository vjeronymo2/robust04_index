The "dirty tricks department" of the  ruling party appeared to have reactivated itself, and while it  ensured that the Opposition could not draw a drop of blood along  with the proverbial pound of flesh, the manner in which the  footlights faded on the Dunkel drama actually constituted one of  the darker pages in the parliamentary chronicle. The Opposition  was justified in feeling cheated.    After disrupting the House for almost two days over the  signing of the Final Draft Act--to get the terminology  correct--the Opposition had withdrawn its protest after being  given to understand that the Prime Minister would address some  of its anxieties. The Deputy Chairman had clearly told them Mr  P.V. Narasimha Rao would make a statement and the closed-circuit  television information system had flashed the same message.    Even when the Deputy Chairman ordered that clarifications be  sought on the Commerce Minister's statement. Opposition members  thought Mr Rao would eventually make a few remarks. They did not  sense something amiss when, in response to a query from among  their ranks about the Prime Minister making a statement, the  Deputy Chairman indicated a change in the format.    Thus it was that the Opposition reacted with dismay and  surprise when, immediately after Mr Pranab Mukherjee concluded  his reply, the House was adjourned for the day. There was no  opportunity to demand that the Prime Minister speak and no  chance to exercise the legitimate form of expressing displeasure  through a walk-out.    The manner in which the Government handled the entire affair  did nothing to suggest that it genuinely treated members with  respect. When the Opposition questioned the veracity of  newspaper reports that the Cabinet had given the negotiators in  Geneva the green signal, there was no response. It took an  occupation of the well to dislodge Mr Kamaluddeen Ahmed from his  seat, and all he had to offer was that a statement might be made  later in the day.    The Opposition did not overdo the obstructionist tactics.  The  Deputy Chairman ordered a brief adjournment, saying she would  contact the Commerce Minister. When the House reassembled, no  protest was made when Dr Najma Heptullah explained that she had  not been able to talk to the Minister since he was attending a  meeting. Then Mr Mukherjee came to the House, but only minutes  before the scheduled lunch-break.    Yet when the post-lunch session commenced, it was announced  that the statement would be made the following day--after the  agreement would have been signed. Obviously, the reaction of  the Opposition was one of extreme displeasure and the House was  brought to a virtual standstill. Disgruntled members relented on  the understanding that the Prime Minister would intervene, but  as things turned out, that was not to be.    It was not merely from the parliamentary angle that the  Government bungled. The impression it sent out was that it was  not particularly convinced about the positive aspects of the  agreements. The parliamentary version of the GATT dispute also  brought another important issue into focus--the status of the  reports of the Standing Committees that were introduced earlier  this year. The Opposition maintained that the Government had  totally ignored the unanimous recommendations of a committee  comprising members of all the political parties, and, therefore,  questioned the utility of the Standing Committees. It was only  technically correct.    As the Commerce Minister pointed out, the committee  presented  its report to Parliament only a day before the expiry of the  deadline to sign the agreement, so how could anyone expect the  Government to formulate its negotiating stance on the basis of  the report?    Since just about anyone with even a faint knowledge of the  GATT process was aware of the December 15 deadline, surely the  committee, headed by an experienced person like Mr I.K. Gujral,  ought to have been alert about that. What purpose, other than  completing a formality, could the members of the committee have  imagined would be served by submitting a report on December 14?    The ruling party members appeared quite happy that they had  outplayed the Opposition and averted any kind of attack on the  Prime Minister. But they wore false smiles. They had not been  deft, but devious. And the difference between the two is  enormous.    The varied tactics adopted by the BJP to protest against the  arrest of its leaders (not particularly effective since by the  end of the week few even took note of its absence) resulted in  M.P.s doing some thinking about the disruption of question hour  as a valid form of protest. When the members of the other  parties raised strong objections to being denied one of their  most valued instruments, the message went home. No disruptions  thereafter.    There was, however, another dimension to the issue.</p>

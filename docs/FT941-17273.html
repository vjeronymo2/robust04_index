			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Media ownership The possible relaxation of government regulations on media ownership promises to keep the City's mergers and acquisitions merchants busy for years to come. If protected media assets come on to the auction block following the government's review, a wholesale restructuring of the industry will naturally result. Cross-border mergers could become fashionable along the lines of the successful merger of Reed International and Elsevier. Companies from other industries may also be keen to enter the media game. BT, for example, will be itching to explore multi-media possibilities given half a chance. US telephone operators are already showing the way. Newspaper groups will surely press ahead with their plans to diversify into television. Whether buying Channel 3 franchises proves the best means of doing so, however, is open to doubt. Newspaper groups would find it too hard to justify the going rate for television franchises since they could not derive the merger benefits available to other television operators. Moreover, deregulation could prove a two-way street. TV contractors could be just as keen to expand their media interests in regional newspapers. All these thrills may come too late for LWT's shareholders, who must now decide on the merits of Granada's existing bid. But it is clear that the re-rating of the television sector which stemmed from the current wave of bid speculation is unlikely to abate once the bids are resolved.</p>

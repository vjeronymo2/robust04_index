			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sycamore in restructuring talks Sycamore Holdings has called an extraordinary meeting on January 28 to consider steps to deal with the deterioration in the group's assets. Directors said that the value of net assets had fallen to less than half of the company's called up share capital. This had been caused by a substantial deterioration in the trading position of Ashworth Living and Warwill, they added. The Warwill factory was closed in August and assets subsequently sold, while Ashworth Living had been totally restructured, directors said. On the basis of the new business strategy, the board is in discussions with its bankers for a capital reconstruction. The board said that it hoped to be in a position to put the proposals to shareholders in the near future.</p>

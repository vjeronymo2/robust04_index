			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD TAKES 'SHOT' AT LAUGHING AT ITSELF  </P> <P> After his Actors' Studio audition, Shelley Winters told an out-of-work actor to  "consider an alternative career." No way. He can scratch and writhe and mumble  pseudo-Mamet dialogue with the best of them. We just saw him do it. His scene  partner and roommate, Patrick, may be a couple of jumps ahead of the  auditioning Dern, but that doesn't say much.  </P> <P> In the view of playwright Dan Bell's "The Shot," they're clowns, and he puts  into their hopeless minds and hapless mouths a delicious blend of Hollywood  actors' dream balloons and cliches. Their intellectual pratfalls are almost  Chaplinesque, simultaneously funny and sad. Knock on any door in Hollywood --  there are Patrick and Dern, kicking debris out of their way as they slouch  across the room and fully expecting, in Patrick's case, a three-year contract  with a top agency and, in Dern's, co-starring status with Clint Eastwood.  </P> <P> What they get is an idea: Why not rip off the only negative of David Mamet's  new film and hold it for ransom? It's a clever gimmick and it's what gives  shape to "The Shot," at the Olio. But the core of the piece remains the  characters of Patrick and Dern, played respectively with on-target satire by  Gill Gayle and the playwright.  </P> <P> It would be to the play's advantage to spend more time with them. Whether  they're trying to force down trendy food at a trendy restaurant or ripping  apart the talents of Bruce Willis at a movie matinee, they're a memorable  creation.  </P> <P> Less memorable is a subplot about Mamet's stealing his own negative for the  insurance money. "He just wants to make a profit," says Mamet's attorney,  Rodney Ricks. Played by Lee Kissman, who also directs stylishly, Ricks' best  moment is a conversation on his car phone with Bruce Willis, trying to bolster  the actor's ego after he has been dropped from the film version of "Glengarry  Glen Ross." Sure, Bruce, Demi thinks you have talent, too.  </P> <P> Around the edges, "The Shot" sounds a little like John Steppling, but only a  little. Steppling never has his tongue this far in his cheek. Bell's kinky  humor makes the difference, and it works fine when it's played dead serious.  When it isn't, it just misses. That's what happens to Rick Dean's private  detective, who secretly writes screenplays in the Mamet mode and sounds oddly  like John Wayne.  </P> <P> Mindy Fisher is closer to the mark as a female guard at 20th Century Fox, and  Julie Summer, as Patrick's wiser actress sister, knows exactly what she's doing  with deadpan delivery of such lines as, "He's gonna do a female version of  'American Buffalo' if he ever wants to see this film again."  </P> <P> Morley Bartnof's sound, Erik Hanson's costumes and George Stoll's lighting  frame the satire well. Hollywood and its denizens are easy to rib. Patrick and  Dern do more than that. They laugh seriously at themselves, and that's what a  sense of humor is all about.  </P> <P> At 3709 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30 p.m.,  until Nov. 4. Tickets: $10; (213) 667-9556.  </P> <P> </P></p>

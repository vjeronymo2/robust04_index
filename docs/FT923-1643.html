			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: France and Germany insist franc is healthy FRANCE and Germany, the two strongest remaining members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, yesterday mounted a concerted effort to talk up the French franc as it fell on currency markets following the Maastricht vote. The support came amid rumours in Washington of a big flight of funds from France into the D-Mark. Yesterday, despite Bank of France intervention, the franc dropped to within one centime of its ERM floor against the D-Mark. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, predicted that the financial markets would calm down when they took the full measure of the French referendum. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, insisted the franc was a fundamentally healthy currency. He underlined that France had a lower inflation rate than Germany and that the rate of wage inflation in its public sector was half the German level. Mr Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance minister, said there was no reason to doubt the French franc and predicted that speculators against the currency would suffer. Mr Sapin said the European Monetary System had not emerged unscathed from last week's turmoil, and dampened expectations of a rapid cut in French interest rates. 'I said a Yes would open the prospect of a reduction in interest rates. That remains profoundly true,' Mr Sapin said, noting that last week's Bundesbank interest rate cut, although small, was an 'absolutely considerable reversal of trend'. But he said Europe would have to 'bandage its wounds' after the currency market turmoil. Privately, French officials are pleased by what they see as new respect for the franc's solidity after its test last week. 'The Americans don't talk to us about the franc the way they used to. The Germans don't talk to us about the franc the way they used to. If the German monetary authorities, who are notoriously demanding, notice that, then others will have noticed too,' said a finance ministry official.</p>

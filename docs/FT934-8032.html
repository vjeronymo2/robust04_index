			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Baxter Intl announces broad-ranging reshape BAXTER International, the troubled US medical supplies group, announced a broad-ranging restructuring which will lead to 4,500 lost jobs and account for Dollars 700m of special pre-tax charges out of a total of Dollars 925m this year. The company also said it was in talks to sell its diagnostics manufacturing business, and was considering joint ventures, partial flotations and other moves to further the development of its businesses. The moves represent Baxter's response to the restructuring in the US health care industry, and to growing unrest among its shareholders. The company's shares, which were trading at Dollars 35 before Baxter first attracted shareholder disquiet when it pleaded guilty to supporting an Arab boycott of Israel in March this year, have fallen to a low of Dollars 20 in recent weeks. Mr Vernon Loucks, chairman and chief executive, said the restructuring was intended to make the company better organised in the US to cope with the 'dramatic changes' under way in the health care market. Its salesforce, operating through 20 product divisions, will be amalgamated and organised regionally, making it better adapted to sell to the large regional buying groups which are beginning to dominate the industry. Powerful buyers have pushed down prices in Baxter's core hospital products business, putting profits under pressure. Also, the company will concentrate much of investment - expected to reach Dollars 2bn over the next three years - abroad, where growth prospects are greater. The restructuring will result in a pre-tax charge of Dollars 700m in the fourth quarter this year, taking the company into a loss for the year. The cost cutting, which will result in a reduction of 7 per cent in the workforce over the next five years, will lead to savings of Dollars 100m next year, rising to over Dollars 350m in 1998, the company said. Baxter said it would take a Dollars 225m pre-tax charge to cover litigation costs, primarily from its breast implants and blood-clotting agents. The global settlement of a class action over leaking breast implants, agreed last month, would result in costs of Dollars 475m - Dollars 618m, Baxter said. After insurance cover, the company's share of the settlement cost is expected to be Dollars 128m. It has also provided Dollars 47m to cover its share of a settlement over HIV-infected blood-clotting products, and Dollars 50m to cover other smaller product liability actions.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Voluntary liquidation I was a shareholder in a small unquoted company which sold almost all its assets and went into voluntary liquidation. The liquidator made an interim payment to me in the tax year ending April 1994, and has indicated a further final payment will be made in the tax year ending next April. The interim payment is big enough to make me liable for capital gains tax after my Pounds 5,800 allowance and indexation. Am I liable for CGT on the interim payment and also liable to a separate assessment on the final payment? If so, am I entitled to Pounds 5,800 in each tax year? The answer to both your questions is yes. Ask your tax office for a copy of Inland Revenue Statement of Practice D3 (Company liquidations: tax on shareholders' capital gains) which was issued on January 20 1972. (If you have any difficulty, write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB.) A free booklet of statements of practice (up to last year) is available, if you are interested: IR131. The free booklet of extra-statutory concessions (up to last year) is IR1. Both are obtainable from tax offices. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's Doubtless aggrieved Names at Lloyd's will continue to insist that the well publicised problems of the LMX spiral went beyond simple incompetence and that the structure of governance is not the most fundamental issue. But coming on top of Mr Coleridge's contrite performance at last month's AGM - an occasion when the middle classes signally failed to riot - yesterday's reports from committees chaired by Sir David Walker and Sir Jeremy Morse add to an impression of Lloyd's gradually getting its house into order. This must be healthy for an institution which relies on a reputation for straight dealing. As a result, the meltdown theory is starting to look a good deal less plausible, although backwoodsmen who believe that everything will be righted with the turn in the cycle are equally guilty of wishful thinking. Lloyd's should survive all right, but in a different form. In the short term at any rate, it also seems destined to shrink. While forecasts of a 20 to 30 per cent fall in capacity next year may be on the gloomy side, 1990 losses when they are announced in 12 months' time will inevitably shake out more Names. There is strong evidence of improving rates, to be sure, particularly in marine and aviation. But given the awful press of recent months and the disappearance of major tax breaks neither new individuals nor corporate members are likely to show up until clear proof can be shown of renewed profitability. Fears that Lloyd's may now lose control of some business sectors may be overdone; much of the problem, after all, was irresponsible competition within Lloyd's itself. That said, Lloyd's will have to concentrate its expertise even more on complex risks and share its bigger deals with the composites. A fully integrated London market - and a more Europeanised one - looks inevitable in the long run.</p>

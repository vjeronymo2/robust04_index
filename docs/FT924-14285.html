			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Cabinet quotes on Europe 'The day of the coded message is coming back . . . We must rapidly rediscover clear aims and clear policies . . . We have been the European party since a Conservative government took us into the community over 20 years ago.' Kenneth Clarke 'Our laws, institutions and sovereign parliament are the essence of our nationhood . . . That nationhood will not be extinguished. We won't let federalism erode it away. We won't let Brussels take it away.' Peter Lilley 'Our invisible earnings are a priceless national asset. If you want to hand that over to the Germans and the French, all you have to do is to see us marginalised on the periphery of Europe. No Conservative government would do it.' Michael Heseltine 'We want an end to the cynical charade of countries signing up to new laws to catch headlines at home when they have not the slightest intention of putting them into effect.' Michael Howard 'If we turn aside from the mainstream of Europe we will only end up the poorer. How brilliantly Michael Heseltine put it this morning]' John MacGregor 'I do not think that in my lifetime, at the very least, there will be any consent for a massive transfer of sovereignty and power - let alone affection - to a European state.' Norman Lamont 'One of Britain's eternal interests, perhaps the central one, is to preserve that balance of power in Europe which alone ensures our continuing strength. You can't do that on an 'in and out' basis.' John Gummer 'We have the freest, most competitive market in Europe . .  Free markets are what the community is about. It is not about accepting restrictive practices from Brussels when we have worked so hard to conquer our own.' Gillian Shephard 'We don't want Britain to be on the sidelines when the security and prosperity of Europe are being decided.' Douglas Hurd</p>

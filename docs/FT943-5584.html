			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (25): Important vote of confidence - Germany: A look at positive moves to revive the industry For an industry undergoing its most severe crisis since the 1960s, the appointment of Jurgen Schrempp as the next chief executive of Daimler-Benz amounts to a considerable vote of confidence. He is the man who, as head of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the dominant force in the German aerospace industry, has been responsible for the radical reorganisation of much of the sector into one of Daimler's most important subsidiaries. And now, in the past 18 months, he has been the man forced to embark on sweeping and painful cuts in that same operation to cope with the downturn, drawing up plans to close six plants and lay off 16,000 workers. The truth is that the success or failure of Mr Schrempp's overhaul is still in the balance, but Daimler, Germany's mightiest industrial empire, has clearly decided that the job has been well done. Dasa, which includes Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, the German part of the Airbus Industrie consortium, and a half share in the Eurocopter consortium, as well as famous names such as Messerschmidt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB), the country's main military aircraft contractor, a majority stake in Dornier, manufacturer of medium-range turboprop aircraft, Fokker, its Dutch counterpart, and Motoren und Turbinen Union (MTU), the aircraft engine manufacturer, will remain an essential part of the empire and its boss, Mr Schrempp, will succeed Edzard Reuter next year at its helm. The decision of the Daimler-Benz supervisory board in June coincided with the successful conclusion of Mr Schrempp's negotiations with the trade unions at Dasa to close six of its 16 plants, and cut 10,300 of the 16,000 jobs it needs to shed by 1996. The last year has been traumatic for Dasa, as it has been for the rest of the aerospace sector. Overall employment in the sector stood at 78,500 on December 31, 1992, and fewer than 72,900 by the end of last year. At least 10 per cent more jobs will have been shed by the end of the present year, according to the calculations of the BDLI, the German aerospace and defence industry federation. The sharpest cuts have been in the military sector  - down 13.8 per cent in 1993 - and in the space sector, down 10.3 per cent in the year. As for turnover in the industry, according to the BDLI figures, it was down even more sharply, by 18 per cent from DM26.77bn to DM21.95bn in 1992 alone. The sector was hit, like the industry worldwide, by the coincidence of a sharp recession in civil aviation and drastic cuts in defence spending, as governments sought to reap the dividends of the end of the cold war. It has galvanised a traditionally secretive and somewhat self-satisfied industry in Germany into urgent public lobbying to protect its position, on the grounds that the country could lose its access to a vast area of vital high technology if it allows the aerospace sector to be marginalised once again, as it was after the second world war. Mr Schrempp has been one of the most vigorous campaigners for more coherent and overt government support for the industry, alongside Wolfgang Piller, his fellow Dasa director and president of the BDLI. Above all, they have argued that European governments must be prepared to back the industry with the same level of indirect support - through defence spending, and subsidies for research and development - as the US government does for its aerospace manufacturers. The recent decision by the German government to back a DM1.2bn four-year research and development programme - to be half financed by the industry - was described by Mr Piller as a 'first step' in the right direction. But he pointed out that in the US, the NASA budget for aerospace research had increased from Dollars 512m in 1991 to more than Dollars 1bn in the current year, with a target of Dollars 1.4bn by 1998. US Defence department spending on research and development in aerospace are estimated by the BDLI at around Dollars 1.4-1.6bn per year. Hitherto, the comparable sums in Germany added up to just DM16m a year. Speaking at the Wehrkunde security conference in Munich this year, Mr Schrempp issued an urgent plea for fairer and more open competition between Europe and the US in armaments and aerospace industries. 'We do not need a preference Europeenne, which would eventually cut us off from developments in top-notch technology outside Europe,' he argued. 'What we need is a level playing field with our US competitors.' This meant, he argued, overcoming the national fragmentation of the European markets in defence and civil aerospace manufacture. And his whole strategy at Dasa has clearly been focused on that aim. In each sector, he has actively promoted cross-border co-operation. Not just in the Airbus consortium, but also in Eurocopter, the Franco-German joint venture set to start deliveries of its seven-seater, twin-engined light helicopter, the EC135, in 1996. He has pushed through the takeover of Fokker, the proudly independent Dutch aircraft manufacturer, to rationalise production in the turboprop sector, and is now talking of possible collaboration in satellites and guided missiles, with France's Aerospatiale. In spite of the painful and costly experience of the Eurofighter project - still on track in spite of the German government's prevarication - Mr Schrempp is a vigorous supporter of the plan for a joint European project for the next generation of military transport aircraft, the so-called Future Large Aircraft (FLA). He has used the industrial muscle of Daimler-Benz to force the German aerospace industry to match its competitors in Britain and France. Thus within the Airbus consortium, he fought strenuously to raise the German profile, succeeding in winning the contract for final assembly of the most recent A321 Airbus model for his own Hamburg plant. Previously all Airbus aircraft were assembled at Toulouse. The importance of the move for the German industry was underlined by the ceremony in January, when Lufthansa, the national carrier, became the first airline to take delivery of an A321. German manufacturers have been firm backers of Lufthansa's privatisation, on the grounds that a strong and profitable national airline is a vital underpinning for a strong national aerospace industry. However, Mr Schrempp's strategy at Dasa has also underlined his perception of the limitations of the European industry. He has pushed through the alliance between MTU and the US aero-engine giant Pratt and Whitney, in an effort to compete with the BMW-Rolls-Royce alliance. He was a prime mover behind the decision to open talks between Airbus and Boeing on joint development of the next generation of super jumbos. And he has also brought about an alliance in a key market, by setting up a joint venture in satellite and space systems manufacture with China. So far, none of that frantic activity has shown up in the bottom line. Dasa suffered a record net loss of DM694m in 1993, more than double that of the previous year. It will still be in the red in the current year. But Mr Schrempp is adamant that it will be back in the black by 1995.</p>

It is even more important for  state security organs to remain sober-minded, to have a clear  understanding of the situation, to be mindful of possible danger  in times of peace, to heighten our vigilance, to enhance their  sense of urgency and responsibility, to always give prominence  to efforts to maintain political and social stability, to  strengthen the role of democratic dictatorship, and to actively  prevent and crack down on various kinds of unlawful practices  and criminal activities that jeopardize state security." These  were the demands made by Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee and executive vice governor, at a  provincial conference on state security work held in Hangzhou on  26 January.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and government,  Chai Songyue highly praised the efforts made by the state  security organs at all levels in the province to safeguard state  security and social stability in the past year, and their  contributions to promoting the economic development of Zhejiang  Province. He said: On the whole, the current international  situation is extremely favorable to us; however, we must clearly  discern that the world is still not peaceful, because the  underlying struggles between espionage and counterespionage,  infiltration and counterintelligence, and attempts to steal  secret information and efforts to combat such attempts have  become increasingly complex and acute. Therefore, the more we  carry out reform and the opening policy, and the more we  accelerate economic development, the more we must beef up state  security work. State security work is a strategic undertaking  that has a bearing on the safety and well-being and on the  survival or collapse of a country. It occupies a highly  important place and plays a vital role in the political and  social lives of a country. The provincial party committee and  government have attached great importance to state security  work. From now on, we still have to vigorously enhance our  leadership over state security work and give our leaders greater  support and help in their bid to eliminate worries and surmount  difficulties. Party committees and governments at all levels  must earnestly implement the instructions and guidelines of the  CPC Central Committee, as well as the provincial party  committee, with a great sense of political responsibility and a  serious attitude, and must give practical help and support to  state security organs. Various departments and units must also  actively support and coordinate with state security organs while  carrying out various tasks. At the same time, he pointed out:  The work on the secret front is of a special nature, and this  special nature calls for steadfast party spirit, a firm  political stand, strict discipline, high professionalism,  absolute loyalty, great skill and expertise among comrades on  this front. He urged state security organs at all levels  throughout the province to step up efforts to improve themselves  and improve the combat effectiveness of their contingents, to  train cadres and policemen to establish a concept to serve the  people wholeheartedly, a concept of hard struggle and selfless  dedication; to promote the spirit of "prudence and independence"  [fayang shendu jingshen -- 4099 2254 1957 3747 4737 4377], to be  good at resisting various types of degenerate thinking and at  resisting the decadence and temptations of the seamy side of  things, and to actively dedicate themselves to state security  undertakings.    Si Daxiao, member of the Standing Committee of the  provincial  party committee and secretary of the provincial Political  Science and Law Commission, was present at the meeting.    The meeting relayed the guidelines of the national state  security conference. Zhu Ziru, director of the provincial state  security department, presented a work report, and leaders at  various levels under the provincial state security system  attended the meeting.</p>

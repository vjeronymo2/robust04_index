			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Truth of the Matter: Golden serials for tea Sunday afternoon is when it strikes. You have unloaded the shopping. You have grappled with all 12 sections of the newspaper, and won. The dishwasher chuckles comfortingly. The dogs are in their baskets and the kids glued to their computer terminals. But then there is the terrible feeling of something missing in the day. Where is the classic serial? Like a shot of guilt, or irredeemable nostalgia, you register this absence. Once it was always there, as regular as vespers. It might be Louis Stevenson, it might be E. Nesbit or, best of all, a triple-decker Dickens with Arthur Lowe (of Dad's Army fame) playing Mr Micawber. For about an hour, everything was right with the world with a giant pot of tea, pyramids of buttered toast and the television (for once) serving as a genuine focus - a place where families might huddle and coalesce: a flickering, gladdening, substitute hearth. It was, of course, Lord Reith's BBC, or the vestiges of it; and everyone knows that Reith, on record as regarding television as 'a social menace of the first degree', brought the full weight of Scottish Presbyterianism to Sunday broadcasting. Until 1957, in fact, Reith created a break in transmission early in the evening in order not to distract church-goers. Before the break, there would be a play for children, perhaps a Shakespeare adaptation; afterwards, something contemporary (say, JB Priestley) or 'classic' (Chekhov, Shaw, O'Casey and many others): the range was formidable. That this aspect of Reith's Sabbath has disappeared will be defended aggressively by the present BBC and its director-general, John Birt. Back at the birth of television (it will argue), we were accused of depriving children of the delights of reading novels by themselves. Now, you beg us to adapt those novels for the screen and, at the same time (to preserve your weekend lie-in), to wean those children on the same bland pabulum of morning cartoons as the commercial stations. On those grounds, the disinclination of Birt's BBC to follow Reith's pattern of edifying Sundays is just about pardonable. What is less comprehensible are the complaints voiced at the Edinburgh television festival recently by Greg Dyke, erstwhile head of London Weekend Television. His concerns are twofold: first, that 'in commercial broadcasting, the delicate balance of being both a business and a broadcaster is in danger of being too dominated by business'; and, second, that 'the relationship between government and broadcasters is becoming a dependent one.' The logic of this double grudge is odd. He wants the BBC's transmission system to be privatised ('to take it out of the political arena'); and he wants it 'to be told that it is not the role of the BBC to get involved in the commercial marketplace'. Otherwise, he claims, the raison d'etre of the licence fee is gone. For a patent example of television's vulnerability to state paternalism, one has only to look across at Silvio Berlusconi's Italy where the viewing public has, effectively, become one politician's audience. The politics of the licence fee, however, are secondary to what one might call its ethics, or even its aesthetics. Vested interests always will intimidate the production of probing documentaries: but what has happened to that old article of faith in the BBC: that television is Britain's only truly 'national theatre'? Lamenting the loss of the classic Sunday serial might seem about as fogeyistic as bemoaning the lack of woodcuts in the Radio Times, and equally futile. And deploring Birt's commercialism is too commonplace to repeat here. Yet, it remains frustrating to know that the BBC has, via the licence fee, the capacity (witness Middlemarch) and the power to create television that is not only culturally magnetic but also gets an entire family gathered around it. A measure of paternalistic intervention is absolutely what we need. To pray for the blessing of the good Lord Reith on our Sundays might be in vain - but I, for one, shall do so devoutly.</p>

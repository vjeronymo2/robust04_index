			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / An alternative to the 'Group of Seven' Too many hopes have been invested in the 'Group of Seven' - that is, the UK forecasters who are to meet regularly to provide the Treasury with alternative views of the economic prospects. It is better than nothing and will be helpful for those of us who use rather than create economic numbers. Nevertheless the concentration of the so-called 'new Treasury openness' on this group is a symptom of the prevalence of old-type thinking. As excessive reliance on forecasts (not just Treasury ones) is in part responsible for present predicaments, it is unlikely that more of the same will provide a cure. Moreover, the attention paid to the group encourages the delusion - prevalent among businessmen as well as policymakers - that economics is all about forecasting. In fact, many Nobel prize-winners in the subject have never made a short-term forecast. There is an innate human desire for crystal-gazers. Yet the real art of policy-making is to be able to respond to events. The role of research is to help devise institutions which will promote good performance and provide a degree of automatic stabilisation. An alternative path for opening up policy-making has been provided by the Swedish prime minister, Carl Bildt. He has appointed the distinguished economist, Professor Assar Lindbeck, to head a small commission to report in a very few months on new directions for Swedish policy. Whether or not the commission's report contains medium-term projections, the emphasis will be on analysis and measures. There are some striking similarities between Sweden and the UK. Sweden too has been without a policy anchor since it stopped shadowing the European Currency Unit, after a much more impressive defence than any put up for the exchange rate mechanism in Britain. Sweden too has, under its minority right-wing government, tried to break with its Social Democratic past by putting more emphasis on competition and the private sector. But Sweden has had a much more severe recession than Britain. It also resembles the UK in adopting an inflation target to replace the ERM anchor. The strong contrast is that the Riksbank has full authority to get on with the job. The purpose of appointing the Lindbeck commission is to give advice which is clearly independent of both the official and the party machines. It was decided after discussions between Mr Bildt and his finance minister, Mrs Anne Wibble, without consulting the Finance Ministry at all. One difficulty of following this route in the UK is that there is no outstanding economist, combining theoretical and practical flair, who would be respected by, say, 80 per cent of economic opinion for such a task. Mr Bildt hopes that proposals from the Lindbeck committee will command greater assent than any from the government alone, but he is not committed in advance. The Swedish government deserves attention for much wider reasons. The most forthright experiments in market economics are now taking place in two rather unlikely places - Sweden and the Czech Republic. The Czech prime minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus, has said that the supposed 'third way' between capitalism and socialism is the quickest route to the third world. Mr Bildt says the same in different words. The Swedish third way collapsed partly because of the weight of taxation required to pay for its welfare state. It also suffered from the attempt to run too tight a labour market and maintain competitiveness by a series of devaluations. When the Swedish prime minister says that 'growth will only come about as a result of policies of deregulation, privatisation, increased competition and lower taxes', he sounds like the British government of the 1980s. But there are notable differences as well. Unlike Lady Thatcher, Mr Bildt does not regard consensus as a dirty word; he managed to secure from the opposition Social Democrats, unions and employers support for the earlier measures to defend the krona. The consensus was shattered when the new budget made inroads into the welfare state, including some trimming of unemployment benefit and the age at which pensions could be paid. The size of the Swedish budget deficit - at nearly 14 per cent of GNP, higher than Italy's and Greece's - made action imperative. Unlike even the Thatcherite Tories, the Swedish government is determined that the budget deficit should be cut entirely by expenditure curbs and not by tax increases. This determination can hardly be regarded as extreme when taxes account for some 57 per cent of GDP, among the highest in the western world. Indeed, Moody's Investor Services has just made a slight cut in the country's debt rating, which has made the government all the more concerned to persevere with its strategy.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PILOT OF BOAT IN COLLISION ALLEGEDLY LEFT THE HELM;  </P> <P> HARBOR: TANKER CAPTAIN SHARES BLAME, COAST GUARD SAYS, FOR NOT GIVING RIGHT OF  WAY. BOTH OF THEIR LICENSES MAY BE SUSPENDED.  </P> <P> The pilot of a sportfishing boat had gone below deck and left no one at the  helm just before a collision with a 564-foot tanker outside Los Angeles Harbor  late Thursday night, Coast Guard officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> Coast Guard Cmdr. Chris Desmond said 2nd Mate Tim Filson of the fishing boat  Shogun was primarily to blame for the crash with the tanker Sealift Antarctic.  He said Filson may have his operating license suspended.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard spokesman said Filson, 25, broke one of the "basic rules of  navigation" by failing to keep a proper lookout before the crash, which injured  seven people and spilled 2,000 gallons of jet fuel at the mouth of the harbor.  </P> <P> But Desmond, head of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Long Beach, said  that both vessels were to blame and that Capt. Arthur Irish of the Antarctic  could also have his license suspended for failing to give way to the smaller  vessel. Desmond said the fishing boat had the right of way at the time of the  crash.  </P> <P> "There is fault on both sides," Desmond said. "The greater error was on the  part of Filson because he left the bridge. That is inexcusable. But the captain  on the Sealift Antarctic failed to properly track the target or give way."  </P> <P> Desmond said that at the completion of its investigation in about two months,  the Coast Guard will probably recommend that Filson and Irish have their  licenses suspended for an undetermined period. An administrative law judge must  decide whether to follow the Coast Guard recommendations.  </P> <P> Filson, who is being treated for cuts and a concussion at St. Mary's Medical  Center in Long Beach, said in a telephone interview Saturday that the tanker  was to blame for the crash. "In the general rules of the road, the vessel to  the right has the right-of-way," Filson said. "We were to the right."  </P> <P> Filson declined to say whether he left the bridge of the 80-foot fishing boat.  The Shogun had just embarked on an overnight expedition to San Clemente Island,  where a crew of seven was taking 35 passengers to fish for sea bass.  </P> <P> Irish could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Desmond said the two vessels left the harbor just before midnight. Filson, he  said, put his boat on automatic pilot and went below deck, thinking that his  course was running parallel to the tanker's. Investigators do not yet know why  Filson went below deck, or how long he was away from the helm.  </P> <P> The Antarctic expected the fishing boat to stay clear, as most smaller vessels  do, even when they technically have the right of way, Desmond said. The tanker  blasted a warning from its ship's horn when the Shogun was five minutes away  and then moments before the collision.  </P> <P> At the last instant, the pilot of the tanker swung hard to the left and Filson  rushed back to the bridge in time to shut down his engines, but not soon enough  to take evasive action, Desmond said.  </P> <P> One of the Shogun's passengers, Raul Baca of San Pedro, said that he was  rigging his fishing poles when he saw the tanker looming about 100 yards away.  "I didn't think we were going to hit it," Baca said. "All of a sudden someone  yelled, 'Look Out!' and it was right there on us."  </P> <P> Baca dropped his poles and dove overboard. "I was so scared I didn't know what  to do," said Baca, 34. He was plucked out of the water, unhurt, after treading  water for 15 minutes.  </P></p>

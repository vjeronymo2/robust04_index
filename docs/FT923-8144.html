			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UBS P&amp;D suspends analyst for refusing to halt book UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the leading securities firm, has suspended the head of its UK research department because he refused to cancel publication of a book which is critical of the accounting techniques used by many of the UK's biggest companies. Mr Terry Smith was given a deadline of yesterday afternoon to tell his publishers to abandon publication, which was scheduled for mid-September. He refused and P&amp;D suspended him on full pay. P&amp;D is considering taking out an injunction to try to prevent publication of the book, called 'Accounting for Growth'. The broking firm, which is owned by Union Bank of Switzerland, the biggest Swiss bank, is alleging that Mr Smith breached his contract and internal regulations. Mr Smith is contesting the allegations. Mr Smith took on the commission for the book, from publishers Random Century, after discussing the project with senior executives of the firm, including Mr Hector Sants, vice-chairman. Initially, UBS had been supportive of the project. The firm ordered several hundred copies of the book for distribution to clients. Mr Smith had also been asked to speak on UK accounting techniques at a seminar for foreign investment institutions in early September. The book is an expanded version of award-winning research published by P&amp;D in January 1991, which highlighted a number of accounting techniques used by UK companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the level of borrowings shown on their balance sheets. In the book, Mr Smith examined the accounts of the UK's 200 biggest quoted companies to see which were using the techniques. The book stresses that there is no implication of impropriety if a company uses the techniques. P&amp;D became embarrassed about the book after newspaper articles highlighted Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, as the company which used more of these techniques than any other. Grand Met, which has a banking relationship with UBS, complained about the articles to Mr Rudi Mueller, head of UBS UK operations. P&amp;D alleges that Mr Smith was in breach of regulations for not showing the book to the 200 companies mentioned in it before the book received any publicity.</p>

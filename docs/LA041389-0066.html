			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SUIT THREAT KEEPS EMERGENCY ROOM OPEN AT CENTINELA  </P> <P> Centinela Hospital Medical Center said Wednesday that it will delay a plan to  close its emergency room to patients brought in by paramedics until next month  in an effort to reach an agreement to treat only obstetric cases that arrive by  rescue ambulances.  </P> <P> The Inglewood hospital's decision came after three public-interest law groups  threatened to sue the hospital unless it delayed its decision. The hospital has  state approval to stop taking public-ambulance patients as of April 26.  </P> <P> The hospital has said it will continue to provide emergency services to  patients who arrive on their own or by private ambulance.  </P> <P> Because Centinela is the only hospital in its area that has an obstetrics unit,  its decision has sent county health officials scurrying to find another  hospital to treat obstetric patients. The county is negotiating with Marina  Hills Hospital in Ladera Hills to provide that service.  </P> <P> Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, fearing that it could face a  large influx of obstetric patients if the county's negotiations fail, has also  filed for state approval to stop treating patients brought by paramedics as of  April 26.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decided After Talks  </P> <P> Russell Stromberg, Centinela's president, said the hospital decided to delay  the planned closure after talking with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles  -- one of three groups that has threatened to sue it.  </P> <P> Legal aid attorneys told Centinela officials that the hospital may be able to  reach an agreement with state and county officials that would allow it to treat  only obstetric patients brought in by paramedics and refuse other types of  patients, Stromberg said.  </P> <P> That would lessen the financial burden Centinela faces in treating indigent  patients of all types, Stromberg said.  </P> <P> "We were under the impression legally that we could not just take obstetric  patients," Stromberg said. "They feel there is a way to structure a contract  where we can."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Kennedy said the hospital would "look very favorably" on  remaining a paramedic base station if Centinela or any other hospital continues  to treat obstetric patients. County and state health officials could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Centinela officials cited ballooning debts in winning state approval March 17  to stop accepting patients brought in by paramedics. The hospital said that in  fiscal 1988 it carried $8.4 million in unpaid bills and donated services.  </P> <P> The Legal Aid Foundation, as well as the Western Center on Law and Poverty and  the National Health Law Program, sent a letter to Centinela on Monday, saying  they intended to file a class-action lawsuit against the hospital unless it  agreed to postpone its decision.  </P> <P> The groups contended in their letter that the hospital's decision violates  federal law by discriminating against patients based on their ability to pay  for medical services.  </P> <P> "They called back and said, 'What can we do to work this out?' " said Byron  Gross, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation. "We have agreed we won't sue  them now while they hold off for 30 days."  </P> <P> Stromberg said Tuesday that he doubts that the groups have any legal grounds to  sue the hospital. If the groups are going to sue anyone, he asserted, it should  be the government agencies responsible for funding medical care programs for  the poor.  </P> <P> "They got the wrong target," Stromberg said.  </P> <P> In a related development, the Inglewood City Council on Tuesday voted  unanimously to stop sending injured police and fire personnel to Centinela for  treatment.  </P> <P> Instead, council members agreed to send that business -- estimated at about  $250,000 a year -- to neighboring Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Informed of Centinela's decision Wednesday, Norman Cravens, Inglewood's  assistant city manager, said: "I guess the bottom line is there would be no  reason to change what the council did immediately."  </P> <P> But Cravens said the council could reconsider its action if Centinela's  emergency room remains open to paramedics.  </P> <P> In an earlier interview, Cravens said city employees will be better served by  Freeman because the hospital will continue to belong to the county's paramedic  system should Centinela drop out. Hence, radio contact with the city's rescue  ambulances and Freeman can be maintained during emergencies, he said.  </P> <P> Moreover, Cravens said, the city wanted to reward Freeman because it has  continued to care for patients brought in by ambulance even though it is losing  millions of dollars a year as a result.  </P> <P> "We want to give business to a hospital that keeps its emergency room open to  all indigents in Inglewood," Cravens said.  </P> <P> Stromberg called the council's action "purely political" and motivated by  Centinela's decision last March to sue the city to prevent the construction of  a center for severely mentally ill patients across the street from the  hospital. Centinela filed the suit after the council approved construction of  the 14-bed facility.  </P> <P> "I think it is just a simple matter of the city administration trying to get  back at us," Stromberg said.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Barbara Baird also contributed to this report.  </P></p>

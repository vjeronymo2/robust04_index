			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zheng Zhong (6774 6850): "A Great Idea, a Great </F> Approach, a Great Job --An Interview With Wu Bangguo, a member  of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and  secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee"; place and  date not given; first three paragraphs are WEN HUI BAO  introduction]    [Text] People tend to analogize Shanghai to a sea and have  various conjectures about and understandings of it.    If Shanghai were an actual sea, it was Comrade Xiaoping's  remarks made during his tour to the south that -- like the  eastern wind -- make this sea look so magnificent. It is as  described by the Han dynasty's Mu Hua [2606 5478] in his "Hai  Fu" [Prose on the Sea]: "Raising the hundred-foot sail in  anticipating the gusty winds; vast and boundless, the sky is the  Limit; it may be calm and unruffled, it may be stormy and  tumultuous with waves reaching the sky and suddenly down and  gone. Yet, it is the meeting place of hundreds of slow-flowing  rivers that help clear away garbage while they flow. It is the  broadness, bizarreness, and greatness that count."    It is precisely with this "Hai Fu" that this reporter begins  his interview with Wu Bangguo, a member of the Political Bureau  of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee, on Shanghai's economic situation.  <H3>  Topic of Conversation One: What Mode of Thinking Has  Shanghai Adopted in Its Operations? </H3>   [Wu Bangguo] You are talking about literary works and cite  Mu  Hua's imaginative descriptions of the great sea. I have to rely  on reality. Let me tell you something about Shanghai's actual  situation. For the past few years, Shanghai's main task has  been the identification of thinking on development. The central  authorities' demand for Shanghai has been the "development and  opening of the Pudong area of Shanghai and making Shanghai one  of the world's economic, financial, and trade centers," under  which Pudong has been clearly designated as the focus of  nationwide reform and opening up in the nineties. In meeting  this demand over several terms of office, the Shanghai municipal  party committee and the municipal government, after carrying out  numerous investigations, studies, and examinations and taking  local realities into consideration, have identified the goals  and strategic focus of development in Shanghai. I would like to  elaborate on them in a relatively popular way:    The first goal is an average of 10-percent annual growth in  terms of the gross national product [GNP] to maintain sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development in Shanghai.    The second goal is the adjustment of the industrial  structure  and industries' internal setup. We are not only interested in  speed, but speed with high efficiency. Because of historical  factors, Shanghai has been concentrating highly on industry,  leaving thus behind a very weak tertiary industry. In terms of  development, it will be difficult to bring into full play the  function of a city without a well-developed tertiary industry.  That is why we emphasize developing tertiary industry and,  derived from this very thinking, commit ourselves heavily to the  ongoing development of the various markets, transportation,  wharfs, and communications. As for adjusting industries'  internal setup, we have been promoting the growth of such new  industries as sedan cars, communications, machine building, and  electronics as a whole, power stations, bioengineering, and  petrochemicals. With this move and by highlighting our special  strengths and avoiding our weak points, we should be able to  develop a unique industrial structure in Shanghai without  repeating the patterns of other cities. We should strive to  complete the adjustment exercise for both the industrial  structure and industries' internal setup by the close of the  century -- not only an adaptive adjustment, but a strategic and  fundamental one. This is crucial to speedy and better economic  development in Shanghai.    It is only through these adjustments that we will be able to  truly achieve technological progress, enhance the people's  quality of life, and bring out Shanghai's superiority.    The third goal is the shaping of a new Shanghai in Pudong --  bounded by the area opposite the Bund and to the east of the  Huangpu Jiang -- capable of meeting the challenges of the next  century.    The fourth goal is eliminating the current 800,000 night  stools and 800,000 briquette stoves and the basic solution of  related problems -- including transportation and housing, which  have been left over by history -- by the end of the century.  Our targets are that by then, the per capita housing space for  Shanghai residents -- both urban and suburban -- will reach 10  square meters, with more than 70 percent of housing units having  their own bathrooms and kitchens. Besides, we have more  concrete goals.    [Zheng Zhong] What kind of measures have you adopted to  achieve these goals?    [Wu] What will be the main focus of our work, given these  four goals? First, we must vigorously step up the building of  the infrastructure, which is necessary to improve the people's  living environment. It is not strange for people to complain if  they have to endure crowded buses all the time. We must also  improve the investment environment: telecommunications, power  supply, wastewater treatment works, two major bridges, multilane  tunnels, the inner and outer ring roads, several expressways  linking Shanghai to other places, and the subway. All these  cost big money, but we cannot do without them. Without a sound  infrastructure, there will be no good investment environment;  without a good investment environment, it will be difficult to  get the funds for future construction. Today we cannot say we  have provided the people of Shanghai with a superior  environment, but at least their living environment has improved.  We are all human beings. Who does not want to live a more  comfortable life? The day has arrived for the people of  Shanghai to live more comfortably.    Second, we must develop a number of large modern markets,  focusing particularly on cultivating markets for essential  factors of production. This not only requires that the  marketplace covers a large area and that facilities be more  advanced, but it also demands greater standardization, order,  and efficiency. Shanghai needs to further improve its own  financial and securities, nonferrous metal, oil, and other  markets. It should gradually explore a spot- commodities  exchange and a negotiable-instruments-futures exchange, and it  should develop high-standard markets with advanced trading  information. At the same time, under state guidance, it should  step up the construction of foreign exchange, gold, and bonded  capital goods markets and accelerate the cultivation and  development of markets for specialized technical personnel,  labor, real estate, scientific and technological research  results, as well as information so as to turn Shanghai into a  comprehensive, modernized market capable of reaching out to  faraway places.    Third, we must develop in the direction of high and new  technologies. This has a twofold purpose. One is to develop  high- and new-technology industries, and the other is to apply  high and new technologies to transform traditional processing  technologies. I have been responsible for telecommunications.  The contract on the program-controlled telephone switch system  signed with Bell Laboratories covers the period up to 1995.  Mobile telephones and cellular phones are all trend-setting  things. We will also develop satellite communications. Without  satellite communications, the development of financial and  futures markets will be affected. Laser printers and fax  machines are among the other things we want to develop. I have  said that the telecommunications industry alone will generate 20  billion to 30 billion yuan in output value by the year 2000. It  seems now achieving this target will not be a problem. The  telecommunications output was 800 million in 1991, it rose to  3.2 billion by 1992, and it is expected to reach 6.5 billion in  1993. This industry makes full use of Shanghai's favorable  conditions in terms of its human resources, and it has great  potential. Our mayor, Huang Ju, personally attends to the  automobile industry. Shanghai's car production exceeded 100,000  in 1993, and its capacity will reach 200,000 this year, with 82  percent of the parts being manufactured domestically. Sales by  the automobile industry topped 30 billion yuan last year.  Deputy Secretary Chen Zhili is responsible for computers, Vice  Mayor Xu Kuangdi is in charge of biological engineering, and  Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren has control of the power industry. I  believe that by the end of this century, a group of new backbone  industries will take shape in Shanghai.    These are our three principal strategic points. There is a  distinguishing feature of Shanghai's work: All the things that  we promised have been done. So far, there have never been a  single instance in which we did not accomplish on schedule what  we said we would do.    [Zheng] Ideas are wealth. I believe that Shanghai has found  a clear way to develop itself.    [Wu] That is right. Ideas mean wealth. I have the same  opinion. Even if we do not have any money, we will think of  ways to collect funds and succeed. Without the right ideas, we  can accomplish nothing even if we have money in our hands.    [Zheng] When I worked as a reporter in other localities,  people asked me whether Shanghai was performing magic. Formerly,  it was like a "pauper" without any accomplishments at all. Now,  it has become rich like an upstart, as if it had suddenly  awakened from a slumber.    [Wu] Friends in other localities say that we are performing  magic. Now I am going to tell you the truth. Some comrades do  not understand Shanghai. We have two accounting books now. One  is a financial accounts book. The finance bureau's accounts  book is for subsistence. Frankly speaking, it is not enough to  depend only on the funds of the financial accounts book, which  are spent entirely on subsidies for grain, diesel oil, and  public utilities. For example, electricity, communications and  transportation, coal gas, and tap water need to be subsidized.  We have a deficit every year. The other one is a construction  accounts book, which relies mainly on loans. The first source  is the direct introduction of foreign funds. We attracted  foreign funds worth $5.3 billion from January to August 1993,  and we shall strive to attract direct investment exceeding $50  billion from foreign businessmen by the end of the century. The  second source is borrowing money. Building the big bridge is  funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank, the 1.6  billion yuan for building the confluence sewage treatment  project is from a World Bank loan, and the subway project is  funded by a German Government loan. We have to repay 780  million yuan worth of foreign debt every year. At home, we  incurred debts by obtaining loans from the People's Bank [of  China] and by issuing stocks and bonds. The third source of  income is leasing land. Land in Shanghai is very dear. Leasing  rental space in Shanghai's downtown area generally costs about  $500 per square meter; when calculated using a ratio of five,  taking into account an average of five stories per building,  leasing one square meter of floor space will then bring in  $2,500. By leasing real estate space, we have raised  considerable funds for renovating Shanghai's old areas and for  building supporting infrastructure facilities. Funds now are  the most important consideration for the Shanghai municipality's  so-called macroeconomic control. We hold a meeting on managing  funds once every week. What we have stimulated are the  construction funds. If people say that we are performing magic,  we are performing it with the funds until we enter a sound cycle  of economic activities.  <H3>  Topic Two of the Conversation: Shanghai's Reform at Its Own  Expense and With the Initiative in Its Own Hands Under the  Prerequisite of Three Guarantees </H3>   [Zheng] History shaped Shanghai's role as a base of heavy  industry. The development of a market economy gives Shanghai a  sense of urgency. Large and medium state enterprises are more  concentrated in Shanghai than in any other area. What are  Shanghai's concept and implementation in this respect?    [Wu] At an economic work conference held by the central  authorities on successfully running large and medium state  enterprises, Comrade Huang Ju delivered a speech on behalf of  the Shanghai municipal party committee and the Shanghai  municipal government. He offered three guarantees to the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council: 1) a guarantee of the  orientation of socialism; 2) a guarantee that financial revenues  to be turned over to the higher authorities will be paid in  full; and 3) a guarantee of the fulfillment of the tasks  assigned by the central authorities and a guarantee of  Shanghai's subordination to macroeconomic regulation and  control. He asked the central authorities to permit Shanghai to  carry out reform at its own expense and with the initiative in  its own hands under the prerequisites of these three guarantees.  Because the market economy has been implemented, it is  necessary to create an environment in which enterprises can  compete fairly with each other. To achieve this goal, we have  adopted three measures. First, to "balance the tax burden."  The current major contradiction is an unequal tax burden.  State-owned enterprises, which are overburdened with taxes, lost  their competitiveness. Leading comrades of the central  authorities have mentioned on many occasions the idea of giving  in order to receive. The overall idea for transforming large  and medium enterprises is "lowering tax rates and enlarging the  tax base." Although tax rates are lowered, the state's tax  revenue does not decrease because an enlarged tax base produces  more revenue. Second, decisionmaking power for exports is given  to enterprises, thus enabling them to conduct business in  accordance with international practices, to participate in  international economic cooperation and the international  division of labor, and to tap into foreign raw materials,  capital funds, and markets. This is necessary to push  Shanghai's economy in a beneficial direction. Third, enterprises  are given decisionmaking power in distribution, thus arousing  the enthusiasm of enterprises' workers. We put forward the idea  of directly linking wage increases to enterprises' economic  performance. As a result, tax rates increase by 1 percent and  wages increase by 0.7 percent. But the wage increase is lower  than the increase in labor productivity. There is no longer a  set limit for wage increases. Of course, the most fundamental  key to invigorating state-owned large and medium enterprises  lies in changing the operating mechanism. The issues of the  modern enterprise system currently raised by comrades in  theoretical circles are worthy of great attention.    [Zheng] Do localities have the power to reduce taxes?    [Wu] We do not have the power to reduce taxes. But Shanghai  practices a contracted financial responsibility system. It is  estimated that the revenue turned over to the state by Shanghai,  which has an area of 6,100 square km, might reach 30 billion  yuan this year, including 15 billion yuan from the Shanghai  municipal government and 15 billion yuan from enterprises in  Shanghai directly under the central authorities. The idea of  carrying out reform at Shanghai's own expense means that under  the prerequisite of pledging to accomplish the task of turning  over a set amount of revenue to the central authorities,  Shanghai will provide support for the development of some high-  and new-technological industries in accordance with Shanghai's  financial ability. Such industries include communications and  computer industries, as mentioned above. Because Shanghai's  financial ability is limited, the scope of tax reductions and  exemptions is also limited. However, as far as supporting new  pillar industries is concerned, this is of significant  importance.    [Zheng] Is this an experiment on a selective basis or an  experiment to be carried by all enterprises? What is the result  of such an experiment?    [Wu] The "Regulations on Changing Operating Mechanisms in  State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" stipulate that enterprises  enjoy 14 kinds of decisionmaking power. We emphasize the three  aforementioned points. I personally believe that they provide a  fairly good objective environment for enterprises. Compared to  the rest of the nation, Shanghai's state-owned enterprises are  suffering the lowest financial losses. At present, Shanghai's  large and medium enterprises are faring relatively well. Those  which are faring poorly mainly are small enterprises.  Therefore, I told foreign visitors that it is useless to  discuss concepts alone. State-owned large and medium enterprises  are not a bad idea. Shanghai's overall industrial growth rate is  10 percent, and the growth rate of its large and medium  enterprises is more than 16 percent. The growth of large and  medium enterprises constitutes the main part of Shanghai's  economic growth. As for the reform of state-owned large and  medium enterprises, we began to try it out on a selective basis.  In the beginning, we experimented with the reform with some  enterprises whose products have a ready market and whose  economic performance is good. A total of 54 large and medium  enterprises carried out the experiment at that time. The reform  turned out to be a success. Later, the scope of such an  experiment is enlarged step by step. In the end, it will be  carried out at all enterprises.    [Zheng] Can all enterprises be saved by such an experiment?  As far as I know, some enterprises in Shanghai are heavily  burdened with debts. They are on the brink of bankruptcy or are  waiting to go bankrupt.    [Wu] You are right. Now I would like to discuss another  idea: Those manageable large and medium enterprises should be  allowed to prosper and those unmanageable ones whose debts are  larger than their assets should be allowed to go bankrupt before  they are reorganized. Some plants with only 20 million to 30  million yuan in assets are burdened with more than 100 million  yuan in debts. The debt interest for each plant totals 15  million yuan per year. They were even not able to pay the  interest. As a result, we replaced several plant managers.  Some plant managers were so worried that their hair went gray.  Who could handle the problem? It seems that bankruptcy is a  solution worth trying. Some foreigners asked me what we should  do if state-owned enterprises experience financial losses. I  told them that under the structure of the planned economy,  financial losses do not mean anything because the state will  subsidize the losses. They criticized us by saying that we  treated enterprises like a kind father. The market economy  means permitting survival of the fittest on the basis of fair  competition. Some enterprises are eliminated through  competition, but more are reborn and grow bigger in the  competition. But great resistance occurs when we try to let  unmanageable enterprises go bankrupt. Having no other, better  way, we adopt the method of mergers. More than 100 plants are  merged each year. Raising returns through an economy of scale is  achieved by merging plants whose products have a ready market  and whose economic performance is good with plants waiting to go  bankrupt. After the merger, the new plants become even more  invigorated. This is also a good way to readjust the industrial  structure. There is an iron- clad rule: If you do not let  enterprises whose debts exceed their assets go bankrupt, they  will not experience a rebirth.  <H3>  Topic Three of the Conversation: How the Organizational  Form of an Enterprise Meets the Requirements of the  Modernization Drive </H3>   [Zheng] During the course of reform carried out by  enterprises, the organizational form of an enterprise is drawing  increasing interest, and people in theoretical circles are  raising the idea of modern enterprises. What is your opinion  about this?    [Wu] The current organizational forms of enterprises are  somewhat unable to meet the requirements of this stage of the  market economy. To enable them to meet such requirements,  enterprises should adopt the corporate system. Enterprises in  all other market economy-type countries are either a company or  a financial group. This mean that current enterprises should  change their form. This is a complicated process which requires  a good job be done in many fundamental tasks. I believe that  such fundamental tasks should include the following: The key  issue is property rights, which serve as the mainstay of the  market economy. If the property rights are not clearly  defined, they cannot become the mainstay. Government  administration and enterprise management are separated in our  current enterprises. The state bears unlimited responsibility  for them. If they experience financial losses, whom will they  turn to? Nobody except the state, who should bear the  responsibility. Such a system will ruin enterprises. Therefore,  it is necessary to compile an inventory and examine the  stockpiles and capital of enterprises. Many enterprises do not  know exactly what assets they possess or what portion is the  state's capital funds and what portion is the enterprises'  assets. Second, it is necessary to clarify accounts receivable  and debts payable. As I just mentioned, if there exists an  enterprise whose assets are only 20 million or 30 million yuan  and whose debts exceed 100 million yuan, then we should let it  go bankrupt because it does not have the capability of paying  its debts. Now many enterprises have chaotic accounts.  Although deeply in debt, they give more bonuses to workers than  do other enterprises. In this way, the state's assets are  frittered away little by little. Third, the accounting measures  currently adopted by enterprises should be replaced by  international ones. Enterprises now have more than 20 report  forms, while Sino-foreign enterprises usually have only three,  with which they are able to clearly show their business  situation. Because of the incorrect accounting methods, the  situation often occurs in which profits show up in the  accounting statement despite losses being the actual situation.  As for cost accounting, we do not share a common language with  other investors living abroad because we have different opinions  about what is to be considered a cost and what is not. I will  not go into further detail about such problems as deducting the  percentage of depreciation expenses and the expenses incurred in  developing new products, as well as whether to list wages and  bonuses as a cost. It will be very difficult to push  enterprises onto the right track if they do not adopt the  accounting method commonly used internationally.    [Zheng]: What would the large enterprise groups be like  when the enterprise's external environment and internal  structure are optimized and they have shifted to new tracks?  Can you tell us your ideas for the future?    [Wu] There are two types of large enterprise conglomerates  in  the world. The Japanese type is trade oriented. The  conglomerate is composed of many enterprises, and its trading  companies are very active. South Korea also is included in this  type. The other type is found mostly in the United States and  Europe. They are industry-oriented large conglomerates.  Germany's Siemens and the Netherlands' Phillips belong to this  category. They are big translational industrial groups linked  by assets. We are now considering merging Shanghai's four major  energy concerns into an enterprise group.    [Zheng] Does this mean a thorough transformation in the  enterprises' organizational form?    [Wu] Yes. I believe that enterprises' organizational forms  should be diversified. First, there will be many limited  liability companies and limited liability stock companies.  Certainly, those companies whose shares are listed should be of  a small number. Even in Japan, they account for only 2 to 3  percent of the total. Then there are Sino-foreign joint  ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises, and exclusively  foreign-owned enterprises. More and more foreign-invested  enterprises have emerged in Shanghai. I believe that we should  be selective with regard to foreign-invested enterprises so that  we can exchange access to our market for technology and  accelerate China's modernization drive. The market is the  driving force of economic growth; it is also our means for  importing technology. We must not give away our capital for  nothing.    [Zheng] You have spoken with me before about implementing  the  shareholding system in Shanghai's enterprises. I know that both  you and Mayor Huang Ju are ardent supporters of this idea. Now  we can see the results of this system.    [Wu] When Shanghai introduced for the first time the  shareholding system in enterprises, it was an experiment. We  only had some fuzzy ideas, not like the very clear ideas that we  have today. Today, those shareholding enterprises in Shanghai  are lively and energetic. They are growing faster than the rest  of them and they are having the times of their lives. The four  shareholding enterprises under the Shanghai Handicraft Industry  Bureau account for 70 percent of the bureau's total economic  returns. The seven shareholding enterprises under the Shanghai  Textile Bureau account for 50 percent of the bureau's economic  returns. The shareholding system's impact on enterprises is  twofold: First, the injection of capital helps advance the  enterprise's transformation and development, and second, it  prompts them to transform their operating mechanisms in a  down-to-earth manner. Shareholders' overseeing of an  enterprise's operations has proved to be a very effective  driving force. The enterprise is supposed to distribute  dividends or allocate additional shares at the year's end. If  its assets have not increased or it is unable to come up with  the money to pay dividends, the shareholders will call the  managers to account. The most important characteristic of the  shareholding system is that it is highly transparent. It must  publish its balance sheet once a year. You cannot fool today's  shareholders. If there is a mistake in the balance sheet, they  will jump on it and you will find yourself in a terrible fix.  Therefore, the enterprise must improve its management and make  public its liabilities, assets, and profit-to-sales ratio.  Under these circumstances, enterprises will have to introduce  standard management procedures. Shareholding enterprises with  especially high economic returns may have their shares listed on  the securities exchange. Listed enterprises have a  responsibility to small investors. No one is allowed to  willfully bring an enterprise to bankruptcy. We must protect  the interests of investors.    [Zheng] You can feel Shanghai's prosperity everywhere you  go. Can there be a bubble economy behind the facade of  prosperity?    [Wu] I also thought about this concern of yours. I recently  conducted a survey, which shows that in the first half of 1993,  Shanghai's trade grew more than 38 percent, which was very good.  The growth was attributed mainly to consumption by residents  instead of institutions, which saw not much growth. This has  set my mind at ease, because consumption by the general public  is genuine. The ongoing macroeconomic control would have  curbed institutional consumption if it had accounted for a  greater proportion of the trade growth. This being the case, we  are still closely regulating and controlling Shanghai's economy  to prevent the development of a false, bubble economy.  <H3>  Topic Four: The Formation of the Great Ideas and Their  Impact on Shanghai's Development </H3>   [Zheng] There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Sit in a  command  post to formulate strategies." Your command post is always  empty; we have a hard time finding you.    [Wu] I like going down to the grass roots. Even though I may  not necessarily conduct in-depth investigation, the more places  I go to and the more things I hear, the broader my thoughts  become. There are many talented people in various work posts who  have brilliant ideas on running this municipality. These people  are in no position to direct other people to do what they think  is right, but we can absorb their ideas and use our position to  put their ideas into practice. Strategies do not have to be  developed in offices or meetings. (At this time, Wu Bangguo  stood up from the sofa and walked to a map of Shanghai suburbs,  which was filled with closely-drawn circles) I have visited  every county in Shanghai suburbs and all the circled townships,  towns, and villages on the map. The visits have given me more  ideas, and I have a pretty good idea about developments in the  rural areas.    [Zheng] You mentioned the question of pooling the wisdom of  the masses. This reminds me of something I have pondered all  the time: Shanghai has been making tremendous achievement based  on great ideas. The great ideas are, I believe, the result of  the efforts of the current municipal party and government  leaders, who have not only carried forward the thinking of their  predecessors but also enriched and developed them. I mentioned  this in my interview with Wang Liping, Chen Liangyu, Xia  Keqiang, and other leaders. They had the same feeling.    [Wu] This is an important point. Huang Ju and I have learned  much from our predecessors during the 11 years of service here.  As deputies, we took part in the formulation of Shanghai's  major policy decisions and development blueprints. Many of the  measures announced today were not formed overnight; they were  the crystallization of the wisdom of past leaders. Comrades  Zemin [Jiang Zemin] and Rongji [Zhu Rongji], in particular,  dedicated their painstaking efforts and wisdom to lay down a  strong work foundation. In the new situation, there will  certainly be changes and development. However, we still pay  attention to maintaining stability and continuity.    The great ideas you mentioned also incorporate another  element: We have always upheld the building of spiritual  civilization to maintain a fine social atmosphere. This was  also the traditional thinking of Shanghai's past leadership. We  must be responsible for our next generation. How can we live in  a society where parents are always worried about their children  away from home. We must safeguard social stability. We will  not be able to accomplish anything in a turbulent society.  Ordinary citizens will be the ultimate victims. The municipal  party committee has decided to ban horse racing, bar girls,  gambling, and beauty contests. Some people accused me of being  on the left. Actually I am being responsible to the people. No  one can control the situation once social atmosphere is  corrupted. Things like that, if allowed to develop, will create  an underworld, which will produce incurable maladies and exert  corrosive effects on party and government organs. If society is  in disorder and social atmosphere is corrupt, ordinary citizens  will complain and curse you even if the economy is in good  shape. A foreign businessman told me he was not afraid of  carrying some money and walking on Shanghai's streets at night.  Maintaining social stability is also a great idea.    [Zheng] How did the current leaders communicate with each  other to arrive at a harmonious consensus?    [Wu] I mentioned before that I have worked with Huang Ju for  11 years. I know what he thinks and he knows what I am  thinking. We have taken concerted action without prior  agreement. After working side by side for a long period, we  have complete trust in each other. This is not only the case  between the two of us, either. Among the leading bodies of the  municipal party committee, the government, the people's congress  standing committee, and the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference committee, it seems that everyone is  able to speak freely with each other with an open mind. They  deal with problems and do not concern themselves with  personalities. They work with peace of mind and do not feel the  need to guard against each other. They discuss issues without  reservation. Good ideas are supported regardless of who comes  up with them. Every so often we hold a meeting to exchange  views. There are no predetermined subjects. Participants speak  their minds, and sometimes they are able to come up with some  good ideas.    [Zheng] Will there be new moves in Shanghai's future  development?    [Wu] The specific ideas for development which were decided  on  at the sixth municipal party congress are the result of joint  explorations by previous municipal party committees and  governments, and they have been affirmed by the party Central  Committee and the State Council, as well as by Deng Xiaoping and  other revolutionaries of the older generation. The general  framework will not change between now and the end of this  century, but we are determined to broaden our path forward.    [Zheng] This has been a very pleasant interview. Thank you.    [Wu] You are very welcome. Please come again for a casual  talk.    [Zheng] In the old days, I accompanied Comrade Wu Bangguo as  a journalist in his tour of five provinces in southwestern  China. At the time, it was called lateral association, which  was part of the activities within the framework of a planned  economy. Since then, I have become better acquainted with him  and have learned more about him. We are able to talk for long  hours at a time when we meet on occasion. I have often been  moved by his humility and by his strict self-discipline. I  often admire his original and penetrating views but have not had  a chance to publish them in the press. This was because he  asked me on those occasions to chat with him as a friend, not as  a journalist doing an interview. On this particular occasion, I  spoke with him about many problems related to Shanghai's  development at the request of a Beijing magazine. Because some  of the subjects discussed are rarely known about by the people,  I have recorded the interview with Comrade Bangguo for the  benefit of our readers. He has not reviewed the transcript. I  wonder whether he will take offense.</p>

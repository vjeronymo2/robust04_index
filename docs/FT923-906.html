			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: SWP at Pounds 30,000 and passes dividend SWP Group, the Worcestershire-based building components supplier, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 30,000 for the year to June 30, against Pounds 826,000. The usual single final dividend is being passed. However, as a result of cost cutting and efforts to expand in niche areas, Mr Robert Stickings, chairman of the USM-quoted company, said that an improvement was expected in the present year. Figures from the first two months supported his view. Turnover fell 25 per cent to Pounds 7.74m (Pounds 10.3m). Earnings per share were 0.1p, compared with 2.2p last time when there was a final dividend of 0.6p.</p>

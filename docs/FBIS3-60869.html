They are being held in remand cells and will be  transferred to Rostov-on-Don in the near future.    An Interior Ministry official reports that during  interrogation it emerged that the terrorists carefully planned  their action. In particular, they thoroughly reconnoitered the  airports at Georgiyevsk and Stravropol. Some experts think that  if the criminals had managed to land at the intended point on  the border with Chechnya, there would have been very little  chance of catching them.    Moreover, it has emerged that during one of the  interrogation  sessions former military pilot Anatoliy Mikheyev said there was  a certain organization behind the groups' actions and that it  had helped plan the crime.</p>

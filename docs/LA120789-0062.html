Coliseum. But the second concert, to be held the same night in Los  Angeles at the Universal Amphitheatre, will go on as planned. Confirmed for the  Los Angeles show are Bruce Hornsby &amp; the Range, Natalie Cole, former Police  guitarist Andy Summers and Paul Stanley of the rock group Kiss. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

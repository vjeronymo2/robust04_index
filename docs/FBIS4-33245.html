			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Following a meeting with President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari, the citizens' commission to help in investigating Luis  Donaldo Colosio's homicide has declined the chief of state's  invitation. This statement was made after members of the  commission submitted their written resignation to the president.  They believe their work is unnecessary in view of the  investigations being conducted by Special Assistant Prosecutor  Miguel Montes.    The citizens' commission told President Salinas that all the  members agree the commission must be independent. The only  legal procedure that could give legitimacy to the citizens'  commission is if Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas [Colosio's widow]  appoints them as assistants of the public prosecutor's office  and judicial authorities.</p>

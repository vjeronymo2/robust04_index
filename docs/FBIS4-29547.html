			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sinister Intention" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense  Department recently worked out "a report on the program of  non-proliferation activities" envisaging "punishment including  sanctions" against the "violators of non-proliferation" for the  prevention of the proliferation of nuclear and other mass  destruction weapons.    Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives voted down the  bill of a resolution calling for an end to assistance to Japan  in its nuclear development.    NODONG SINMUN today says this is an unreasonable act to  stifle anti-imperialist independent countries including the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the unjustifiable  pretext of "non-proliferation" of nuclear and other mass  destruction weapons, while patronizing the nuclear arms  development in such pro-U.S. countries as Japan and Israel.    The analyst further says:    The United States is trying to stifle with a strong arm the  DPRK that offers no problem, while keeping mum about Japan where  nuclear armament is being accelerated, creating realistic  danger. This is the culmination of the application of a double  standard which fully reveals the shamelessness and duplicity of  the United States.    The U.S. military threat and blackmail under the pretext of  "non-proliferation" of nuclear and other mass destruction  weapons are now directed against the DPRK. But they may reach  all the other anti-imperialist independent nations tomorrow.    The United States intends to lord it over in the world by  dominating developing countries by all means including threat  with nuclear weapons.    The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] can never be a  means of the U.S. domination and interference. Intolerable is  the U.S. scheme to continue monopolizing nuclear weapons by  abusing the NPT and dominate other nations.</p>

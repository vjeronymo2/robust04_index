			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 18 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces have not  respected the cease-fire agreement for one moment at the Gorazde  front. Since early this morning they have been attacking the  Serb positions and using all available infantry and artillery  weapons, the command of the [Srpska] Herzegovina Corps said  today.    The fiercest Muslim attacks have been launched from the Baba  and Kik hills about 5-6 km southwest of Gorazde on the left bank  of the Drina. The attacks are aimed at the villages of Bachci  and Lalete.    According to the command of the Herzegovina Corps, it is  obvious that the Muslims are trying to break through along the  Drina toward the Foca area. In this way they want to draw in  the Serb units in the area in order to relieve the right bank of  the Drina and regain the territories lost on Saturday and Sunday.    Serb positions on Biserna hill above Gorazde on the right  bank of the Drina were fiercely targeted from the town today.  The heaviest fire is coming from a five-story building in the  town center where the United Nations has been accommodated. UN  representatives are on the fifth floor of the building, while  the Muslims have deployed a heavy machinegun on the fourth floor  and an antiaircraft gun on the third floor.    Heavy fire can be heard from the area around the bus  station.  Muslims are targeting Serb positions with 82-mm mortars deployed  behind the UN Protection Force building.    According to Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic from the command of  the Herzegovina Corps, the Serb forces are responding only when  they have to protect themselves. He claims that the Muslims  razed 400 houses in the Serb village of Sopotnica, which was  liberated yesterday.</p>

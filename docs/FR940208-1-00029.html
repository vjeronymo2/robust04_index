			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> E. Review Under Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12612, entitled ``Federalism,'' 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This proposed rule will apply to States that contract with DOE; however, none of the revisions is substantive in nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DOE has concluded that this proposed rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) (1976) or the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> IV. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Interested persons are invited to participate by submitting data, views or arguments with respect to the proposed DEAR amendments set forth in this notice. Three copies of written comments should be submitted to the address indicated in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this notice. All comments received will be available for public inspection in the DOE Reading Room, 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. All written comments received on or before the date specified in the beginning of this notice and all other relevant information will be considered by DOE before taking final action. Comments received after that date will be considered to the extent that time allows. Any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential and which may be exempt from public disclosure should submit one complete copy, as well as an additional copy from which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information or data and to treat it according to its determination. The Department's generally applicable procedures for handling information, which has been submitted in a document and may be exempt from public disclosure, are set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11. The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the rule should not have a substantial impact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses. Therefore, pursuant to section 50(c) of the DOE Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7191(c)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 912, 952, and 970  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Government procurement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on February 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> G.

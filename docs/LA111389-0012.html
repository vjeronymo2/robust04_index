			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN AIR: IT JUST MIGHT WORK  </P> <P> California's clean-air campaign, which spends a lot of time under siege, had  two days last week that made it look as if it all might work.  </P> <P> One of the good days was more a morale boost for the people in charge of  pollution controls than the kind of day that actually makes smog go away. But  the other was the announcement of an important early test of whether the state  has the patience for a new approach to cleaning up pollution. For more than 20  years, it has been able to make big gains by controlling major polluters --  power plants, refineries and the like. Now it must go after large numbers of  smaller sources. It must trap pollution by the handful, not by the truckload.  </P> <P> The first good day was Monday when guests of the State and Los Angeles Area  Chambers of Commerce showed up to hear a discussion of what the invitation  called "Draconian clean-up measures" being proposed to clear away Southern  California smog. The Los Angeles Chamber says it agrees with the goals of clean  air but is sharply critical of what the South Coast Air Quality Management  District says will have to be done in the future to reach those goals. With its  mention of possible economic decay and vanishing jobs, the invitation seemed to  promise a program that would hang Southern California's bold new 20-year  cleanup plan on the wall and take a bull whip to it.  </P> <P> The guests, instead, got a group of panelists that amounted to a fan club for  clean air. Before they spoke, Hitachi Ltd., one of the conference sponsors,  released the results of a poll of Los Angeles residents, 58% of whom said they  had seriously considered moving out to get away from the smog. Nearly half said  that major industry is most responsible for paying for clean air. Nearly half  also said they would be willing to car pool or take mass transit to help wipe  away smog.  </P> <P> The audience heard a state senator call for a ban on trucks at rush hour. A  planner said that regional government capable of handling environmental, social  and economic problems as parts of an inseparable package was essential but  warned that nothing would work until people trusted government again. An oil  executive said that his industry waited too long to take clean air seriously  and had some catching up to do. And so it went.  </P> <P> The outcome might mean nothing more than that the sponsors failed to invite the  right speakers. We choose to believe it demonstrates that the effort to get  clean air has as much support as efforts to get clean water and that the  question is not whether but how the goal is reached.  </P> <P> The other big day involved a move by the state Air Resources Board to require  manufacturers to make deep cuts in the ingredients of smog that escape into the  air every day from deodorant spray cans. Regulating something as seemingly  harmless and personal as a spray can is something new for most Californians. It  probably will take time for it to sink in that the total pollution from the  cans that seem too small to matter is about the same amount that escapes into  the air every day from an oil refinery. How people react in the end will have a  lot to do with whether Southern California can change the fact that it has the  dirtiest air in the nation, because it is just such cuts by the handful that  will be the pattern of the future.  </P></p>

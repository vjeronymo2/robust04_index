			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- A visiting senior  Chinese official said on Monday that China does not know the  correct extent of North Korea's nuclear development.    Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, said China had talked with North Korea  over the nuclear question.    "But, North Korea listened to us some times, and at some  other times they did not," Wu said.    During his call on President Kim Yong-sam, the Chinese  official said that denuclearization ought to be realized on the  Korean peninsula.    He was quick to add, however, that if pressures were applied  to North Korea to this end, it is prone to aggravate the  situation.    "I am sure that if South Korea promotes its policies toward  North Korea with patience, denuclearization would be realized  some time," he said.    During the meeting, President Kim said that if North Korea  develops nuclear arms, it would be a misfortune not only for  peace in Northeast Asia and the world but also for North Korea  itself.    If North Korea returns to dialogue with the South in a  sincere manner, South Korea would furnish economic support to  North Korea and help them improve relations with the United  States and Japan, President Kim said.    Wu flew into Seoul Sunday for an eight-day official visit at  the invitation of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu.</p>

The problem of animal radio-ecology is  considered by studying the organisms and animals from the zone  adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.    For several decades, the world community has been interested  in the effect of ionizing radiation on the animal world. Yet  interest in this problem has heightened relatively recently, and  this was largely due to the tragic Chernobyl events as well as  the growing roar of the newly declassified data on the  radionuclide contamination of vast territories in the former  union.    The natural peculiarities of Kazakhstan, its mountainous  landscapes, and numerous deposits of diverse ores, including  radioactive and, of course, the nuclear tests which were  conducted for many years necessitate large- scale  radio-ecological research. Today, there is every reason to  regard the radiological conditions in the republic's environment  as troubling. This can be confirmed by the data of the brief  review of this issue compiled predominantly on the basis of  current newspaper materials presented on the pages which follow.  Unfortunately, our scientific publications virtually ignore  these issues. A similar situation also existed until recently in  the former USSR. As Zh. Medvedev noticed in Energiya  No. 4, 1991, not a single article appeared about the Chernobyl  catastrophe in academic journals, even in  Radiobiologiya. The map of the nuclear installations  in the former union was published in the first issue of the New  York Times of 19-25 Mar 91. The map of nuclear bursts in the  republic long promised by the State Committee on the Environment  (Ogni Alatau, 25 Sep 91) has not yet been published.    Radiation Situation in Kazakhstan    Numerous current affairs publications dealing with the  nuclear bursts carried out at the test site near Semipalatinsk  between 1949 and 1989 have been accumulated in recent years. The  so-called ``nuclear shield of the country'' is now known to  virtually every citizen of the republic and the former union.  Nevertheless, we should focus attention once again on some of  the data. According to Vechernyaya Alma-Ata of 11 Feb  92, 1,800,000 ha of land were allocated in the Semipalatinsk  oblast for underground and surface nuclear bursts. The  radionuclide fission product fallout pattern stretches across  numerous inhabited localities and reaches Russia's Altay kray.  Given a natural radioactive background of 15-18 R/h, the  maximum total dose on open terrain reached 200 R/h. The  territories of the adjacent rayon have been contaminated with  fission products dozens of times. A.D. Sakharov said that ``the  fallout pattern is one of the principal causes of death,  illness, and genetic damage among humans.'' Yet even Chernobyl  left its fallout pattern in Kazakhstan territory. China is also  making a weighty ``contribution'' to contaminating Kazakhstani  soil. The most recent nuclear burst carried out there on 21 May  92 reached 1-2 Mt which exceeds the yield of U.S. and Russian  nuclear bursts by severalfold (Izvestiya, 27 May 92).    During the period of underground testing, approximately 100  Ci/km[.sup]2[/] of [.sup]239[/]Pu, strontium, cesium, and [.sup]14[/]   C and other long-lived isotopes entered the  environment (Kazakhstanskaya pravda, 4 Jan 92).  During 1961-1969 alone, approximately 38,000 Ci of radioactive  strontium and almost 50,000 Ci of cesium entered the Irtysh  water and were spread around. As years went by, the soil,  vegetation, and water contamination continued to increase.  Underground bursts result in the development of camouflets from  which radioactive gases seep out and radioactive fragments enter  the groundwater. We should keep in mind that for humans, even  one fifty-millionth fraction of a Curie is a life-threatening  dose. Little is still known about the actual level of  environmental contamination from these bursts. In order to paint  a realistic picture of contamination, one should take  measurements at least every 20 m because of its ``spotty''  pattern throughout.    In 1964, a nuclear device was set off in the bed of the  shallow Chagan River near the test site which formed a huge  crater from which roughly 3.5 million m[.sup]3[/] of ground  and ash was ejected, as a result of which a ``nuclear lake'' was  formed. Radioactive dust covered an enormous territory with  villages, sheep farms, and pastures. In place of snow, black ash  covered a territory with an 80-km radius (Izvestiya,  22 Jul 91). Out of the 300 people who were working on the lake  at the time, less than 30 survived. The dosage rate on terrain  reaches 50,000 R/h in the areas of traditional cattle  grazing  and watering. Remote breeding and grazing fields were also  contaminated. The concentration of various radionuclides in the  milk and meat of agricultural animals exceeds the maximum  permissible concentrations (PDK) by hundreds of times according  to the report of an interdepartmental commission of the USSR  Ministry of Public Health of 17-19 Jul 89. In 1953, a  thermonuclear bomb with a 500-kt yield was tested at the test  site. The external irradiation dose was enormous (50-60 R/h).  Moreover, plutonium isotopes which are a source of alpha  particles which are extremely dangerous when ingested into the  organism were accumulated in huge quantities. If they enter sex  cells, they may lead to birth defects in future generations.    Despite the fact that more than 40 years have passed since  the start of the early tests at the Semipalatinsk test site, the  radiation level at the burst sites remains very high--up to  10,000 R/h (Gorizont, 2 Nov 91). Approximately 1  million ha of test site lands was returned to circulation in the  national economy as suitable for habitation and production of  agricultural crops. Yet serious doubts arose in the cleanness of  these territories since one cannot rule out the presence of  radioactive fragments containing uranium and plutonium in these  territories which cannot be detected by existing radiation  monitors (Ekspress K, 7 May 92). Nevertheless,  animals are still grazing and hay is still being prepared in the  areas with a known high radioactivity level even today.    Calculations show that on a global scale, the total number  of  victims from the nuclear tests carried out in the world has  reached 1 million and is growing by 200,000-300,000 persons  annually (Poisk No. 5, 1991). In his monograph  ``Uranium and Life in the History of the Earth'' (Uran i zhizn v  istorii Zemli), S. Neruchev wrote in 1982 that three periods of  increasing uranium accumulation intensity can be identified in  the history of man-caused activity in the world. When these are  compared to the history of mankind, one can note extended  slowdowns in the development of civilization which coincided  with the start of these periods and were accompanied by a  decline in culture. In the author's opinion, the anthropological  type of the people changed during the radioactivity periods! So  what will Chernobyl, Semipalatinsk, Southern Urals, Novaya  Zemlya, etc. bring to mankind?    In the ``earth-plant-animals-human'' ecological chain, soil  is the principal link of radioactive contamination. Furthermore,  the most biologically dangerous radionuclide of artificial  origin (especially [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs) are  even multiplying in Kazakhstani soils. This is the opinion of  the expert from the Kazakhstani Hydrometeorological Service  (Ekspress K, 28 Nov. 91). They began a careful  investigation of the soil in the republic. By the way, we still  do not have the maximum permissible concentrations for  radioactive contamination of the soil. Russia's Law of social  Protection of Citizens extends to a radionuclide soil  contamination at levels exceeding 1 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. Fifteen  such administrative territories have been identified in Russia  (Argumenty i fakty Nos. 16-17, 1992). Yet the public  in Belarus and Ukraine are insisting that this level be lowered.    As we know, the soil is saturated with living organisms.  They  amount to 90-99% of the zoological mass in land  ecosystems.  Many of these forms are highly sensitive to the effect of  radiation and may store radionuclides [1]. It has been  established that long-living soil invertebrates (earthworms,  Dingoflagellata ticks, certain insect larvae, etc.)  are prospective bioindicators of radioactive contamination [2].    An examination of the Semipalatinsk oblast soils carried out  by the above experts demonstrated the presence of man-made  radionuclides in all selected samples (from a depth of 5-20 cm)  in five areas under study. It turned out that [.sup]137[/]Cs  and [.sup]90[/]Sr contamination exceeds the global background  by 1.5-8.5 times. At the same time, surface radioactivity in  these areas is within the natural norm. Earlier, in Sept- Oct  1990, the Ukrainian corporation Protiy together with the  Northern Ukrainian Geology Production Geological Association and  the Environmental Problems Center at the Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences completed activities in radio-ecological assessment of  the Semipalatinsk test site soils and the affected area with a  territory of 200,000 km[.sup]2[/] (see figure). A number of  abnormally high radioactivity patterns related to the test site  entities, i.e., surface burst craters, test boreholes, drifts,  etc., where the [.sup]137[/]Cs contamination density reaches  50-100 Ci/km[.sup]2[/] in some areas within a 5-cm soil layer  was discovered within the test site on an area of 11,000  km[.sup]2[/]. Thus, two independent expert studies confirm  that the test site soils are contaminated while radioactivity  from man-made sources is distinguished by its high ability to  accumulate in living organisms. [.sup]90[/]Sr affects  primarily the hematopoietic and osseous tissue while [.sup]137[/]  Cs--soft tissues and especially the sexual sphere  which has its impact on posterity.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-013-63A>      Figure </FIG>     Uranium mines are other sources of radiation which  contaminate the environment in Kazakhstan. The issue of the  republic's uranium industry which supplied more than 40%  of  uranium to the former USSR became open for the first time after  publication of V. Ponomarev's article ``Uranium Empire''  (Gorizont, Jan-Feb 92). Exploration of uranium  deposits began in the republic in the 1950s. By 1985, the number  of oblasts associated with uranium extraction reached nine.  Radioactive waste from this production is being dumped into  quarries, dumps, trenches, lake shores, and reservoir banks. At  the same time, a serious ecological danger of sulfuric acid  discharges arises since uranium recovery from molybdenum and  phosphorus ores is realized by treating them with sulfuric acid.  Hence the so-called acid rains. Uranium mining productions are  periodically experiencing emergencies. As a result of such  activities in Chimkent oblast, e.g., 2,600 open pits were formed  and numerous cases of epizootic cattle disease were recorded.  Moreover, this oblast did not escape nuclear tests. One such  test was carried out in 1973.    Elevated terrain radioactivity may be attributed to  radiation  anomalies. For example, more than 100 such anomalies have been  discovered in Ust- Kamenogorsk. In the city itself, areas with a  gamma-radiation dose reaching 7,000 R/h have been discovered  (Ekspress K, 8 Jan 92).    It became known rather recently that the natural  radioactivity background may vary within a broad range due to  the radon gas escaping from the earth as a result of the uranium  and thorium decay. According to 1990 data, up to 15,000 people  die annually in the former USSR due to radon-caused cancer  (Meditsinskaya gazeta, 30 Mar 90). We know from  foreign press releases that approximately 20,000 deaths related  to this gas are recorded annually in the United States. In  Sweden, 4,600 buildings have been declared inhabitable as of  1989 due to the high radioactivity resulting from the release of  radon. In France, the radon level in a number of provinces  exceeds the radiation level by 40 times. Radon is released from  the rock and enters the rooms with building materials or from  the soil on which the building stands. It largely accumulates in  unventilated rooms. In our mountainous republic, unfortunately,  no serious attention has been given to the radon problem. On the  other hand, mandatory testing of all inert building materials  was introduced recently in Kazakhstan (Ekspress K, 24  Mar 92).    It has been established that an increase in the radon  concentration in the inhaled air affects the pituitary gland and  the adrenal gland and causes shifts in the entire organism.  During these surges of the radon concentration, approximately  30% of the population experienced a sense of alarm,  heartbeat,  hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. Radon begins to escape  actively from the rock when it is subjected to alternating  compression and tension during perturbations of the geomagnetic  field. This led to speculations that the state of human health  is affected not as much by the magnetic storms themselves as by  the radon released from the ground and building materials  induced by them. Thus, the mountainous landscape in Kazakhstan  makes its own contribution to the radiation conditions in the  environment.    Finally, one more facet of the problem is associated with  the  radioactive waste and the so-called ``burials.'' Today, more  than 17,000 sources of ionizing radiation have been recorded in  the republic of which 11,000 are in Alma-Ata. A pavement area  with a radiation level exceeding 500,000 R/h was discovered  in the city (Vechernyaya Alma-Ata, 10 Sep 91). There  is no place to dispose of the dangerous soil. The only burial in  the republic--at the Nuclear Physics Institute of the  Kazakhstani Academy of Sciences--has been shut down. This  prompted preparations to the development of a network of  regional stations for burying substances emitting ionizing  radiation (Vechernyaya Alma-Ata, 22 Apr 92).    Speaking about the problems of animal radio-ecology, it  would  make sense to emphasize that against the backdrop of a certain  heightening in the interest in the health and social conditions  of the persons living in the elevated radiation zone on the part  of the public and the republican government (thus far, we have  been talking only about the Semipalatinsk test site zone), the  study of the animal as well as plant life has been nonexistent  from this viewpoint. Yet it is quite obvious that no matter how  accurate radiation monitoring is for measuring radioactivity in  contaminated territories, the principal criteria for its  assessment are still the biological indicators. Only the living  organisms, their reaction, and status may impart biological  sense in the most precise physical measurements and give an  answer about the suitability of the environment for habitation.    Objectives of Radio-ecological Studies of Animals    Animal radio-ecology is one of the most recent branches of  general radio-ecology. It entails a study of the effect of  ionizing radiation from radionuclides introduced into natural  biogeocenosis on the animal populations, their communities, and  individual organisms [3]. To date, several animal radio-ecology  trends have developed:     -  determination of the qualitative and quantitative  radionuclide distribution in animal organisms;    -  a study of the changes in the structure and dynamics of  animal  populations and communities living under the conditions of  elevated radiation background    -  and identification of the specific features and long-term  consequences of the effect of external and internal (from  incorporated radioactive elements) irradiation on the animal  organism.     Principal attention is given by scientists to the first two  trends, e.g., by such domestic researchers as R.M. Aleksakhin,  A.I. Ilyenko, D.A. Krivolutskiy, V.Ye. Sokolov, et al. They  analyzed the extensive materials published in the form of  reviews, monographs, and collections [4, 5, 6]. These  publications can serve as ground-breaking sources for  formulating approaches to identifying the necessary objectives  in studying the ecology of land vertebrates. Foreign sources are  not replete with publications in the field of radio-ecology of  free living organisms which is probably due to a more orderly  radio-ecological situation there than here.    A study of the animal organism proper freely living in  nature  at a molecular, cellular, and systemic levels remains the  weakest link in animal radioecology. The diversity of the animal  life which includes rare and endangered species and the  multicomponent and variable origin of the natural effects as  well as the geographical and the climatic differences in the  habitats impose their peculiarities on the course of metabolic  processes and the level of various biochemical components of the  organism. Certain difficulties for researchers are due to the  need to capture a sufficient quantity of animals and acquire  vast volumes of similar data for mathematical processing.    Prior to the events brought about by Chernobyl, the  radiobiologists' principal efforts were aimed at the main  mechanisms of the course of acute radiation syndrome, i.e., the  effect of high radiation doses. Animal radio-ecology presupposes  a study of the biological efficiency of low radiation levels  since in areas with very high radiation doses, a study of low  irradiation doses of low intensity under a prolonged (chronic)  impact becomes a priority. Yet the effects of low doses are  usually manifested to a lesser extent in contrast to high doses  which can be easily reproduced experimentally on laboratory  animals. The negative consequences of chronic low doses are  accumulated little-by-little and cannot be easily recorded.  Furthermore, as stated at the First All-Union Radiobiological  Congress (Moscow, August 1989), we feel the insufficient  development of accessible efficient methods of indication of the  radiation reaction of various organisms and of the arsenal of  biological radiation monitoring. There is very little  theoretical and practical knowledge about the radionuclide  distribution in vegetative and animal organisms and the specific  features of the radionuclide contamination of the biocenoses.    In the past, a viewpoint about complete safety of low  radiation doses figured prominently. Eventually, it became clear  that the response to the effect of low doses may turn out to be  completely unpredictable. New data on the effect of low  radiation doses on humans and animals began appearing in  scientific literature only recently. This was also prompted by  the Chernobyl catastrophe. Yet it is impossible to replicate the  Chernobyl or Semipalatinsk conditions in model experiments, so  consequently, their genetic and biological impact is  unpredictable. It must be examined directly in the [affected]  areas.    Moreover, in ecologically troubled areas, the effect of  radionuclides is often compounded by the chemical and physical  factors of diverse origins. Their combination may result in a  nonlinear ecological impact (synergism) which greatly exceeded  the harm caused by these factors separately. The problem of  synergism of radionuclides and chemical agents assumed a global  scale, yet until recently, it has not been explored sufficiently.    It is well known that a definitive conclusion about the  status of the animal organism's vital activity calls for a  comprehensive interdisciplinary approach which is similar to the  study of the human organism. Such experiments are based on an  examination of diverse systems (circulatory, nervous, muscular,  etc.) and structural-functional and metabolic processes at a  subcellular, cellular, tissue, organ, and organism level using  the methods of biochemistry, physiology, hematology, immunology,  molecular biology, as well as environmental indicator methods  such as morphometry and morphophysiology.    It has been uniformly agreed that the cell containing the  genetic material is the decisive link in the reactions of  multicellular biological systems to the radiation exposure. It  is also beyond doubt that the principal targets of the low  radiation doses are the biological membranes which regulate the  interrelation between the cell and the environment.    Radiobiologists are constantly searching for the methods of  biological indication of the effect of ionizing radiation and  its quantitative assessments. The solution to this problem is  considered from the viewpoint of various cytogenetic,  biochemical, immunological, hematological, and biophysical  criteria. The principal requirements imposed on the  bioindicators of the radiation exposure include the dependence  of the effect on the irradiation dose, the sensitivity and  specificity, universality and suitability of any organism  populations for analysis as well as the simplicity and quickness  of the methodological approach used. Chromosomal analysis [7] is  regarded as a routine method of quantitative assessment of the  radiation dose (as an additional method for physical radiation  monitoring data). The cellular pattern of the bone marrow and  the micronuclear test [8] are often used for indicating the  radiation effects. Determination of the lymphocyte  subpopulations in peripheral blood [9] is regarded as promising.    A study of the organism of the animals which inhabit the  contaminated territories is not limited to formulating the  specific test systems. The interdisciplinary approach  presupposes a search for the peculiar features and patterns in  the process of animal adaptation to the chronic irradiation  conditions, manifestations of the relative radiostability of the  individuals and the species as a whole, and the possibility of  predicting the impact of radiation exposures. The use of  adequate control animal populations whose interspecific  characteristics are similar and who inhabit the areas which are  the closest with respect to the climatic and geographic  parameters is an extremely important condition for attaining  objectivity in analyzing the resulting data.    The fauna of the radiologically unfavorable Kazakhstan  regions also calls for specifically zoological observations as  one of the most important aspects of the biological variation  monitoring in the populations of wild animals. Yet the vast  areas of the Semipalatinsk zone as well as many other similarly  unfavorable regions in the republic remain outside the sphere of  the zoologists' inquiry.    Two months after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident,  the Belarussian researchers conducted observations of the  population of small mammals and other animals. They discovered  that the number of wolves and forest ferrets declined by  fivefold and that of foxes and mouse-like rodents--by twofold.  The males of field mice developed excessively hypertrophied  testes and thyroid glands [10]. Among the birds, ducks, loons,  snipes, and woodcocks were the most contaminated ones. Their  principal nutrition are animal benthos, land and soil  invertebrates living near the water, macrophytes, and pasture  vegetation which, it turned out, accumulate radionuclides [11].  Between 1986 and 1988, 218 wild farmed and hunted mammals were  examined within a 30-km zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant. It was established that the highest [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134  [/]  Cs and [.sup]137[/]Cs concentration was in the  organs and tissues of wild pigs and foxes which was followed in  the decreasing order of concentration by gazelle, deer, moose,  and wolf. In young animals, the [.sup]90[/]Sr concentration  in the muscles was higher than that in the adults. On the  organ-by-organ basis, the nuclide accumulation peaks in the  liver and kidneys, the average levels are found in the lungs and  muscles, and the minimum--in the wool. No differences between  accumulation in the males and females was detected. The  relationship between the type of animal nutrition and the level  of radionuclides in the tissues was identified [12].    The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident not only prompted  the study of the flora and fauna on the affected territories  which is attested to by the international conference dealing  with the biological aspects of its consequences held in  September 1990 but also facilitated the development of urgent  tasks in the fields of radiation genetics [13] and radiation  immunology [14]. New trends are being developed in the area of  radiation biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology  associated with low doses and long-term consequences of  radioecological disasters.    In a similar vein, the Radiobiology Laboratory of the  Zoology  Institute at the Kazakhstani Republic Academy of Sciences has  been focusing its efforts since 1991 on the issues of studying  the organisms and populations of animals inhabiting the natural  zones of Kazakhstan with an elevated and natural radioactivity  background. The efforts are being carried out using the  populations of wild rodents which, as we know, are characterized  by their high number, uniform distribution, and frequent  succession of generations. For these reasons, these entities  have been commonly accepted for solving the tasks of animal  ecology and radioecology [15, 16], while the greatest diversity  of radiation effects [17] is noted among the rodents of the  mouse species.    Even the early data which we obtained from the rodents  inhabiting the area adjacent to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test  site provide new and original information and are stimulating  interest. In the Chagan River valley where the surface  background appears normal (13-15 R/h), the soil  contamination  measured with the help of a gamma-spectrometer was higher than  the global level and reached 3.5 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. The forest  mouse (39 animals) were the most common among the 70 animals  representing eight species trapped over this territory. A study  of this population revealed an extreme nonuniformity with  respect to a number of morphophysiological features, e.g., a  high variation coefficient. The animals differed most  significantly with respect to their morphometric parameters and  cellularity indices of the bone marrow. With respect to these  characteristics, adult mice could be clearly divided into two  groups. In the first group, the animals had a higher level of  bone marrow cellularity and had a greater mass, body length, and  tail length. All distinctions are statistically significant. At  the same time, it was discovered that one of the most important  parenchymatous organs, such as the liver, had an elevated  functional activity in the individuals with higher bone marrow  indicators which was judged by the activity of a broad range of  enzymes used in clinical tests of its status.    The cytogenetic studies of the bone marrow cells of the  animals under study made it possible clearly to record an  elevated chromosomal aberration level. From among the 282 cells  examined in the metaphase, 6.74% had various types of  aberrations. Yet it is known that as a norm, the bone marrow of  mammals contains between 0 and 2% of aberrant cells,  depending  on the species and age. Based on this, one can draw the  conclusion that the significant increase in this indicator among  the rodents who for a long time inhabited the area of the former  nuclear tests discovered by us directly attests to the serious  impairments in their genetic system.    Many of the rodents under study were characterized by a  large  number of erythrocytes in the blood. A leftward shift of the  differential blood count, i.e., a predominance of young  neutrophile forms over the mature ones, was common to all  animals. The fact that there is a change in the red and white  blood count under the effect of ionizing radiation is commonly  accepted today and is regarded as one of the principal criteria  of its biological effect [5]. In our case, the variability of  these interesting indicators may determine the extent of  long-ranging consequences of nuclear testing among the  inhabitants of the affected territories and their adaptation  reactions. Activities in the test site area are continuing. In  addition to the specifically radio-ecological effects, an  analysis of even the early experiments reveals noticeable  interspecific and sex-age differences for a broad range of  biochemical indicators which is of interest from the viewpoint  of understanding the specific features of the rodent organism  activity. Such a cellular-tissue approach to studying wild  animals is promising for solving the problems of comparative  radiosensitivity, radioadaptation, and synergism phenomena and  as a whole--for constructing models for predicting the vital  activity of populations under varying extreme conditions.    In conclusion, we should note that zoologists specializing  in  all areas must start studying the problems of animal  radio-ecology of Kazakhstan in all directions of this field of  science. There is no doubt that only a complex of large-scale  scientific research activities may become the basis for  successfully solving all urgent problems.  Bibliography    1. D.A. Krivolutskiy.

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown acquisition gets MMC clearance THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission has cleared Hillsdown Holdings' purchase of the fruit and vegetable canning and ambient stored meals businesses of Associated British Foods. The MMC said the acquisition gave Hillsdown substantial market shares in those sectors and for individual products. Hillsdown and Anglian Canners, one of the businesses acquired, had combined sales of Pounds 130m in 1990, equal to a little more than half the total UK market for canned seasonal vegetables. But the MMC found Hillsdown was unlikely to be able to exploit its position because of the buying power of multiple retailers and competition from other producers. The MMC also decided the market for ambient stored meals would not be damaged. Competition was provided by branded products and by chilled and frozen meals.</p>

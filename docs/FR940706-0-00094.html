This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to these documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Unless required by statute, the Secretary does not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Secretary can demonstrate that the records must be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to ED.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The starting date for retention of the following types of documents (including supporting records) is specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section: indirect cost rate computations or proposals; cost allocation plans; and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> If submitted for negotiation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

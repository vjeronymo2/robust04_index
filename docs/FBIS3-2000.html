Contracts now stipulate duties, obligations and rights of  both employees and the State. This encourages competition and  motivates workers.    Of the 80 million workers in State firms, 23.3 million work  under collective contracts, according to statistics from the  Labour Ministry.    The ministry is urging more enterprises to sign workers to  contracts in the future.    Despite this, there are no labour laws governing the  contract  system .    So a contract labour law is being drafted and will be  submitted this month to the National People's Congress for  examination and approval, said Dong Ping, a Labour Ministry  official.    Although contract and lifelong "iron rice bowl" systems  still  co- exist in State firms, most new workers are hired under  contract.    Some well-developed coastal cities like Shenzhen, Zhuhai and  Yamen are encouraging all workers to be hired under the contract  system.    In shanghai, China's largest industrial city, nearly 1.5  million workers are under labour contracts, or 97.53 per cent of  all employees in State firms.    At Shanghai No 5 Steel and Iron Plant, the trade union  bargained for a collective contract for all the employees.    More enterprises are expected to follow suit, Dong said.    In East China's Shandong Province, 9,359 State firms  switched  to the contract system, employing 2 million labourers.    Several pilot cities--Anyang in Henan Province, Zhuzhou in  Hunan, and Yancheng in Jiangsu--have signed all State workers to  contracts.    And provinces such as Guangdong, Hainan, Jilin, Hebei and  Liaoning are also expanding contract employment to all  State-owned enterprises, Dong said.    It is still, however, in the experimental stage in remote  and  underdeveloped regions.    The contract system first began with new workers in some  areas in 1986, and has been on a trial basis nationwide since  1987.    Under the system, those working at full enthusiasm receive a  pay raise.    Most State-owned enterprises have been revitalized by the  new  employment system, Dong claimed.    And workers have benefited as well. For instance, more  workers now defend their own interests as stipulated in the  contract.    Recently, an official survey conducted among 2,400 State  workers found that about two-thirds favour the contract system.    Those surveyed said the greatest fears under contract are  job  stability and salary.    Some, especially those working at foreign-invested firms,  complain they would be fired by their bosses too often.</p>

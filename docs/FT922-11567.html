			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Warring parties ignore Sarajevo truce: Oil refinery reported set ablaze in fighting on Bosnia's northern frontier HEAVY firing broke out last night in Sarajevo, capital of the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, only hours after leaders of its ethnic groups had signed a ceasefire. The truce among Moslem, Serb and Croat leaders was brokered by Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia, and Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the foreign minister of Portugal which holds the EC presidency. However, there were immediate reports of renewed fighting, with mortar fire from Moslem areas of the city being answered by recoilless cannon fired by Serb militia around the hotel Bosna, which houses the EC mission headquarters and foreign journalists. Belgrade television also said that the oil refinery in Bosanski Brod, on Bosnia's northern frontier with Croatia and the only such installation in the republic, had been hit and set ablaze as fighting in the area between Serb and Croat forces continued for the third successive day. The federal army command in Sarajevo agreed with the Bosnian government to send all available fire-fighting equipment. The parties had agreed to sign last night's declaration to observe a truce originally reached on April 12 but subsequently ignored. Mr Pinheiro warned that fresh peace talks to be held in Lisbon on Monday would take place only if the ceasefire was respected. Federal army tanks and armoured vehicles ringed the airport in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia, where the EC team met the Bosnian leaders. 'Everybody is to blame for what is happening in Sarajevo and the sooner we get a ceasefire there will be no need to blame anybody,' Lord Carrington said later on arrival in Belgrade for talks with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president, and General Blagoje Adzic, federal defence minister. Diplomats feared the fighting could engulf the newly independent republic. A western diplomat said: 'The amount of destruction and number of deaths is a very small illustration of what is possible'. Sarajevo radio said 48 people had been wounded in two days of fierce clashes in Bosanska Krupa, in the north-western Moslem heartland. Local authorities agreed to a ceasefire to take effect from midnight last night. At least 21 people have been confirmed dead in the last 24 hours of fighting between Serb irregulars and Moslem units in Bosnia. Unconfirmed reports after fierce fighting on Wednesday in Sarajevo said at least 20 people were killed and 77 wounded. Eyewitnesses reported heavy damage. In Bonn, Germany and the Netherlands stepped up pressure on Serbia to end the conflict or face international isolation, calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the crisis.</p>

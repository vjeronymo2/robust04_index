			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR STOPS LABOR AFTER 1ST TWIN IS BORN; 2ND NOT DUE FOR 15 WEEKS  </P> <P> In one of only 14 recorded cases of its kind, a woman gave premature birth to a  girl 15 weeks before the infant's twin sister is due, hospital officials  announced Saturday.  </P> <P> Donna Krasenics, 24, gave birth to 1-pound, 8-ounce Shakoora Krasenics on  Thursday at Crawford-Long Hospital of Emory University, said Tisha Burland, a  hospital spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Her sister's full-term arrival is expected in July.  </P> <P> After Shakoora's birth, Dr. Camille Davis-Williams was able to stop further  labor, preventing the other twin from being born prematurely, Burland said.  </P> <P> Williams tried to terminate labor before Shakoora was born, but the baby's  water sac broke and she had to be delivered. The other twin's water remained  intact.  </P> <P> Shakoora was placed in an incubator in the nursery's intensive care unit and  was reported in critical but stable condition Saturday. Donna Krasenics was  listed in good condition.  </P> <P> Burland said the baby was in good hands. "We've taken care of much lighter  babies and much sicker babies in this intensive care unit," she said.  </P> <P> Krasenics will have to stay in bed until her second baby is born. Shakoora will  remain at the hospital until she gains enough weight to be out of danger,  Burland said.  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Growth in condom sales expected to slow CONDOM sales in Europe should increase 25 per cent from Dollars 492m (Pounds 271.8m) in 1990 to Dollars 616m over the next five years, according to a report* published by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market research company. However, the rapid market growth during the late 1980s, following the first realisation that heterosexuals were at risk from HIV, will not continue, said the report. The largest market in Europe for condoms remains Italy, with annual sales of Dollars 193m. The Italian market is still growing rapidly, increasing 12 per cent during 1990, mainly because of low usage of the pill. West Germany is the second largest European market, where sales reached Dollars 111m in 1990. Unification should increase the condom market since they were not officially available in East Germany. In the UK, condoms have overtaken the pill as the most popular form of contraception for the first time since the 1960s. Condom sales reached Dollars 67m in 1990. In Spain, more than half of women between 15 and 45 do not use any form of contraceptive. The pill remains the most popular form of birth control. The French condom market worth Dollars 45m, is poorly developed, according to the report. *The European market for OTC external medication, OTC contraceptives and home diagnostics, Frost &amp; Sullivan, 071 730 3343.</p>

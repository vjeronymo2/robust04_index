			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAMES DESTROY L.A.'S HISTORIC PAN PACIFIC AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> I was both saddened and appalled as I heard the fire trucks and helicopters  trying to save the burning Pan Pacific building. This beautiful Art Deco  building has remained empty and in disrepair for a number of years. If this  disregard for buildings is how the people of Los Angeles treat their historic  landmarks, then maybe the people of Los Angeles do not deserve them.  </P> <P> SUSAN SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

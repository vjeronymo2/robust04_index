			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kalon loses battle for control of Manders KALON's hostile Pounds 86m bid for rival Manders (Holdings) has failed. The paint maker lapsed its offers after it had only received acceptances in respect of 7.82m Manders ordinary shares, or 21.2 per cent of its target, by 1pm yesterday when the bid closed. Mr Roy Amos, Manders chairman, said that he was very pleased, 'especially about the 500 jobs' which would have been lost had the bid succeeded. He added that the '80 per cent support was a pat on the back for the management from shareholders' and repeated that 'the bid didn't properly value Manders, a firm, well-spread business'. He compared his paint, ink and property group favourably with Kalon, 'which has a lot of eggs in one big basket'. For his part, Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, said he was 'puzzled about what judgments people make on group performance and management records'. He suggested: 'Kalon's success has caused some suspicion, and if we had had, say, only 20 per cent annual improvements, we would be thought a fine company.' He conceded that the climate was 'not good for hostile bids or mergers - agreed bids are the only acceptable route'. The beginning of the end of the bid came last weekend, he said, when British Steel Pension Fund, which holds 22 per cent of Manders' equity, announced it would be rejecting the offer. Other shareholders then abstained, feeling it was a lost cause, he said. Kalon's bid valued Manders shares at 232p, or 241p with the partial cash alternative. Last night Manders shares eased 2p to 186p and Kalon's gained 1/2 p to 82 1/2 p.</p>

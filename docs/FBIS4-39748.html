			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Russia" column: "Luzhkov Is </F> Not Going To Give In. He Still Considers Voucher Privatization  a Disaster"]    [Text] It seemed that the battle of giants has come to  naught: The triumphant statement by the State Property  Management Committee [Goskomimushchestvo] Press Center, filled  with the bombast of struggle in the course of which a revolt has  been suppressed, speaks no more about Goskomimushchestvo's going  to the Prosecutor's Office. The response note by the Moscow City  Hall Press Center and Yuriy Luzhkov's statement yesterday also  leave the mayor sticking to his anti-Chubays positions.    Yesterday the Moscow City Hall Press Center circulated two  statements by Yuriy Luzhkov, one of which was devoted to  Chubays, and the other to security (in connection with the  attempt on Berezovskiy's life). The statement devoted to  privatization problems reads as follows: "I must calm  Muscovites and those Russians who are still hoping to stop the  catastrophe initiated by Mr. Chubays' foreign experts. I state  officially that I not only have not stopped my struggle for a  genuinely people's privatization but, in view of new facts  coming to light, am going to intensify it."    The last part of the document is an apotheosis of struggle  for the rights of the down-and-outs: "For these and many other  reasons I declare that a departure from our principles in this  situation would be treachery with respect to the Muscovites."    The Moscow mayor's sharp statement was backed up by an  interview in the latest issue of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY.    Observers have considered the battle in two dimensions: As a  reflection of the actual economic interests of Moscow, aimed at  addressing concrete tasks, and also as the first act in Yuriy  Luzhkov's election campaign for the Russian presidency.    Therefore, if we are to sum up the objective results of the  multi-round battles, it becomes clear that the Moscow mayor has  failed to stand up for the interests he had in mind when issuing  the 1 April order. Moreover, according to sources in the  presidential entourage, Luzhkov has even found himself in a  somewhat weaker position with respect to the president. The  Moscow mayor apparently officially had to abandon his claims to  the presidency. But now Luzhkov will go to the very end, while  the next Russian president will be either Boris Yeltsin himself  or a person who receives power from his hands. (Scenarios for a  tough political struggle and/or coups is a subject of separate  conversation).    So, what has Yuriy Luzhkov won? I venture to say that  politically he has made considerable gains. In fact we have  witnessed the Moscow mayor's first step from the position of a  regional leader to the status of a national leader concerned not  only about city problems. Any division of property in the end  leads to its concentration in the hands of the minority, while  the majority gets rich only in the process of steady economic  development. Yuriy Luzhkov opposed voucher privatization in a  loud and scandalous way, combining TV appearances with  interviews circulated in 6.26 million copies. His arguments are  simpler and more clear-cut than the positions of many opposition  leaders who have not reached a common opinion and have weak  publicity. Is there any need to say how this is important to a  future contender in an election campaign, especially if the  Moscow mayor's newly found charisma does not prevent him from  remaining the president's trusted person? Should Yeltsin  recognize that Luzhkov is right, Anatoliy Chubays, at the end of  privatization, will be left one to one with the vouchers and  their holders.</p>

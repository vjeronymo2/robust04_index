			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNOCAL TO PAY $5.5 MILLION TO END LAWSUIT;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: CIVIL SETTLEMENT IS THE LARGEST REACHED UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT.  SUIT CHARGED THAT THE COMPANY POLLUTED SAN FRANCISCO BAY.  </P> <P> In the largest civil settlement reached under the Clean Water Act, Unocal Corp.  of Los Angeles has agreed to pay $5.5 million -- including $2.7 million to an  environmental group -- to end a lawsuit filed against the company for polluting  San Francisco Bay.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, which claimed that  Unocal knowingly and illegally discharged tons of toxic waste into San  Francisco Bay throughout the early 1980s, polluting the water and fouling  sensitive wildlife habitat.  </P> <P> The $2.7 million will go to the Trust for Public Lands for the purchase and  restoration of fouled wetlands. The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund will be paid  about $1.3 million in lawyers fees. The remaining $1.5 million will be split  between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the state Water  Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Fund.  </P> <P> "We're elated," said Stephan Volker, the Sierra Club lawyer who filed the suit  in 1984. "This should send a message to other polluters: Clean up your  operations or face the prospect of being hauled into court and paying a  substantial penalty."  </P> <P> Unocal, in a prepared statement, said the alleged violations were the result of  a misunderstanding of its responsibilities under federal law. The company  denied any malicious intent, and said it has since installed a $64-million  waste water treatment facility at its refinery in Rodeo, Calif., about 18 miles  northeast of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club lost its original 1985 suit after a one-week trial in U.S.  District Court in San Francisco. But that decision was reversed by the U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987. The appellate court decision was, in turn,  vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988.  </P> <P> Eventually, the Sierra Club suit was consolidated with a lawsuit filed by the  State Regional Water Quality Control Board. That suit was scheduled to be heard  earlier this month, but was delayed by negotiations that led to the settlement  disclosed Thursday.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleged that whenever polluted waste water built up at Unocal's  plant, the company would purge the excess by bypassing its legally required  treatment facility and dumping waste directly into the bay. That waste  allegedly exceeded state and federal standards for a variety of pollutants,  from oil and grease to inorganic toxics and bacteria. The suit also accused the  company of failing to tell pollution officials when the excessive discharges  occurred, as required by law.  </P> <P> Unocal said that most of the alleged violations resulted simply because the  company failed to fully understand the requirements of its federal waste water  discharge permit. Unocal said it did not realize it was prohibited to bypass  its waste water treatment system, because the waste received partial treatment  elsewhere in the plant and was diluted with fully treated effluent.  </P> <P> Once informed by the state in 1985 that such bypasses were illegal, Unocal said  it "immediately changed its method of operation."  </P> <P> The marginally treated waste water flowed into San Pablo Bay, the northern  section of San Francisco Bay and the site of many of the Bay Area's remaining  wetlands. Those marshy lands are valuable habitat for spawning fish, migrating  birds and other wildlife.  </P> <P> The Trust for Public Lands, a private, San Francisco-based organization that  raises money to buy environmentally valuable property for preservation or  donation to state and federal parks, said it will use its share of the Unocal  settlement to protect not only wildlife habitat, but scenic and recreational  resources as well.  </P> <P> "This settlement makes it possible for us to redouble our efforts to protect  areas critical to the health of the bay, and to secure for the public some of  the acreage that is fast giving way to development," said Martin J. Rosen,  president of the nonprofit land trust.  </P> <P> The Trust for Public Lands already has assembled and bought 500 acres of prime  waterfowl habitat along adjacent Suisin Bay for protection by the State Lands  Commission.  </P></p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson lifts first-half net earnings 24% Jardine Matheson, the trading conglomerate which is to de-list from the Hong Kong stock exchange at the end of the year, lifted first-half net earnings to USDollars 215.8m from USDollars 173.8m in the same period last year. The rise was partially fuelled by a 44 per cent profits jump at Jardine Fleming, the brokerage jointly owned with UK merchant bank Robert Fleming. Its after-tax profit was USDollars 111m, half of which accrues to Jardine Matheson, against USDollars 77m in 1993. However, directors warned that Jardine Fleming will be hard pressed to match last year's second half which triggered a 166 per cent rise in net earnings to USDollars 202m. Earnings per share, taken on a fully-diluted basis, rose 23 per cent to 36.69 US cents from 29.79 US cents, and directors are recommending an interim dividend of 7.80 US cents a share, an improvement of 15 per cent on last year's 6.80 US cent payout. The results were in line with expectations. Henry Keswick, chairman, said the outlook for the full year is for satisfactory earnings growth. Among affiliates and operating divisions, Jardine Pacific's earnings rose 7 per cent to USDollars 86m with the trading and distribution arm helped by a pick up in Hong Kong and slight recovery in the wines and spirits business in Japan. Trading profit in the engineering and construction division declined despite strong showings by Jardine Airconditioning, Jardine Schindler and Gammon, due mainly to the reduction in the group's interest in Jardine Schindler and lower Pacific Machinery sales. Jardine Strategic, in which Jardine Matheson has a 55 per cent attributable interest, contributed USDollars 64.3m, an increase of 53 per cent. That was lifted by swollen interests in the group and two affiliates, Dairy Farm and Mandarin Oriental. Last week Jardine companies announced they will follow Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic and de-list from the Hong Kong stock exchange, essentially over post-1997 concerns. The news coincided with an attack by China on the group calling for its removal from the proposed Container Terminal 9 project, which Beijing has yet to approve.</p>

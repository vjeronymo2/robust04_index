			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Samyah al-Jundi: "The State of America"] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton hardly mentioned foreign  policy in his State of the Union address last weekend. He only  noted the few achievements made in his first year in office,  specifically the North America Free Trade Agreement with Canada  and Mexico, the GATT Agreement, and increasing pressure on Asian  countries to open their markets and eliminate customs  restrictions on their imports. Apart form this, the speech  focused on domestic issues. There was disappointment for anyone  who expected the U.S. President to say something about his  latest tour of Europe and Russia, about his meeting with  President al-Asad in Geneva, and whether the tour added or  contributed to a clear U.S. view of the world, its problems, and  how to address them.    The world's problems disappeared in Clinton's address  despite  the aggravation of problems in volatile areas such as Bosnia and  Somalia and despite the doubts surrounding the reforms in Russia  and the increasing differences between the United States and its  Western allies over security and foreign policy. The drama of  President Clinton failing repeatedly to appoint a new defense  secretary to succeed Les Aspin added a new dimension to the  general picture formed over a year of Democrats' rule of the  extent of the confusion, division, and vacillation of actions,  goals, and concepts. Does the United States deal with  outstanding problems piecemeal? Is it trying to find a separate  solution to every problem? Will it intervene militarily where  things are hot and, if so, what is the extent and the limit of  such intervention? What is the United Nations' role and what  are its resources and ability to play such a role?    There are people who believe that President Clinton, after a  full year in office, appears less enthusiastic about confronting  his responsibilities as the first post-Cold War President of the  United States. There are others who believe that the Democratic  administration has not yet assimilated the changes on the world  map and lacks a clear view of the shape of the world order in  the long term and of the nature of the world map currently being  shaped, a map in which states and ministates are bracing  themselves to play an influential role in provoking wars and  making peace. It is expected that the world will continue to  see the United states vacillating on the road between the  Balkans and Somalia and Russia and its former empires without a  comprehensive framework for achieving peace based on a firm and  consistent basis.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: BBV ahead on operating level BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya, the big Spanish bank, yesterday reported reduced net profits for the first half of 1992, but said that ordinary banking business had shown solid improvement, Reuter reports from Madrid. The bank said the drop was partly due to the sale of some affiliates. Group operating profit rose 5.1 per cent to Pta46.9bn (Dollars 501.8m) thanks to a 20 per cent rise in fee income and a rise of only 3 per cent in operating costs. However, net profits were 13 per cent lower at Pta42.5bn reflecting a 1.9 per cent drop in net interest income and a decline of more than 50 per cent in extraordinary income to Pta9.4bn. The bank said the rise in operating costs was well below the industry average and reflected a rationalisation policy begun several years ago. The growth of non-performing loans had slowed over the past 18 months with virtually no increase in the first half of 1992, it said. The improved operating profits had enabled it to raise the first-quarter dividend to Pta38 a share from Pta36. Net interest income had been affected by the sale of Banco de Credito y Ahorro and Banco de Extremadura in the first half of 1991, it added. Group assets rose to Pta9,300bn at end-June, while loans came to Pta4,200bn.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSTAS SICK, BUT ENBERG DOES IT ALL  </P> <P> NBC's Dick Enberg was pressed into double duty Sunday when Bob Costas came down  with a severe case of the flu.  </P> <P> Costas was so sick Sunday morning that he checked himself into a Denver  hospital.  </P> <P> Enberg, besides calling the game, also had to take Costas' place on the pregame  and postgame shows.  </P> <P> Then Ralph Wiley, who was scheduled to conduct postgame interviews in the  Cleveland locker room, was stricken with the flu during the game.  </P> <P> Jim Donovan, who does play-by-play for NBC on a part-time basis and works for  the NBC affiliate in Cleveland, filled in for Wiley.  </P> <P> Donovan fared better than O.J. Simpson, who could not remember Denver running  back Sammy Winder's name during a postgame interview with quarterback John  Elway.  </P> <P> "Talk us through this touchdown pass to James Wa, Wa . . . Winder," Simpson  said.  </P> <P> "Who's it to?" Elway said.  </P> <P> During his interview of Michael Young, Simpson congratulated the former Bruin  and Ram on his 60-yard touchdown reception. It was 70 yards. LARRY STEWART  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jelena Dabarcic from Gorazde region] </F>   [Text] A turnabout took place on the section of the  battlefields between Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca yesterday.  Serbian fighters who managed to break up the strong Muslim  offensive from Gorazde, despite cold weather today continued  expelling Muslim soldiers from the remaining bunkers and  strongholds in the direction of Viskovici and Gorazde. A  veritable chaos is reigning in the units of the so-called Army  of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this region and some mutual showdowns  have taken place among them, that is, between those people who  want to cross the Drina from its right bank to the left bank and  the police forces who are making this impossible. Fighters from  the units of the army of the Srpska republic are very carefully  clearing the minefields that the Muslims have set everywhere.    Major Andjelko Milicevic from the Command of the Joint  Serbian Forces said this morning that Serbian fighters, starting  from the directions of (Faljika) and Trebinjaca yesterday  neutralized all enemy's firing positions without having suffered  any losses themselves and took control over some typically  Serbian places that were occupied by Islamic fanatics. The  Serbian village of (Kirin), only half a kilometer away from  Viskovici, was thereby liberated.    The Command of the Joint Serbian Forces points out that the  Muslim Army has suffered great losses, thereby denying Muslim  [Sarajevo] radio reports that there were casualties among  civilians.</p>

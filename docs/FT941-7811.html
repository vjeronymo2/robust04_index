			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protectorate for Bosnia Sir, Now that the siege of Sarajevo looks like being fully lifted, it is time for the international community to move into other areas. For more than a year our organisation has been promoting the idea of a United Nations Transitional Authority for Bosnia (similar to the UNTAC operation in Cambodia). Last year at the Geneva talks it was agreed by all sides in the conflict to establish a UN Protectorate in Sarajevo and an EU protectorate in Mostar. Unfortunately, the establishment of these protectorates was tied in with an overall peace settlement, but surely now is the time for a 'de-linking' from an overall settlement and for those protectorates to be put in place now. The idea of a UN administration seems to be gradually dawning on people both within the UN itself and also in the outside world. Such an idea is a sensible and practical way of ending the conflict and should be pursued by the international community. Tony Bloomfield, European Dialogue, 11 Goodwin Street, London N4 3HQ</p>

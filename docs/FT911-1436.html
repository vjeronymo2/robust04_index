			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Leading Article: The aftermath of the G7 SHOULD COUNTRIES pursue 'low inflationary' or 'non-inflationary' growth? That was the question for debate during this week's meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven largest industrial countries in Washington. 'Low inflationary growth,' said the US; 'non-inflationary growth,' said the Germans, with conviction, and the British with exaggerated piety. The result was predictable: the countries agreed to differ. But even though the rest of the G7 did not accede to American pressure at the time, the US is likely to get the interest rate cuts it wants. The US administration may have failed to convince the G7 that the world is on the verge of a global slump, but it did persuade the Federal Reserve to cut the discount rate by half a percentage point to 5 1/2 per cent last Tuesday, for the third time since December. Whether the Federal Reserve was wise to yield to the pressure is another matter, especially given the long lags associated with changes in interest rates. The US economy is undoubtedly in a troubling recession with manufacturing orders and retail sales depressed. But spring has brought faint signs of recovery. Modest increases in consumer spending and new house sales, a rise in the purchasing managers index, and yesterday's news of a smaller than expected fall in employment in April, suggest that the worst may be over. The risk for the US over the coming year is that 'high inflationary' rather than 'low inflationary' growth will be the consequence of last week's wrangling. Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gives the appearance of having caved in under political pressure. Even if the cut was justified on economic grounds, its timing does not add to the credibility of the Federal Reserve - and in central banking appearances matter quite as much as reality. Bonn's resistance Germany's refusal to cave in to pressure for lower interest rates may, paradoxically, bring future cuts in German rates forward. At least the rally of the D-Mark against the dollar, which followed the cut in US interest rates cut, removed any remaining risk of a further rise in German rates at last Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's council. Merely maintaining the current tight monetary policy in Germany should be sufficient to persuade wage bargainers of the Bundesbank's view that high wage claims will raise unemployment. Similarly the Bank of Japan may be happier to cut Japanese interest rates sooner rather than later, now that it will no longer give the appearance of responding to external pressure. France, Italy and the UK may also be able to cut interest rates further over the coming months. Until recently the strength of the D-Mark in the exchange rate system, combined with the general unwillingness to countenance a realignment within the ERM, made such cuts difficult. Since the risk of a further rise in German interest rates is declining, while the D-Mark remains weak, further interest rate cuts are now feasible. UK caution Whether such cuts would be desirable is another question. The UK at least must be cautious. While headline retail price inflation is set to fall sharply over the coming months, underlying inflation appears stuck at over 7 per cent, while pay settlements show no signs of significant declines, despite rapidly rising unemployment. Clear signs that underlying inflation is falling are a precondition for significant further cuts in interest rates. As in the US, there is a danger that further cuts in interest rates now risk a bout of inflationary growth next year. The difference between 'low' and 'non-inflationary' growth must seem academic to Conservative backbenchers, now analysing the impact of the Conservatives' miserable performance in Thursday's local elections upon their electoral prospects. Despite Mr Norman Lamont's optimistic predictions that recovery is just round the corner, the UK economy still shows no growth to speak of, but plenty of inflation. The fancy of a June election must now have vanished from the prime minister's mind. But economic recovery needs to begin this year if the Tories are to have a good chance of forming the next government. The rise in business confidence indicated in the latest Confederation of British Industry Quarterly Survey suggests that a recovery of some kind may materialise. However, the recession has already proved very damaging: the survey also shows that companies are planning further cuts in spending on capital investment and on product and process innovation over the coming year. Mr Lamont held out for non-inflationary growth in Washington. Yet he will be fortunate to deliver much in the way of growth before the election, let alone growth without inflation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A source in the Armed Forces Command has ridiculed  the statement put out by a responsible source in the Transport  Ministry broadcast by Sanaa radio this evening. The source said  the al-Ahmar gang are in a difficult position now and are  accordingly incapable of threatening Democratic Republic of  Yemen [DRY] sea ports and airports. The DRY Armed Forces are in  total control of all the Republic's sea ports and airports, and  can fully guarantee the security of these seaports and airports  and all the services they supply to all ships and aircraft.</p>

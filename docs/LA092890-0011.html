Hughes (D-Los Angeles) was needed to accomplish the goal.  </P> <P> "Our schools are aware of the importance of this instruction," Deukmejian said,  "and are responding appropriately without the additional programs and mandated  local costs that this bill would create."  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> * Issued a proclamation designating Oct. 1-5 as Rideshare Week.  </P> <P> * Tax Credit: SB 2208 by Sen.

Connelly (D-Sacramento) to require the  state Department of Health Services to set up a program to inspect and test  tableware for unsafe lead levels before public sale.  </P> <P> * Pap Smears: AB 2542 by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) to require  health insurance plans to include coverage for annual Pap tests used to detect  cervical cancer in women.  </P> <P> Bills Vetoed  </P> <P> * College Tuition: AB 500 by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) to allow  families to save for their children's future college tuition by purchasing  municipal bonds in small denominations.

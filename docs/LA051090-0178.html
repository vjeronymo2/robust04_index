			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCK STOPS WITH LAKERS;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: THEY TAKE BLAME FOR FOURTH-QUARTER BREAKDOWN, DURING WHICH THEY  MADE FOUR OF 19 SHOTS.  </P> <P> A short jump shot by Laker forward James Worthy late in the third quarter  Tuesday night looked as if it would fall short. But rather than passively  following the ball's flight, Worthy all but scared it into the basket with his  deep, threatening voice.  </P> <P> "Get in there," Worthy grumbled. The ball obliged.  </P> <P> But all the coaxing by Worthy could not prevent a surprising fourth-quarter  offensive collapse that led to a 104-102 loss to the Phoenix Suns in Game 1 of  the NBA Western Conference semifinal series.  </P> <P> The Lakers went the final 3 minutes 40 seconds without making a basket. They  made only four of 19 shots in the fourth quarter, blowing an eight-point lead  in the last nine minutes. Worthy missed all of his six shots in the fourth  quarter, Magic Johnson made only one of five shots and Byron Scott missed his  only shot in the final eight minutes.  </P> <P> The unraveling was neither pretty nor common. The Suns' defense, which included  Kurt Rambis on Worthy and Dan Majerle or Jeff Hornacek on Johnson, was only  partly responsible.  </P> <P> The Lakers blamed themselves. They said they lacked patience, had lapses of  composure and simply took the first, instead of the best, shot they had.  </P> <P> Wednesday, the Lakers gathered at the Forum to review their inadequacies on  videotape in hopes of avoiding another collapse against the Suns tonight in  Game 2. "We watched (the fourth quarter) over and over and over again," forward  Orlando Woolridge said. "I think we learned from that. That's not like us. We  have such good players that sometimes we feel we don't have to execute."  </P> <P> This is not the first time the Lakers have folded in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> In finishing with an NBA-best 63 regular-season victories, the Lakers had to  come from behind on numerous occasions. But they had a memorable home-court  collapse against the Detroit Pistons, failing to score a basket for the final  eight minutes and getting shut out in overtime. And they lost Game 3 of the  series against the Houston Rockets after making five of 18 fourth-quarter  shots.  </P> <P> "Even the great teams, it happens to them sometimes," Sun Coach Cotton  Fitzsimmons said. "I'm not going to say either way, whether it was us or them.  But how many times is James going to go 0 for six and Magic one for five?  That's not going to happen a lot. We're not bragging about it. We're just  playing. But we do believe in ourselves."  </P> <P> Laker Coach Pat Riley watched in seeming disbelief Tuesday night. He emerged  Wednesday in a feisty mood.  </P> <P> "Four out of 19 is not going to beat anybody," Riley said. "You can't make  assumptions that, because you are at home, good things are going to happen. Our  failure to execute and be patient got (the Suns) even. What happens is you get  a little frustrated and you lose the discipline. We knew what we had to do. We  worked on it for three days in practice. We did not do it.  </P> <P> "(Laker players) should be upset with themselves. We had an eight-point lead  and some nice moments and chances to really open up a lead in the third  quarter. We could've had a 13-, 15-point lead had we made a couple proper  decisions.  </P> <P> "They should be disappointed in themselves in how they executed and their  impatience on offense in the last eight minutes of game."  </P> <P> Riley said the Lakers held a "nice film session" to hash out their problems. If  Laker players were not aware of their fourth-quarter transgressions before,  Riley kept hitting the rewind button.  </P> <P> In the final 8:11, the Lakers committed three turnovers and had a curious  selection of shots. Worthy had an inside shot blocked by Tom Chambers, Magic  Johnson an inside shot blocked by Eddie Johnson. Scott missed an open  three-point shot, Woolridge missed a jump shot from the top of the key, Worthy  missed two jump shots under pressure and another while crossing the lane with  1:01 to play. Worthy also was pressured into taking an off-balance running jump  shot with five seconds left that was not close.  </P> <P> "We didn't execute," Worthy said. "We were quick-shooting everything. We've got  to play 48 minutes."  </P> <P> What may have been most troublesome -- and surprising -- to the Lakers was  their lack of patience when the Suns rallied.  </P> <P> "We played like a first-year playoff team," center Mychal Thompson said. "It  wasn't us out there. We've got to play with intelligence in the fourth quarter.  We rushed the offense and got too anxious. Is that the Lakers?"  </P> <P> It certainly was the same Phoenix defense the Lakers have faced so often, but  they could not handle the Suns' constant pressure.  </P> <P> Fitzsimmons had used Chambers almost exclusively against Worthy the last two  seasons. In Game 1, however, the more-physical Rambis guarded Worthy until late  in the fourth quarter, when Chambers took over. Worthy led the Lakers with 22  points, but made only nine of 26 shots. Neither Rambis, the former Laker, nor  Fitzsimmons wanted credit for controlling Worthy.  </P> <P> Said Rambis: "I guarded him just like everybody else would -- try to push him  as far away from the post as possible and then scream for help. It's really not  Worthy against Rambis. It's Worthy against the Phoenix Suns."  </P> <P> Added Fitzsimmons, who watched Worthy average a Laker-high 25 points against  the Suns in last season's playoff series: "I think Kurt did a nice job on him,  played him hard. . . . Kurt is a thinker, very defensive-minded. If you're  going to play a guy like Worthy, you've got to be a thinker. Kurt knows Worthy,  what he likes to do best. That doesn't mean he's going to stop him, but it can  help."  </P> <P> Riley said he hopes the Suns use Rambis, who is slower but stronger than  Chambers, on Worthy tonight.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying Kurt is not an excellent post defensive player -- he is -- but  I think James has quickness and can do a better job."  </P> <P> Hornacek and Majerle, among others, took shifts in applying the tight defense  that kept the ball away from Magic Johnson, who made four of 14 shots.  </P> <P> "(Phoenix's defense is) not any tougher than Houston's or 82 other games this  year," Riley said. "Earvin's used to it. He knows it. He knows what he has to  do. Last night, I thought it was a relief, I really do. They didn't come and  trap him and double-team him."  </P> <P> Said Johnson: "They are trying to wear me down, like most teams do. I just have  to get into it more."  </P> <P> Distraught as Riley was about the Lakers' offensive problems, the coach said he  was reasonably pleased with his team's defense.  </P> <P> The Lakers concentrated on controlling point guard Kevin Johnson (nine points,  12 assists) and shooters Eddie Johnson (four of 12) and Chambers (10 of 26) at  the expense of center Mark West.  </P> <P> West, occasionally left unguarded when Laker big men double-teamed players with  the ball, made the Lakers pay. He scored 24 points, had 16 rebounds and blocked  seven shots.  </P> <P> "It was not an aberration," Riley said of West. "You've got to give (West)  credit. He was definitely a difference. I thought for the most part we defended  efficiently enough to win. But our offense put a lot of pressure on our  defense."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Cotton wore cotton, and the Suns finally ended two long Forum losing streaks  Tuesday night. So, Sun Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said he again plans to wear the  cotton-knit golf shirt he borrowed from trainer Joe Proski after he left his  white dress shirt at the team's hotel Tuesday night. The Suns had lost 21  consecutive games in the Forum, and Fitzsimmons, who had lost 37 in a row  there, gave partial credit to Proski's golf shirt. "I think it's the shirt,"  Fitzsimmons said after Tuesday's game. "I may keep this shirt forever."  </P> <P> Sun point guard Kevin Johnson, who attempted only seven shots in 45 minutes, is  playing with a hip pointer and did not appear to make have his usual quick  bursts toward the basket. "It's affecting him," Fitzsimmons said, "but you do  what you have to do. But let's give Byron Scott credit. Scott did a great job  on him." Johnson said his hip is not hampering his play. "That's Cotton just  trying to protect a player," Johnson said. "I'm smart enough to know what it  takes to win. The other players were doing it (Tuesday). It's important to us  to have everyone involved." . . . Fitzsimmons segued into his thickest,  down-home style when asked what he expects from the Lakers tonight. "I expect  the Lakers to come back with fire in their nostrils," he said, "coming at us as  strong as a freight train can come at you. There'll be no surprises with the  Lakers, I tell you that."  </P></p>

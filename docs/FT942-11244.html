			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Gonzalez pledges to fight on: Ministerial resignations deal heavy blow to Spanish PM Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, stated firmly yesterday that he intended to maintain his hold on government and to tackle the corruption cases at the source of the country's political crisis. He said it would be 'an irresponsible act' to resign and rejected a snap election. He was nevertheless badly wounded when his former finance minister and political soul-mate, Mr Carlos Solchaga, quit as leader of the ruling Socialist parliamentary party and resigned his seat in the Cortes. Mr Solchaga's appointment last year was an important element in Mr Gonzalez's effort to weaken the grip leftwing Socialists had enjoyed over the parliamentary party for more than a decade. His position had been called into question because of his staunch backing, as finance minister, for Mr Mariano Rubio, the former Bank of Spain governor who now faces fraud charges. Mr Gonzalez's statement, broadcast live on television and radio, came after reassurances from Catalan and Basque region-al parties that they did not intend to destabilise the minority Socialist government. His appearance brought relief to nervous securities and foreign exchange markets. The Madrid general share index rose 1.5 per cent, regaining most of the ground lost on Wednesday because of the crisis, and the peseta recovered somewhat after falling sharply against the dollar and D-Mark. Mr Gonzalez rejected the idea of a wider cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of his interior and agriculture ministers in connection with corruption scandals. Mr Rubio and Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former stock exchange head who handled his investment portfolio, were remanded in custody without bail at Madrid's Carabanchel prison yesterday. A former interior minister, and close Gonzalez ally, Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, also resigned his parliamentary seat yesterday because of his connection with Mr Luis Roldan, ex-chief of the paramilitary Guardia Civil, who went missing last Friday. An international arrest warrant has been issued for Mr Roldan alleging tax fraud, bribery, misappropriation and other offences. The latest resignations will not affect the parliamentary balance since the Spanish system provides for the seats to be filled by the same party. Mr Gonzalez held talks early yesterday in Madrid with Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalist party on whose support the Socialists rely to carry a majority in parliament. He assured Mr Pujol the government would press ahead with a free-market economic programme and combat corruption. Mr Juan Alberto Belloch, 44-year-old justice minister, was appointed to take over the interior ministry in a combined portfolio. The new agriculture minister is Mr Lus Atienza, 36, now undersecretary for energy. Markets recover, Page 2 Bonds, Page 31; Currencies, Page 33; World stocks, Page 39</p>

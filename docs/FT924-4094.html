			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UN action on nutrition THE INTERNATIONAL community is likely to place greater emphasis on nutrition in combating hunger and poverty as a result of a UN-sponsored conference which opens in Rome tomorrow. The seven-day International Conference on Nutrition is the first time the UN's resources in the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation have been pooled on such a scale in the struggle to eliminate hunger and reduce malnutrition. The conference, at which 150 countries will be represented at ministerial level, will absorb Dollars 6.9m in UN funds. It will produce no binding resolutions, but the draft declaration contains an ambitious commitment to reduce starvation and famine.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY SHEARER  </P> <P> Shearer is just one of the many citizens who makes the job of parking  enforcement a thankless and sometimes dangerous job.  </P> <P> Most officers hate tow-away calls more than anything. They waste a great deal  of time waiting for the tow truck to arrive and for the information to reach  them covering the vehicle, and then the "dreaded" report to do. Contrary to  public belief there are no Brownie points for this.  </P> <P> Place the blame where it belongs -- not on the shoulders of the officers.  Remember, the officer is only executing the law that you, the public, make.  </P> <P> L. H. MANDA  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

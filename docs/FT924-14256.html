			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Gardening: The charms of finding a stranger in your bed - Chance seedlings can be worth encouraging I HAVE a weakness for self-sown shrubs which bear the prospect of being different. Cotoneasters are one, along with buddleias and the deciduous varieties of euonymus. I am constantly finding cotoneaster seedlings in the strangest places, coming out of crevices in walls or wedged against the bole of a tree where they have been missed by the lawnmower. With some species, you can be fairly certain from the outset about what these seedlings are and their potential quality. Seedlings of C. horizontalis are of this kind; in my experience, they always have the same fishbone style of branching, ready to mould themselves to any firm surface whether it be a wall, fence or tree stump, or to spread outwards over the ground, layer upon layer. Usually, these seedlings differ only in the quality of their flowers and berries, and in their ability to turn vivid shades of yellow, orange and red in the autumn before the leaves fall. Evergreen C. microphyllus is also one that is regular in character. Its leaves are very small and dark green, its berries crimson, and its humped stems excellent at moulding themselves over low walls or large rocks. A little less certain is C. conspicuus, an evergreen species from Tibet which always makes a dome-shaped bush but can vary greatly in ultimate size and also in its ability to produce regular crops of scarlet fruits. At its best it is superb and, though the berries look so good, birds shun them; thus, they usually hang on well into the new year. C. franchetii is totally different. It has long, flexible stems which arch outwards all around it, eventually making a big, loose bush with tapering evergreen leaves. From September on, it produces heavy crops of fruits born in clusters. There is a form of it which, for many years, I called C. wardii - until I read that the true bearer of this name was unlikely to be in cultivation and that the plants really are C. sternianus. As the leaves become old they turn orange, and the bush is among the brightest in the garden, but this is a quality that can differ from one seedling to another. C. salicifolius identifies itself by its long, narrow leaves, like those of a willow but evergreen. It can be 10 to 15 ft high and as much in diameter, so that a chance seed that decides to germinate in the middle of a flower border can become an embarrassment in a few years. But this is a very variable plant in size and habit, and some of its seedlings are sufficiently dense and low to be used as ground cover. This excellent species does not seem to be quite certain whether it is evergreen or deciduous, but this might be because it crosses readily with other species, including C. frigidus which does lose its leaves in winter. If, like me, you let chance seedlings stay out of curiosity, it could well be that what you are calling a species is, in fact, a garden mongrel. This bothers me only when visitors press for instant names and I have to confess I am not sure. A very fine cotoneaster named watereri is rated officially as a hybrid between C. frigidus and an evergreen species named C. henryanus. This is said to have appeared as a chance seedling from C. frigidus in the Bagshot, Surrey, nursery of John Waterer &amp; Sons. A selected form of it, kept true to type by being grown from cuttings, is still sold as C. John Waterer. This is the kind of plant you should get if you do not want to play around with the uncertainty of seedlings. I think that, basically, gardeners are of two kinds: those who bother a lot about purity of variety and correct naming, and those who find it rather fun to have plants which are beautiful but which they are unable to identify precisely. C. dielsianus is a true species that is very free with its seedlings. It is deciduous and its long stems arch gracefully outwards. There is a seedling of it in my garden which I intend to remove as soon as it has lost its berries because it is taking up too much room and interfering with the grass mowing. I could prune it, but that would spoil its shape. So, I am content to let it go as there are others like it elsewhere. The lowest growing of the cotoneaster is dammeri, which covers the ground with a carpet of evergreen leaves although it is only dwarf in height. Sideways, it seems capable of going on forever, rooting into the soil as it grows. It is a favourite with landscapers, who use it to cover banks and also to smother weeds. I do not grow it and cannot say how it fares from seed, but I doubt there is a lot of variation. There is, however, a variety named Skogholm which is at least twice the height of the type plant. In the beginning, this probably was just another of those chance seedlings that was left to see how it would fare. But there might from the outset have been some hint of difference that aroused curiosity. That is the way a good many fine plants originate.</p>

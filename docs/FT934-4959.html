			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Finnair expects to halve losses Finnair, the Finnish national airline, expects to reach its target for this year of a halved group loss, Reuter reports from Helsinki. For the first six months to September, Finnair's performance was better than expected, said Mr Antti Potilla, chief executive yesterday. As a result 'it has been possible to slightly raise the forecast for the financial year'. The first-half result, after financial items, was a profit of FM89.8m (Dollars 15.7m), compared to a loss of FM197m in the same period a year ago.</p>

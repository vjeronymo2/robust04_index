			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese exporters sold after rise in yen A SHARP rise in the yen against the dollar prompted selling in export-related issues and share prices lost ground as cautious investors refrained from activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average shed 259.46 to 17,022.27, having opened at the day's high of 17,261.56. The index recorded the day's low of 16,976.72 on investment trust and arbitrage selling in the afternoon before recovering to the 17,000 level on buying by corporate investors at the end of the session. Volume declined to 190m shares from 203m. Losers led gainers by 769 to 183, with 165 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 13.49 to 1,296.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.92 to 1,046.93. Equities initially met selling from investment trusts and arbitrageurs, before the yen jumped against the dollar on reports that Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, of the US, had said at a seminar in Kyoto that the desirable range for the yen was Y100 to Y110 against the dollar. Reports that European Community leaders were calling for a reduction in Japan's trade surplus also accelerated buying of the yen. The currency rose to an intraday high of Y121.95 against the dollar, before closing at Y122.35. The dollar fell below the Y122 level for the first time since October 28 last year. Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, slipped Y7 to Y374 on profit-taking by dealers, while shares bought on the 'restructuring theme' also declined as investors took profits: Oki Electric receded Y15 to Y395 and Nissan Chemical retreated Y5 to Y750. High-technology exporters lost ground on earnings worries due to the higher yen. Fujitsu weakened Y12 to Y547, NEC Y15 to Y637 and Hitachi Y14 to Y707. Uni-Charm, leading diaper maker, appreciated Y20 to Y1,780 on hopes of a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year to March. Dainippon Screen, a precision machinery maker, posted its third consecutive advance, rising Y13 to Y653. Individual investors sought the issue on hopes of strong sales for its semiconductor manufacturing equipment and liquid crystal displays. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 164.97 to 18,496.56 in volume of 59.5m shares. Roundup TRADING was quiet throughout much of the region, although Sydney provided a bright spot. AUSTRALIA moved sharply higher after Prime Minister Paul Keating announced plans to cut company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent; subsequent profit-taking pared the gains. The All Ordinaries index, which rose 50 points to a six-month intraday high of 1,609 on the government's statement, ended 24.5 up at 1,583.9 in heavy turnover of ADollars 486.6m. The other highlight of trade was an ADollars 1.20 rise by News Corporation at ADollars 29.90 after touching a record ADollars 31.18 on announcing interim net profits up 27.5 per cent. HONG KONG saw some early excitement which took the Hang Seng index more than 20 points higher on reports, subsequently denied, that China and Britain would resume talks on the colony's future next month. Later trading lacked impetus and the index eased back to end just 2.87 ahead at 5,789.52 in thin volume of HKDollars 1.57bn. SINGAPORE was modestly firmer after a quiet day as investors awaited details of the government's proposed goods and services tax, announced after the market closed. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 8.79 at 1,624.52 as late bargain hunting reversed early losses. KUALA LUMPUR edged lower on profit-taking after the recent surge. The composite index lost 1.63 to 639.97. A two-day meeting of Malaysia's hereditary rulers, beginning today, over constitutional amendments to remove their legal immunity also made investors cautious. Technology Resources rose 30 cents to MDollars 2.09 in turnover of 35.4m shares after news that it will distribute shares in its Malaysian Helicopter unit free to shareholders. BOMBAY climbed again on speculative pre-budget buying, the BSE index finishing 59.53 stronger at 2,771.68.</p>

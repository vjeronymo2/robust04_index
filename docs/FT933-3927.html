			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses differ in reaction to cut in German rates THE Bundesbank's rate cut had generally been anticipated and bourses saw a mixture of performances, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT responded to the news from the Bundesbank with a slight fall, which some traders attributed to the strengthening of the D-Mark against the US dollar. The DAX index ended the session off 4.48 at 1,880.81, and in the post-bourse slipped to 1,870.53. Turnover dropped to DM6.8bn from DM7bn. The market has been undergoing a correction since hitting a peak at the end of last month, which came at the end of a three-month rally in equities. Mr James Cornish, European strategist at NatWest Securities in London, remained positive on the outlook for the German market, both in the short and long term. With economic fundamentals showing signs of improvement and expectations that recovery was underway, he said, the prospect for corporate earnings looked good through 1994 and 1995. He remained fully weighted in the German market, he said. Among the stocks, Daimler lost DM9 to DM718.50, Siemens fell by DM2 to DM658 and Volkswagen by DM2.10 to DM360.80. PARIS was disappointed by the lack of a cut in the intervention rate, in spite of an easing in the 5-10 day rate. The market is looking for the authorities to make a move on the former by Monday at the latest. The CAC-40 index, which at one point had risen to 2,146, closed down 20.69 or 1 per cent at 2,108.75. Turnover was moderate at FFr4.6bn. The recent batch of disappointing corporate results was also affecting investor sentiment. There were some large falls among index stocks, with Legrand down FFr269 or 5.5 per cent at FFr4,625 ahead of interim results which are due today. Canal Plus lost FFr57 or 4.4 per cent to FFr1,248 on a brokers downgrade, while dollar weakness affected the likes of Rhone Poulenc , off FFr5.10 to FFr147, and Euro Disney, down FFr1.80 at FFr62.35. AMSTERDAM rose slightly after several days of declines, the CBS Tendency index up 0.6 at 124.5. Amev gained FL 3.30 to Fl 72.50 after parent group Fortis issued good half year results, while Bols Wessanen lost 20 cents to Fl 42.00 on disappointing interim profits. ZURICH registered some disappointment at the absence of a cut in Swiss interest rates and the SMI index fell 15.8 to 2,382.1. Nestle registered shares eased SFr2 to SFr1,070 in spite of a 6 per cent rise in first half consolidated net profits, which was at the top end of expectations. MILAN clawed its way back from a weak opening after the Bank of Italy cut the discount rate and the Comit index finished 1.54 easier at 592.64. The market had opened under pressure from a flood of sales by individual investors following local press reports, later denied by the finance minister, that the government was considering reintroducing capital gains taxation on share trades. The Bank of Italy's move on rates came as little surprise in the wake of the German reduction, although many investors had expected the authorities to hold back an announcement until the government won parliamentary approval for its 1994 budget plans in a vote expected after the market had closed. Among banks, San Paolo attracted a number of large buy orders which took the price L900 or 8.7 per cent higher to L11,190. Ferruzzi continued on its idiosyncratic way, climbing another L45 or 9.9 per cent to L497.75, for a rise this week of 46 per cent. STOCKHOLM strengthened during the session with the Affarsvarlden general index rising 9.7 to 1,281.8 in turnover fo SKr1.4bn. ATHENS fell 6.9 per cent as it became clear that the government had, after all, lost its majority in parliament and an early election was called. The general index fell 59.3 to 801.85. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London said: 'Over the longer term, the economic fundamentals will not change greatly, irrespective of who is in power. There is bound to be nervousness and the market will fall further, but that will provide opportunities for investors to start buying selected stocks again.'

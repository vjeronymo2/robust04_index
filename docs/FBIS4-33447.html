			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Demetrio Villa Urrutia from Cartagena for the </F> "Doing Radio" newscast]    [Excerpts] The 10-person Cuban delegation that will handle  the Ibero- American summit on 14-15 June arrived in Cartagena 48  hours ago. [passage omitted]    The first official activity before the Ibero-American summit  concluded this weekend; it was the scientific conference on  sustainable development. Our chief representative was Dr. Rosa  Elena Simeon Negrin, minister of science, technology, and  environment.    The conference mainly sought to review the formation of  human  resources, financing, and the ways to prepare Latin America for  the area's integration. Precisely the issues of integration,  economy, and trade will be the main issues to be discussed in  this fourth version of the Ibero-American summit. [passage  omited]    Shortly before her departure, Comrade Rosa Elena Simeon made  some statements to the Cuban media delegation, which is here to  assess the event and its topics. Here is a small fragment of  Comrade Rosa Elena Simeon's statement:    [Begin Simeon recording] Emphasis has been placed on  something throughout the debate and the three roundtables:  Research work must be guaranteed sustained financing. What do  we call sustained financing per se? We mean it must have  continuity. That is the experience in our country, which today  invests $25 per inhabitant. The revolution has made an  extraordinary effort in the formation of human resources  throughout the history of the revolution and today we can enjoy  the results. You cannot invest in the research sector and then  fail to give it continuity. That investment is not recovered in  the short term. This entails medium term and long term  investments.

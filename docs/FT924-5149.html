			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance ministers to attend EC summit MR Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, and other European Community finance ministers will take part in the EC summit in Edinburgh in two weeks, reflecting the growing importance of economic issues in the remaining weeks of the UK presidency, Peter Norman, Economics Editor, writes. The finance ministers' presence will be a break with EC tradition. But the UK's proposals for financing the EC budget over the next seven years and the search for an economic growth policy for Europe have persuaded Britain to invite finance ministers. Recent upheavals in the European exchange rate mechanism and the future of the community's plan for economic and monetary union are likely to be discussed at the summit. The heads of government and foreign ministers would be able to draw on the expertise of finance ministers. UK Treasury officials confirmed that Mr Lamont would be in Edinburgh. Most other EC finance ministers are expected to attend.</p>

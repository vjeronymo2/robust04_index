			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Pay deal reached with unions in eastern Germany THE STRIKES which have threatened to paralyse industry in eastern Germany are likely to be called off next week after unions and employers reached a compromise yesterday on pay rises. Agreement was reached in principle on equalising pay rates between east and west German workers by 1996, instead of 1994 as promised in an earlier agreement. The deal followed 21 hours of negotiations in the Saxon capital of Dresden between Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, and IG Metall, the engineering union. There was relief in Bonn that the prospect of a prolonged and damaging dispute had been averted. But the deal will significantly increase wage costs for eastern industry, already uncompetitive, and could have a damaging effect on foreign investment in the region. The strikes have already affected more than 90 enterprises and 40,000 workers. The union will ballot its members in the five eastern German states early next week, using the Saxony compromise as a basis. The strikes, the first in eastern Germany for more than 60 years, were aimed at forcing employers to reinstate a contract, signed with the union in March 1991 which would have equalised western and eastern German wages next year. This would have meant pay increases of 26 per cent for eastern Germany's metal and electrical sectors, and 21 per pay rises for its steel sector. Eastern German wages are currently about 68 per cent of western German levels. The employers said they pulled out of the contract because of deteriorating economic conditions nationally and persistent low levels of productivity in the east, which lag behind the west by about 70 per cent. IG Metall accused employers of breaking the contract to erode the traditional system of collective wage bargaining, and turn eastern Germany into a low-wage economy. Yesterday's agreement, mediated by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of Saxony, reinstates the principle of the contract, but in a substantially modified form. Income parity has been put back to mid-1996. At the same time, eastern German wages will rise to 80 per cent of western German levels by next December, instead of last April. These pay increases will be phased in on July 1, when they will rise to 75 per cent, and to 77 per cent on September 1. In practice, they reflect an annual pay increase of about 15 per cent. Gesamtmetall, which had said it would never reinstate the principle of the contract, also failed to obtain an unconditional 'opt-out' clause for enterprises that could not afford to pay these increases. Instead, they will negotiate at local level. Neither side appeared jubilant. Mr Hans Peter Munter. Gesamt-metall's main negotiator, said the agreement 'was a painful compromise'. Analysis, Page 2</p>

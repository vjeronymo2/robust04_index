			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Union [EU] Commission decided tonight  to postpone adopting any decision against Greece for the  measures the latter took against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Our Brussels correspondent  Nikolaos Belos has the following dispatch.    [Begin Belos recording] The EU Commission will not take  Greece to the European Court for its measures against Skopje  before the conclusion of mediation efforts by Commissioner Hans  Van Den Broek. This decision was made after a long debate at  today's meeting of the EU Commission, during which political  issues prevailed over legal and trade issues.    According to a statement by the spokesman of Commission  President Jacques Delors, all aspects of the issue--political,  legal, and trade--were discussed during the debate. The  spokesman said: It was decided to continue the mediation  efforts of Van Den Broek, who will discuss the issue with  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias tomorrow in Israel.  Responding to a question, the spokesman also stressed that Van  Den Broek does not plan any meetings with the Skopjeans for the  time being. In conclusion, the spokesman emphasized that until  Wednesday, when the issue will be discussed again at a  Commission meeting, the commissioners authorized Commission  President Jacques Delors and Van Den Broek to make the necessary  decision on how to handle the issue.    The debate on the legal and trade aspects of the Greek  measures was conducted on the basis of an opinion by the  Commission's Legal Department given to the commissioners.  According to reports, the Legal Department reported that it can  justify a court case against Greece.    In his intervention during the discussion, Greek  Commissioner  Ioannis Palaiokrassas referred to the historic aspects of the  issue and to continuous Skopjean provocations against Greece.    Finally, it has been learned that Greece's measures against  Skopje will be discussed in Brussels on Monday during the EU  foreign ministers meeting. [end recording]</p>

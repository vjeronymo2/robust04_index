			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Falling whisky prices cut Burn Stewart to Pounds 4.2m Falling whisky prices cut profits in half at Burn Stewart Distillers in the year to July 3. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 8.12m to Pounds 4.19m on sales ahead from Pounds 38m to Pounds 40.6m. Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, described the year as 'the most testing in the company's short history' following intense competition in the value-for-money sector. 'Price pressure is doing serious damage to our profitability.' Substantial changes had been made in company strategy, with the focus on whisky bottled in Scotland. Cased sales in the UK and export markets were 43 per cent ahead by volume, and the company no longer depended on bulk sales or a small group of customers. 'If they had sold at our 1991 bottled-in-Scotland prices profits would be at record levels,' said Mr Thornton. Of total sales by volume, only 18 per cent was accounted for by bulk exports  -an area where the company feels reluctant to compete because of intense price competition. Bottled-in-Scotland sales accounted for the rest, with 48 per cent going to own label customers and 34 per cent branded. While the overall reduction in average cased prices was 2 per cent, this concealed a cut of 11 per cent in own label prices. Mr Thornton said there was a growing realisation that price discounting could not go on forever, and he expected an improvement next year. Operating profits fell from Pounds 9.66m to Pounds 5.79m, reflecting increased costs of Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 28.3m) following investments in sales and marketing. The pre-tax figure included a gain of Pounds 298,000 from a disposal. Interest payable rose from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 1.9m. Earnings per share fell from 9.53p to 5.20p. The total dividend for the year is maintained at 5p, including an unchanged final of 3.3p.</p>

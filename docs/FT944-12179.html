			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (1): Dispassionate review of the evidence - This book deserves a much wider audience than the university students for whom it is primarily intended / British economic history 'THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OF BRITAIN SINCE 1700' Edited by Roderick Flood and Donald McCloskey Cambridge University Press Pounds 50, Volume 1, 1700-1860: 484 pages, Volume 2, 1860-1939:  510 pages, Volume 3, 1939-1992: 427 pages For the past 30 years, discussion about Britain's economic performance has been dominated by a sense of national failure. How could a country which once astonished the world with its industrial achievements have sunk so low? Some blame the legacy of the industrial revolution and the failure to adapt to German and American competition in the late 19th century. Others put more weight on inter-war protection and cartelisation, or on misplaced priorities after 1945, when resources which should have been devoted to industrial modernisation were spent on the welfare state. That there should be competing explanations is not surprising; the past two centuries of British economic history contain plenty of unresolved controversies and puzzles. But even if complete agreement among historians is unlikely, it should be possible to remove at least some of the misconceptions which pervade so much of the debate about British economic decline. That is why the second edition of The Economic History of Britain since 1700, edited by Floud and McCloskey, deserves a much wider audience than the university students for whom it is primarily intended. Substantially revised from the 1981 version and with the addition of a third volume which extends the story to 1992, the book brings together in an accessible way the work of 39 scholars on a range of topics which includes population trends and living standards, the growth of cities and the economics of the Empire. The third volume is inevitably less authoritative than the first two, but the book as a whole provides a dispassionate review of the evidence and a welcome readiness to put British experience in an international context. The starting point is the period leading up to the industrial revolution when Britain, more than any other nation, provided the incentives and institutional support which were necessary for sustained technological innovation. As Joel Mokyr writes: 'Ancient prejudices, which regarded intellectual efforts devoted to production as something unfit for decent gentlemen, though not quite dead, no longer dominated British society. It was becoming socially acceptable to make money from industry, and therefore from innovation'. Britain's strength was not so much in basic inventions, a large number of which originated in France, as in incremental improvement based largely on mechanical intuition and dexterity. Whereas French science was theoretical and abstract, the British approach was empirical, experimental and pragmatic. Did the emphasis on inspired tinkering contain the seeds of subsequent failure in industries which called for formal scientific and technical education? This is part of the wider issue of Britain's alleged over-commitment to the products of the first industrial revolution - textiles, iron, coal - and its lag in the newer activities such as electrical engineering and chemicals which came to the fore towards the end of the 19th century. But, as Knick Harley explains, Britain had a comparative advantage in these older products until well into the 20th century and close trading links with countries, chiefly outside Europe and the US, which had the largest demand for them. With Germany and the US protecting the new industries by tariffs and government support, Britain's pattern of trade and industrial specialisation before 1914 was a rational response to market circumstances. One of the consequences may have been a neglect, relative to Germany and the US, of the investment in human capital which the new industries required. But this hardly justifies the view that between 1870 and 1914 there was an entrepreneurial and organisational failure from which the economy never recovered. As Sidney Pollard shows, there were successes and failures during this period, but no general industrial decline. 'The entrepreneurs who had got to the top in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain could hold their own with the very best abroad'. Even in education, Pollard argues, substantial progress was made, including the creation of civic universities in Leeds, Sheffield and other cities. Admiration for the formal, state-directed German system 'overlooked the merits of the British voluntary and demand-led education, with its largely practical emphasis'. A more serious legacy of the industrial revolution may have been the system of employment relations whereby, as William Lazonick puts it, employers delegated control of the manufacturing process to skilled craftsmen. 'The authority and responsibility to manage the shop floor organisation of work provided in turn a basis for key groups of workers to form powerful trade unions that, through collective bargaining over the conditions of work and pay, consolidated craft control'. Employers, in effect, gave up the right to manage. That Britain's labour relations arrangements became a competitive handicap in some industries is not in doubt; more questionable is Lazonick's assertion that the 'root cause' of the country's inferior performance was the unwillingness of entrepreneurs to invest in 'modern managerial structures that could plan and co-ordinate shop floor work'. The failure before 1914 to build US-style managerial hierarchies was not unique to Britain and not necessarily a long-term source of weakness. Was it, then, the inter-war period that put in place, as Barry Eichengreen suggests, 'the shackles that prevented the British economy from keeping pace with its European competitors'? The first world war violently disrupted the structure of world trade and finance on which Britain had depended; the retreat into protectionism forced exporters to rely more heavily on Empire markets. At the same time 'mergers, collusion, cartelisation and protection may have insulated British manufacturers from the chill winds of domestic and foreign competition'. Yet the habit of collusion was even more deeply entrenched in Germany. Moreover, entrepreneurial dynamism was far from lacking in inter-war Britain. The chemical and electrical industries recovered from their earlier lag; the growth of the motor industry was impressive; and there was a promising start in electronics. Despite structural problems in older sectors, especially textiles, Britain remained a powerful industrial nation. So why did Britain fall behind in the 1950s and 1960s? Charles Feinstein argues persuasively that rapid growth in Germany, France and Italy 'owed far more to their low starting point than to any special merits of their particular economic and social arrangements'. According to his backwardness-convergence hypothesis, overtaken countries eventually respond to their changed circumstances, as Britain did in the 1980s. 'Established attitudes and ossified institutions will finally be recognised as barriers to progress, and will gradually be forced to make way for new and more efficient arrangements'. No doubt there is still a residue from Britain's industrial past which has to be cleared away. But it is probably a mistake to conflate the post-1945 story - an initial lag followed by partial modernisation - with Britain's loss of industrial dominance in the 19th century. Both episodes need to be analysed, as they are in this book, realistically and without nostalgia; neither should be a cause of national lamentation.</p>

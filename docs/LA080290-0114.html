			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> SUSPECT WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY ARRESTS  </P> <P> A suspected gang member was grazed by a bullet fired by a Santa Ana police  officer Wednesday, officials said.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old Anaheim youth was wounded about 12:30 p.m. at 5th Street and  Harbor Boulevard when he tried to elude police, who were searching for suspects  in connection with a drive-by shooting that left two Garden Grove teen-agers  with gunshot wounds in the legs.  </P> <P> The Anaheim youth was treated at the scene for the minor injury and taken into  custody on suspicion of attempted murder along with four other suspected gang  members.  </P> <P> "One suspect began to reach into his waistband and the officer, fearing for his  life, fired one shot, striking the suspect in the left arm," Santa Ana police  spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Police said two other suspects involved in the  incident were still at large.  </P> <P> The victims were Michael Allen Bower, 19, and a 16-year-old youth, both from  Garden Grove. Bower was treated and released at the AMI Medical Center of  Garden Grove; the 16-year-old remained in stable condition at UCI Medical  Center in Orange, police said.  </P> <P> The suspects were spotted riding in a pickup truck and stopped in the 300 block  of North Harbor Boulevard by Santa Ana police about 12:35 a.m. Wednesday after  a description of their vehicle was broadcast. Several people then jumped out of  the back of the truck, while the driver and a passenger fled in the truck.  Officers pursued the running suspects.  </P> <P> "They are all part of a rival gang with the people that were shot," Garden  Grove Police Investigator Mike Hanfield said.  </P> <P> A .38-caliber revolver was found at the scene of the shooting.  </P> <P> Arrested in connection with the drive-by shooting, which occurred about 11:40  p.m. Tuesday at a residence in the 12500 block of Sunswept Avenue were two  adults, Jason Tovar, 21, of Santa Ana and Jerry Felix Cardona, 18, of Garden  Grove, and three juveniles, one 17-year-old from Anaheim and a 17-year-old and  a 15-year-old, both of Santa Ana.

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Sulzer jumps to SFr168m SULZER, the Swiss engineering group, has unveiled a 56 per cent jump in net profits to SFr168m (Dollars 112m) for 1992, more than making up for the 23 per cent fall in 1991. The directors are proposing that the dividend, which was cut to SFr13 per share last year, from SFr15, be raised to SFr16. Consolidated sales rose 5 per cent to SFr6.8bn. The group said the profit increase was due mainly to a sharp improvement in operating income to SFr250m from a restated SFr163m. It said 1992 accounts were prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and last year's figures have been adjusted.</p>

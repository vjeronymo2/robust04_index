			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CINEFILE  </P> <P> Jack Nicholson has the title role in "The Murder of Napoleon," being developed  by producer Thom Mount at Warner Bros. The Deric Washburn ("The Deer Hunter")  script is based on Ben Weider and David Hapgood's book of the same name, which  Nicholson optioned several years ago. Their tome, a blend of history and  detection, relates how a Swedish dentist discovered convincing proof that  Napoleon was slowly poisoned to death with arsenic during his final years in  exile on St. Helena. . . .  </P> <P> William Hickey ("Prizzi's Honor") plays an aging Mafia don, again, in the  gangster comedy "Mob Boss." When a hail of bullets sends him to the hospital,  his son, Eddie Deezen -- the actor who looks and acts like a young Jerry Lewis  -- inherits dad's mistress, Morgan Fairchild, and his enemies. The American  Independent film, which also stars Jack O'Halloran, Don Stroud, Leo Gordon and  Dick Miller, began shooting last week under Fred Olen Ray's direction. . . .  </P> <P> In Buenos Aires, production designer Roger Hall is building the largest set in  Argentina's history for Panzer-Davis Films' "Highlander II."

Jill Schoelen (star of the November release "Phantom of the Opera"), Don  Michael Paul ("Heart of Dixie") and Sean Kanan ("Karate Kid III") are the leads  in Films West's "Rich Girl." About a spoiled, rich girl who gets a job in an  L.A. rock club and falls for a lead singer, it also features Willie Dixon, the  legendary 73-year-old R&amp;B musician, plus such local bands as Darling Cruel,  Precious Metal and Celebrity Skin. . . .  </P> <P> Deborah Rennard ("Dallas"), Lisa Pelikan ("Julia") and Harrison Page ("Sledge  Hammer") will get their kicks with martial-arts star Jean-Claude Van Damme in  Imperial Entertainment's "The Wrong Bet." About street fighters and gamblers,  it begins production Oct. 23. . . .  </P> <P> Robert Forster, Lance Edwards, Robert Davi, Bert Remsen and Hilary Shepard star  in Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane's "Peacemaker," a contemporary sci-fi action  adventure set in Los Angeles.

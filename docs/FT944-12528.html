			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet taps new market for Dollars 500m Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, is to raise Dollars 500m (Pounds 316m) in the United States through an issue of perpetual fixed rate preferred securities, a financial instrument similar to preferred stock. The issue, one of the biggest in the US preferred market this year, is part of the group's efforts to reduce its short-term debt and diversify funding sources. It follows a Dollars 1.2bn zero coupon bond and a Dollars 600m Eurobond issue earlier this year. Part of the attraction is the tax advantages linked to the way the deal has been structured. A new subsidiary set up as a limited partnership in the state of Delaware, will issue the securities. The proceeds are then loaned to the UK parent and on to a separate foreign operating subsidiary. The coupons on the inter-company loan will be tax deductible. Delaware company law allows businesses to be classed as partnerships for tax and companies for reporting purposes. 'We have developed a structure which provides the economic equivalent of a parent issue of preferred stock at an attractive cost,' explained Mr Nick Rose, group treasurer of GrandMet. 'It will further lengthen the maturity profile of our funding and will improve gearing and interest cover.' Mr Calum Osborne, executive director, capital markets, at Goldman Sachs, co-lead manager of the issue and bookrunner, said the deal could be a model for other companies seeking to raise capital in the US. Although the new securities will be classified as 'minority interests' and give the company a similar degree of flexibility as an equity issue, funding costs will be lower than an issue of preference shares and only slightly more expensive - than an issue of debt. UK and other European companies have ventured into the US preferred market over the last five years, but this is the first time a UK group has issued preferred securities. 'Preferred securities are low cost, non-voting securities, (and) represent an attractive and important source of non-dilutive, quasi equity capital, which to date have been unavailable to UK corporation,' said Goldman Sachs, GrandMet also hopes to widen its investor base in the US, arguing that the paper should prove attractive to retail investors. 'It is an important development in the evolution of UK and other foreign issuers to access the fixed rate preference share market', said Mr Bruce Macfarlane, a managing director at Merrill Lynch, the other co-lead manager.</p>

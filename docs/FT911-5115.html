			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmers Viewpoint): Tenant farmers fear return to Dark Ages - Proposals by John Gummer to deregulate the farm tenancy law will limit protection IF PROPOSALS put forward by Mr John Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture, become law, relationships between landowners and tenant farmers will be back in the Dark Ages. So say some elderly tenants who remember the days before the Second World War. They speak of ruthless landlords who, in the absence of laws providing security of tenure, evicted a tenant on a whim. They tell of tenants who allowed the fertility of their land to deteriorate and buildings to fall down because they had no guarantee of how long their tenure would last, nor of compensation for improvements they might make to the landowner's property. The Agriculture Act of 1947, sponsored by Labour Agriculture Minister Tom Williams, changed that. As well as setting up a system of guaranteed prices for farm commodities, it gave tenants security of tenure for their lifetime, always provided, of course, that they paid their rents regularly and were not guilty of some gross breach of the tenancy agreement. Also, it established a framework of law to guide both parties to such agreements and through which disputes between landlords and tenants could be resolved. In 1976 another Labour government introduced legislation for England and Wales which provided security of tenure for three generations of farming families on the same land, which had been the case in Scotland for some years. However, while the measure may have been intended to help tenant farmers, it had the opposite effect. Landowners, who had already shown reluctance to let farms for one tenant's lifetime, refused point blank to lose control of their land for three generations, and the trickle of farms available to let dried up completely. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1986, introduced by the Conservatives, cancelled three-generation succession and reverted to security of tenure for one lifetime on new tenancies. However, it made little subsequent difference to the availability of farms to let. Landowners, with the help of their agents, had by then found ways to circumvent the law and were enjoying the freedom it afforded them. Many took their land in hand and farmed it themselves with advice from agents or consultants. Others turned over their farms to professional management companies set up for the purpose, which ran them either on contract, in partnership, or according to some form of share farming agreement. In all cases, the arrangements avoided setting up legal tenancies and enabled the landowner to regain control of his land within a relatively short and predetermined period, thereby preserving the so-called 'vacant possession premium'. This is the difference in value at auction between let land and land in hand, and varies these days between 33 per cent and 50 per cent in favour of land in hand. Obviously few landowners would voluntarily forgo such an advantage, even if they had no immediate intention of selling. Almost all tenanted farms that have changed hands in recent years have done so according to one or other of the non-tenancy routes. Meanwhile, with the growth in owner-occupation of land and the associated decline in the let sector - from 90 per cent in 1910 the number of tenanted farms has shrunk to 36 per cent today - young farmers with limited capital wishing to make a start in the industry have for several years now experienced great difficulty in finding farms to rent. That, presumably, was the motivation behind John Gummer's proposals, announced two months ago to deregulate farm tenancy law. Also, the NFU has failed to come up with a workable way to reform the present rules, which are observed more in their avoidance than their compliance. The new proposals as they stand would remove most of the protection previously provided for tenants and allow almost complete freedom of contract between parties. Insiders have suggested that the minister's proposals were virtually written by the Country Landowners' Association, and they certainly appear to lean in the landlord's favour. If adopted, they would abolish security of tenure for new tenants (existing agreements would not be affected); there would be no statutory minimum term; no automatic right to renew a tenancy at the end of an agreed term; no statutory period for notice to quit; and no arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes. The idea is clearly to allow maximum flexibility and that, of course, has merit. The virtual removal of the entire framework of law against which tenancy agreements could be written, however, appears to be worrying even the CLA, and it seems likely that they, the NFU, the Tenant Farmers' Association, and the Young Farmers' Clubs, all of whom have similar interests but different priorities, will urge the minister not to be quite so radical. The danger is that, in the absence of the kind of statutory framework that currently exists, every dispute could turn into a test case in the courts. None of the parties involved wants farm tenancies to become a lawyer's benefit. That said, there is widespread acceptance that change is necessary, if only to recognise what is already happening in the market place. Some of the ideas floated in the minister's proposals will be widely welcomed. The assignability of a tenancy, for instance, would be regarded as a great step forward by many, although provision for this, like so many of the proposals, would be up to the individuals concerned. As a farm tenant for more than 30 years, the agreement under which I operate would be unaffected by any new legislation. However, if I were signing to rent a new farm, in order to avoid the Dark Ages of some tenants' fears, I would wish to see as an absolute minimum statutory provisions for reviewing rent, up or down; a legally binding formula on compensation for improvements done by either party; and a standard procedure for arbitration of disputes. Beyond that, the more flexibility and freedom of contract the better, so far as I am concerned. But I doubt if, in reality, a new law on the lines proposed would bring about significant improvements for young farmers seeking to get a start in the industry.</p>

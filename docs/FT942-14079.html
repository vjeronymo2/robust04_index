			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: BZ fund placing raises SFr2bn Stillhalter Vision, the latest investment fund formed by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has raised SFr2bn in a placing of bearer and registered shares. The fund, formed two weeks ago, will invest in blue chip shares and reduce their volatility by continually writing covered call options on them. As in the cases of previous BZ-led investment funds, Stillhalter offered investors the option of exchanging some of their shares for its shares. The fund will publish details of its portfolio in the next few weeks when its bearer shares are listed in Switzerland.</p>

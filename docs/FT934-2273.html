			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Digging for a new identity: Robert Thomson on life without coal in northern Japan Surrounded by pieces of timber that were to be fashioned into a wooden box, the former coal miner forced together the tongues and grooves of two sides that would not quite fit. He crouched with a dozen other men who had shared a mine shaft until last year, all attempting a conversion to carpentry in the hope of finding an income and a life after coal. Changing identity in Japan does not come easy. These miners had always introduced themselves by company name first, Mitsui, and family name second. They had a clear hierarchy in the mine shaft, a hierarchy dismantled on the retraining room floor, where each pair of calloused hands starts with the same planks of wood and is judged on the symmetry of a completed box. The coal miners of Ashibetsu, in northern Japan, could be unwitting trend-setters. Just as Mitsui has closed an unprofitable mine, Japanese manufacturers are contemplating closing loss-making factories and wondering where to put middle-aged administrative workers, who still hope their company will keep the promise of lifetime employment. As the miners must cope with a change in occupation, small communities which have lost an old identity are attempting to fashion a new one. In Ashibetsu, they have a saying 'from tanko to kanko', from coal mines to tourism, which is supposed to replace the black stuff as the fuel of local wealth. Theme parks are a popular choice for local governments casting around for a new character, and Ashibetsu has built a Canadian Village. Its claim to fame is Japan's largest lavender field, but it is far from Tokyo and for much of the winter the park is snowed under and the six imported Canadians are idle. An hour's drive away, another town has built a German theme village and the countryside is dotted with little bits of other countries. But, in Ashibetsu, the coffee shop in the town's centre still has a lump of coal on a pedestal, and the local candy comes in the shape of just-mined coal. Mr Katsuhiro Tainaka, aged 54, now a trainee carpenter, was among the last 373 miners at Mitsui Ashibetsu. He was the local organiser for the regional head of the miners' union, a position of subservience and of importance: 'I guess it's a Japanese way of looking at things, but he was my lord and I would still do absolutely anything for him.' Having worked in a mine for 35 years, Mr Tainaka is adjusting his vision to the harsh light above ground. His wife Kazue says he eats less but has already put on nearly half a stone and looks pudgy: 'When he was working, I would cook plate after plate of food, and he would just eat and eat. He would be too tired to talk.' The couple met on a holiday camp run by the Lenin Society three decades ago, when miners were adopted as popular symbols of the working man by the country's communists. In those days, Mr Tainaka thought a revolution inevitable, but the union and the company gradually merged. When Mitsui announced that the mine would have to close, the miners understood that cheap imports had made them redundant and accepted the decision. Mr Tainaka keeps his mining hat on the mantelpiece, beside the shining blackness of a coal lump that he hauled out before the shaft was closed. Playing with a grandson occupies his time, but his income has fallen by more than half and the loss of mateship is more damaging: 'When you are in a mine, people depend on you. You can't make a mistake. You have to work together.' Of the workmates with him at the end, a third have left town, a third have new jobs, and about a third are being retrained. Two have committed suicide. The Tainakas have stayed in the mining company apartment, but most of the blocks lining the town's roads are empty and sales in local stores have fallen about 20 per cent this year. Shopkeepers complain that a new road intended to be Ashibetsu's lifeline is strangling them. Instead of shopping locally, Mr Tainaka and other residents drive 40 minutes to the nearest city, where cheaper discount stores outside the old distribution networks have sprouted in the past two years. The speculative binge of the late 1980s bypassed Ashibetsu, but the area is nonetheless suffering trauma. Investment losses have put large companies under extra pressure to close local factories and to halt fresh investments, leaving a just-finished industrial park waiting for its first customer. And the yen's appreciation this year means Ashibetsu is up against northern China and Thailand in the tough contest for scarce funds. Local governments have not lost enthusiasm. Mikasa city, another old coal mining centre in central Hokkaido, has a population of 16,126 and is shedding people at the rate of 400 a year. Mr Ginichi Aoki, the mayor, delivers a vivid description of Mikasa's bright future. He spreads maps out on the table, and points to the high-tech centre, the culture zone, the industrial parks and the tourism belt. 'I am going to Tokyo this weekend to tell a mayors' conference about our plans. We are determined to attract people to live and visit here. We will make this a happy place,' Mr Aoki insists. Outside his office, a traffic signal's electronic chirping beckons absent pedestrians to cross. A banner hanging across the front of the civic centre proclaims that the town is aiming for 500 days without a road accident. Of all the grand plans, that is the most attainable in Mikasa's empty streets.</p>

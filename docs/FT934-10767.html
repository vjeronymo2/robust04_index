			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Wave of market reforms planned: New parliament expected to enact laws to transform economy RUSSIAN authorities are preparing a mass of legislation to put a market system firmly in place, on the assumption that the December 12 parliamentary elections will return a reformist government, ministers said yesterday. The reforms include: Laws on foreign investment which would guarantee property rights and the ability to remit profit. A new phase of privatisation from July next year, covering sectors such as energy and transport. A decree allowing the government to set strict performance and profit targets for state-owned companies. The drastic reduction of the Ministry of the Economy, formerly Gosplan, to a small agency concerned with analysis and forecasting - thus ceding top place in economic management to the Finance Ministry for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution. The reformers, many of them on the ticket of 'Russia's Choice', the main party of the right, are confident of securing a reform-minded parliament and thus a radical government. Professor Richard Layard, who co-heads the Centre for Economic Performance in Moscow, reflected their optimism when he said yesterday that 'if Russia can stick to a course of tight monetary control and bring down inflation, then by the end of the century it could have the fastest-growing economy in the world'. However, the figures produced yesterday by the Centre remain discouraging. Inflation remained over 20 per cent in September, while the real exchange rate of the rouble and output continued to fall. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, told a government session on privatisation yesterday that the mass privatisation of enterprises by voucher would continue until July 1 next year, after which 'a deep transformation' of the programme would be set in train, aimed at establishing strong companies and investment groups. The emphasis would shift, he said, from the rapid distribution of state property to individual programmes targeted on industries and companies. Mr Valery Fateyev, deputy economics minister, said yesterday there were 'no serious investors' in Russia, because there were 'no guarantees for tomorrow'.</p>

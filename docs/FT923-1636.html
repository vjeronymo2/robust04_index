			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / German bank says UK must negotiate re-entry THE German Bundesbank yesterday served notice that the UK will have to negotiate sterling's re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism at an appropriate parity as the currency fell to a new low against the D-Mark. In remarks which are likely to irritate the British government, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said that the re-entry of sterling and the lira into the ERM would have to be on terms approved by all other participants. The ERM remained under heavy strain yesterday after France's narrow approval of the Maastricht treaty failed to allay investors' fears about the future of European monetary union. The French franc dropped to within two centimes of its ERM floor against the D-Mark, in spite of continuous intervention by the Bank of France, and supportive comments from Mr Schlesinger. Ireland's punt was again the victim of heavy selling as investors continued to buy D-Marks. In Italy, the central bank's announcement that it would not rejoin the ERM today, as it suggested last week, triggered another heavy sell-off of the Italian currency against the D-Mark. It closed in London at L845.2, from a previous close of L836.2, although it picked up in early Far East trading today where it was quoted at about L842.2. Sterling, which left the ERM last week, fell as speculators anticipated an early cut in UK base rates. The pound closed in London 7 1/2 pfennigs down from Friday's close at DM2.5375, an historic low against the D-Mark and an effective 10 per cent devaluation from the old ERM central rate. In New York it finished the day at DM2.5338, and slipped a shade further to around DM2.53 as Far East trading opened. Sterling also fell against the dollar, finishing in New York at Dollars 1.7080, more than 2 1/2 cents down on Friday's close. Early today in the Far East it gained slightly to about Dollars 1.7130. Without specifically naming the pound, Mr Schlesinger said it was 'very important' that countries entering the ERM should choose a parity that 'would be right from the beginning'. This had not happened in the past. Mr Schlesinger's remarks reflect the continued distaste the Bundesbank has for the way the UK entered the ERM in October 1990. At that time UK unilaterally decided that sterling's parity would be DM2.95 and announced the rate before the weekend meetings of EC officials which were to discuss UK entry. Mr Schlesinger's insistence that the UK submit its proposed entry terms to its EC partners is in line with ERM rules. But it is likely to irritate Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who at the weekend made clear the UK wanted changes in the ERM before again submitting sterling to its disciplines. Last night he voiced hopes that the French vote would help calm the markets. He added that although sterling was outside the ERM, 'our policies will continue to be directed at achieving the objective of sustained non-inflationary growth over the medium term, and of meeting the convergence conditions set out in the Maastricht treaty'. The ERM had difficulty coping with the D-Mark as its anchor currency after German union, he said, and called on the EC to address the 'rationale' of the ERM. One issue was whether it should revert to a system of fixed but adjustable parities, as was the case before 1987, or 'a glide path towards a single currency'.</p>

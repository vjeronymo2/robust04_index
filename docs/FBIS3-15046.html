			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1645 GMT on 1 March carries an  8-minute "Current Affairs Commentator's Studio" program. The  program starts with an introduction over video footage of the  State Duma in session and Rutskoy and Khasbulatov being  released. The amnesty is referred to as the focal point of the  week.    The unidentified interviewer tells S.A. Filatov, head of the  Russian president's administration, that he will ask him about  the amnesty later, but first asks Filatov to speak about the  decrees signed by Yeltsin last week. Filatov starts off by  talking about Yeltsin's decree on the award to Patriarch Aleksey  II of All Russia of the Order of the Friendship of Peoples on  the occasion of his 60th birthday. He praises the patriarch for  his work towards the stabilization of society and congratulates  him.    Filatov states that 50 decrees were issued last week in all.  He briefly refers to the decree on the release of Kazannik from  the post of procurator general and his replacement. He  discusses the two trends at the State Duma -- those who wish to  get off to a fresh start without any investigations,and those  who want to mark a political victory. Filatov does not perceive  agreement among the parliamentarians in spite of such decisions  as the "memorandum on accord.    The interviewer comments that a lot seemed to happen on the  night of Friday to Saturday, and asks Filatov what he learned on  a visit to the prosecutor's office today. Filatov complains  that the procuracy was also riven with differences. He says  that there seemed to be an instruction to release those  amnestied as soon as possible. He notes that the president as  the guarantor of the constitution was powerless to do anything  about what happened.    The interviewer notes that Filatov spoke to the president  this morning and asks Filatov what Yeltsin's reaction was.  Filatov replies: "Well, the president is naturally concerned  about what happened. Undoubtedly he is. The greatest  perplexity is evoked by the fact that he addressed a definite  message to the State Duma. He asked them to explain a number of  positions, because in that message in general the question is  formulated of it not being an amnesty but a pardon. This is the  prerogative of the president alone. He asked for an explanation  of these issues. At least one might have expected that no  action would be taken until a reply was received to that  message. Well, when it was necessary the Supreme Soviet even  used to meet at night. If it was an emergency situation, the  State Duma could have been convened quickly. They are here.  They had not yet left Moscow for anywhere else. Therefore, if  it is a question of an emergency or is becoming a question of an  emergency, then one should react to that in the relevant manner.  But to simply carry out the decision of the Duma just like  that, or to compel it to be carried out, so to speak, without  even replying to the president's message, is not just lack of  respect, but one cannot even find the words to describe it. If  there was such a a hurry -- the first question I put is why it  was done in such a tearing hurry. Furthermore, they even told  me that a duty officer was sitting in the editorial office of  the State Duma, waiting to print the document in a hurry, and it  was to be sat on for as long as possible before it went to the  presidential structures. It was to be submitted in such a way  that no reaction was any longer possible. But I did not know, I  thought that Saturday and Sunday might turn out to be very  serious in their consequences."    The interviewer asks Filatov whether executive power is  ready  to react sufficiently if Ampilov and his supporters organize  street fighting again. Filatov replies that it is up to the  State Duma to deal with that, since they have released people  for whom they have taken responsibility, as it were. He  stresses the need for the State Duma to understand its  responsibilty and ensure the safety of the public.</p>

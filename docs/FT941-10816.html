			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Cupid takes aim at the financial heart: Rachel Johnson finds that on Valentine's day, money might buy you love If money can't buy you love, love can make you money. Next Monday the Royal Mail, greetings card manufacturers, the travel trade and restaurateurs will be among those raking in the profits of the feast of St Valentine, a multi-million pound industry that is set to beat all records this year. Royal Mail is predicting a 10 per cent rise this year in the volume of cards sent first-class to 8.92m, and extra revenues of Pounds 2.25m. Ms Yvette Turner, head of personal mail, said it was not just timing - last year February 14 fell on a Sunday - that explained the increase. 'The range of cards available from humorous to romantic is now so vast, and the greater availability of stamps makes it easier to send a card.' Hallmark, the privately- owned card group, refuses to disclose its share of the frilly hearts and pink card bonanza, which is expected to have its best year since the custom was revived in the 1920s. As a guide, the Valentine's day card market was worth Pounds 26.5m in the UK last year, with romantics spending an average of Pounds 1.31 on 20.2m cards. According to Royal Mail research, the most dedicated senders are Midlands-based women - females send 50 per cent more cards than males - in the 25-34 or 45-54 age brackets. The least romantic are male readers of The Times from the West Country. For the travel and restaurant trades, timing is all. With the day falling on Monday, lovers will take longer breaks. Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said bookings were up 20 per cent rise on last year for the weekend - and the most popular destinations are, inevitably, romantic-sounding cities such as Paris and Venice. Newspapers make money from hotels advertising their Valentine breaks - a typical specimen this year offers a two-night break plus dinner in a 'candlelit restaurant, complimentary champagne and red roses' for under Pounds 100. The other money-spinner is classified advertisements. The Independent hopes to match the Pounds 26,000 it earned last year from two full pages of 1,000 advertisements. But Mr Giles Johnson of the classified section realises that falling circulation and a 50p rise in the price of an eight-word message might deter all but the most ardent. For regional restaurants, the prospect of a full house on the slowest night of the week - when many do not bother to open their doors - are enticing them to do so for the first time in months. Miss Brenda Blacklaws, who manages the Peat Inn in Fife, predicts that business will be brisk enough to outweigh the disadvantages of serving couples at tables for four. Not all restaurants are so accommodating towards the 'gruesome twosomes' - they often start the evening with high expectations and end it in tears. Ms Sally Clarke, owner of Clarke's in Kensington, west London, said she 'hates Valentine's day more than anything'. She tries to discourage canoodling couples by offering starters such as 'skewered ducks' hearts' on the night. At least Ms Clarke does not have to endure the American approach to Valentine's day. Not only are 1bn cards, 55m roses and Dollars 655m (Pounds 436.60m) worth of sweets due to be bought, but there is to be a charity ball in Kissimmee, Florida - for couples only.</p>

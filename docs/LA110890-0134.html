Persimmons are falling off trees in Southern  California and showing up in markets throughout the country until the end of  the holiday season.

They serve a  spaghetti dish with browned butter and mizithra cheese I have not seen on the  menu elsewhere. I'd appreciate the recipe.  </P> <P>  -- SHEILA  </P> <P> DEAR SHEILA: Other readers love the recipe too. We have answered requests for  this simple spaghetti and cheese dish for years. You can use just the mizithra,  a Greek cheese similar to ricotta, or combine it with other Greek cheeses, such  as Kasseri and Caciocavallo, or other soft cheeses.  </P> <P> SPAGHETTI FACTORY SPAGHETTI MIZITHRA  </P> <P> 1 pound spaghetti  </P> <P> 1 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 pound dry ricotta cheese, Kasseri or Caciocavallo, grated  </P> <P> 1/4 pound Romano cheese, grated  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> Cook spaghetti until tender but firm to bite. Drain. Melt butter in large  skillet until butter turns brown in color. Sprinkle with mixed cheeses, then  drizzle with browned butter. Sprinkle with parsley. Makes 6 servings.  </P></p>

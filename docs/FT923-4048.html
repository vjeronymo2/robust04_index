			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Accountant to be chief executive of Granada TV GRANADA, the television and leisure group, yesterday alarmed some of its programme makers by appointing Mr Charles Allen, an accountant with no background in television, as chief executive of Granada Television. Mr Allen, 35, has worked at British Steel and GrandMet before becoming group managing director of the Compass Vending Group. He said yesterday he was on his way to Granada Television to listen and learn and work out over the next six months the best way to take the business forward. He added he was committed to the ITV company remaining a leading producer rather than a commissioner of programmes. Earlier this year, Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada Group, forced the resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television and one of the most respected figures in ITV. He was replaced by Mr Andrew Quinn, who had the title of chief executive and who recently resigned to become chief executive of ITV. Mr Allen has worked closely with Mr Robinson since 1983 and in 1991 was appointed chief executive of Granada Leisure, which groups motorway services, hotels, night clubs and theme parks. 'This is the inevitable consequences of not standing up and being counted when David Plowright was forced to resign,' a Granada programme maker said yesterday. People, Page 15</p>

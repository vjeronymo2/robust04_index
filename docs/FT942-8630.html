			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Married without a honeymoon - Michael Lindemann and Quentin Peel talk to Krupp Hoesch chief Gerhard Cromme, who insists that the merger came just in time Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Krupp Hoesch, seems to be an incorrigible optimist. He has had to be, given the problems he has faced in the last two years, consummating the marriage of Germany's second- and third-largest steelmakers in the midst of the sharpest post-war recession in their main markets. He never had a honeymoon. The merged group is in the process of shedding at least 25,000 jobs, more than one in four of its workforce. It had to shoulder a loss last year of almost DM600m (Dollars 353m), and close one of its two main integrated steel plants. It still carries a debt burden of almost DM5.8bn. Mr Cromme insists the merger was an ideal industrial marriage, with rationalisation and cost-saving possible in 70 per cent of operations. At the same time, the depth of the 1993 downturn in steel, capital goods and the motor industry, helped concentrate minds and accelerate the process, he says. 'The merger came only just in time. The crisis in 1993 was so bad that both Krupp and Hoesch alone would have had difficulties surviving in the same form they are in today.' The merger was confirmed in December 1992, and took a further six months to begin putting into effect. It leaves the cumbersomely titled Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp with six broad divisions, ranging from its strengths in steel, engineering and plant construction, to its expanding interests in trade and services. Mr Cromme singles out the automotive supplies division as a beneficiary, because the joint operation can provide manufacturers with complete systems, instead of individual parts. For example, it will for the first time supply the complete front axle for the new Jaguar in the UK. The cost savings from the merger are still working through, he says. The combined data processing operation will be DM100m a year cheaper than the separate operations, and DM60m of that has already been achieved. The savings, above all in the group payroll, are an important factor behind his forecast of returning to break-even this year. 'Turnover in 1994 will be roughly the same as it was for the two companies in 1992, but we already have 16,000 fewer people.' It was not the merger which caused the real problems, he insists, but the extent of the economic recession. And yet he believes that has been beneficial for the industry. 'Everything that happened in 1993 brought the German steel industry for the first time to the point of real rationalisation.' After a decade of desultory and unsuccessful negotiations, Thyssen, the largest steelmaker, and Krupp Hoesch are involved in the process of streamlining their operations. The outline of the plan, agreed last December, is for Thyssen to take majority control in two areas - tinplate and electrical strip - and Krupp Hoesch to lead in special steel flat products. The three areas make up 30 per cent of Krupp Hoesch's steel output. Krupp's interest in special steels will be reinforced if it is successful in its joint bid with three Italian partners - Riva, Falck, and Tadfin - for AST, the special steels division of Ilva, the Italian state-owned steel company. 'That means that in steel we will continue to develop those areas where we see the chance of a competitive future,' Mr Cromme says. At the same time, the closure of the Krupp steel plant at Rheinhausen, cutting crude steel capacity by 4m tonnes, has left the group with 'a virtual equilibrium' between all its parts of the steel-making process - and no incentive to make any further large capacity cuts, he says. Mr Cromme says he has no intention of seeking debt relief along the lines of his competitor, Klockner, and in spite of the heavy debt burden. 'We will have no Chapter 11 here.' The overall debt burden did not increase last year and remained constant at almost DM5.8bn. Mr Cromme denies plans for further large disposals to reduce the debt burden, but says it would be cut by good cash flow. The company's heavy capital investment programme has been curtailed, and the money normally ploughed into investment will go to pay off some of that debt. Mr Cromme is optimistic about Germany's efforts to remain competitive as an investment location. 'We have solved more problems in Germany in the past year than many sceptics thought we could,' he says. He believes the D-Mark will regain some of its competitiveness against the dollar and other European currencies in the coming months. The future for Krupp Hoesch rests heavily on its international markets, and investing close to them, he says.</p>

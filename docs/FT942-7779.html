			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Observer: It's a strine Bet Alexander Downer, the new leader of Australia's opposition, didn't get bullied in Britain in the same way as he does in Australia. His dad was Australian high commissioner in London between 1964 and 1972 and young Downer went to school in Oxford and got his degree in politics at Newcastle. His enemies in Australia call him Shirley Temple because of his black curls, and there has long been a joke that when his family's home was in the Canberra suburb of Downer, they lived at the posher end  - Upper Downer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mobile forces have safely finished opening the land  route linking Renk with Malakal, which had been closed for more  than 10 years. In a press statement, a coordinator with the  people's defense in the Upper Nile State, 'Abd-al-Halim Adam,  stressed that the scattered remnants of the rebellion's army in  the region have suffered a collapse of morale, and a great  number of them have expressed their wish to surrender.    He said that government soldiers, the people's defense,  people's police, and the national service, with the support of  the citizens, participated in the opening up of the road.    Meanwhile, the command of the people's defense has called on  all combatants to enlist in the Misk al-Khitam Brigade, which is  currently heading toward the operational zone. The deadline for  enlisting is 13 June, at Mawlid Square in Khartoum.    This comes as a support for national unity, development  plans, and the defense of peace in the country.</p>

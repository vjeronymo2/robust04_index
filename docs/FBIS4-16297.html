			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- The Party of the Majority  set up two months ago will not sign the draft memorandum on  civic peace and accord, party leader Vyacheslav Grechaninov told  a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. Grechaninov said that  the authors of the document place it even "higher than the  constitution." Additionally, it restricts the rights of  parties, public associations and subjects of the federation. He  strongly opposed the provisions rejecting political campaigning  for elections to federal bodies of power and banning trade  unions from organising strikes. The draft agreement also  obliges the subjects of the federation to pledge not to change  their status for two years.    Anatoliy Panfilov, leader of the Constructive Ecological  Movement of Russia (KEDR), who also attended the news  conference, said that his movement supports the position of the  Party of the Majority and has no intention of signing the  agreement. The Party of the Majority is currently negotiating  with Panfilov's movement the possibility of joining forces to  set up a united bloc for the next elections. At the same time,  Grechaninov said that his party is ready to take part in the  preparation of a "more serious" memorandum of accord.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A state-owned West German steel firm said it has evidence that blueprints  supplied by its subsidiary for a chemical factory in Hong Kong may have been  sent to Libya to help build a reported poison gas plant there. The company,  Salzgitter AG, and the Finance Ministry in Bonn said in separate statements  that a probe of the Salzgitter subsidiary uncovered a reference to Rabta,  Libya, in a 1985 letter from Imhausen-Chemie. Imhausen is already under  criminal investigation for its allegedly pivotal role in constructing the plant  near Tripoli. "Salzgitter Industriebau, subcontracted by Imhausen-Chemie . . .  was obviously deceived" about the location of the planned plant, Salzgitter  said.  </P></p>

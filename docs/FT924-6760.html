			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP reform 'shock to corporate farming' THE REFORM of the European Community's common agricultural policy had 'induced a shock to the corporate farming system,' the fifth annual conference of Food from Britain, the government-backed promotional body, was told in London yesterday. But the many inconsistencies and escalating costs of the CAP could be expected to lead to further, probably more radical, reforms later in the decade, Mr Edward Robinson, a director of the Booker food and farming group, predicted. The squeeze on farm incomes would continue 'with increased severity', farm employment would continue to decline, and competitive pressures would continue unabated. 'This prospect will in itself foster a climate of continuing uncertainty with which agriculture, and by implication, other parts of the food chain will have to live for some years to come.' Mr Robinson was particularly critical of EC's plan to set aside 15 per cent of cereal growing land next year. This would cut profits at Booker Farming - which manages 27,000 acres of mainly arable crops - by up to Pounds 400,000 a year. Cereal production could be expected to continue rising, he said. Set-aside applies only to farmers with a production potential of more than 92 tonnes. In the UK this would affect 54 per cent of farms. But in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal 95 per cent or more of cereal farmers would be exempt, while 80 per cent would be exempt in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and Holland, and 70 per cent in France. 'Clearly there is no incentive for the community's predominantly small farmers to reduce output,' Mr Robinson said. Last year EC output rose by 6 per cent to 167.5m tonnes, with Greece accounting for 35 per cent of the rise, Portugal 26 per cent, Italy and Ireland 10 per cent, and France 8 per cent. The UK was responsible for just 0.5 per cent. 'The reality is, of course, that important elements of agricultural reform are being driven by social policy rather than by economic consideration,' said Mr Robinson. Mr John Gummer, Agriculture Minister, yesterday announced a scheme implementing EC regulations to register traditional, regional and speciality foods from the UK.</p>

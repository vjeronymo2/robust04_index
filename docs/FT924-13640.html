			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (4): Call it silicon peninsula / Review of the effort to attract new investment WITH Devon's traditional industries such as defence, agriculture and fishing in decline, and tourism under threat from foreign competition and unpredictable summers, the county must create more jobs by attracting new investment, both from UK companies and from overseas. Great progress has been made in the last 10 years, especially with an influx of service industry jobs to Exeter and high tech companies to the Plymouth area. More is needed to combat the effects of the recession and the run-down in traditional employment. 'There has been a constant process of companies relocating in the county, but it has been getting slower,' says Mr Ken Martin, chief executive of the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which is responsible for investment from overseas. 'When selling Devon overseas you are also selling the whole of the UK, and the performance of the national economy is the backdrop against which you operate . . .at present this is causing problems and until it improves it is going to affect our business.' The county's inward investment strategy has been designed to achieve a better balance of jobs; successes have resulted from an improved infrastructure and the attractions of a high quality environment and a skilled workforce. Relocation has taken a number of forms: straightforward domestic corporate movement; international arrivals; expansion driven moves, and rationalisation programmes. According to a study conducted by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the surveyors and property consultants, relocation activity in Devon is usually traced back to the move made by London &amp; Manchester Assurance, the insurance and financial services group; it transferred from London to Exeter in 1976. Since then the company, with 1,300 employees, has become one of the county's leading service sector employers, and is also active in the local property investment market. Then in 1981, Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, initiated a big investment programme in Plymouth, where it now employs over 1,000 people. One factory supplies the company's entire output of colour television sets to the UK and European markets, and a second was opened earlier this year to produce air conditioning units. About half will be exported to Europe. The Toshiba experience is given as proof of local claims for having one of the most stable and productive workforces in the country. Toshiba in Plymouth pioneered Britain's first no-strike agreement and has been remarkably free of industrial unrest. Largely because of the example of Toshiba, another leading Japanese electronics company, Murata Manufacturing, decided to invest Pounds 50m in building a plant at Plymouth, now in production. Less clearcut has been the experience with Harris Corporation of America. It planned to set up a Pounds 120m semi-conductor manufacturing and testing plant in Plymouth - which would have been the biggest prize so far - but the company has decided to put the decision on hold because of the world-wide fall in demand. But there are now about 70 high technology and many more precision engineering companies in the county - big names like British Aerospace Dynamics, Plessey, Northern Telecom and an ICI research laboratory. Such a heavy concentration, attracted in part by the strong academic and research base of the universities at Exeter and at Plymouth (where the polytechnic has been upgraded), has made Devon and Cornwall known as the silicon peninsula. This expansion has been mirrored in the machine tool industry, with investments from Gleason's, Barden Corporation and IBL, supported by a relocation of Hepco Slide Systems from the London area to manufacture precision components for machine tools at Tiverton. The financial services and insurance sectors have grown, too - though not yet on the scale of other centres in the south-west nearer to London, such as Bristol. The most notable recent relocation has been that of Medical Sickness, which moved from London to Exeter a year ago. Devon county council, Exeter and Plymouth city councils and private organisations jointly seek to bring in 'sunrise' companies to fill the vacuum caused by the decline in defence and other traditional industries. Prime targets are more electronics and precision engineering companies, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Mr Mike Wharton, county industrial development officer, also stresses the importance for inward investment of retaining assisted area status for Plymouth and Bude, and reinstating it for Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, Bideford, Torbay and Totnes in the government review which is about to be concluded. Success would mean help in improving the infrastructure, and would make it easier to attract companies to areas of the county with high unemployment, including a superb new business park near Barnstaple. The development bureau, supported by the government, local authorities and private companies, has a budget of Pounds 900,000. It has staff in Boston and Tokyo and shares an office in Taiwan with five other English regional development organisations which, individually, did not have clout similar to heavily financed Scottish and Welsh agencies. A small advantage highlighted by Mr Martin is that Devon is a net importer of goods, which means that there are opportunities for 'backloading,' or transporting other goods on a return journey. This can give a distinct cost advantage. More relevant, though, in attracting investment is the quality and flexibility of the workforce, good education services, relatively low development land and wages costs, and intangible factors such as the welcome given to outsiders moving in, the quality of life, and the willingness of staff to live in the county. Devon has been relatively successful in attracting companies from within the UK and from the US and Japan, but there has been a dearth of newcomers from Europe. Most of the European companies are there as a result of acquisitions or mergers, rather than investment in greenfield sites. The development bureau is aware of the problem and is trying to meet it - but finds competition increasingly fierce during the recession.</p>

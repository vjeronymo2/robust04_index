			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transmission service sought by RMLD in the Application is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Pool-Wide network transmission service, of precisely the same kind and character as is presently available under &sect;13.2(b) of the NEPOOL Agreement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Over transmission facilities rated 69 kV or above, previously or hereafter constituting Pool Transmission Facilities (PTF) within the definition presently contained in Section 13.1 of the NEPOOL Agreement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. At a pool-wide rate established in accordance with the methodology set forth in &sect;&sect;13.4, 13.5 and 13.9 of the NEPOOL Agreement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. To be used for the transfer of an ownership interest or output entitlement of RMLD in a generating unit having a gross rating of 25 MW or higher, as to which the appropriate committee operating under the NEPOOL Agreement has not unreasonably withheld such designation as may be necessary to permit RMLD to acquire an ownership interest or output entitlement consistent with the requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 164A; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. With Economy Flow, Scheduled Outage, Unscheduled Outage, Deficiency service and other hour-to-hour service provided by NEPEX under the terms of the NEPOOL Agreement, as referenced in &sect;13.2(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initiation and termination dates for the service requested, and the total amount of transmission service requested, are not presently determinable with precision. The service sought will not become effective unless the proposed Thirtieth Amendment to the NEPOOL Agreement, currently pending before the Commission in Docket No. ER93&hyph;985&hyph;000, becomes effective. If the Thirtieth Amendment becomes effective, RMLD expects: (1) To require the availability of the service requested in the Application within approximately five years;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) that the exact initiation and termination dates of the service will depend on the nature of the ownership interest or output entitlement that RMLD acquires in the generating unit or units described in item 4 above; and (3) that the total amount of transmission capacity requested will be within the range historically required by RMLD under Section 13.2(b) of the NEPOOL Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  August 3, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> E.

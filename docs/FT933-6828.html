			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Caltex passes dividend CALTEX, the Australian petroleum group, has again passed its dividend despite a strong earnings recovery in the six months to June. The company lifted net profit to ADollars 35.5m (USDollars 23.6m) from ADollars 7.9m for the half-year, on a 7 per cent revenue rise to ADollars 1.75bn. The result followed a widening of operating margins, and a ADollars 9.7m benefit from lower tax. Interest costs eased from ADollars 27.3m to ADollars 26.2m. However, falling crude oil prices and petroleum product discounting is clouding the outlook for the current six months, Caltex says. As a result, there is again no interim dividend. Bank of Melbourne, the regional bank, has shrugged off a big increase in doubtful debt provisions to record a strong profit lift for the year ended June. Net earnings have jumped from ADollars 8.6m to ADollars 91.2m despite a 7 per cent fall, to ADollars 547.9m, in total revenue. The dividend is going up from 13 to 30 cents a share. The result reflected a ADollars 74m abnormal loss in the previous year. Gross profit rose just 5 per cent to ADollars 87.1m. Doubtful debt provision rose 47 per cent to ADollars 42.6m. Tax provision took ADollars 36m, against ADollars 2.5m previously.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Leading Article: More law is not better law The UK parliament returns to work this week after the Christmas break, with a full legislative programme to complete by the autumn. Legislation timetabled for this session includes another education bill, the third criminal justice act in four years and further measures to reform local government. Yet the more that parliament revisits these important subjects, the less satisfactory the outcome appears to be. Britain's legislative machinery is in crisis. One symptom of this crisis is the volume of legislation passed each year. In 1901, 40 acts were passed covering 247 pages; by 1991, the number of acts had risen to 69, needing 2,222 rather larger pages. It is not evident that the UK is better governed as a result. Another symptom is the amount of time spent remedying the defects of recent legislation. New sentencing procedures in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 were repealed last year within months of being introduced. Quangos set up by the 1988 Education Reform Act to administer the national curriculum and testing were abolished in the 1992 Education Act when the reforms ran into trouble. The rules for calculating the maintenance to be paid by absent parents have had to be changed within months of the Child Support Agency opening its doors. Bad law crowds out the good. Legislation on restrictive trade practices recommended in a 1989 white paper has yet to find parliamentary time. There is a queue of measures from the Law Commission to update the law. The trademarks legislation which parliament will consider in this session has been waiting since 1987. Undue haste Much legislation is unsatisfactory because of the haste with which it is passed. The 1990 Dangerous Dogs Act - which has clogged the courts with arguments over the nature of a pit bull - sped through parliament in response to a public outcry. But ministers are also guilty of pushing through their favoured ideas without proper consultation or analysis of the consequences. Their haste is understandable: ministerial office often lasts no more than a year or two. By the time the mess emerges, its creator has moved on. Such haste inevitably leads to bad drafting. The civil servants who draft legislation complain that they receive instructions late, with short deadlines and subject to changes of mind by the commissioning departments. As a result, the government finds it necessary to present increasing numbers of amendments to its own bills in the Lords. According to Lord Howe, the average number of amendments has risen from 1,106 per session between 1979 and 1983 to 2,668 between 1987 and 1989. The Broadcasting Act 1990 passed through parliament with the help of a staggering 1,322 government amendments. It is already being torn up, with restrictions eased on mergers of ITV companies and a new review of rules on cross-media ownership. Outside consultation A recent paper from the European Policy Forum, the cross-party think-tank, suggested the drafting of legislation should be opened up to lawyers outside the civil service. This would break the monopoly of parliamentary counsel and allow departments access to a wider range of talent. More important, it could also slow down the legislative process. Outside lawyers might demand more reasonable timetables and clearer instructions. But much more needs to be done if the quality of UK law-making is to improve. A high-powered commission sponsored by the Hansard Society last year completed a two-year investigation into the legislative process. It produced more than 100 recommendations for streamlining parliament's work, including more consultation, deeper parliamentary scrutiny and better timetabling. Their proposals have attracted widespread support and should be implemented. None of this will have the necessary impact, however, unless the political process is also improved. Ministers too often take the view that government office gives them the right to bulldoze through radical measures on the basis of rudimentary analysis and inadequate testing. Incremental change - as in the Thatcher reforms of industrial relations - may be more effective and hence more durable than can-do government.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME FDA OFFICIALS UNDER ETHICS PROBE;  </P> <P> 17 MAY HAVE TAKEN DRUG INDUSTRY GIFTS, HOUSE PANEL CHARGES  </P> <P> As many as 17 Food and Drug Administration officials may have violated  government ethics rules by accepting subsidized hotel rooms to attend drug  industry meetings at a luxury resort, congressional probers charged Tuesday.  </P> <P> In some cases, the subsidy exceeded $200 per room per night, and some of the  officials also charged drinks, limousines and gift-shop items to their rooms,  said the investigators, who asked that they not be identified.  </P> <P> The tab for the subsidies and the other items was picked up by the National  Assn. of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, an industry group that represents  generic drug companies, the investigators said.  </P> <P> The subsidies enabled the drug industry regulators to attend the group's annual  conferences during the period 1986 to 1988 at a posh Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico,  resort and not exceed their government expense allowances, the investigators  and NAPM officials said.  </P> <P> Government rules prohibit U.S. officials from accepting things of value from  private groups, and they bar FDA officials in particular from taking gifts from  firms they regulate.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the FDA and the NAPM said the FDA officials were unaware of the  subsidies and stopped accepting them as soon as they learned of them earlier  this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used Cheaper Hotel  </P> <P> But investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigations  subcommittee said they believed that at least some of the FDA officials "must  have known" about the subsidies and stopped accepting them only after the  investigators found out about the arrangement.  </P> <P> For this year's six-day meeting, which began Jan. 28, eight of the nine FDA  employees who attended stayed at a cheaper hotel in San Juan, 40 miles away,  NAPM executive director Robert Milanese said. The ninth stayed at the Dorado  Beach facility but paid his own way, Milanese said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> "They made the decision," Milanese said of the FDA officials. "Apparently they  have a very stringent policy on what might be seen as an indirect gratuity."  </P> <P> This year, "we just told the association we would all be staying together in  San Juan," FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said.  </P> <P> Investigators said the FDA officials had in the past paid $100 a night -- the  maximum permitted under their government allowances -- for rooms that cost up  to $330 a night.  </P> <P> Grigg said the officials did not know the association was picking up the  difference.  </P> <P> Grigg and Milanese said the meetings were an important forum for federal  regulators and industry officials to exchange views and information, and Grigg  said no officials had been disciplined for accepting the room subsidies.  </P> <P> At the subcommittee's request, the Inspector General of the Health and Human  Services Department has been looking into the subsidies and the results of that  probe are expected in the next two to three weeks.  </P> <P> The probe is an offshoot of a federal grand jury and congressional  investigation of alleged FDA favoritism in the approval of generic drugs, in  which some drug companies are alleged to have received special treatment at the  drug safety agency in return for bribes and other favors.  </P> <P> Government sources said the criminal investigation, which is being heard by a  federal grand jury in Baltimore, is expected to result in the indictment later  this month of "several" FDA employees and as many as half a dozen generic drug  firms, Reuters reported last week.  </P> <P> The FDA's Grigg said he had no word of developments in the criminal probe.  </P> <P> The investigations subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), kicked  off the grand jury investigation after being tipped off by unidentified  individuals to alleged criminal law violations at the FDA.  </P> <P> Generic drug firms market their own copycat versions of well-known name-brand  prescription drugs after the original makers' patent protection has expired.  </P> <P> Before the drugs can be sold, they must go through a special FDA licensing  procedure intended to speed them onto the market and promote drug industry  price competition.  </P> <P> Though the companies that are to be indicted are unknown, Par Pharmaceutical  Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., disclosed in October that it, its Quad  Pharmaceuticals subsidiary and a Quad executive were targets of the grand jury  investigation.  </P> <P> Congressional investigators said American Therapeutics of Bohemia, N.Y., and  its Chief Executive Raju Vegesna were subpoenaed last year by the  investigations subcommittee and declined to testify, invoking their  constitutional protection against self-incrimination. American Therapeutics  lawyer David Weeda declined comment.  </P></p>

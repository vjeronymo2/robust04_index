This has had a very positive effect in  stimulating social production, bringing prosperity to urban and  rural markets, making things more convenient for the people,  adjusting the production structure, increasing employment of  labor, and in increasing revenue for public finance. The  individual and private economy has thereby become an important  force within the national economy of the whole province. In  order to further implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National  Congress and of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important statements on  his southern inspection tour, also to more rapidly and more  effectively develop the individual and private economy in our  province, and to thereby promote the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of Hubei's national economy, the following  has been decided upon:    1. Further Emancipation of Minds, Greater Unanimity of  Concepts    1) The individual and private economy is an organic part of  China's socialist market economy; it is a new growth sector in  the developing social productive forces. Personnel engaged in  the individual and private economy are workers in the  construction of socialism. Rapid development of the individual  and private economy is one of the major moves toward the  establishment of the system of socialist market economy, and  toward raising the national economy of the entire province to a  new height of accomplishment.    2) The following ideology is to guide the development of  Hubei's individual and private economy in Hubei: It must be  guided by the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the  fundamental political line of the party must be upheld, as must  be "the three advantageous" criteria, the principle of the  priority of the public ownership system with its long-term  coexistence with elements of multiple other economic forms, and  also the principle of competition on equal terms and the  principle of common development. Our central concerns must be  the establishment of the socialist market economy, improvement  of the external environment, accelerated regional legislation,  standardization of business procedures, and accelerating the  development of the individual and private economy throughout the  entire province.    3) In all places, in all sectors, and especially among  leading cadres at all levels, there has to be a further  emancipation of minds, outdated concepts shall be revised, and  the important position and function of the individual and  private economy shall gain full recognition. While we shall  continue to strengthen the public ownership system,  extraordinary measures shall at the same time be adopted to  arouse enthusiasm in all quarters to achieve a breakthrough  development in the further promotion of the individual and  private economy.    2. Expending Great Efforts To Achieve the Objective of  Developing the Individual and Private Economy    4) For the period from 1993 to 1995, the overall  developmental targets of Hubei's individual and private economy  are: Each year one large step forward and throughout the three  years one great development. On the foundation already laid in  1992, we shall, up to the year 1995, double the number of  individually operated industrial and commercial businesses, the  total number of privately run enterprises, the number of persons  engaged in the said establishments, and achieve twice as much  output value and twice as much business volume, namely get to  1.2 million enterprises, 2 million persons, and 30 billion yuan,  respectively. At the same time, great efforts shall be made to  improve the trade structure of the individual and private  economy, and to accelerate the productive, scientific, and  export-oriented development of privately run enterprises.    3. Simplifying Registration Procedure, Broadening the Scope  of Business Operations    5) All secondary and tertiary industries primarily financed  by one or more individuals (excluding nonprofit enterprises)  shall be considered falling within the scope of enterprises that  have to be registered and administered as individually operated  industrial and commercial businesses or as privately run  enterprises. With the exception of party and government  personnel, staff and workers employed in industrial and  commercial enterprises, presently serving military personnel,  and students at schools--anyone capable of running a business  may--on the evidence of his/her proof of identity and other  relevant documents, apply to the local administrative organ in  charge of industrial and commercial affairs for registration.  New entrepreneurs in remote border areas and in impoverished  mountain districts may be allowed to start business first and to  attend to the prescribed registration later.    6) Individually operated industrial and commercial  businesses  and privately run enterprises may apply to be allowed to prefix  their own name with the name of their county or higher ranking  administrative district, and their registration and  administration may be carried out at the different  administrative levels. Privately run enterprises of certain  scale, whether of single proprietorship or whether partnerships,  may add "gong si" [company] to their names.    7) Individually operated industrial and commercial  businesses  and privately run enterprises shall be encouraged to set up  productive, scientific, and export-oriented enterprises.  Registration requirements, as to number of people employed and  amount of registered capital, may be lowered for scientific and  export-oriented privately run enterprises during their initial  stage of operations. Relevant departments shall be supportive of  tertiary industries in the areas of education, cultural affairs,  public health, tourism, and consultative services.    8) Individually operated industrial and commercial  businesses  and privately run enterprises may trade in all lines of business  and all kinds of products which it is permissible to trade in,  according to state and provincial government provisions. As to  products which it is not permitted to trade in, a one-time trade  may be transacted with the prior approval of a people's  government of county or higher rank or with the approval of an  organ authorized by the governments, provided it will not  adversely affect the overall situation.    9) Business may be conducted in any form or pattern. Where  appropriate prerequisites exist, privately run enterprises may  operate, with the approval of the authority in charge of their  registration, as group corporations, and may also, with the  approval of the relevant authority, set up enterprises on the  shareholding system.    10) Individually operated industrial and commercial  businesses and privately run enterprises may take over  management under contract, lease, or purchase state-owned and  collective-owned enterprises or institute joint business  operations with them. If public property is placed under private  business management, the relevant authority shall effect an  appraisal of assets, ensure that value of government-owned or  collective-owned assets is maintained or increased, that  ownership status of the assets is not changed, and that there is  no change in the character of the operations carried out by the  individual or private enterprises.    11) Individually operated industrial and commercial  businesses and privately run enterprises shall be encouraged to  undertake Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative  enterprises with foreign business firms, also to extend their  business operations to overseas. Where necessary prerequisites  exist, privately run enterprises may take up foreign trade,  either jointly with foreign trade units or through agencies, and  may also, according to regulations, report their import-export  trading right to higher authority for record.    4. Improving Business Environment    12) Governments at all levels shall incorporate the plant  layout and the various market constructions of  individually-operated industrial and commercial businesses and  of privately run enterprises into the urban development plan of  the locality in question. Market construction shall be  accelerated by "raising capital in a multiplicity of ways, with  a multiplicity of participants, but with unified management and  commonly shares benefits," as well as according to the principle  of "benefits to accrue to whoever has invested capital." Units  and individuals are encouraged to start up various kinds of  markets, and the objective that we shall all strive for  energetically is to increase the total number of wholesale  markets from 91 in 1992 to 150 by the latter part of the Eighth  Five-Year Plan. At the head of this development shall be the  large- and medium-sized cities and fairly large commodity  collecting and distributing centers. They shall initiate two to  three large-scale wholesale markets of substantial capacity and  broad effective influence to outlying areas, and shall also  initiate a series of medium and small-scale wholesale markets of  local character, as also one to two wholesale markets that will  rank among the ten large wholesale markets of the entire  country. At the same time, great efforts shall be expended on  the effective establishment of border trade markets.    13) The relevant authorities shall plan for and be most  supportive in supplying land needed for production and business  operations of privately run enterprises. If it shall become  necessary for special reasons to dismantle or relocate business  sites or plants, the government at the location in question  shall reach an appropriate agreement beforehand with the  original user of the land.    14) The authorities in charge in medium- and small-sized  cities and county market towns shall, in accordance with the  overall city development plan, energetically support the  reconstruction of walls and residences along the streets turning  them into retail shops. They shall designate certain sections as  early-morning markets, as night markets, or in residential  districts designate the two sides on nonarterial roads for  stalls and crowds of vendors, and also appropriately arrange for  business sites for individually operated industrial and  commercial businesses and privately run enterprises.    15) New privately run enterprises that are experiencing  difficulties during their initial period of operations in paying  legally prescribed taxes, may be granted reductions or  exemptions in their industrial and commercial income tax for  their first year, unless the tax law explicitly prohibits  reduction or exemption of a tax for certain products or in case  of the "eight small" [ba xiao 0360 1420] enterprises. If further  difficulties are experienced beyond the first years, they may be  granted further tax reduction or exemption, depending on the  circumstances and on obtaining approval, according to the proper  procedure under the current system of the tax administration.    16) Individually operated businesses and privately run  enterprises whose development, production, and marketing of a  new product has been reported to the relevant authority and  approved by it, may, if their standards are of "national  ranking," be granted two to three years of tax reduction or  exemption, and if of "provincial ranking," be given tax  reduction and exemption for one to two years. If their  difficulties persist after expiration of the said periods, they  may be granted further tax reduction or exemption on obtaining  approval, according to the proper procedure under the current  system of the tax administration.    17) Enterprises set up by individually operated businesses  and privately run enterprises with foreign firms as joint  ventures or cooperative management enterprises shall enjoy the  benefits of preferential taxation policies accorded by the state  to foreign-invested enterprises. Scientific and export-oriented  enterprises instituted by individually operated businesses and  privately run enterprises shall enjoy the benefit of  preferential taxation policies.    18) Tax offices shall collect taxes from individually  operated businesses and privately run enterprises according to  law. Arbitrary increases or reductions in taxes are not  permissible.    19) All relevant state agencies and units shall show  solicitude for and shall support individually operated  businesses and privately run enterprises, and shall help dispel  their anxieties and resolve their difficulties.    20) In the appraisal of products, in adjudging high quality  and fitness for exhibition, in import-export formalities, in the  conferring of titles to their personnel, and in checking for  permission to travel abroad, individually operated industrial  and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises shall be  treated the same as state-owned or collective-owned enterprises;  examinations shall be conducted and approval granted by the  authorities in charge according to prescribed procedures.    5. Protection of Legitimate Rights    21) Any arbitrary imposition of fees, levies, and fines on  individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises  shall definitely be stopped. Apart from charges and fines  prescribed by law and regulations and charges and fines  authorized by the state and the provincial authorities in charge  of such collections, arbitrarily decreed fees and fines,  wherever and whosesoever, are all invalid. Legitimate charges  and fines must not exceed appropriate limits and standards. The  various charges and standards shall be properly adjusted and  made public. If individually operated businesses and privately  run enterprises are subjected to arbitrary charges, levies, and  fines in violation of law, regulations, and administrative  rules, they may be firmly rejected by the associations of  individual workers and associations of private enterprises, and  individually operated industrial and commercial businesses and  privately run enterprises shall have the right to refuse  payment. They may, furthermore, report such incidents directly  to the local government or to the individual and private economy  leading teams.    22) No unit or government agency whatsoever may, for reasons  of initiating an economic entity, leasing out business sites,  providing services, and taking up shares, change the economic  character of individually operated businesses and privately run  enterprises, nor may they arbitrarily transfer their assets.  There must be no "incorporation into one's unit" and no "linking  up for support" in these business operations. The authorities in  charge shall reassess the economic character of state-owned and  collective-owned enterprises who are such only in name but not  in reality.    23) Business licenses serve to certify the legitimate  business operations of individually operated businesses and  privately run enterprises. No unit or individual other than  those of the state agencies in charge of industry and commerce  are legally authorized to retrieve or cancel these licenses. If  economic losses are inflicted on individually operated  businesses and privately run enterprises by action that exceeded  the authority of an agency, the person in charge of that agency  must bear responsibility to compensate for such losses.    24) The life and property of those engaged in individually  operated businesses and privately run enterprises shall be  absolutely protected. With due approval, security organizations  may be set up at large- and medium-sized markets and integrated  specialized markets. Criminal acts that infringe upon the  legitimate rights and interests of individually operated  businesses and privately run enterprises shall be punished  according to law by the public security and judicial agencies.    6. Enhance Organizational Guidance    25) Party committees and governments at all levels shall  enhance their guidance of the individual and private economy. In  the same manner as this has been stressed in the case of  state-owned and collective-owned enterprises, the same stress  should be exercised in the case of the individual and private  economy. There has to be effective coordination and proper  handling of the major problems in the development and  administration of the individual and private economy.    26) Party committees and governments at all levels shall  express strong approbation of outstanding contributions made by  individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises.  Every unit of the news media shall actively propagate incidents  of such exemplary cases, propagate the standing and functions of  the individual and private economy, so as to create a beneficial  public opinion and atmosphere, favorable to the accelerated  development of the individual and private economy.    27) The departments concerned shall do an effective job in  organizing participation of individually operated businesses and  privately run enterprises, of their own initiative and volition,  at such activities as studies and training, so as to raise their  overall quality. They shall encourage them to freely pursue  their business interests, continuously expand the scope of their  business operations, striving to become "giants en  miniature." They shall educate and guide those engaged in  individually operated businesses and privately run enterprises  to abide by and implement the laws, rules, and regulations of  the state and all provisions of policy, and to arrive at a state  of "observing discipline and obeying the law," and of "honorable  conduct of all business operations." Where conditions would be  suitable for it, privately run enterprises may establish party  or youth league organizations and staff and workers unions.    28) Supervision and administrative control of the individual  and private economy must continuously be strengthened. Illegal  activities, such as evading taxes and resisting taxation,  manufacturing and selling counterfeit and spurious goods,  fraudulent purchasing and selling, and gaining dominant position  in the market by fraudulent means, must be investigated and  appropriately dealt with. Persons operating businesses without  license must be urged to register, and those still refusing to  register shall be ordered to cease operations.    29) According to the party's policy of "uniting, assisting,  guiding, and educating," industrial and commercial associations  of all ranks shall step up efforts toward strengthening contacts  between representatives of the individual and private economy.  Their education shall nurture "patriotism, respect for one's  trade, and a law-abiding attitude," and their opinions and  demands should be promptly made know, so that their legitimate  rights and interests may be protected, and to have these  associations function as effective intermediaries. They should  also participate in the formulation of plans for the development  of the individual and private economy, in the formulation of  relevant policy, and in commending meritorious achievements.  Associations of workers in individually operated businesses and  associations of privately run enterprises of all ranks shall  give full scope to self-education, self-administration, and  mutual service among one's own members, so as to promote the  healthy development of the individual and private economy.    30) The Industry and Commerce Bureau, together with relevant  departments, shall formulate enforcement provisions for the  present decision.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Fighting in Cuito has put in jeopardy the Angolan  peace talks taking place in Lusaka. The Union of the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] is blaming the government for the  cease-fire violation. UNITA is even questioning the  continuation of the peace negotiations. Alcides Sakala, UNITA  representative in Brussels, stated that his movement wants the  dialogue but the government's attitude does not allow this:    [Begin Sakala recording] We believe there is no military  solution for Angola's problem. We need to find a solution  through negotiations, a peace solution. But for as long as the  government persists in this irresponsible and criminal policy,  we believe this is an attack, a serious attack on the Angolan  peace process, and the government is still persisting in this  irresponsible strategy. We believe that we need to find peace  for Angola, we need to negotiate it. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

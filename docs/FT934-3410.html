			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Israel switches to natural gas - Six international companies invited to tender Israel has invited six international energy construction companies to bid for contracts to build natural gas-fired electricity generation facilities. The move is part of Israel's strategy to convert power generation to natural gas once supply contracts are signed with Qatar and Egypt. Both Arab states have officially denied Israeli claims that advanced agreements have been drawn up, but Mr Moshe Shahal, Israel's energy minister, said again this week the Qatar deal would be signed before the end of the month. The energy ministry said yesterday the six companies - SRI of the US, Bateman of South Africa, Arthur D Little and British Gas from the UK, Sofregas of France and Tractebel from Belgium - have also been asked to bid on the transmission of natural gas to Israel. The companies are required to consider three separate potential supply routes - transportation of liquid natural gas by ship either to a Mediterranean port or to Eilat on the Red Sea. The third option is to bring natural gas by pipeline from Egypt. The energy ministry said the bids should be completed within a month.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm RATES AT the short end of the money markets stayed high for most of the day, as traders settled down to the idea of a hold on UK interest rates until March. Some dealers suggested the Bank of England had this week deliberately traded in a manner designed to cool speculation over rates. 'It has operated in a steady, non-hystrionic fashion,' said one senior dealer. 'It has been doing its best to maintain the status quo in the markets, and I think it has succeeded.' There was little paper on offer to ease the money rates, as the Bank stayed out of the market until noon. The forecast shortage was lower than expected at Pounds 750m. The shortfall was mainly comprised of treasury bills and maturing assistance. Exchequer transactions provided liquidity of about Pounds 590m. The Bank of England purchased band one and two bank bills totalling just Pounds 21m at rates of 10 3/8 per cent before lunch. Rates were somewhat easier when the Bank stepped in with help amounting to Pounds 529m in band one treasury and bank bills, and band two bank paper, all at 10 3/8 per cent. However, it took late assistance of Pounds 240m to bring the overnight rate - which had been trading at more than 11 per cent during the day - down by a significant amount. Overnight money closed at 10 3/8 - 1/4 per cent, thus promising an easier day tomorrow. The one week rate, which edged as high as 10- 9/16 per cent during the day, closed at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent. The key three months interbank rate, which shadows base rates, was steady at 10 1/4 - 3/16 per cent. In the futures market, the March short sterling contract was looking for a cut in rates next month, as it closed at 89.87. This implies an interest rate of 10.13 per cent, lower than in recent days. Call rates in Germany eased from 9.55/65 to 9.50/60 per cent, as payments of government notes and a cash injection through a repurchase agreement boosted liquidity. About DM6bn was expected to enter the banking system yesterday through principal and interest payments on the government notes. In the US, the funds rate was trading at 4 1/16 per cent, compared with the perceived target of 4 per cent. The Federal Reserve added liquidity through a Dollars 1.5bn customer repurchase agreement.</p>

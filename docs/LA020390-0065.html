"On this surface it could have been a much closer match because she  usually has a big serve. But she made simple mistakes."  </P> <P> Graf meets Manuela Maleeva of Switzerland in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Maleeva, ranked eighth in the world, beat big-serving Brenda Schultz of The  Netherlands, 6-2, 6-0.

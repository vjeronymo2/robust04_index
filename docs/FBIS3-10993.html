			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>   [Text] The latest CID/GALLUP poll reveals that seven out of  10 Panamanian citizens believe that the United States must  maintain its bases in Panama. Additionally, six out of 10  Panamanians think that the cost of living has increased the last  four months. The survey conducted exclusively for EL PANAMA  AMERICA details that 69 percent of 1,218 people polled hope that  the U.S. Southern Command remains in Panama after the year 2000,  and 23 percent reject the U.S. presence.    Regarding the cost of living increase, it is mostly felt by  40-year-old women and those with a high school education.  Despite the cost of living increase experienced by Panamanians,  the poll showed that 62 percent believe the country's situation  will improve in the next two years.    Regarding the creation of jobs, nearly half of those  interviewed said the government is responsible for hiring more  people in government positions, but four out of 10 Panamanians  think the private sector must increase its efforts to create new  jobs.    The view of those polled contrasts with the objectives of  government and international organizations economists, who think  the state must reduce its payroll, which employs 140,000  officials earning monthly wages totalling 69 million balboas.    The CID/GALLUP poll also revealed 55 percent of those polled  prefer to work in the private sector and only 27 percent favor a  job in the public sector.</p>

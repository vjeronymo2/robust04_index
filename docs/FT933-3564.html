			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Inflation watch proves unsettling TAKE another cigarette from the packet. Light up, sit back and draw deeply. If you dwell for too long on the heights to which the US bond market has climbed, you'll need something to steady your nerves; and after all, smoking is now cheaper than it's been for years. Cigarette prices have become one of the most powerful symbols of this deflationary era. Last month, the price of cigarettes tumbled by no less than 25.6 per cent. The price war sparked by Philip Morris earlier this year, when it announced a cut in the price of its Marlboro brand for a trial period (later made permanent), finally hit home. The downswing in cigarette prices accounted for the 0.6 per cent fall in the producer price index for finished goods in August, the biggest drop for more than two years. Without tobacco, the figures released on Friday showed a 0.2 per cent rise for the month. After the three previous months of declines (reversing the up-tick in spring which seemed to herald a rise in inflation), the latest figures brought the annual rise in the producer price index down to a paltry 0.6 per cent. The figures sparked yet another round of buying in the bond market's latest two-month surge. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond staged a one-point rally, driving the yield down to 5.87 per cent. At that level, the yield was seven basis points lower than a week before, and around 70 basis points lower than at the beginning of August. It all feels like a year ago, when weak August employment and prices figures raised questions about the strength of the US recovery. The bond market bulls had something else to celebrate last week: a sharp setback in the gold price. The rally which had taken the price of gold from less than Dollars 340 an ounce to nearly Dollars 400 appeared in the early summer to herald a belief that resurgent inflation was about to make a come-back. On Thursday, though, no less than Dollars 14 an ounce was wiped off the price of gold, leaving it at around Dollars 350 an ounce and putting the market back close to its lowest for seven years. Weak oil prices - which contributed to the August slump in the producer price index - have also raised the spirits of bond buyers. Nevertheless, the Treasury market is becoming a dangerous place to be for those of a nervous disposition. Just a day before Friday's producer price numbers, the price of the long bond dropped a point and a half, driven down by news that the powerful House Ways and Means Committee was to review the exemption from withholding tax of foreign investors (the withholding tax was lifted in 1984). Given the scale of the US budget deficit, and the role played by foreigners in financing it, no-one seriously expects a withholding tax to be reimposed (a more likely reason for foreigners to stay out of the Treasury market is the weakening dollar.) However, the market was looking for the chance of a correction, and the withholding tax scare seemed as good an opportunity as any. Were the last two days' trading a warning of greater volatility to come? Speaking during the relative calm of Wednesday, Mr Leif Olsen, a former chief economist of Citicorp, who now runs his own consultancy, Ecom Consultants, cautioned that the bond market was about to enter a more volatile period. After several months of low inflation, one or two months of higher-than-average price rises will be needed to keep inflation for the year at the 2.5 to 3 per cent level that most economists expect (the recent figures have not prompted economists to review their inflation forecasts downwards, whatever the market markets' outlook). When the monthly data show a bigger rise in prices, how will the bond market react? Investors will be hard-pushed to tell whether it is just one month of higher prices, or whether the long-run trend has turned up, says Mr Olfsen. Mr David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services of Chicago, has a similar point to make. Writing ahead of last week's figures, he pointed to the likely inflationary effects of the mid-west flood on food prices, and the imposition of a gasoline tax. 'The odds are high that there will be at least one or two months of 5 per cent inflation at annual rates during the fourth quarter. If industrial raw materials are also firming, there will probably be a setback in bond prices and the Fed will have another serious discussion about whether it should hike short-term interest rates,' he said.

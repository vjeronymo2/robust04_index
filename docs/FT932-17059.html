			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Why property factor may harm recovery Sir, Your leader, 'A question of confidence' (March 27), suggests that growth in industry's output is the only plausible motor for recovery. My experience of the fragility of confidence, gained from visiting all parts of the UK in the past eight months, leads me to agree with you. But with one caveat. Industry will need to be able to raise the necessary working capital to increase its capacity to meet any increase in demand. Recent research published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows the degree to which UK banks have relied on the security of commercial property to support lending to commerce generally. With property values falling and likely to continue to do so for some time, businesses (and particularly the smaller ones) may have difficulty in raising the short-term facilities so necessary now. On a tour of the US in the past week I have found a different position there. US banks appear more ready to base their lending on their own judgment of the business prospects of their customers. In the US there is no longer a correlation between property values and the level of lending to industry, whereas in Britain this is very strong. Thus US industry does not suffer from an artificial constraint on its facilities resulting from movements in a market often far removed from its own. The recovery you seek will require a substantial contribution from smaller businesses. UK banks have a vital role as the monopoly suppliers of capital to this sector. We must hope that they will be able to separate their often unhappy experiences in direct property lending from this critical role in the drive for recovery.

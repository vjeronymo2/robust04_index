			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by State Council Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze at </F> inaugural conference of Tbilisi branch of Citizen's Union of  Georgia held at the Philharmonic Society concert hall in Tbilisi  on 15 January -- recorded]    [Text] The Citizens' Union, as a political organism, as an  organization which, if not today, then in the future, must  become a pillar of the state and our top-level politics, has not  emerged on the wave of destruction. We did not [words  indistinct] down with this government and we do not believe that  a new government will work miracles. We came with the belief  that destruction must stop in Georgia. Anarchy must stop in  Georgia. This terrible process must be stopped and let us all  together start construction. If this happens and if these are  not our union's empty words, then we will gain a civil  [Georgian: mokalakeobrivi] right to be a leading and fundamental  force in a democratic Georgian state, in the state of Georgia.    I can draw a more dramatic picture [of the situation in  Georgia] than the orator who spoke before me. I profoundly  respect Batoni Chkheidze, who is one of the greatest patriots of  the [Tbilisi] city and, also, an expert in his profession. I  can draw an even more terrible picture. I can say how many  people are perishing, including how many have starved to death,  how many people are being killed, how much violence there is,  how many houses are being destroyed, how many streets are full  of [uncollected] refuse and so on and so forth.    You will then, naturally, ask me what we should do. There  are two ways. One way is to lose heart and say that nothing  will save this country. I am categorically against this. This  is not true. The country can be saved. I have said it before  and I am repeating this for a third time. Georgia will be  saved. These are not empty words and phrases. The country will  be saved, if we do something about it, if we start working, if  everybody minds their own business, if professionals do their  job, if the government does its job and if citizens and the  government struggle together to save the country.    I spent a day and a half in Turkey. There was a television  report about (?the visit). One cannot report everything. It is  impossible to report everything. The television camera fails to  catch everything. I decided to refrain from a television  interview only to tell you first about my impression. We were  received there as worthy representatives of a worthy country.  And, not only there [in Turkey]. In every country I have  visited--and there will probably be more visits in future  because we have no other choice-- we (?were received) as  representatives of a democratic country which enjoys full rights  and has a future. They are ready to have relations with us.    In Turkey, I remembered Ataturk's words. I think that the  television carried this. This person who saved Turkey--and you  can see his pictures anywhere you go in Turkey--said: we need a  strong and good neighbor east of Turkey, and Georgia will be  such a neighbor. They are saying this today as well. The  current president and prime minister are saying this: we need  Georgia as a good neighbor and friend. When I was talking about  neighborhood and friendship, [Turkish President Suleyman]  Demirel said: I do not agree with you, we are brothers, we want  to build fraternal relations with you, with our strong and good  neighbor Georgia. They believe in us more than we do in  ourselves, more than we believe in our (?abilities).    I do not share the terrible pessimism which has hit our  society. We are competing with each other in drawing the most  terrible picture. This applies to any party. This applies to  any parliamentarian. Of course, I do not mean our majority  faction here. [Reference to majority faction in the Georgian  parliament which supports Shevardnadze]. They all believe that  the present government should resign and a new government should  come. I assure you that--of course, this is not an ideal  authority, nor is the head of state ideal, and (?he) can be  blamed for many shortcomings and many disasters--a better  government will come tomorrow.    Young people spoke who here today, Zurab [apparently, Zurab  Zhvania, the secretary-general of the Citizens' Union and the  leader of the Green Party] and others, will come to the fore.  However, we, representing an older generation, should show and  prove that we are able to struggle together with them. We can  teach them how to live and struggle. We will struggle until we  are alive.</p>

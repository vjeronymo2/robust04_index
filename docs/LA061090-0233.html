			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS WAX CREATIVE AND SHOW THE WRITE STUFF  </P> <P> Forget about Dick and Jane.  </P> <P> In this storybook world, radish-munching rabbits consult psychiatrists, fat  mice inhabit a planet with shopping malls made of Swiss cheese, and scary  creatures speak through Ouija boards.  </P> <P> And every one of the 274 youthful authors receives a prize.  </P> <P> Elementary and junior high students from 13 school districts displayed their  works at the East San Gabriel Valley Reading Council's Young Authors'  Conference, held May 22 at the Performing Arts Center at Citrus College in  Glendora.  </P> <P> This year's offerings ranged from whimsical fantasy to serious social  commentary, with some instructional tomes thrown in for good measure.  </P> <P> There is the psychological drama of Billabee Rabbit, who prefers radishes to  carrots. In "The Rabbit Who Ate Radishes" by Alisia Tran, a second-grade pupil  at Cullen School in Glendora, Billabee's concerned parents take him to a  psychiatrist to help him get over his craving. But Billabee's preference  prevails in the end when he turns red after eating one radish too many at a  rabbit picnic. His color enables him to scare away a fox with a phobia. (He's  afraid of red.)  </P> <P> Rachel Durand, a fifth-grader at Don Julian School in Bassett, took a look at  crime and violence in her poem "Gangs."  </P> <P>  Bad, dumb  </P> <P>  Fighting, hurting, stealing  </P> <P>  Graffiti, knives, drugs, names  </P> <P>  Killing, ending, dying  </P> <P>  Sad, pain  </P> <P>  Death  </P> <P>  On a lighter note, William Young, a fifth-grader at Evergreen School in  Diamond Bar, spun a first-person tale of being abducted by fat mice in UFOs who  transport him to a mouse planet where he shops at a mall made of Swiss cheese.  </P> <P> Jennifer Valencia, a third-grade pupil at Dalton School in Azusa, offered tips  on building a snowman:  </P> <P> "The first thing you've got to find is a mountain with snow. Then park your car  or else your car will run through a house."  </P> <P> In "The Moving Glass," Ann Mijares, an eighth-grader at Torch Middle School in  Industry, told a ghostly story involving the supernatural Amy, who speaks  through a Ouija board and gets even when people ask her rude questions.  </P> <P> Linda Welch, staff development specialist at the Hacienda La Puente Unified  School District's Instructional Services Center, said the annual event, now in  its ninth year, is designed to reward and stimulate literary efforts.  </P> <P> "There has to be a reason to write," said Welch, who chaired the conference.  "And when a student is honored in front of a thousand people, that's got to be  an incentive."  </P> <P> An estimated 1,200 people -- young authors and their parents, friends and  teachers -- jammed the auditorium for the afternoon event. Certificates were  awarded to each participant, and about 50 blue ribbons were bestowed for  special efforts.  </P> <P> Some students watched in delight as their stories were dramatized by  Imagination Machine, a children's theater group based in Orange.  </P> <P> Dawn Brandi Anderson, a fifth-grader at Los Altos Elementary School in Hacienda  Heights who offered a poetic appreciation of felines in her illustrated story  "Cats in the Mood," said her work was inspired by real life.  </P> <P> "I was thinking of my own cat, and I tried to be as descriptive as I could,"  she said.  </P> <P> She added that she wants to be a children's author of "realistic fiction" when  she grows up. Meanwhile, she is getting plenty of feedback at home.  </P> <P> "My dad, mom and brother look at my work," she said, "and give me  encouragement."  </P> <P> Other participants showed less interest in a writing career. Michael D'Elia, a  second-grader at Magnolia School in Azusa who wrote and illustrated "What I Saw  at the Ocean," said he has other career plans: second baseman for the Angels.  </P></p>

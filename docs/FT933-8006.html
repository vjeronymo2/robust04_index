			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Sedgwick Sedgwick's last rights issue in 1986 marked a turning point for all the wrong reasons. Group revenue has since risen by 26 per cent, but expenses by more than 40 per cent. That is reflected in an unrelenting squeeze on margins, first as insurance rates softened in the late 1980s and latterly as underwriting losses have eroded capacity in the London market. No surprise, then, that yesterday's rights price is little more than half that offered seven years ago. The acquisition of Noble Lowndes from TSB looks better timed than the move into US brokerage at the top of the cycle in 1986. Whether Sedgwick will be able to create a one-stop shop for insurance broking and benefits consultancy remains open to question. But even without cross-selling between the two sides of the business, demand for consulting should pick up as the economy turns. A purchase price of around 14 times last year's earnings, once the impact of TSB's pension fund holiday on Noble Lowndes' profits is stripped out, does not look over the odds. Since 75 per cent of Sedgwick's revenue will come from insurance broking after the acquisition, though, its fortunes are still tied to the insurance cycle. Waiting for US rates to harden has so far proved thankless. Halting the steady shrinkage of London market capacity depends on Lloyd's success in attracting corporate capital. The golden scenario for Sedgwick - in which US rates harden as the capacity of the London market increases - looks unlikely indeed.</p>

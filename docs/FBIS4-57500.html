			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elsy Fors: "The Unveiling of the </F> Adjustments"]    [Text] Havana -- On 5 May, Havana woke up shaken by a  double tornado. The winds, unexpected and violent, ushered in  the issue of the official war declaration on the "currency  hoarders" -- the local nickname given to speculators.    Forty-eight hours after the closing of a special session of  the National Assembly of the People's Government (Cuban  Parliament), the Council of State complied with its first  mandate -- to take strong action against those who have an  illegitimate patrimony, be it the result of robbery,  speculation, or the diversion of public funds.    Other measures, which will affect the entire population,  will  be announced more calmly and in no more than 18 months. Cubans  are currently concerned over a prospective rise in the cost of  living, but they are willing to face it so long as the national  economy and their own living standards improve in the long run.    For over three decades, Cubans have lived under nearly  absolute state protection. They did not have to worry about  paying taxes or any other fiscal obligations, but the days of  the paternalistic state seem to be drawing to a close.    The shortcomings resulting from the collapse of Cuba's  leading commercial partner in the former socialist bloc  contributed to the shortcomings prompted by the U.S. blockade,  internal deficiencies, and the absence of fiscal obligations to  the depletion of the Treasury.    Now, without any more delays, the country will proceed to  restore order to its internal finances. With this objective,  the National Assembly met in a special session on 1 and 2 May.    According to the figures revealed by Jose Luis Rodriguez,  minister president of the State Committee for Finance, at the  end of March, currency excess in the population's hands amounted  to 11.636 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official  Cuban exchange rate) while the budget deficit amounted to 4.2  billion pesos.    Cuban academic sources are of the opinion that the excess  money in the hands of the population -- equivalent to  approximately 15 months of wages for all the workers in the  country -- is unequally distributed. Therefore, out of the 59  percent of this amount deposited in banking accounts, one-fourth  corresponds to only 1 percent of savings accounts. [sentence as  received]    The situation became difficult in 1987, the last year in  which the budget was virtually balanced. Since then, in the  first measures implemented to correct the imbalance, the state  assumed the weight of the adjustment, by issuing currency  without compensatory backing.    Between 1989 and 1993, the country's import capacity fell  from more than $8 billion to only $2.2 billion. This had a  multiplying effect on domestic agriculture and industrial  production, which were virtually paralyzed for lack of fuel,  fertilizers, and other materials.    The main effects of the crisis on the population were a  decrease in food, scarcity of medicine, and a severe reduction  in electricity and urban transportation. Besides that, most  Cubans had to turn to the black market to obtain basic products  such as soap, detergent, and cooking oil.    The reform was begun without a set model. In what were the  first firm steps, on 14 August, the Cuban Government  decriminalized the holding and use of dollars and other strong  foreign currencies among the population. It also changed a  large part of the agriculture sector, which had been  government-managed up to then, into cooperatives.    This was followed by an in-depth reorganization of the  state apparatus in April 1994, which reduced ministries and  payrolls.    According to specialists at the Center of Cuban Economic  Studies (CEEC), the increase in tourism -- the second most  important foreign exchange generator after sugar -- the increase  in the production of nickel and domestic oil pointed toward the  initiation of a partial recovery at the end of 1993. This  prompted the government to find the necessary national consensus  for the adjustments required to stimulate the incipient  improvement.    This was how a process called "the workers parliament"  started and the country's problems and the possible solutions  were studied in 80,000 assemblies held at work centers. The  common denominator of those assemblies was the unanimous demand  for the government to act against the people who profited from  the country's shortages.    The country's finances, however, require something more than  the elimination of "money hoarders." In this sense, the  corresponding minister proposed that tax revenues be increased  and that savings and economic efficiency be encouraged. He also  proposed that several subsidies be eliminated and did not deny  the possibility of a future currency replacement.    Jose Luis Rodriguez recommended that currency be collected  by  increasing the prices on fuel, cigarettes, and alcoholic  beverages. Also, that electricity, postal, and telephone rates  be augmented, dependent on the improvement of those services,  which are currently deficient.    In an effort to promote economic efficiency, several months  ago, material incentives were given to workers in priority  fields such as in the sugar, mining, nickel, and electricity  sectors. This measure has resulted in important production  advancements.    Another of the proposals to obtain revenues was through  taxes. The taxes applied to persons who have been self-employed  for the past year will be increased and it is estimated they  will contribute not less than 126 million pesos to the 1994  budget.    The elimination of subsidies is expected. This includes  charging for sports and cultural events, as well as school  lunches, school supplies for junior and high school students,  and some medicine such as Neovitamin -- a vitamin supplement  distributed without cost to the population since the outbreak of  the optic neuritis epidemic in 1993.    Regarding the replacement of the currency, economists such  as  Osvaldo Martinez, the president of the Economic Affairs  Committee in the parliament, believe the measure would not have  a lasting effect on the reappearance of the black market. Its  defenders, however, claim the change attempts to achieve other  financial control objectives.    The measures, which are still not all known, according to  the  parliament's final resolution "will lead to gradually being able  to surmount the current difficulties" and will ensure the  protection of the low-income sectors.    Despite all the foreseeable difficulties, the truth is that  Cuba is launching an independent development, which foreign  specialists and investors consider to be more advantageous in  the long term.</p>

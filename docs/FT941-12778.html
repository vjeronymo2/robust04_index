			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keeping an eye on banks Sir, I wish I shared the confidence of Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, that banks are committed to providing finance to small businesses ('George calls for a cut in recriminations', January 18). Chartered accountants around the UK report that their clients are still experiencing significant problems with banks. Small ventures today are too often unable to obtain finance at anything like reasonable interest rates. Just as worrying are reports of banks offering finance only if clients accept unwanted and/or unduly expensive insurance products as part of the financing package. The governor is right that very many small businesses lack financial and management skills. Good business advice, whether from Training and Enterprise Councils, Business Links or chartered accountants, is generally a crucial element in the success or failure of small businesses. I also welcome the emphasis on the need for banks to ensure that lending staff are properly trained. I hope the shift towards specialist business centres in banks does not mitigate against small companies. The Bank of England report places small business finance on the public agenda. But translating that into a new era of understanding and support from bank managers requires action on the ground. My members and their clients will no doubt be watching closely.

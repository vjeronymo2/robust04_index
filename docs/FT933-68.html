			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Accountancy: No room for own goals in financing soccer's future - Gerry Boon looks at the world of football club accounts and the implications of putting players on the balance sheet ENGLISH professional football clubs spent more than Pounds 70m buying players in the 1991-92 season, but you would never know it from looking at their balance sheets. At a time when clubs are increasingly turning to banks and shareholders for support, should players be treated as a financial asset rather than an expense to their clubs? This was one of the questions we set out to answer in the 1993 Touche Ross survey of football club accounts, published this week. As part of our annual check on football's financial health, we looked at where the money comes from to finance football and the accounting implications of putting players on the balance sheet. One of the survey's key findings was that in the 1991-92 season, 53 out of the 84 clubs whose accounts were available reported a pre-tax loss. Add to this that auditors qualified their reports on the 1992 accounts on 'going concern' grounds for 27 clubs, and football finances start to look very sick. But our results give a different picture. Professional football clubs are increasingly required to pay their way as businesses. Satellite television deals, new sponsors, tax investigations and the sale of several clubs is focusing attention on their financial position. Clubs also face additional burdens unfamiliar to conventional businesses. For example, the Taylor Report on stadium safety has led to an estimated Pounds 200m of capital expenditure since its publication in January 1990. Substantial investment is required to strengthen the quality of players, because success on the field usually has a direct impact on the club's finances through greater attendance figures. Perhaps the greatest challenge is balancing commercial realism against the demands of the customer, since fans want money spent on players without having to pay higher ticket prices. With few exceptions, clubs can no longer rely on wealthy individual backers. They need to turn to the banks, financial institutions and - like the three quoted English teams - the Stock Exchange. In order to attract investment, they will have to portray their financial position in the best commercial light and demonstrate good financial management. Our survey highlighted one area - player registrations - in which clubs could help themselves to promote a more balanced financial picture. In the 1991-92 season, English first and second division clubs spent Pounds 70m on players, up from Pounds 40 million the previous year. The biggest net spender was Blackburn Rovers (Pounds 6.84m) followed by Derby County (Pounds 4.44m) and Liverpool (Pounds 3.63m). But just four clubs put player registrations on the balance sheet as an intangible asset. And 82 per cent of the 46 clubs in the top two divisions still account for transfer fees through the profit and loss account in the year in which the transfers take place. There are certain advantages to sticking with this traditional way of accounting for transfer fees. It is uncontroversial, involves no judgment in carrying forward costs, is simple to understand and disclose, and means all transfer deals are treated in the same way. It is prudent, consistent with the way club directors view their transfer fee budget and in line with the tax treatment of transfer costs. However, we believe there are two considerable commercial disadvantages to this policy. First, a substantial 'asset' - the players - is not shown in the balance sheet. There is a strong business case that this expenditure is an investment, and not showing it as such conceals the club's true worth. Second, the profit and loss account bears substantial and 'lumpy' charges which may significantly distort the underlying results of the business from year to year. Net transfer income tends to be one of the largest single items in a club's profit and loss account. For example, Blackburn Rovers' Pounds 6.84m transfer fees helped result in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.92m in 1991-92. There are only two ways of expressing the value of transfer fees: either by an additional disclosure in the accounts or by putting players on the balance sheet. Derby County, Portsmouth, Sheffield United and Tottenham Hotspur put players on the balance sheet as an intangible asset. Tottenham and Derby do so only for players they have bought, which they do at 'cost'. Sheffield United use the manager's valuation, and Portsmouth uses the directors' valuation for the whole squad. Nine clubs disclose the aggregate value of the playing squad in their accounts, based on either the directors' or manager's valuation. The exception was Manchester United, which became the first club to have its squad independently valued. Touche Ross calculated the figure at Pounds 24m, which analysts quickly converted into 197p per share. The benefit of an independent valuation is that it lends objective credibility to the value of the business in the eyes of outsiders: shareholders, supporters, financiers and investors. The club realised the importance of communicating its market value to its new audience in the City. Club directors, or the team manager, can, of course, produce their own internal figure. The main advantage is simplicity, although this is perhaps outweighed by the perceived lack of objectivity. Whatever basis is used, disclosure of market value for such an important asset is, I believe, good practice. It is sometimes argued that disclosing player values is not appropriate because they are too subjective, or misleading, or simply too difficult to calculate. Club directors need to tackle certain key issues: whether to use cost or market value; the period over which to depreciate the capitalised value; the residual value of a player at the end of his contract; write-offs in cases of permanent injury; write downs due to a player's loss of form; and how best to protect tax allowances. The solutions are fairly straightforward. Market value can be judged from the prices of recent transfers and other managers' views of what a player is worth. The depreciation period should not exceed the length of the contract period, and the standard European Football Association transfer multiplier (based on a player's age at the end of his contract) can be used to estimate residual values. A permanent diminution in a player's value because of injury will require a write-off, although this may be off-set by any insurance payment received. The most difficult judgment will be on loss of value because of loss of form; a reasoned assessment based on what happens elsewhere in the market will be acceptable. Professional advice should ensure that writing off transfer fees for tax purposes is not jeopardised by capitalisation. Our research showed that there is a lot of hidden talent in football absent from the balance sheet. Based on the disclosed amounts, we estimate that there is about Pounds 250m in players in the Premier League and Pounds 80m in the Football League first division - valuable assets that clubs should be listing alongside their grounds and facilities. By turning players into an asset rather than showing them as an expense, clubs can promote themselves as commercial enterprises at a time when football is coming under greater pressure to perform. If clubs react positively to the changes, everyone wins: fans, players, clubs, shareholders and investors.

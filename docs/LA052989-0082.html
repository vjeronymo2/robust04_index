			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> About 8,000 commercial radio stations nationwide went silent for 30 seconds  Friday to kick off the largest simultaneous promotion in the history of radio  -- a $100-million advertising campaign aimed at highlighting what life would be  like without radio. At 7:42 a.m. EDT, actor James Earl Jones told listeners  that "for the next 30 seconds this station and others would like you to imagine  your life without radio. Imagine if all your days sounded like this. . . . "  The following 30 seconds were filled with silence. Jones then cut in and said,  "Thirty seconds seems like a long time, doesn't it? Now think how radio fills  that silence for you." About 80% of the nation's commercial stations  participated in the opening stage of theyearlong campaign, the Radio  Advertising Bureau said. The campaign reportedly represented the first  industry-wide effort to promote the medium since the first commercial radio  station signed on in 1922. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

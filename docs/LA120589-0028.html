			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CANTINOVA IN AMERICAN MASTERWORKS CONCERT  </P> <P> Ten more lesser-known works by well-known American composers proceeded without  leaving an unusually bold or memorable impression Sunday evening at the third  and final concert of a CalArts-sponsored series devoted to American  Masterworks.  </P> <P> A 20-member vocal group, Cantinova, nonetheless superbly led off the event at  Santa Monica Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Their vibrant vocal sound filled the resonant hall, creating musical lines that  were remarkably full and crisp. Paul Vorwerk conducted the group with vitality,  shaping each phrase carefully and expertly.  </P> <P> Samuel Barber's "Agnus Dei" (1967), the composer's vocal arrangement of his  famous Adagio for Strings (1936), was given special, sensitive attention. Other  notable efforts included Roger Sessions' "Turn, O Libertad"(1944) and the  choral version of Ives' song "General William Booth Enters Into Heaven"(1914).  </P> <P> The second half of the program made use of chamber ensembles with members of  the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players. Charles Griffes' slow, impressionist  Three Tone Pictures (1915), arranged for nine woodwinds and harp, proved the  most ambitious undertaking, though the routine music challenged little of the  players' capabilities.

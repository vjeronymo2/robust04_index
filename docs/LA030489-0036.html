			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDER DITCH CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Only time will tell whether the controversial border ditch will really reduce  drug and illegal alien traffic from Mexico. But, the arrogance and hypocrisy of  the Mexican government in opposing the project is outrageous.  </P> <P> The ditch will be entirely on U.S. land. It will have absolutely no effect on  aliens who are in the U.S. legally, or on any legitimate commerce between the  two countries. But, it will hurt the drug lords and the coyotes who deal in  human misery.  </P> <P> Let's dig the ditch! It's worth a try!  </P> <P> BILL ROSENTHAL  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BECAUSE OF FREE AGENCY, LAST CUT ISN'T DEEPEST FOR ROBINSON, RAMS  </P> <P> Thanks to Plan B free agency, the Rams won't have many painful cuts to make  today when National Football League teams are required to reduce rosters to 47  players.  </P> <P> This could have been the day veterans such as Johnnie Johnson, Jim Collins,  Michael Young and Mickey Sutton took the ax. But those Rams, along with eight  other veterans, were lost to free agency in the off-season, making today's  parings more clear cuts, so to speak.  </P> <P> "It's always hard, facing them," Rams Coach John Robinson said. "I think they  fall into place for the most part. I don't think very often do you find  yourself in a position where two guys are equal and you keep one. I think you  work it out in your mind that you like A better than B.  </P> <P> Here's a look at would could happen, by position.  </P> <P> Quarterback: The Rams will keep three quarterbacks on the roster for Atlanta:  Jim Everett, Mark Herrmann and Steve Dils. When Herrmann is healthy, Dils goes  back to commercial real estate, opening a roster spot for perhaps unsigned  first-round fullback, Cleveland Gary. Jeff Carlson could be headed for the new  developmental squad for rookies and first-year players.  </P> <P> Running backs: The tailbacks are Greg Bell and Gaston Green. Bell, no doubt,  will start against the Falcons. The fullbacks are Buford McGee and Robert  Delpino.  </P> <P> Wide receivers: Henry Ellard, Flipper Anderson, Aaron Cox and Ron Brown.  Anderson, by virtue of his fine summer and Cox's hamstring injury, moves in as  a starter.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to take Aaron Cox a little while to work back into it,"  Robinson said. "I'd like to dodge the issue and say we have three wide  receivers."  </P> <P> Tight ends: Damone Johnson, Pete Holohan and Pat Carter  </P> <P> Offensive line: Seven spots are sewn up by Doug Smith, Jackie Slater, Tom  Newberry, Irv Pankey, Duval Love, Tony Slaton and Robert Cox. The eighth spot  is between rookie tackle Kevin Robbins and guard Warren Wheat.  </P> <P> Defensive line: They'll probably go with five: Alvin Wright, Doug Reed, Shawn  Miller, Bill Hawkins and Mike Piel.  </P> <P> Outside linebacker: The locks are Kevin Greene, Brett Farynairz and Mike  Wilcher. If the Rams go with four here it's between seventh-rounder George  Bethune and second-rounder Brian Smith, who hasn't made much noise, but it's  tough to cut high picks.  </P> <P> Inside linebacker: Fred Strickland, Larry Kelm, Mel Owens, Frank Stams, and a  decision between Richard Brown and rookie Mark Messner. If it's Brown, Messner  could be headed for developmental squad. Brown, a second-year player, doesn't  qualify. Messner seems to have the inside track.  </P> <P> Secondary: With LeRoy Irvin out another three weeks, the cornerbacks are Jerry  Gray, Darryl Henley, Cliff Hicks and Alfred Jackson. At safety are Vince  Newsome, Michael Stewart, Anthony Newman and James Washington.  </P> <P> More about the developmental squad: Players will receive $1,000 per week for  their services (Don't fret, they get to keep their signing bonuses). Before  re-signing with the Rams, a player would first have to clear league waivers.  </P> <P> Another interesting question is the future of linebacker Mark Jerue, fighting  back from another knee surgery. He's weeks away from playing and might be  headed for six-week injured reserve.  </P> <P> Also, can Mike McDonald survive again as the long snapper?  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> According to Ram sources, tight end Damone Johnson's fine of $38,000 was not  waived when he reported to camp last Wednesday after his 38-day holdout.  Because he was under contract and did not report, Johnson was fined $1,000 each  day. Also, contrary to what Johnson told reporters when he reported, the Rams  are not renegotiating his $200,000 contract. . . . Linebacker Fred Strickland,  who had arthroscopic knee surgery in early August, returns to practice this  week. Coach John Robinson said he stands a better chance of playing against  Atlanta than Larry Kelm, who missed the last two games with an injured foot.  </P></p>

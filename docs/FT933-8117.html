			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / French trim overnight rates again THE Bank of France cut overnight rates for the third time in eight days yesterday, continuing its strategy of gradually trimming borrowing costs in the wake of the European currency crisis. The cut came amid firm denials by French monetary officials that they were seeking controls or taxes on foreign exchange flows as a means of curbing speculation against the French currency. The franc strengthened following yesterday's 0.5 percentage point cut in 24-hour borrowing rates to 8.75 per cent. It closed at FFr3.517 to the D-Mark, up from FFr3.544 at Monday's close, but still nearly 10 centimes below its previous European exchange rate mechanism floor rate of FFr3.4305. The currency has stabilised since the end of the last week when revelation of a substantial net deficit in the central bank's foreign exchange reserves raised fears of a prolonged period of high interest rates. These were compounded by comments by Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, that France would propose measures to curb speculation and stabilise the international monetary system. But French monetary officials said yesterday that the idea of reintroducing capital controls was 'totally absurd'. Alternatives, such as taxing foreign exchange transactions or requiring commercial banks to place funds with the central bank to match overseas lending, were also dismissed. 'Restricting the freedom of capital movements would be a move in the opposite direction to the one we want to pursue,' said one financial official. France's objective of closer economic and financial integration between EC countries would be undermined by restrictions on capital flows. Yesterday's interest rate cut still leaves overnight borrowing rates above their pre-crisis levels of 7.75 per cent. The 5-10 day borrowing rate, suspended during the crisis and reintroduced at 10 per cent, was left unchanged. The intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, has also been left at 6.75 per cent since the crisis.</p>

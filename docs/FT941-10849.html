			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Central Asian republics look west for investment Leaders of central Asian republics have been sending signals that they are serious about establishing a stable, friendly environment for economic development. The International Monetary Fund has put its name behind two of the republics, issuing credit to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is negotiating with Uzbekistan. An increasing number of investors have been bypassing Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states for what they perceive to be better opportunities in central Asia, especially in Kazakhstan. This shift has occurred in tandem with Russia's demise as the economic crossroads and clearing house for the 14 ex-Soviet republics. Uzbekistan's recent and sudden conversion to free market policies has been greeted with interest, and some scepticism, since President Islam Karimov has watered down or failed to implement previous reforms. The Uzbek programme, announced on January 23 by presidential decree, promises for the first time to auction off state enterprises publicly; foreigners may bid. The decree also enacts a five-year tax holiday for manufacturers established under more than 50 per cent foreign ownership, and phases out import duties in July 1995. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union two years ago, virtually no western-style privatisation has taken place in Uzbekistan, which is rich in gold and produces a huge cotton crop. Uzbekistan has taken the route of 'collectivisation', the transfer of enterprises to their employees in fixed-price shares. Analysts are taking this policy announcement more seriously because of the trend in other central Asian republics. Mr Karimov is watching his regional rival, Kazakhstan, outpacing Uzbekistan's economic progress, while his own republic has been mired in chaos. The Kazakh president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, last week announced an economic reform programme that goes even further then Uzbekistan's. It freed prices on consumer goods on January 1, set a 1994 budget deficit target of 4 per cent of GNP, and froze state salaries, a risky step in the conservative republic. Kazakhstan is attracting attention primarily because of its tremendous deposits of oil and natural gas. But Mr Nazarbayev has also embarked on what ranks as among the ex-Soviet Union's most ambitious privatisation programmes. Last year, Philip Morris became the first private owner of a large Kazakhstan enterprise, paying Dollars 313m (Pounds 208.6m) for a big cigarette factory and tobacco farms in the capital, Alma-Ata. Now, the government has issued a list of 38 more state-owned enterprises, some employing up to 40,000 people, for auctioning to the foreign bidders. The list includes some long-shots, such as Alma-Ata's central market, but for the first time it allows foreigners to buy metals facilities such as an aluminium plant in the northern city of Pavlodar and a lead and zinc plant in Taldy-Korgan. Later, the government says, it will auction about 7,500 state enterprises to Kazakh citizens under a coupon system. The privatisation programme has impressed westerners who have witnessed the frustration of trying to get started in Russia. 'If you are trying to privatise an enterprise in Russia, a different ministry is passing a new law every day saying you can't do it. In Kazakhstan, you know who to deal with, and they are behind privatisation at the top,' said a western business consultant in Alm-Ata. 'It's very centralised.' In Kyrgyzstan, President Asghar Akayev, frustrated by parliamentary and bureaucratic conservatives, recently obtained more authority to pursue his reformist programme. Kyrgyz voters endorsed Mr Akayev with a 96 per cent approval rating in a national referendum, and he has said he intends to use the result to push ahead with structural reforms and privatisation. Even if the reforms are only partially put into practice, they reflect a greater acknowledgment in the region that the Soviet days are over.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Amnesty in plea to Brazil on human rights Amnesty International yesterday called on candidates in next month's Brazilian elections to make human rights a priority for the next government. In a report highlighting several recent cases of human rights abuse in Brazil, Amnesty also made several recommendations for improving the judicial system as well as the police, who have been implicated in several of the worst abuses. 'The killings and torture can only be stopped if the people elected to government give a high enough priority to actively promoting and protecting human rights,' said the report. The report contained a summary of some of Brazil's recent highly publicised human rights cases. These include the 1992 prison massacre at Carandiru in Sao Paulo, when 111 prisoners were killed by police, and last year's murder of eight street children in Rio de Janeiro. Amnesty also highlighted the problems faced by Brazil's overcrowded prison system and the alleged involvement of off-duty police in 'death squads' hired to kill petty criminals or drug rivals. Brazil has tended to accept, sometimes grudgingly, human rights criticism. Complaints about the Sao Paulo police following the Carandiru massacre led to a sharp fall in the number of civilians killed by the police, from more than 100 a month to about 20 a month. Amnesty said Brazil's police needed 'radical change' in its organisational culture and operations. At present, members of the police are tried in military courts, a hangover from Brazil's 1964-85 military rule. According to Amnesty, such cases should be transferred to civilian courts because military courts fail to convict police in human rights cases. Amnesty is due to meet the two frontrunners in the presidential elections, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, tomorrow.</p>

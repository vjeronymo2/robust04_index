			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Leading Article: G7 under US pressure RARELY CAN a great power have come to an important international meeting with arguments as feeble as those advanced by the US at the meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the group of seven industrial countries in Washington, over the weekend. But the arguments were not merely indefensible; they were dangerous. Those who recalled the row between Germany and the US that preceded the stock market crash of October 1987 must have shuddered, especially since an exceptionally strong stock market preceded that meeting, too. The US was wrong to argue that a huge demand for capital was about to hit the world economy; it was wrong to argue that strong growth in the industrial countries was needed to meet that demand; it was wrong to argue that looser monetary policy in Germany and Japan would lower the important real rates of interest; it was wrong to argue that the G7 should shift its aims from achieving non-inflationary growth to achieving growth with low inflation; and it exaggerated both the risk of a global 'credit crunch' and the threat of a global recession. What the Soviet Union and eastern Europe need is irrelevant; what matters is their demand. Neither the Soviet Union nor any of the countries of eastern Europe is now able to borrow large sums on a commercial basis. Nor are the demands from Kuwait likely to be as big in the near term as had been earlier supposed. Moreover, if such a demand were to materialise, borrowers would need low long-term real rates of interest. Low rates of interest would be better secured by low growth and slack resources in industrial countries than by their opposite. Unconvincing argument Interest rates on long-term credit are determined by the availability of savings and inflationary expectations. Artificially low real rates of interest on short-term money would reduce savings and increase expected inflation, precisely the opposite of what is needed. Equally unconvincing is the US case for a shift in the aims of the G7. When the G7 sought non-inflationary growth, it delivered growth with modest inflation. What could one expect if its aim were to be growth with low inflation? Growth with high inflation, is the obvious answer. Finally, the IMF forecasts no deep recession, but rather economic growth in the industrial countries at 2.8 per cent next year, up from 1.3 per cent this year. Nor is the 'credit crunch' a global problem, but largely an American one. It is the result of an almost unbelievable series of failures in financial legislation and regulation, about which the US is going to do virtually nothing, it now appears. Mismanagement US arguments are not merely unpersuasive; they are cheeky. The US has received resource transfers from the rest of the world worth some Dollars 670bn in 1990 prices over the past nine years and enjoyed current account deficits totalling around Dollars 1 trillion. How can it argue that other G7 countries must adjust to borrowing needs of eastern European countries that will be negligible by comparison? It is no less outrageous for the US to complain about high global real rates of interest when it has done everything it can to persuade Germany and Japan to eliminate the savings surpluses of the 1980s. It makes little sense to complain about a global 'credit crunch' when it is most evident in the mismanaged financial system of the US. To the extent that it exists elsewhere, this is often because of the past willingness of other countries, notably Japan, to accommodate the US desire for lax monetary policies. In the end, no great harm was done by the G7. Nobody can object to calls for 'monetary and fiscal policies which provide the basis for lower real interest rates and a sustained global economic recovery with price stability'. Nevertheless, US policy-makers must accept two points: first, that the solutions they seek are virtually all to be found at home; second, that the principal aim of the rest of the G7 is not to secure the re-election of the president, however many specious arguments may be put up for the purpose.</p>

In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE before his  departure on Saturday [1 January] to the former Yugoslav  Republic of Croatia, Akashi said Japan should not pretend that  it is indifferent to a proposal to upgrade Japan's standing in  the world body to that of a permanent member of the U.N.  Security council.    "If Japan were given the status of a Security Council  permanent member, it needs to act in accordance with its new  responsibility because the Security Council is responsible for  ensuring world peace and security," he said.    Akashi, who previously headed the U.N. peacekeeping force in  Cambodia, asked the Japanese to meditate upon the issue of why  Japan cannot assume a military role in U.N. peacekeeping when  other countries' peacekeepers are engaged in high-risk fields of  peacekeeping. "There is a question why Japan failed to send a  contingent of foot soldiers as peacekeepers despite the fact  that it could dispatch a contingent of engineering troops to  Cambodia," he said.    "If Japanese people can hammer out a national agreement on  this matter, I want Japan to send a contingent of foot soldiers  as peacekeepers," said the U.N. undersecretary general. It is  the Japanese people who should make a decision whether the  dispatch of foot soldiers is constitutional or not, he added.    Akashi said both the United States and the U.N. became more  cautious toward peacekeeping following U.N. peacekeepers'  failure to establish peace in Somalia.    The U.S. decided to pull its troops out of the African  nation  following their failure to arrest Somali warlord Mohamed Farah  Aidid.    "There occurred tough problems (in Somalia) in such fields  as  peacekeepers' command structure, the scope of weapons they are  allowed to use, as well as the issue of training of peacekeepers  that participated" from various countries, he said.    Akashi referred to the Cambodian experience, where the use  of  heavy weapons in dealing with the threat from the "deep-rooted"  Khmer Rouge would have run the risk of drawing the U.N.  peacekeepers into a "quagmire."    In December, Akashi urged the Japanese Government to send  peacekeepers to the Balkans region, where civil war has already  killed an estimated 200,000 people, and has strong potential to  spread. Then Akashi said he believed Japanese laws "allow"  Japanese peacekeepers to join the U.N. protection forces  (UNPROFOR) in the region "in such logistics fields as medical  service, transportation and communications."</p>

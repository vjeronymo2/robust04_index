			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / British Gas ventures out of the comfort zone: A shift in international plans The sale of British Gas's 53 per cent share of Bow Valley, the Canadian oil and gas company, for Pounds 348m is the latest evidence of a radical shift in international strategy in one of the world's largest integrated gas companies. The Bow Valley sale comes just six months after British Gas announced its intention to sell an 85 per cent stake in Consumers Gas - the main distributor of natural gas to the domestic market of Toronto - to Interprovincial Pipe Line System for CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 570m). Regulatory approval for that sale is expected this summer. The two sales effectively end what some executives termed the 'commonwealth' phase of the company's internationalisation. It was characterised by a focus on countries such as Canada and New Zealand, where a shared language and common legal system offered a high 'comfort factor' to a company just emerging from privatisation in 1986, and seeking to reduce dependence on the regulated British market. Critics, however, claimed that in practice it meant British Gas paying 'first division prices for second division assets'. For some the wisdom of the strategy seemed to be borne out by British Gas's abortive attempt to enter Spain, a fast-growing market but one in which national companies were determined to remain dominant. But the strategy's weakness was that it offered few growth opportunities and little scope to add value to the operations, the main explanation for the sale last year of Consumers. In addition, the Canadian businesses tied up large amounts of capital when opportunities to apply the company's expertise were opening up in high-growth regions such as Asia. Mr Cedric Browne, chief executive, yesterday confirmed that the Bow Valley sale 'forms part of the review of our activities. It is consistent with the policy of focusing on international markets where we see the greatest growth potential.' The new international emphasis will be spelled out in detail in the company's strategic review, expected to be completed within the next few months. It is likely to include a shake-up of British Gas's international structure, which is divided between exploration and production of gas and oil, and Global Gas, which focuses on downstream operations such as pipelines, distribution and power generation. It is also expected to re-affirm its intention to become the world's first 'gas major', operating in much the same way as the oil majors. But it is likely to put a priority on developing gas-related businesses in regions where it sees the highest growth potential. These include Asia, where it is involved in gas-fired power generation projects in Indonesia and Malaysia and a planned gas distribution system for Bombay. The southern cone of Latin America will probably be another priority area. British Gas already has 29 per cent of MetroGas, the Buenos Aires gas distribution network, and a 45 per cent shareholding in a power generation project. It is also part of a consortium studying the feasibility of piping gas from Argentina over the Andes mountains to Chile. The company is known to be keen to expand its role in building, owning and operating gas-fired power plants, a sector which is expected to grow strongly. Earlier this week it took a 51 per cent stake in the US-based Gas Ventures Advisers, a company it helped set up in 1991 to identify investment opportunities in large-scale power projects. Europe remains a desirable area for expansion, but the dominance of state monopolies offers limited scope outside the emerging markets of central and eastern Europe.                             *      *      * MAIN OVERSEAS STAKES: 29 percent of MetroGas, distribution, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the unique characteristics of brake systems for these types of trains, FRA believes that operators of high speed passenger trains should develop train brake system inspection, maintenance, and test plans tailored to the specific train brake systems they use. These plans would become part of the safety standards for the operation of the trains and equipment to which the plans apply and would be enforceable by FRA. Due to the complex designs and operations of these types of brake systems, FRA feels that all maintenance and that initial terminal train brake tests should be conducted by qualified mechanical and electrical train brake inspectors. FRA also believes that the various designs of these pieces of equipment may require inspectors to occupy dangerous positions in order to inspect them directly. If that is the case, FRA feels that the brake systems should be equipped with sensors that give a reliable indication of the application and release of the brakes, visible to an inspector on the platform or along the side of the track.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA contemplates dividing this rule into subparts, each of which would contain multiple sections. This proposal contains all of the anticipated subparts, including those that are being reserved for future proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart of the proposal contains the general provisions of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains a formal statement of the proposed rules' purpose and scope. FRA intends the rules to cover all brake system requirements, including those relevant to non-steam locomotives previously contained in Part 229 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a general matter, FRA proposes that these rules apply to all railroads that operate on the general railroad system of transportation. In addition, FRA proposes that many of these rules apply to non-insular passenger railroads operating outside the general railroad system of transportation. Consequently, FRA proposes that many of these proposed regulations apply to non-insular tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA's regulatory authority permits it to amend the current applicability sections of its various regulations so as to expand or contract the populations of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations. FRA has had jurisdiction over all railroads since the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 was enacted. There is a very wide range of operations that could be considered tourist, excursion, or scenic railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.'' Tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads have written several letters to members of Congress questioning the basis for FRA's assertion of jurisdiction. Additionally, FRA recently received a petition from the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, Incorporated on behalf of tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads requesting the need for legislative and regulatory action for new regulations tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. Pursuant to FRA's letter of September 28, 1993, in response to that petition, FRA has considered the suggestions made by those parties to the extent they pertained to power brakes in drafting these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA recently settled on several principles that will be used as current FRA guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads, whether or not they operate over the general railroad system, except those that are (1) less than 24 inches in gage and/or (2) insular.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist, excursion, or scenic railroad is insular if its operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of any member of the public (except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser) would be affected by the operation. A railroad is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation; or (d) a common corridor with a railroad,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the mere fact that the trackage of a railroad is not connected to the general system does not make the railroad insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular theme parks and museums, a need to do case-by-case analysis in certain close situations still exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

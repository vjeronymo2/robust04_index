Zhu is the first top Chinese Government official to travel  to  Japan since the coalition administration of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa came to power last August, officials said. He  will have talks with Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  as well as meeting three former premiers -- Noboru Takeshita,  Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa -- and business leaders during  his stay until March 3, the officials said.    "Last year Sino-Japanese trade volume hit an historical  record of 39 billion dollars, an increase of 54 percent over the  previous year," Zhu told reporters before leaving Beijing.  "With this Japan has surpassed Hong Kong as China's largest  trading partner and China has became the second largest trading  partner of Japan," he said.    "This year is a crucial year for China in building a  socialist market economy," said Zhu, who is concurrently  governor of China's central bank.    "This also is an important time for Japan to take major  administrative measures to rejuvenate its national economy.  Therefore, I believe both sides have the interest and the need  to hold mutually beneficial exchanges and discussions," he added.    During the visit, the vice premier will also travel to  Osaka,  Kagawa and Fukuoka prefectures in western and southwestern Japan  to take a firsthand look at corporate activities there.    Zhu said upon arrival at Tokyo's Haneda Airport that his  Japan trip is aimed at deepening mutual understanding and  promoting cooperation and friendship between the two countries.    "Bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have already  entered a new stage of development through common efforts by the  two governments and the peoples," Zhu said. To further  strengthen such ties will be beneficial for the Japanese and  Chinese peoples in the long term and will also contribute to the  peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and  the world, he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STELLO IS NOT THE MAN FOR NRC  </P> <P> The tenure of James D. Watkins as President Bush's secretary of energy has been  brief but refreshing. Watkins, a retired admiral who brought order out of chaos  at the Reagan Administration's AIDS commission, has initiated a long overdue  review of U.S. energy policy and has dealt forcefully with the alarming  problems at the department's 17 nuclear weapons plants. But Watkins' record so  far has one serious blot that would vanish if he would drop the choice of  Victor Stello Jr. to be assistant secretary for defense programs in charge of  the weapons program.  </P> <P> In choosing Stello, former chief of staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,  the Bush Administration clearly wanted someone who knew the nuclear industry  and had a capacity for cracking heads to get jobs done. Stello may fit those  criteria, but his credibility was so damaged at the NRC that his chances of  fulfilling his mandate at the Energy Department are undermined before he even  gets an opportunity to start. In advance of Stello's confirmation hearing  before the Senate Armed Services Committee today, five Democratic senators  distributed a letter urging President Bush to withdraw the Stello nomination.  The senators, including California's Alan Cranston and Nevada's Richard Bryan,  said that even if Stello is confirmed, the controversy surrounding him would  critically impair his ability to run the department's weapons program. They are  correct.  </P> <P> During his time at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Stello became embroiled  in several curious controversies and exhibited questionable behavior for a  regulator of such a sensitive industry. In one instance, he approved a $6,000  cash payment to a former utility company worker to obtain information that  would imply dereliction of duty on the part of another high NRC staff official.  The propriety of the payment has been under investigation in Congress. A Senate  subcommittee reported that the affair appeared to be motivated as much by  "personal and professional animosity" as by safety concerns. Rep. Peter H.  Kostmayer (D-Pa.) claimed that Stello's testimony before the Senate on the  payment matter contradicted what he told a House subcommittee. The House  subcommittee staff said the payment was part of "a wasteful investigation with  revenge the primary motive."  </P> <P> As head of the NRC investigation of the Three Mile Island accident, Stello was  accused of failing to pursue allegations that TMI operators had falsified  cooling system leak rates to keep the reactor running and of withholding  information about the severity of the accident. Critics have brought other  claims of Stello's alleged interference in NRC safety enforcement.  </P> <P> Not all of the claims have been substantiated. But this critical job demands an  appointee who is above any such suspicion, a person with unimpeachable  credibility. Adm. Watkins would do well to renew his search for such a person.  </P></p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Elf and Enterprise may bid for Occidental's UK assets ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil and chemicals group, and Enterprise Oil, the British independent exploration and production company, are expected to announce a joint venture agreement today to buy the North Sea assets of Occidental Petroleum, the US oil company, for some Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 813m). The expected deal is believed to make provision for Enterprise to acquire the 25 per cent of its shares owned by Elf - possibly by swapping some of its existing assets for the shares. Elf has been widely rumoured for several weeks to be close to securing the purchase of Occidental's assets in an auction where it has been competing against Enterprise and Arco, the US oil operator. The co-operation of Elf and Enterprise in a bid is likely to make the deal more palatable to Mr Peter Lilley, the UK industry secretary, who referred Elf's last British acquisition to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the French government's 55.6 per cent stake in the company. The commission cleared Elf's purchase of Amoco's UK petrol stations last week. Occidental's North Sea business includes operating the Piper field where 167 men were killed in an explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig three years ago. The majority ownership of this field could prove a sensitive political issue which Enterprise's involvement could help to diffuse. Occidental has spent some Pounds 550m re-developing the Piper Alpha platform, but no longer regards its North Sea business as a core operation. It has been trying to sell the UK assets in an attempt to reduce debt in the US parent. The Occidental assets cover a broad spread of business in the North Sea which would fit well with both Elf and Enterprise's acquisitive strategies. Enterprise needs experience in operating a UK field to aid its overseas expansion and prepare it to take over the running of its Nelson field when that comes on stream later this decade. Enterprise also needs cash flow to develop the Nelson field, of which it owns 60 per cent and which is expected to cost Pounds 1.25bn over the next five years. An asset swap - could improve the independent company's cash position, but only if it can be done in a way that will avoid a large Advanced Corporation Tax liability. Some analysts are speculating that Enterprise will make a rights issue to help fund the asset purchase. None of the companies involved would comment.</p>

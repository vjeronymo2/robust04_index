DG 437 521-2 AS WE look at current events, it is worth remembering that nationalism in Europe is not a new phenomenon. Every student of musical history learns that the nationalist movement flourished about 100 years ago, when composers from countries around the periphery of Europe (Russia, Czechoslovakia, England, Spain, Scandinavia) started to assert themselves and write music in an identifiably national style. This year is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Edvard Grieg, one of that movement's leading voices. It is difficult to explain why some events capture the record companies' attention, but others not: 1993 is also an anniversary year for Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov, both popular composers, yet nothing much that is new or important of theirs has surfaced on record. Perhaps it is because they were part of a wider Russian musical tradition, whereas Grieg stands alone - Norway's lone champion, the embodiment in music of a whole national identity. Any number of interesting new discs of Grieg have been coming on to the market. The single largest offering is DG's complete recording of all Grieg's music with orchestra, which is available either as a boxed set of six CDs (with the full version of Peer Gynt, originally issued a couple of years earlier) or as four single CDs. Either way one has a chance to discover some rare music. Like so many young musicians of his time, Grieg studied in Germany. Throughout the 19th century Austro-German composers were dominant in the concert-hall and it was inevitable that visiting students will have come away thinking it right and proper to write symphonies and concertos, even though those forms might have been foreign to the indigenous musical tradition in their homelands. In that respect Grieg was no different. Among his early works are one of each - a symphony written in 1864 and the famous Piano Concerto of four years later. For a 20 year-old, the Symphony shows a remarkable mastery of harmony and thematic invention, but in a derivative style. It is an exercise, very competently carried out, and Schumann seems to be the teacher. Grieg's own verdict - that the symphony 'must never be performed' - is probably too harsh. Neeme Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, the performers throughout this series, make a rumbustious case for it. The Piano Concerto was immediately more successful. So successful indeed that its popularity has obscured the fact that it makes little out of the concerto form, except to hang upon the basic structure a series of typically singable Grieg tunes. A recent Prom performance showed how fresh the music can still sound, if its embellished piano writing takes on the magic of a Chopin Nocturne. Jarvi and his soloist, Lilya Zilberstein, are heavier. They want the Concerto to be grand in the Rakhmaninov manner, which does not work to its advantage. From then on Grieg was to turn his back on the Germanic style. His preference was for smaller forms, where he could exploit a native gift for melody without the need to engage in dense musical arguments. Among the purely orchestral pieces, the Symphonic Dances and the Norwegian Dances are based on traditional Norwegian tunes. Others, such as the Lyric Suite and the Elegiac Melodies, are arrangements of small piano pieces or songs. Jarvi is apt to be strenuous with them, rather than easy-going, but it is useful to have these musical picture postcards collected together. Even Peer Gynt is really a collection of miniature mood paintings rather than a large single canvas. (Of one movement the composer wrote 'It stinks of cow-dung and Norwegian insularity . . . but I think people will sense the irony behind it]') Anybody who is fond of Grieg's music will have acquired this 1988 set already, but it is worth giving a reminder that this was the first recording to use the complete score, as the composer originally intended it. The most interesting new discovery is Olav Trygvason - described as a 'torso of an opera', but really more of a pagan oratorio. Grieg attended the first performance of Wagner's Ring as a reporter for his local newspaper and Olav Trygvason, begun just three years earlier, would clearly have turned out a Norwegian epic of a similar, if more modest, kind. The opening three scenes, which are all that he composed, are unlike other mature Grieg, raw, dark inspiring music, all heathen chanting and sacrifical dances. Ironic that Anne Gjevang (the reigning Erda in Wagner's Ring) is the singer here of the portentous invocation to the Norwegian gods. The other vocal and choral disc couples Bergliot, a melodrama with a pair of short solo vocal works and the songs which Grieg orchestrated himself. This last group, although containing only five songs and those not always the most famous, is wholly delightful. Barbara Bonney and Hakan Hagegard are the singers, who show how moving the simplest of music can be, the key to performing Grieg. Nevertheless, if pressed to make one choice, I would take the single disc of songs by Anne Sofie von Otter, imaginatively accompanied at the piano by Bengt Forsberg (it was also the choice of Gramophone magazine, which has just made it its Record of the Year). Although she stretches the scale of the songs to a disturbing degree, adding a minute to the timings of a couple of them in comparison with Bonney, von Otter does use the extra time profitably. Her performance of Haugtussa, Grieg's late song-cycle, is quite visionary, a marvellous example of how the cold Northern personality could melt in music and singing of such seductive warmth. I have played this disc again and again. It is the Grieg anniversary's clear winner.</p>

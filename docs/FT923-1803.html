			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): The cost of containing terror - With cash scarce, efforts are focused on improving intelligence A FAVOURITE game among journalists in Northern Ireland is to try to trap a minister into defining what is an 'acceptable level of violence', the point being that if the IRA cannot be defeated by military means as the security forces experts say, then at what level can the violence be contained until such time as the paramilitaries can be defeated by economic, social and political means? The ministers have their standard reply prepared. 'There is no acceptable level of violence,' they say. Government statistics hint in numbers at what ministers are unable to define in words. Last year there were 499 shooting incidents, 367 bomb incidents and 237 incendiary devices which exploded or were defused, all relating to paramilitary activity. Over the past four years shootings have oscillated between 500 and 600 - the bombings between 300 and 450. In 1991, 94 people died as a result of the violence, 75 of them civilians - many of those sectarian murders. Murders by Loyalist paramilitaries are now running almost as high as those by the IRA, and last month's banning of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) is a recognition of the growing threat they also pose to political stability in the province. Criminal injuries and damage expenditure, paid by the government as compensation to the victims of the violence, is running at over Pounds 40m per year. This caused the government to temporarily suspend its capital investment programme in Northern Ireland earlier this year. So what more can be done to contain the violence? When paramilitary activity showed an upturn at the end of last year, two more army battalions were flown into the province. In addition, 400 more Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers have been recruited bringing RUC strength up to 8,500. Total army strength is now around 18,500 including 6,000 from the Royal Irish Regiment (formed by merging the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Royal Irish Rangers). Troop levels are now the highest since 1979. On the streets of Belfast and the country lanes of Armagh, there is a now a highly visible army presence. Random checkpoints are set up to make more difficult the movement of weapons and explosives. The incessant judder and whine of the round-the-clock helicopter patrol over Belfast, adds an Orwellian flavour to the city's already militarised atmosphere. Locals say they no longer notice it. Mr Michael Mates, the new minister responsible for security in Northern Ireland, while fighting for more resources, is concerned that any higher level of troop presence could prove counter-productive. He says turning Belfast into a 'fortress' would be to hand the IRA a propaganda victory. Other considerations are cost and manpower limitations. The planned defence cuts in the armed forces will sharply deplete the number of regular army troops available for Northern Ireland. Already several battalions there are understrength and additional companies are having to be seconded in from the mainland. Expenditure cuts are also being felt at the RUC. In his annual strategy statement made at the beginning of the year the RUC chief constable Sir Hugh Annesley said 'the uncertainty of future major capital expenditure and insufficient technical staff continue to be major problems'. With no blank cheque available to help bring down the level of violence, the security forces are therefore focusing their resources on improving their intelligence activities and in targeting the finance and munitions flows to the paramilitary organisations. The RUC's new anti-racketeering squad claims to have had considerable success in drying up numerous sources of finance of both IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries in the past year, and new legislation is in the pipeline to make it easier for the police to investigate and prosecute businesses and organisations suspected of channelling funds. The Libyans are under pressure from the United Nations to give hard intelligence to the UK government which might lead to a breakthrough in locating the remaining 100 tons or so of weapons supplied in the mid-1980s to the IRA, most of which is thought to be still hidden in the Irish Republic. However, cross-border co-operation is improving and, significantly, Mr Mates and Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish justice minister, met privately in Belfast recently, the first such meeting outside the formal structure of the Anglo-Irish talks. A new area of concern is the sourcing of weapons from the former eastern European states which are undergoing fragmentation and civil war. 'We are very much alive to the danger, but there is no evidence yet of any new arms supplies,' a senior RUC source said. The RUC views its intelligence-gathering operations through penetration of the paramilitary organisations as a priority area of its work. Sir Hugh said pointedly, in his strategy document: 'Public co-operation and understanding in this difficult task is crucial if we are to succeed.' Equally as crucial are moves to improve liaison between the Army and the RUC. A new body called the Province Executive Committee (PEC) was established during the summer, which will co-ordinate intelligence gathering and sharing at the top level. The PEC is chaired by Mr Blair Wallace, the deputy chief constable of the RUC. In principle the RUC is in charge of all security operations in Northern Ireland, including intelligence gathering. MI5, however, has run its own operations independently in the province for two decades, some of which have come under intense criticism for alleged involvement in Loyalist paramilitary activities. Earlier this year MI5 was given overall responsibility for intelligence operations against the IRA on the mainland, replacing the Metropolitian Police Special Branch. This in effect confers and confirms a similar role for MI5 in Northern Ireland.</p>

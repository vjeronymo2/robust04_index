			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: BOMBAY PALACE'S CURRIED TREAT  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I had a recipe for Indian curried vegetables about a year ago. I  prepared it once and must have thrown out the newspaper in error. It was a  delicious recipe and I would appreciate receiving it again.  </P> <P>  -- MARGARET  </P> <P> DEAR MARGARET: The recipe came from the Bombay Palace restaurant in Los  Angeles. It's also in their cookbook, "The Bombay Palace Cookbook" by Stendahl  (Caravan Publishers). The vegetables, by the way, may vary according to season.  </P> <P> BOMBAY PALACE 9 VEGETABLE CURRY  </P> <P> 1/4 pound broccoli, cut into florets  </P> <P> 1/4 pound green or sweet red pepper, cut into diamonds or small cubes  </P> <P> 1/4 pound carrots, peeled, sliced and cut into diamonds or small cubes  </P> <P> 1/4 pound cauliflower, cut into florets  </P> <P> 1/4 pound green beans, sliced and cut into diamonds or small cubes  </P> <P> 1 large potato, peeled, sliced and cut into diamonds or small cubes  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1 large onion, minced  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 tomatoes, chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons yogurt  </P> <P> Dry Masala  </P> <P> 1/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 1/4 pound fresh or 1/2 (10-ounce) package frozen green peas, thawed  </P> <P> 1 (4-ounce) can mixed fruit cocktail, drained  </P> <P> 1/4 cup raisins  </P> <P> 12 slivered, blanched almonds  </P> <P> Separately cook broccoli, green pepper, carrots, cauliflower, green beans and  potato in boiling salted water until crisp-tender. Drain. Set aside.  </P> <P> Melt butter in skillet. Add onion and garlic. Saute until onion is transparent.  Add tomatoes, yogurt and Dry Masala. Simmer 5 minutes. Add parboiled vegetables  and simmer 5 minutes longer, adding 1/4 cup water. Cover and simmer 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Add whipping cream and peas.

It was a perfect buffet dish to serve with cold ham or  fowl. Now, in these days of diminished interest in meat, it would make a good  main course.  </P> <P>  -- RUTH  </P> <P> DEAR RUTH: Well, how about this one? It's fairly close to the one you  described.  </P> <P> WILD RICE CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 4 strips bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped onions  </P> <P> 1 cup sliced mushrooms  </P> <P> 1 cup wild rice, rinsed  </P> <P> 3 stalks celery, chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, optional  </P> <P> 4 1/2 cups chicken broth  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Cook bacon until crisp. Drain and set aside. Drain all but 2 tablespoons bacon  fat. Add onions and cook until tender. Add mushrooms and cook until warmed  through.  </P> <P> Combine onions, mushrooms and bacon with rice, celery, seasoned salt and broth  in 2-quart casserole. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and bake at  325 degrees 2 hours or until rice is done. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Many years ago I had a recipe taken from The Times for a Mexican corn  bread made from a mix, diced chiles, sausage, etc. The "etc." is what I can't  remember. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- STAN  </P> <P> DEAR STAN: You just about got it all. The missing "etc." is corn. The recipe,  incidently, was a My Best Recipe back in 1974.  </P> <P> J.E.

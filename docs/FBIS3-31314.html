			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik's </F> report to parliament on 2 February: "Slovakia in the World"]    [Text]  <H3>  1.2 Foreign Policy of the Slovak Republic and the Process of  European Integration </H3> <H5>  The European Union </H5>   A substantial part of the strategic task of Slovak foreign  policy in the relationship with the European Union [EU] and its  member countries, which was the signing of the European  Agreement on the Association Between the Slovak Republic and the  EU, was fulfilled in 1993. Moreover, the process of its  ratification has been initiated in the European Parliament and  the parliaments of the member countries.    The transformation of the original association agreement  with  the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic to the separate  association agreements with the Slovak Republic and the Czech  Republic has been considered more a technical than a political  issue. The talks required two official meetings of experts in  Brussels on 15 April and 26 May 1993. The last round of talks  took place as the agreement was ratified on 23 June 1993.  Because of some technical problems concerning the translation  of the English working draft into the other nine languages of  the Union, the agreement was not signed until 4 October 1993,  during the EU Council session in Luxembourg.    Thanks to the effectively focused diplomatic preparations,  the association agreement was approved by the European  Parliament on 27 October, when 297 of the present 302 deputies  voted in favor of the agreement, three opposed, and two  abstained. The Danish Folketing approved the signing of the  association agreement on 9 December 1993. The original goal of  having the association agreement ratified by the end of 1993  could not be achieved because of the current situation--the EU  has been preoccupied with its own problems, like the open  question of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and also  as a result of the technical obstacles connected with the  translation of the association agreement into the EU official  languages. It is expected that the ratification process will be  completed by the end of November 1994 so that the agreement  could go into effect on 1 January 1995.    Concurrently with the signing of the association agreement,  the formal side of the succession of the Slovak Republic to the  Provisional Agreement on Trade between the Czech and Slovak  Federal Republic and the EC has been guaranteed (temporarily  valid already since 1 January 1993 on the basis of the  declaration of the Government of the Slovak Republic dated 7  December 1992), whereby the framework has been established for  the mutual trade relations with the EU until the association  agreement is ratified.    The support for development of the political dialogue on  various levels between the EU and the Visegrad Four [V-4]  countries attracted great attention in 1993. One of the results  of this dialogue was the approval of the document "Toward a  Closer Association With the Countries of Central and East  Europe" at the Copenhagen EU Summit on 21-22 June 1993. The  European Council accepted the appeal by the V-4 countries for an  expansion of their access to the EU markets. The Slovak  Republic managed to reflect the concessions obtained by the  decision of the Copenhagen Summit into the provisional agreement  and also into the association agreement.    A joint committee of the EU Slovak Republic (Czech Republic)  convened in Bratislava on 21-22 October 1993. The Provisional  Agreement on Trade was used as a framework for the assessment of  the level of the trade and economic relations, but the response  by the joint committee to the conclusions of the Copenhagen  Summit also acts as a great stimulation for the reinforcement of  our position as an associate member of the EU.    Some of the highlights of the contacts between the Slovak  Republic and the EU in 1993 were the reception of Slovak  President Michal Kovac by EU Commission chairman J. Delors, the  reception of Slovak Prime Minister V. Meciar by EU Commission  chairman J. Delors, the association agreement signing by the  Slovak prime minister in Luxembourg, and the participation of  Minister J. Moravcik in the political dialogue of the EU troika  with the associated countries in Brussels. Sir L. Brittan,  deputy chairman of the EU Commission, and EU Commissioner H. van  den Broek visited the Slovak Republic in 1993.  <H5>  The European Free Trade Association </H5>   The main tasks of Slovak foreign policy regarding the  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) were completed in 1993 in  agreement with the overall integration objectives of the Slovak  Republic. The Slovak Republic became a successor to the  Agreement on Free Trade between the Czech and Slovak Federal  Republic and the EFTA countries by signing the succession  protocol in Geneva on 19 April 1993.    The Slovak Republic paid a lot of attention to the expansion  of cooperation with EFTA by means of active contacts (visit to  the Slovak Republic by EFTA Secretary General G. Reisch) and the  utilization of the EFTA offer of expert discussions related to  the adjustment of the economic environment in the Slovak  Republic to the standards of EFTA and the European economic  area. The joint Slovak Republic-EFTA committee also met in St.  Gallen on 23-24 April 1993.  <H5>  The Council of Europe [CE] </H5>   One of the most significant achievements of Slovak foreign  policy in the field of multilateral cooperation was full  membership in the CE. By the adoption of resolution No. 33/93  of the CE Committee of Ministers and the signing of the Protocol  on the Acceptance of the CE Statutes, the Slovak Republic on 30  June 1993 became a full member of this international government  organization. The Slovak Republic confirmed all of its  obligations to the CE, and it supports the process of the  formation of an integrated Europe by its participation in CE  activities.    CE membership brought with it certain commitments in the  sense of the fulfillment of the Recommendation by the CE  Parliamentary Assembly No. 1201/1993 concerning the  Supplementary Protocol to the European Treaty on Human Rights  and Rights of Ethnic Minorities. The Slovak Republic promised  to honor the principles expressed in the Parliamentary Assembly  recommendations during the process of admission to the CE.    By its resolution, the Slovak Government entrusted the  members of the government with ensuring the implementation of  the accepted commitments specified by the CE recommendations.  At the initiative of the chairman of the Foreign Committee of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic, an ad hoc working  group was formed for the evaluation of the current fulfillment  of Slovak obligations toward the CE.    Following its acceptance as a CE member, the Slovak Republic  accepted many agreements adopted by the CE. This applies to the  acceptance by the Slovak Republic of the Agreement Against the  Use of Anabolic Steroids, for instance, the European Agreement  on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage, or the European  Agreement on Cinematographic Coproduction (the last two were  signed by the Slovak Ministry of Culture). Under the auspices  of the Slovak Ministry of Justice, work is in progress on the  ratification of the European Agreement on Prevention of Torture  and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and on the  acceptance by the Slovak Republic of Protocols Nos. 1 and 2 to  this agreement. The Commission for the Ratification of the  European Social Charter operates under the auspices of the  Slovak Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Public Works.    Thanks to the CE Support, a CE Information and Documentation  Center (IDS) has been established in Bratislava in cooperation  with the Slovak Foreign Ministry and interested sectors, which  collects all CE documents and provides services to the members  of parliament, the government, and the public at large. The IDS  was ceremoniously opened on 11 October 1993.    Despite the diplomatic efforts by the Slovak Republic for  the  purpose of supporting the establishment of the CE Second  European Center for Youth (ECM) in Bratislava, it has been  decided that the Second ECM will be set up in Budapest.    The Slovak Ministry of Culture secured through the CE  Cultural Heritage Committee a "Technical Assistance for Banska  Stiavnica" project, in the framework of which the CE experts  prepared a blueprint for the revitalization and reconstruction  of the city.  <H5>  Regional Cooperation </H5>   The Slovak Republic has been accepted as a full member of  the  Central European Initiative [CEI] as of 1 January 1993 without  interruption, following the demise of the Czech and Slovak  Federal Republic. This was confirmed, in accordance with the  agreed mechanism, by the spring meeting of CEI foreign ministers  in Budapest.    The CEI priorities in 1993 were to focus, above all, on the  development of the economic and cultural cooperation in the  framework of specific joint projects. In the course of the  year, however, because of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the  trend strengthened toward the reinforcement of political  consultations and questions of ethnic minority rights compared  with the original pragmatic intentions of the cooperation.    On the basis of the talks of the ad hoc working group for  ethnic minorities, the Italian side prepared a draft document on  the protection of ethnic minority rights, which was originally  supposed to be adopted as a legally binding document at a  special CEI conference. At their summit in Budapest in July  1993, the prime ministers of the CEI countries authorized this  group to continue their endeavors to draft a document on the  protection of minority rights, but in an open form from the  vantage point of the legal obligation. Because of the ongoing  work on the document, the Slovak Republic is adversely inclined  to the implementation of the concept of collective minority  rights, a stand that corresponds to the development of opinion  within the CE, as confirmed at the Vienna CE summit.    Despite our support for the CEI orientation in the direction  of the development of the economic infrastructure by means of  regional projects, the intended goals have not yet been achieved  in those areas of cooperation that have been selected as  priority ones by the EU and the EBRD [European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development] (power generation,  telecommunications, transport, environment). The Slovak  Republic has pointed out the unsatisfactory situation in  financing the infrastructure projects at the sessions of the CEI  Administration Board at the EBRD. The Slovak Republic has  supported the idea of the reorganization of the administration  system within the bank in the interest of an improvement in  relations between the bank and its customers.    At the fall meeting of the foreign ministers of the CEI  countries in Debrecen, the Slovak Republic favorably responded  to the Italian initiative of a pilot project of establishing  industrial zones, which would begin by a study and coordination  of the legislative conditions for their implementation, first in  Slovakia and subsequently in other CEI countries.    The focal point of the activity of the CEI working group for  culture, education, and youth exchange, chaired by the Slovak  Republic, was the realization of the project "The Year of  European Baroque." This successful project, in the framework of  which seven exhibitions were organized in various CEI countries,  is to continue with three more exhibitions in 1994.    The regional association known as the "Working Commonwealth  of Danubian Countries (PSPK)" associates 22 entities (federal  countries, independent countries, provinces, regions) located in  the Danube River valley. The Slovak Republic has been a  full-fledged member of the commonwealth since 1991.    The Slovak Republic takes part in the cooperation in almost  all working groups and subgroups through the representatives of  individual sectors. The Slovak Republic chairs and coordinates  the work in two subgroups--the "Territorial Arrangement" and the  "Land Protection."    In 1993, the Slovak Republic was host to the fourth  conference of the government heads of the PSPK member countries,  at which the work of the PSPK was evaluated, and the orientation  of cooperation was specified for the next year in the form of a  recommendation. Within the framework of the conference, chaired  by the Slovak prime minister, bilateral talks also took place  with the heads of the delegations from Bavaria,  Baden-Wuerttemberg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Croatia, and  Hungary.   <H3>    1.3 Relations Between the Slovak Republic and the  United Nations </H3>   One of the key areas of the activities of Slovak foreign  policy in the multilateral sphere is the activity within the  framework of the United Nations, to which the Slovak Republic  was admitted on 19 January 1993. The principal precondition for  working effectively in the United Nations was the complex  succession to multilateral contractual documents held by the UN  secretary general.    The Slovak Republic was substantially involved in 1993 in  the  area of maintaining international peace and security, above all,  by its presence in various UN peace operations:    UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]--former Yugoslavia, a  logistics battalion of the Slovak Army, 419 men strong, is  operating in the Daruvar region and should be expanded by 40  more Army members by 30 December 1993 and another 141 on 28  February 1994, so that the Slovak Republic will have a total of  600 soldiers in this mission.    UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission]--Angola--six  military  observers from the Slovak Army.    UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia]--Liberia--ten  military observers from the Slovak Army.    UNOMUR [UN Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda] --  Uganda-Rwanda--five military observers from the Slovak Army.    UNGCI [expansion unknown]--Iraq--four members of the Slovak  Police Corps.    The Slovak Foreign Ministry and the Slovak Permanent Mission  to the United Nations in New York rapidly assess the  applications by Slovak businesses for permits issued by the  appropriate sanctions committee of the UN Security Council so  Slovak economic interests are harmed as little as possible by  the sanctions introduced by the United Nations against the  countries that threatened or violated international peace and  security. The Slovak Foreign Ministry OMEO [expansion unknown]  prepared, in cooperation with the Slovak Danubian Navigation  Lines, a list of Slovak monitors who will accompany ship convoys  through Yugoslav territory. This list was approved by SAMCOMM  [Sanctions Assistance Missions Communication] in Brussels and  passed on for approval by the UN Sanction Committee No. 724  (1991). Because of the economic losses caused by the UN  sanctions against Yugoslavia, on the basis of Article 50 of the  UN Charter, the Slovak Republic has asked the UN Security  Council for consultations regarding compensation for the losses  it has sustained. The Slovak Foreign Ministry, through the  Slovak Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York, has  asked for the dispatching of an expert hired by the UNDP [UN  Development Program] to assess the losses. The losses have been  calculated in cooperation with the individual sectors and  submitted to the UN Committee. On 26 October 1993, the Slovak  permanent representative at the United Nations submitted a note  to the Security Council chairman enumerating all Slovak losses  caused by the sanctions against Yugoslavia, which was published  in the form of Security Council document No. S/26648.    Within the framework of efforts to solve the problems of  sanctions, several diplomatic actions have been taken in the UN  system. The Slovak foreign minister emphasized in his address  to the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly the need for a  solution to the economic impact of the sanctions on the most  affected countries. Similarly, following an initiative by the  Slovak Permanent Mission at the United Nations in New York, the  problem of economic losses resulting from the sanctions against  Yugoslavia was added to the agenda of the 48th Session of the UN  General Assembly. The motion was discussed and approved by the  plenum. The countries affected by the sanctions pointed out the  long process of the approval for export and transit permits for  Yugoslavia.    Since the Slovak Danubian Navigation Lines is actually the  body most affected by the problems resulting from the sanctions,  operative consultations are taking place with its representative  concerning a solution to the most acute problems. Since Security  Council Resolution No. 820 came into effect, the Slovak Foreign  Ministry carries out the entire process of the issue to Slovak  businesses of UN export or transit permits for Yugoslavia. It  also keeps in contact with the enterprises and provides them  with all important information for the purpose of alleviating  the damage.    Because of the situation in the Disarmament Conference, the  Slovak Foreign Ministry continues to claim its right of  succession to the CSFR in the Disarmament Conference. The  Disarmament Conference membership is still frozen because of the  unresolved questions regarding the expected expansion of the  Disarmament Conference membership (the question of Iraq). The  disapproval of the "parcel" method of admitting new members so  far prevented a solution to the situation in favor of the Slovak  Republic.    In the sphere of armament and disarmament control in 1993,  the Slovak Foreign Ministry focused on promoting the interests  of the Slovak Republic at the UN, where, by its work at the 48th  Session of the UN General Assembly, it joined all of the  significant activities, supporting peace solutions to problems  and reducing tension in individual regions of the world, and  implementing UN resolutions for a truce during the Olympic games  and the year of Olympism. The foreign policy of the Slovak  Republic also became involved within the framework of the UN  system in solving the problems of openness in armament. In the  context of solving the problems of openness in armament, the  Slovak Republic submitted to the secretary general complete  information for the so-called Register of Conventional Arms for  1992.    In 1993 the Slovak Republic began the full implementation of  the regulations of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Chemical  Weapons. Arrangements were made for the participation of  representatives at the Preparatory Committee at The Hague and,  on the basis of its recommendations in accordance with the  Slovak Action Plan, an interdepartmental Slovak preparatory  commission was established for the implementation of the treaty.  At this time, the introductory initiatives of this body are  taking place, aimed at the final ratification of the treaty in  the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the specific  conditions in the Slovak Republic.    The Slovak Foreign Ministry enlists expert participation at  the talks of the Government Expert Group regarding the possible  control measures of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Biological  Weapons, where a representative of the Slovak Republic acts as a  member of the expert process. The Slovak Republic joined the  appeal to call an assessment conference for the aforementioned  Treaty already in the first stages of this initiative and during  the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly.    In the interest of getting involved in the work of the  institutions dealing with the issue of nonproliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and rocket technology and the  regulation of exports and imports of material, technology, and  equipment with dual purpose, Slovak Foreign Ministry  representatives took part in the session of the Core Group  (against arms proliferation) in Oslo.    The Slovak Foreign Ministry, in cooperation with the Slovak  Defense Ministry and the Atomic Energy Commission, organized  participation in the session of the Preparatory Committee of the  Assessment Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of  Nuclear Weapons in Southampton.    In the context of this activity, the ministry gave its  support to the endeavors by some countries to implement the  validity of the treaty without any time limit. The Slovak  Foreign Ministry prepared its concept of the issue and presented  it at the session of the appropriate committee during the 48th  Session of the UN General Assembly.    An important activity was the preparation of the  participation of a government delegation, led by the foreign  minister, in the session of the UN General Assembly on 2-6  October 1993, appearances of the delegation members in the UN  committees, and the arrangements for various multi and bilateral  talks, above all, with the secretary general and other leading  UN officials and heads of state delegations, participants in the  General Assembly. The orientation of the work on the  preparation of the trip and appearance by the Slovak Foreign  Ministry state secretary in the UN General Assembly committees  and talks with the UN secretary general deputies was similar.    The Foreign Ministry submitted at the UN General Assembly an  application of the Slovak Republic for a reduction of its  membership contribution to the UN budget. A reduction and  adjustment from 0.18 to 0.13 percent is expected.    The question of the membership of the Slovak Republic in the  UN Statistical Commission was also dealt with at the 48th  Session of the UN General Assembly, and alternative  possibilities were discussed for securing the UN presence in the  Slovak Republic (the establishment of a UN information component  in the Slovak Republic).    An important element of the work was the preparations for  the  establishment of a Slovak Permanent Mission at the international  organizations in Vienna.    Many activities were oriented toward the sphere of  specialized UN programs, particularly the following:    UNITAR [Institute for Training and Research]--in cooperation  with the Slovak Permanent Mission in Geneva, the supply of  information on the organization of courses on multilateral  diplomacy in Geneva.    UN Graduate Studies Program.    UNU -- UN University.    Commission on Transnational Corporations.    Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International  Standards of Accounting and Reporting.    EUREKA--the production of information on Eureka programs  with  the objective of activating Slovak researchers to participate in  the top research programs. After the publication, specific  information was provided to the interested parties.    Departement des Affaires Humanitaires--Geneva.    International Center for Family Studies.    Government Committee for the Physically Disabled.    Public Administration--the collection of information  oriented  towards the territorial arrangement and modernization of public  administration, and arrangements for the participation in  international actions by competent institutions, the dispatch of  experts, the circulation of information on vacant positions  within the framework of the UN structure to the concerned  institutions and reporting job candidates from Slovakia.    Characteristic of the last third of the year, as well as for  1994 and 1995, is the intensification of the work on the  preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women. For the  Slovak Foreign Ministry it translates into a need for the  coordination of its activities abroad, the methodical  modification of and help in the preparation of the national  reports for the Fourth World Conference on Women. It implies  for the Slovak Foreign Ministry the need to coordinate its work  abroad, methodical guidance and help in the preparation of the  national reports for the Fourth World Conference on Women, and  the preparation of the documentation on behalf of the Slovak  Foreign Ministry sector.    UNDCP [UN Drug Control Program]--Among the important  activities in this field was the signing of the regional  laboratory Balkans Route [Balkanska cesta] project. The project  is intended for use in the implementation of narcotics control,  for the establishment and equipment of laboratories, for  increasing their capacity, and for the training and education of  their staff.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese turn attention to a burgeoning Asia - A manufacturing powerhouse and growing market JAPAN'S Mitsubishi Motors, Aiwa, the audio manufacturer, and YKK, the world's leading maker of fasteners, have this month all unveiled plans to expand production in Asia. Last week, car maker Suzuki followed suit, signing an agreement with the China North Industries Group to become the first Japanese car maker jointly to produce passenger cars in China, from 1995. As Japanese industrialists ponder the prospect of persistent weakness in their home market, a rising yen and continuing friction with key trading partners, Asia appears to be the one bright spot in an uncertain future, representing both a manufacturing powerhouse and a potentially vast market. The Asian Development Bank last week forecast 7 per cent growth this year in the Asia-Pacific region, compared with less than 2 per cent in developed market economies. The proportion of total Japanese investment that went into Asia rose from 12 per cent in 1989 to 14 per cent in 1991. North America saw its share of Japanese investment fall from 50 per cent to 45 per cent over the same period, and Europe held steady at about 22 per cent, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. And while Japanese overseas investment has shrunk 30 per cent in the past two years, as a result of economic downturn, the fall in Asian investment has been markedly less, at 15 per cent. In recent months, the rapid rise of the yen has enhanced the incentives for moving Japanese manufacturing abroad. Another reason why Japanese manufacturers are turning their eyes to Asia is that long-term changes in Japanese society are threatening to deprive them of a stable source of labour in their own country. The growing rejection by Japanese youth of manual labour, including skilled technical work, coupled with the trend towards having fewer children has made it difficult for manufacturers to find workers in Japan willing to take on factory work. While the current recession has masked the trend somewhat, small to medium-sized subcontractors, the foundation of Japan's manufacturing success, are founding it difficult to attract workers and there is talk among Japanese industrialists of a 'parts crisis'. 'In 10 years it will be impossible to produce parts in Japan,' says Mr Yoshio Sakakibara, director of the Asia-Oceania Division, Overseas Research Department, at Jetro. 'The only place where Japanese industry can take that work is Asia.' A good proportion of Japan's manufactured goods is already coming out of Asia. For example, 60 per cent of products sold by Sanyo, the electronics group, in the UK are made either in the EC or in Asean countries, and that trend will intensify, says Mr Yasuaki Takano, Sanyo's president. 'We can no longer speak of Japan's consumer electronics industry. It is the world's consumer electronics industry.' Asia is also attractive to Japanese manufacturers who may feel culturally closer to the region than other parts of the world, Mr Sakakibara says. A further factor, which may take on a more important role as cost considerations weigh heavily on Japanese companies, is that past experience has shown the profitability of Japanese companies in Asia to be much higher than in other parts of the world. Whereas the ratio of revenue to pre-tax profits for manufacturing companies was 3.2 in Europe and a negative 0.9 in North America, it was 5 in Asia, according to a study by the Japanese government. 'I think there is a reassessment of the geographic portfolio with Japanese companies giving more weight to Asia than Europe and the US,' says Dr J Malcolm Dowling Jr, assistant chief economist at the ADB. As Asia becomes a global base for certain industries, it is also attracting investment from subcontractors and manufacturers in related industries. YKK, for example, says it is increasing production in Asia by 50 per cent because China has become the world's base for clothing manufacture. So far Japanese investment in the region has been concentrated in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. But with greater liberalisation, countries such as China and Vietnam are expected to win a substantial amount of future Japanese investment. China has already become the second largest exporter to Japan after the US and in 1991 Japan overtook the US to become the second biggest investor in China, on a cumulative basis. The Asian response to Japanese investment appears so far to be favourable. But Mr Sakakibara warns that 'environmental pollution could become an increasing problem'. Japanese industrialists may need to tread carefully as they build their dreams on Asian soil.</p>

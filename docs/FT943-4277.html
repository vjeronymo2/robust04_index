			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Job loss programme proceeds on schedule despite being slowed by culture shift - Robert Corzine considers the reorganisation being undertaken by British Gas Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas' chief executive, yesterday said the radical reorganisation was proceeding on schedule. An additional 3,000 people being made redundant in the first half brings the year-on-year total to 10,000. His comments, at the second-quarter results presentation, came after some analysts questioned the relatively slow pace of the programme, announced earlier this year. It involves the separation of the company into five business units and the loss of 25,000 jobs, a third of the workforce, over the next three to four years. However the heads of two of the main units, TransCo, the transportation and storage arm, and Public Gas Supply, the domestic trading division, say substantial progress is being made. Mr Harry Moulson, managing director of the Solihull-based TransCo, notes that under the old system there were '13 management levels between the chief executive and the guy who dug holes in the road. We are now going for five or six.' The top tiers of management had now been appointed, with mid-level and more junior supervisory slots soon to be filled. Mr Moulson says the way British Gas is conducting the restructuring, by filling management posts from the top down to allow each new layer of managers to determine the roles of those under their control, is one reason that the exercise was not moving more quickly. The broad range of structural and cultural changes which TransCo is trying to introduce has also slowed the process. In addition to the complex task of splitting up an integrated company, executives are trying to change a business culture steeped in strict command and control to one in which 'people will have a go and try things'. An even greater cultural shift will be required at the trading arm, according to Mr Mike Alexander, managing director of Public Gas Supply, the unit that will have to compete with independent gas marketing companies when the domestic market is opened up from the beginning of 1996. Of the 7,000 people in his division, only '80-100 actually work for PGS,' he says. The remainder will have to compete for their jobs, a process that promises to be intense. He says closure of district and regional offices will build up over the next year or so. The first office closes in October and nine are due to be shut by the end of the first quarter next year. Those with the largest staffs will be closed by the end of 1995, by which time the number of district offices in his division will have fallen from 23 to eight or nine. Mr Alexander says British Gas workers last year questioned why they were be forced to undergo such radical changes. They now simply ask: 'When will I know I have a job?' But he accepts there is still some resistance within the ranks. There are reports, for example, that some British Gas officials are engaged in efforts to preserve threatened jobs. There are also reports that jobs continue to be created, even in departments earmarked for sharp staff reductions.</p>

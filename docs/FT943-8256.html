			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Skids on Japan's motorway noise - A look at a new material which absorbs sound A small company in northern England is hoping to develop an interest in the Japanese motorway system. Sound Absorption, based in Lancashire, has appointed Hitokuchi Zaka Studios as the Japanese distributor for its acoustic cladding material, Coustone, which it hopes will be used for motorway sound screens. Coustone is made from flint particles bonded together with resins. It has excellent acoustic properties, as it both absorbs and insulates sound. But its physical robustness makes Coustone particularly suitable for highway sound barriers. The key to Coustone's sound-absorbing properties is the existence of air-filled spaces between the flint particles. Spaces allow sound to enter the material instead of being reflected, and are a feature of sound absorbers. In buildings where acoustic quality is very important, such as concert halls, resonant cavities may be incorporated into the structure. These absorb the sound, which can be monitored with a microphone and fed back through a loudspeaker, allowing electronic control of acoustic quality. Simpler sound-absorbing materials are usually porous or fibrous substances. The sound-deadening effects of curtains and human bodies are a matter of everyday experience. Mineral wool is widely used when sound absorption must be incorporated into a building's structure. Substances used in Japan include glass wool, ceramics, foamed concrete, aluminium fibre and sintered aluminium. None of the alternative sound-absorbing materials is as strong as Coustone, according to Toshio Obayashi, of CI Kasei, a Tokyo engineering firm which has used the material on a number of building projects. Sales in the UK have also depended heavily on its non-acoustic properties, according to Mike Hadfield of Sound Absorption. Coustone's acoustic properties are suitable for television or radio recording studios, but the fact that it can be scrubbed and even sterilised makes it popular as a sound-absorbing cladding for police interview rooms. Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, UK interview rooms have to be suitable for sound recording but have always posed difficult cleaning problems. Sound transmission can be effectively blocked by any heavy material. Sound consists of a vibration, or pressure wave, travelling through the air. Anything heavier than air needs more energy to make it vibrate, and so can be used to make a barrier. Motorway sound screens in the UK are made of wood. Most of the sound that strikes a wooden fence is reflected. The limitation of materials such as wood or concrete for noise barriers is that reflecting sound does not remove it. The sound merely returns to its source, from where it can be reflected again. Reflections are a nuisance in sound recording, because they reduce clarity, but they also increase sound volume. Coustone's combination of cleanability, ruggedness and sound absorption have won favour in swimming pools, factories and indoor firing ranges in this country. It was selected for use in police firing ranges because of its resistance to ricocheting bullets. But sound reflections are a severe problem in an indoor range: the direct report of each shot is literally only half the problem. The sound is reflected from the walls, the ceiling and the floor, as well as travelling directly. Noise exposure regulations limit the number of shots heard by each instructor. Acoustic measurements show that in a firing range panelled with Coustone the reduction in sound reflection roughly doubles the number of shots that the instructor can hear. Sound absorption is also considered important for motorway noise screens in Japan. Highways run through densely populated areas, so the noise-reducing effects of sound-absorbing barriers are more important. Noise screens up to 8m high have been constructed around motorways in Tokyo.</p>

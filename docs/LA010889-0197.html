			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NATURE-SEEKING SCOUTS STUMBLE ACROSS COCAINE  </P> <P> When the boys of Cub Scout Pack 333 set out on a nature hike in Newport Beach  on Saturday, they had no idea the trail would lead to a good deed.  </P> <P> The Scouts, led by Newport Beach lawyer Alan W. Courtney, were meandering  through the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve when they discovered a small  suitcase. It contained more than a pound and a half of cocaine with a street  value estimated by police at $30,000, they later learned.  </P> <P> "We were in the Back Bay and we were looking at plants and the animals," said  Courtney, Cub master for the Scouts, who attend Anderson Elementary School. "We  were walking along and we saw this suitcase stuffed underneath some bushes. It  was like carry-on luggage."  </P> <P> The two boys who found the suitcase -- Courtney's son Ben, 9, and Casey  Luchesi, 8 -- took it to Courtney, who cut the zipper open with a pocketknife.  </P> <P> "There was a paper sack, and inside that was a pound and a half of cocaine in  small packets. There also was a cigar box that had cocaine packets in it, and  then there was a small testing kit in a pink plastic container."  </P> <P> Because of the way it was packaged, Courtney immediately suspected it was  cocaine.  </P> <P> "Well, it didn't look like Sweet 'N Low," he said.  </P> <P> "We picked it up and brought it immediately to the Newport Beach Police  Department," he added. "They thanked us and gave all the kids badges.  </P> <P> "The kids knew what it was. They have a real strong anti-drug program at  Anderson. They were real glad to find it and turn it over to the police."  </P></p>

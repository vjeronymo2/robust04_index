			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Voting widens Ukraine's east-west split Ukrainian polls at the weekend revealed a widening rift between the country's east and west. People voted in large numbers to replace the communist-dominated parliament that has blocked economic reform, but pro-communist forces in the east secured resounding majorities in 'opinion polls' favouring closer ties with Moscow. Belying predictions of voter apathy, 75 per cent of the electorate turned out at polls across the nation, taking all 450 parliamentary districts past the necessary 50 per cent threshold. President Leonid Kravchuk's advisers had been counting on a low turnout, enabling them to declare the elections invalid and setting the stage for presidential rule. However, although the vote was a confusing one for many Ukrainians - with some ballots carrying more than two dozen names - initial returns showed new opposition faces emerging into the lead throughout the country. The requirement that candidates also secure more than 50 per cent of the vote to win a parliamentary seat saw 90 per cent of seats unfilled, however, pending a run-off election on April 10 between the two leading candidates in each district. 'For the most part, it looks like it'll be the new wave - democrats, businessmen - versus the old guard in the run-offs,' said Mr Roman Zwarycz of the independent Elections 94 press centre. However, Crimea, the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, and the Lugansk region on the Russian border ignored a presidential ban and held votes on closer ties with Russia, which threaten to create new federal problems for Mr Kravchuk. The Crimean president's administration said more than 80 per cent of the voters had endorsed a survey to form a special, more independent relationship with Kiev and allow Russian-Ukrainian dual citizenship. General Valery Kuznetsov, adviser to Crimean president Yuri Meshkov on military affairs, said that the survey, which Mr Kravchuk had outlawed, 'showed once again that Crimea does not want to be prevented from living as Crimeans want to live'. A similar survey in Donetsk showed that 90 per cent of the electorate favoured joining the CIS economic union, making Russian an official language and decentralising the Ukrainian state, according to a preliminary estimate . In the 47 seats filled by an outright majority in the first round, a number of high-profile national leaders secured seats, including Mr Ivan Plyushch, parliamentary chairman, and Mr Victor Pynzenik, a market economist and former government minister. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, who favoured closer relations with Russia in his campaign, and Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition nationalist Rukh party, also won seats. 'These elections have been a positive event. The people have shown the political will to improve their country,' commented Mr Vladimir Averchev, a Russian MP observer for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. 'I didn't realise how disillusioned Ukrainians were with the current parliament.' He added: 'I think the second round will go through and Ukraine will have a real chance to head on the road to reforms.' Ukrainian living standards have fallen rapidly in recent months, with incomes eaten up by hyperinflation. However, the current Ukrainian parliament, dominated by former communists, has been opposed both to economic reform and to relinquishing the country's nuclear arsenal - a condition of much western economic support.</p>

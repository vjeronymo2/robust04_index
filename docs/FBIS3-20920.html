			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wolfram Engels: "Unmarketable Miracles"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   Measured in terms of domestic product, the U.S.A., Japan,  and  Germany spend about the same for research and development. The  success is quite different. Referenced to the money spent, the  Japanese register more patents than the Americans and the  Americans more than the Germans. Using another indicator of  success, the Nobel prizes for natural sciences, America is  without peer. Then comes Germany while Japan has none. However,  most of the Nobel prizes for Germans were awarded for research  done in foreign countries and in foreign laboratories.  Apparently, the Germans are good scientists but Germany does not  provide them with enough development potential.    There is no international comparable data for the commercial  success of R&amp;D expenditures. However, there is no doubt that  Germany would be an also-ran. The reason for the low German  research productivity is apparently poor organization. The  famous Japanese MITI brings the companies together around one  table to discuss a joint project. If the companies are ready to  use their own money together, the MITI makes available a  relatively modest government grant in addition.    In Germany and in the European Union, this is done  differently. The government awards research and development  contracts, some of which it finances completely--Jager 90,  Transrapid, high-temperature reactor, space travel, fusion  reactor, etc. If the contractor for a project that is fully  financed by the government is a company and not a government  research institute, the company has every reason to generate  costs as high as possible because the contracts are usually  awarded on a cost-plus basis. This means, the higher the costs,  the higher the profit for the contractor. On the other hand, it  makes virtually no difference to the company whether the  development leads to a marketable product. The company is  earning money on the research and need not recoup the costs of  this research by way of sales.    Transrapid is a beautiful example of the results of this.  The  government-financed high-tech means of transport has been  traveling around in circles for years as fast as lightning on a  track in Emsland that is 31.5 kilometers long. Under the stilts  of this track, contented cows graze. Unfortunately, no one has  yet seen fit to buy this miracle of German engineering prowess.  Therefore, in a second step, the sales are also to be financed  by the government. The government wants to build a track from  Hamburg to Berlin for 5.6 billion marks. A consortium of private  companies will take over operation, again subsidized in the form  of tax reductions. Because it is just the nature of government  investment projects that, at the end, they are twice as  expensive as originally estimated; the taxpayers will, when all  is said and done, be asked to pay a few hundred marks per  household. For this a reference track, which interested parties  from the world over can view, will be available in the year  2004. The test track in Emsland was apparently too short.    You can just imagine how the story continues. In 2005, a  Russian delegation appears. They want to use the Transrapid on  the line from Moscow to St. Petersburg. However, the Russians  have no money. Consequently, the federal government ensures an  interest-free, non-repayable loan because otherwise the contract  would go to the Japanese.    Many such stories can be told. The Airbus received  government  financing but cannot be produced profitably without additional  subsidies such as inexpensive loans and dollar exchange-rate  guarantees. The Ariane is a reliable booster but a commercial  flop. The Russians and even the Chinese are cheaper transporting  payloads into space. The high-temperature reactor swallowed a  large portion of the budget of the Federal Research Ministry for  years. Not a single one has been sold and the only commercial  reactor in Hamm-Uentrop has been shut down by the North  Rhine-Westphalian Land government--even though it was completely  operational. The fast breeder reactor was even more expensive  and just as unsuccessful.    Government support of microelectronics was a similar flop.  Germany cannot defy Japan and the U.S.A. and cannot even keep up  with South Korea anymore. Now, the government that has already  paid for most of the research is also to subsidize production.  You have not heard anything for two years about one of the most  expensive projects, the fusion reactor. The government supported  wind systems are, in the meantime, supplying a little power, but  even then only because the electric power companies have been  forced to purchase wind power at excessive prices. The goal of  government research support is to provide innovative products  that can be produced profitably in the high-salary country of  Germany. The meaning is perverted if the production must also be  subsidized.    The only reasonable strategy is to support research only  where industry also assumes some risk with its own funds and  therefore has an interest in marketable products. Then, the  government need not care about the selection of projects any  more. There was such a program in the form of salary subsidies  for research plans of medium-sized companies. The program was  overturned. That program could have produced something  marketable.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Robert Morris, 57, is an entrenched New York artist of a generation that had  one foot in the sparest of minimal sculpture like that of Donald Judd and the  other in surrealist fetishism like the work of Walter de Maria. Morris' work  has not been seen in any depth around here since the days of the old Dwan  gallery, so we are grateful for a museum-like survey even if it turns out to be  an object lesson in what an artist ought not to do.  </P> <P> The earliest works on view are large spare objects such as a huge pair of steel  wheels or three big "L" shapes fashioned of black mesh wire. They are new works  based on drawings from the '60s. This is curious because Morris' work has  evolved drastically since then and it is hard to figure why he'd want to go  back to an earlier incarnation.  </P> <P> Then there are big hanging shapes of black felt, one of which is vaguely  suggestive of a giant cowl for a black mass. So far everything is about equally  provocative and ambiguous, leaving us mental room to contemplate the puzzling  border where pure formalism leaves off and expression takes up.  </P> <P> Unfortunately things grow clearer in a work like "Golden Memories," which is  made of an ingot-like metal corner bar festooned with a nasty hanging hook an a  bit of knotted rope. At this point we recall that Morris is the artist who once  posed for an exhibition poster with his naked torso wrapped in chains and his  head menacingly clad in a Nazi helmet. Suddenly this is all very suggestive of  Crock, the cartoon character, running around bashing his subalterns with his  iron glove.  </P> <P> Morris' recent work here consists of photographs of corpses piled in the manner  of the death camps or set out in rows like executed prisoners. These are daubed  with color and surrounded by enormous frames made of cast body parts including  skulls and hands gripping penises of impossible proportion. Their elaborate  morbidity is almost funny -- like some send-up of "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"  but there is no humor in them.  </P> <P> The lesson is that some artists should not make their intentions literally  clear. Unless you happen to share this art's tiresome narcissistic obsessions  with macho violence, sex and death, the work is as drearily predictable as a  definition from Kraft-Ebbing. It suffocates intelligence and strangles  imagination. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to Feb. 11.)  WILLIAM WILSON  </P></p>

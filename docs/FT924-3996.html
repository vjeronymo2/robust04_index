			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Timesheets go out of the window As the recession continues to bite, professionals who work on a time-accountable basis - accountants and solicitors, for example - are under increasing pressure to record accurately the time they spend on each client's affairs. The ProTem 300 electronic aid has been designed to replace the traditional timesheet and provide vital billing information. The pocket-sized time recorder can be used in the office, or on the move, and has sufficient memory for up to 6,000 client/project combinations. Every few days the information is downloaded on to the office PC - ProTem works with all commonly-used database and accounting packages. The gadget is loaded with data from the PC. When a client calls, the user presses the 'on' button, enters the name and the gadget does the rest. Pentica Communications: UK, 0734 792101.</p>

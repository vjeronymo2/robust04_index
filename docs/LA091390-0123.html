			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: CARAMEL CANDY: SWEET AND EASY  </P> <P> Homemade caramels have a flavor distinctively their own -- buttery, creamy,  with undertones of butterscotch. Ideally they should be delicately chewy with a  smooth, grainless texture.  </P> <P> To achieve these characteristics, cook the ingredients slowly, allowing the  sugars and milk solids to caramelize. The longer and slower the mixture is  cooked, the darker the color and the stronger the flavor of the finished candy.  </P> <P> Before beginning the cooking process, line an 8-inch baking pan with foil and  butter lightly, or lightly butter an area approximately the same size on a  marble slab and arrange metal candy bars that have been lightly buttered on the  inside over top, forming an 8-inch square.  </P> <P> Combine the corn syrup, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, whipping cream and  butter in a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Place over medium heat and stir constantly  with a wooden spoon until all the sugar crystals dissolve, then wash down the  sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in hot water (Step 1).  </P> <P> A candy thermometer must be used when making caramels. Place it in the pan and  move as necessary when stirring the mixture (Step 2). The thermometer may be  clipped to the side of the pan, but needs to be moved frequently to prevent the  candy under it from scorching.  </P> <P> Continue cooking the mixture, washing down the sides of the pan at least two  more times, for 30 to 40 minutes. Stir constantly during the last of the  cooking period to prevent scorching.  </P> <P> When the mixture registers 238 degrees on the thermometer, begin testing for  the desired consistency by dropping a small amount of the mixture into ice  water (Step 3). Test the cooled ball of candy between your thumb and fingers  (Step 4). The consistency will be the same as the finished batch.  </P> <P> Pour the mixture into the prepared pan (Step 5) or inside the candy bars. Do  not scrape the caramel that remains in the cooking pan, as it is tougher and  will leave hard spots in the poured-out batch. Instead, scrape the remainder  onto a plate (Step 6) and serve separately.  </P> <P> The caramel should stand at room temperature overnight so that it cools evenly  and becomes firm.  </P> <P> Remove the caramel from the pan and peel off the foil (Step 7) or remove the  metal candy bars. Butter the blade of a chef's knife and cut the candy into  squares with a sawing or rocking motion (Step 8).  </P> <P> Wrap the caramel individually and store at room temperature for several days or  in the refrigerator up to three weeks.  </P> <P> CARAMELS  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups light corn syrup  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk  </P> <P> 2 cups whipping cream  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter, cut into thin slices  </P> <P> Line 8-inch baking pan with foil. Lightly butter foil and set aside.  </P> <P> Place corn syrup, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, whipping cream and butter in  4-quart heavy saucepan. Place over medium heat.  </P> <P> Stir mixture constantly with wooden spoon until all sugar crystals are  dissolved. Wash down sides of pan with pastry brush dipped in hot water.  </P> <P> Stir frequently, moving thermometer as necessary, until mixture reaches 238  degrees. Wash down sides of pan at least twice more during cooking.  </P> <P> Begin testing for desired consistency by dropping small amount of mixture into  ice water. When candy reaches 245 degrees or desired consistency, remove from  heat. Cooking process will take about 45 minutes.  </P> <P> Pour into 8-inch foil lined pan or onto lightly buttered marble slab with  buttered metal candy bars arranged to form 8-inch square. Do not scrape pan.  </P> <P> Allow to firm overnight. Lift caramels from pan, peel off foil or remove metal  candy bars. Butter blade of chefs knife and cut into 3/4- to 1-inch squares,  using sawing motion.  </P> <P> Wrap each square individually. Store at room temperature several days or  refrigerate up to 3 weeks. Makes 64 to 100 caramels.  </P> <P> Note: After pouring, remaining mixture in pan may be scraped onto plate and  served separately.  </P></p>

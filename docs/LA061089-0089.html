			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECOUNT CONFIRMS OUSTER OF VICE MAYOR  </P> <P> A recount on Friday of the votes in a May 23 recall election, in which San  Gabriel Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak lost his City Council seat by a nine-vote  margin, has confirmed the results, said Deputy City Clerk Cindy Bookter.  </P> <P> "It was on the nose," said Bookter, the official in charge of the  election-night tally. "They (Blaszcak's supporters) may not be happy about it,  but I believe they're satisfied. I hope their faith has been restored in (the  city clerk's) office. I feel so happy about this."  </P> <P> Supporters of Blaszcak, who was accused of abusing his powers as a city  official, have called for an investigation by the Los Angeles County district  attorney, the secretary of state and the attorney general, claiming there may  have been ballot-tampering. The final count was 1,903 for recall and 1,894  against.  </P> <P> Gary Meredith, a spokesman for Friends of Frank Blaszcak, said that the recount  had not changed his opinion that an investigation should be conducted.  </P></p>

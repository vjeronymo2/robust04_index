			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: US aims to recycle 50% of its paper by 2000 The US paper industry said yesterday it wanted to recover for recycling about 50 per cent of all the paper Americans use in the year 2000. It currently stands at 40 per cent. The goal was announced as the American Forest &amp; Paper Association, an industry umbrella body, released a survey showing that US pulp, paper and paperboard manufacturing capacity will grow slowly over the next three years. However, it did show there would be a much faster expansion of recycling capacity. In 1990, the paper industry set a goal of recovering 40 per cent of paper by 1995, but it said yesterday it had reached this target two years early. Mr Red Cavaney, president of the Forest &amp; Paper Association, said that 'in 1986 twice as much paper was being landfilled as recovered for recycling. 'Today, for the first time ever, Americans recover more paper for recycling and re-use than they send to landfills.' He added that a 50 per cent recovery rate, which would be a large challenge to reach and appeared about the maximum possible, was unprecedented in a country as large and sparsely populated as the US. Achieving it would put the country ahead of Europe and on a par with Japan, which had achieved a rate of 50 per cent to 51 per cent for the past decade. The industry's capacity survey shows growth expected to average just 1.9 per cent a year through to 1996, well below the previous 10-year average of 2.3 per cent. It will bring total paper and paperboard capacity to an estimated 96.3m annual tons in 1996. Growth in domestic wood pulp capacity is expected to be even lower, at only 0.6 per cent a year. However, recycling capacity is expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.8 per cent.</p>

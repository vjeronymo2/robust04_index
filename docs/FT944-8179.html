			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (15): From ugly duckling to swan in three years - Lufthansa's re-fit The evolution of Lufthansa from ugly duckling to swan over the past three years is by common consent the most successful German restructuring story yet to emerge from the turmoil of the recession. The international investment community showed its approval in late September, subscribing with enthusiasm to a rights issue and an offering from the federal government's shares which shrank Bonn's stake from 52 per cent to 35 per cent. To judge from the mood among investors, the government might have disposed of its entire holding in one swoop, but regulatory requirements - not to mention the prospect of the government's getting a fatter price in future - mean they will have to wait. Expectations of a rising Lufthansa share price are based on confidence that the airline's management will keep the rationalisation and cost-cutting process moving at pace, plus the effects on routine operations of the international economic recovery. Chairman Mr Jurgen Weber, who has kept all of his promises so far (in fact the turn-round from the brink of disaster took only around two years instead of the five he expected), is in no mood to let go of the reins now. He only recently gave a hint of how serious the company's condition was when he took over. 'Only a few people knew really how bad it was, and we could not say anything,' he said. 'There were times when I got up in the morning and knew that we would lose another DM4m today.' While the government gets on with preparing for the final stage of privatisation, promised before the end of next year, the group's management continues working towards its long-term objective of displacing British Airways as Europe's premier airline. The 'passenger-friendly' tone of the German flag-carrier's latest advertising is the most visible indicator of this ambition. But the most audible is Mr Weber's constant refrain that the cost-savings and quality improvements must continue at every level. Accordingly, the entire DM1.2bn raised in the September rights issue will be used to pay off bank borrowings run up by the previous management which spent heavily anticipating the completion of the single European market while simultaneously failing to anticipate recession. The group plans to halve its net debt to DM3bn by 1997, saving DM200m a year in interest charges, while Mr Weber has other cost savings of DM500m in his sights. The first stage of restructuring programme introduced by Mr Weber shortly after his appointment in late 1991 was aimed at reducing manning and labour costs. Old hierarchies were split up, pay was frozen for one year, working hours were increased. Pilots agreed to a 7 per cent increase in flying hours, and the end of easy-going times was underlined when one of their number was fired after refusing to take off because his lunch was not on board. Luxuries such as the group's Cologne headquarters were cut in a sale-and-leaseback deal. Fringe interests such as hotel management were thrown out as stakes were reduced in the Kempinski and Penta hotel chains. As a result, in the 24 months to June this year, costs were cut 15 per cent and productivity was increased more than 30 per cent. The second stage, introduced this year, is intended to reduce costs by a further 20 per cent by 1997. A large proportion of these economies is likely to come not from the direct efforts of Mr Weber and the main board, but from new, independent management teams assembled to run the new-look Lufthansa group, plans for which emerged on the eve of privatisation. Group cargo operations plus the internal service divisions, aircraft maintenance and information technology will be hived off as separate joint stock companies on January 1. They will function as independent profit centres, alongside the main passenger airline business, and LSG Catering and Condor charter services which are already run as free-standing businesses. The result will be a wholesale restructuring of the classic German 'pyramid' management structure - where virtually every decision is made at the apex - which will leave the main board in charge of group strategy and the passenger airline, while fostering entrepreneurialism in the other companies. They will be expected to seek out new business and customers apart from Lufthansa in the world market and, as the airline's internal newspaper said, counter cost pressures with 'greater flexibility' than is available to them under the existing group structure. As an indicator of the possibilities open to the offshoots, the IT business, to be named Lufthansa Systems, is to be launched in concert with the General Motors subsidiary, EDS, which will hold a 25 per cent stake and share management control. This suggests similar arrangements with globally-active partners are desirable for the other fledglings and in the core business itself, where two candidates are already waiting in the wings - partners and code-sharers United Airlines and Thai Airways. Amid all the brouhaha over the way the board mastered the recession and rebuilt the airline, most excitement has stemmed from the formation this year of strategic alliances with United and Thai which gave Lufthansa the global reach necessary if it is to stage a realistic challenge to British Airways. All that is lacking, analysts say, is for the deals to be cemented by cross-shareholdings, an issue which all three sides have said may be addressed in future. When that might be appears to depend on Bonn's success in its efforts to persuade its European Union partners to amend union legislation under which more than half an airline operator's shares must be owned by European individuals or institutions. This was one of the reasons for using the book-building technique in the recent placing - to allow careful selection of investors - and excluding the US from the offer. According to the government's own timetable, change will be needed before the end of next year when it has undertaken to dispose of all its remaining shares, which are forecast by then to be worth well over DM3bn. With the first tranche of the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom due almost immediately afterwards - and expected to raise at least DM10bn - success will depend on Bonn's ability to spread its offerings as widely as possible across the global capital market.</p>

The development is expected to put more pressure on Ankara's  ties with Tehran aimed at curbing regional terrorism. Official  sources said they expect now more than ever for Iran to abide  with its guarantees to Turkey and fulfill its obligations  underlined in mutual security protocols.    There are already reports that some of the wounded PKK  militants have been transferred to the so-called Halil Cavus  camp, some 70 kilometers from Zhalah, in Iranian territory.  Officials said on Monday that although an exact damage report  was still not available with regard to last Friday's air strikes  on the PKK camp in Zhalah, some 110 kilometers from the Turkish  border, the separatists could not use the camp again. The camp,  consisting of underground tunnels, caves, at least 21 buildings  and dozens of tents, has reportedly been totally destroyed.  Military sources say one of the main priorities of the  operation had been to make the area unusable for the terrorists.    According to Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Cogu Silahcioglu,  constant monitoring of PKK wireless communications over the past  three days has shown that none of the separatist units in the  region can raise anyone at Zhalah.    Meanwhile, regional sources have said that (Ferhat) Osman  Ocalan, brother of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, is currently in  Iran and suspected of being in Orumiyeh.    Official sources say that since they are not able to use  Zhalah again, the remainder of the PKK forces in the region  would seek a new camp. About 1,600 terrorists were thought to  be in Zhalah at the time of the attack.    One view is that the PKK may return to its camps in Iraq,  near Ochnevieh, and use these for both training and cross-border  attacks into Turkey. This depends mainly on Iran's sincerity in  its pledge to Ankara to hit back at terrorism. If not, the PKK  can continue to shelter in Iranian territory in which it has had  a constant force of 800-1,000 fighters up till now. According  to another view, some of the leading militants may be  transferred to Armenia where the PKK has official protection and  aims at opening a major training camp.    Osman Ocalan has had constant relations with Iranian  officials in the past three years and has recently held a  high-level meeting with representatives of the Iranian  Information Ministry.  <H5>  Retaliation </H5>   Meanwhile, Turkish security officials have upgraded  precautionary measures against a possible terrorist attack in  retaliation for Friday's operation.    Security sources, over the weekend, took measures at all  entrances to the Turkish capital and police have been warned in  major metro- [sentence as published].</p>

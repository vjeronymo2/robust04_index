			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Green Light for </F> Italian Steel Aid"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, June 15 -- The European Commission  today gave the go-ahead to 790 billion lire in aid for Italy to  help 68 private steel firms make capacity cuts, breathing fresh  life into an EU [European Union] steel plan that had seemed  moribund.    EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert will illustrate  the decision -- to be put to EU industry ministers on Wednesday  [22 June] -- to Italian Industry Minister Vito Gnutti in Rome  tomorrow.    EU Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that "cutting  5-6 million tonnes from Italy's private steel producers is the  only chance we have to get up to the minimum European target of  19 million tonnes, allowing us to apply the steel plan."    "Each of the 68 aid cases will have to be notified by Italy,  and will be examined individually," van Miert said, underlining  the need to "swiftly act on the Commission's June decision."</p>

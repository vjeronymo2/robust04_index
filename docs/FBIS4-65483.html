			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the Paris studio -- live]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    [Butrus-Ghali] Good morning.    [Giesbert] The United Nations is taking a lot of flak right  now. You will have heard what [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur  and [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe have said: If things continue  like this in Bosnia, we shall withdraw our peacekeeping troops.  What do you think about this?    [Butrus-Ghali] I think that any peacekeeping operation must  be of limited duration, and that we must encourage the  protagonists in the conflict to find a peaceful solution as  quickly as possible, because there is fatigue on the part of the  member states, on both the military front and the financial  front.    [Giesbert] What will happen if France puts its threat into  action?    [Butrus-Ghali] It is for the Security Council to decide what  we must look at, to which troops we should turn to replace the  troops that wish to leave. A similar operation was conducted in  Somalia, where the French, American, German, and Belgian troops  withdrew, and we were able to continue the operation with  African and Asian troops.    [Giesbert] You saw Francois Mitterrand yesterday, as well as  Edouard Balladur. Did they tackle you about it?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, on the contrary; I received support from  both the prime minister and the president for the action the  United Nations is taking worldwide, whether in Angola,  Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi -- more or less throughout the world.    [Giesbert] But in order to make progress in this matter of  Bosnia, should one not in fact send more peacekeeping troops?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, but if the states do not wish to do  this,  then we are dealing with an established fact. We have to try to  continue with our action with the number of peacekeeping troops  at our disposal at the moment.    [Giesbert] With regard to your action in Bosnia, when you  are  accused, as happens often, of playing the Serbian card, how do  you answer this? You have a representative there who is very  fond of the Serbs.    [Butrus-Ghali] No, not at all. We are neutral, we represent  the international community. Our presence there is made up of  French troops, British troops, Egyptian troops, Jordanian  troops. You have an international group, it is a multinational  force, and the decisions which are adopted are not decisions  adopted by one or two states. They are adopted by 15 states,  including the five big powers. So, we cannot be accused of  subjectivity in so far as we are implementing decisions which  are adopted by the international community.    [Giesbert] You are not being accused of subjectivity, Mr.  Secretary General, but your representative there is accused of  subjectivity.    [Butrus-Ghali] No, it is not true. The representative who is  on the spot is applying the recommendations and the resolutions  which are adopted by the member states of the United Nations,  and it is a normal thing that the various protagonists are going  to accuse us of subjectivity when this or that action is not in  keeping with their particular objectives.    [Giesbert] The Bosnians are howling.    [Butrus-Ghali] The Bosnians are howling, the Serbs are  howling, the Croats are howling, and we have had problems with  all three protagonists at different moments.    [Giesbert] What about the basic question raised by the  Bosnia  problem, because you are accused of many things, but in the  final analysis, you do not have the necessary means? Does this  not raise the question of this real army which the United  Nations ought to have, a real army which would be capable of  making war?    [Butrus-Ghali] I agree, but this real army depends on the  willingness of the member states. The United Nations does not  have an army, arms, or the financial resources to be able to  act, if the member states do not decide that this should be the  case.    [Giesbert] And what do the member states say? They say if we  cannot do that, it is because of the United Nations. In other  words, you are being used as a scapegoat.    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, certainly the United Nations is often  used as a scapegoat, but I believe everyone knows very well  that, in the final analysis, when a resolution which demands  10,000 men is adopted by the Security Council and we are unable  to obtain the 10,000 men, this is not the fault of the UN  Secretariat. It is due to the fact that the member countries do  not wish to put the 10,000 men demanded by the Security Council  resolution at the UN Secretariat's disposal. Or, alternatively,  if members of the United Nations, after having put certain  forces at UN disposal, decide to withdraw these forces, then I  have no means of preventing these members from withdrawing their  forces.    [Giesbert] You, the secretary general, the United Nations,  are insulted all the time. There are even French ministers who  say it is this, it is that. There is talk of impotence,  cowardice -- do you have the impression that you are being  supported in your action? For example, do the states willingly  help the United Nations -- in all ways, I am not just talking  about financially?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, no, no, the financial problem is another  aspect of the problem. States do not pay their contribution.  The United States owes us more than a billion dollars, so we  have financial difficulties.    [Giesbert] Are you saying that it is in fact the Third World  that pays the United Nations?    [Butrus-Ghali] To a certain extent it is the Third World  which sends the troops, but obviously the logistics, the means  of transporting these troops, the arms required for these  troops, the means of communication, are those of the big states.    [Giesbert] Mr. Secretary General, let us talk about Rwanda  now. There is a dual genocide taking place there, and all that  you are doing at the United Nations in the end is to reduce the  contingent.    [Butrus-Ghali] No, we are not reducing the contingent. Here  again we are talking about a decision by the Security Council.  I gave a report to the Security Council...    [Giesbert, interrupting] In other words, it is not you?    [Butrus-Ghali] On the contrary. [sentence as heard] I asked  the Security Council to replace immediately...[pauses] To give  you an example, the Belgian troops withdrew, and they have the  right to withdraw, because the contribution is a voluntary one.  I read a report to the Security Council, calling on it as a  first option to replace the Belgian troops immediately by other  troops.    [Giesbert] In other words, you are the UN Secretariat  General. In other words, it does not care about anyone else.    [Butrus-Ghali] No, the member states made a choice, but if  the United Nations is to be used as a black sheep and this helps  the member nations, then highlighted whereas the successful  operations are generally overlooked]    [Giesbert] You still have a lot of work on your plate. For  example, as an Arab, are you not afraid of what is going to  happen in Algeria?    [Butrus-Ghali] No, at present Algeria is a matter of an  internal conflict. But if the Algerian Government should ever  ask for our assistance, then we are ready to give it -- just  like any other country, just as the Georgian Government asked  for our help. We have observers on the spot helping to find a  solution to the conflict between the Georgians and the  Abkhazians. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Secretary General. I wish you  success and a good day.    [Butrus-Ghali] Thank you.</p>

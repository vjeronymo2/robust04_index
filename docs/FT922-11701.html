			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television Today's most promising offers all appear to be factual. The first in a 6-part series about British Olympic medal winners, Tales Of Gold, (7.30 BBC1) deals with Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett. Their dominance of middle distance running in the 1980s ought to make for a fascinating programme, the only ominous point being the choice of Kenneth Branagh to deliver the words. Put actors in dark dubbing theatres where they cannot show their faces and too often they work their shirts off to be noticed via their voices. In a rather odd bit of planning, 9.30 sees the start of another 6-part documentary series on sport, this time rugby on BBC2. Up And Under begins with a look at Wigan's clubs, league and union. On BBC2 in Nature (8.00), Julian Pettifer observes British animal rights campaigners trying to rescue another donkey from unfeeling Spaniards. Today's Short Stories (8.30 C4) is about Barbara Carpenter, now 70, who has farmed in the Forest of Dean all her life. Yet another new 6-part series, Made In The USA begins on Channel 4 (11.10). This time the subject is American culture generally and television in particular.</p>

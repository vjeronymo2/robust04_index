			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Leaders battle to set the agenda MR NEIL Kinnock and Mr John Major battled yesterday to raise their strongest issues to the top of the election agenda, with Labour promising to freeze prescription charges and the Tories trumpeting their commitment to strong defences. Buoyed by Labour's lead in opinion polls published yesterday morning, Mr Kinnock complained about the impact of government health policies on patients' pockets and said: 'Putting a price barrier in the way of prevention today simply adds to the cost of cure tomorrow.' Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said the 10 per cent increase in prescription charges that came into force yesterday would be reversed if Labour came to power and so 'cut back the cost of being sick'. He pledged also to restore free eye and dental checks. The Liberal Democrats also underlined their commitment to public services, detailing how they would improve the National Health Service and raise spending on education. Mr Major claimed that defence was 'an issue of the greatest importance when opposition policies pose a threat to the security of our country'. At a press conference peppered with attacks on Labour's past shifts on defence policy, the prime minister said he would 'always maintain strong defences for Britain'. He added: 'The Labour party would not. They would cut our defences to the bone, to the marrow.' Tory strategists have made a central part of their strategy to win back voters what they see as the contrasts between the proven leadership qualities of Mr Major and policy 'U-turns' by Labour.</p>

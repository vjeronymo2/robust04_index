			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Talk of fresh bid for Lasmo Rumours that a third party is poised to enter the fray of the Lasmo/Enterprise bid battle added sparks to a hectic day and sent the turnover of Lasmo shares soaring to 21m. Marketmakers believed a big buyer moved in after fresh developments yesterday in the vigorous fight between the two companies. First, Lasmo issued a defence document which included an independent valuation which set a net asset value of between 180p-211p - higher than that estimated by Enterprise in its bid and sending Lasmo shares jumping 7. Enterprise swiftly hit back saying that it did not intend to include a cash element in its bid offer. Its shares immediately climbed, with investors relieved that the bid would not drain Enterprise cash, and Lasmo stock began to fall back. But with Lasmo clocking up big volume and the price maintaining a gain of 3, talk began to circulate in the market that the bid would soon take a further twist with the arrival of a surprise suitor. Sector experts await the crunch next week when Enterprise must say whether or not it will raise the bid described by Lasmo as 'mean'. Lasmo closed up 3 at 142p. Enterprise added 10 to 410p with 2.3m shares traded.</p>

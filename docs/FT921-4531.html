			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Call to reform race discrimination laws SWEEPING REFORMS are needed to make race discrimination laws effective, according to government research. Existing laws are so heavily weighted against victims that the vast majority of offences go unpunished, according to a study published today. The Commission for Racial Equality has argued for some years that reform is needed, but the government has said it considers existing laws to be adequate. Today's report was compiled by the University of Southampton for the Department of Employment. It says employers should be required by law to take steps to ensure ethnic minorities are recruited and promoted. 'Class actions', along the lines of the US system, should be introduced which would allow cases to be brought on behalf of groups in society. The study argues that the commission should also be given greater powers of investigation. While Britain's race laws are among the most extensive in the European Community, the study says victims of discrimination are 'discouraged by every step' of the legal process. Emotional stress and fear of victimisation 'act as further disincentives'. The study concludes that in spite of considerable legal and practical measures the evidence shows 'the vast majority of instances of discrimination are untested and go unpunished under the current arrangements'.

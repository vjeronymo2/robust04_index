			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DUCKLER DANCE PROGRAM AT SKYLIGHT THEATRE  </P> <P> The pit-a-pat of a rainy day drizzle grew to an actual indoor downpour as five  women in leotards slithered around in a bath of water and Freudian connotations  just inches from their audience in "Wet," a five-part dance with sprinkler  system choreographed by Heidi Duckler. It was the steamiest moment of an  impressive if uneven bill called "Fall to Pieces" presented Saturday and Sunday  at the Skylight Theatre by Collage Dance Theatre.  </P> <P> Collage artistic director Duckler also choreographed the brief opening number,  'Spinster," in which a row of dancers in long dresses stood in isolated pools  of colored light, each beside their own hanging basket. They tended to the  pendulous objects with resolute gestural movements suggesting the routines of  solitude.  </P> <P> "Sight Specific," the "Duckler does L.A." portion of the evening, featured  Collage's five dancers (Debi Albeyta, Cindy Clarke, Eimi Guirao, Aimee Levine,  Laura Ozer) in print pants, T-shirts and sunglasses flopping around on deck  chairs, posing and snapping snapshots.  </P> <P> Spicing up the treatment of this by-now overworked topic were interludes of  text (by Daniel Rosenfeld and John Milton, read by Lia Sargent and signed by  Mary Lee Sanders) between the dance riffs and live percussion by Bob Fernandez,  Joel Hirsch, John Norton and Jim Snodgrass.  </P> <P> Also on the bill was Katherine LaNasa Hopper's "Rocking This Ship," a Southern  flavored meditation on various aspects of woman's fate.

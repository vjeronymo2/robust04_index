			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with First Lieutenant Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih, </F> brother of Kordofan Province Governor, by Muhammad Ahmad  al-Hasan; date and place not given]    [Text] First Lieutenant Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih,  according to his words, worked "until his conscience awakened"  as chief of the security and followup branch of the government  of Kordofan Province, Sudan. He was also the personal guard of  Kordofan's governor, his younger brother. But he left Sudan  recently and declared at a press conference in Switzerland,  where he has applied for political asylum, that he does not wish  to return to Sudan under the current government. He talked about  the tragedies he saw in Kordofan and offered a comprehensive and  detailed personal report on the massacres that have taken away  the lives of thousands of Nubians.    AL-MAJALLAH has contacted lst Lt. Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih  and conducted the following interview with him:    [Al-Hasan] How did you get out of Sudan?    [Salih] I left in the company of my sick mother who went for  treatment in Jordan. When she recovered, thank God, I arranged  for her to return to Sudan and I headed for Switzerland in  search of political asylum. At a press conference there, I said  everything to satisfy my conscience, exposing the ethnic  extermination and purge campaign launched by the Sudanese regime  against Nubia's citizens.    [Al-Hasan] Your talk about the regime's actions against  Nubians was based on reports with which you familiarized  yourself by virtue of your position as security branch chief.  Did you personally see mass extermination or villages burned in  the Nuba Mountains?    [Salih] We made visits to the field with the governor after  the operations, and we saw the villages that were burned to the  ground and the corpses.    [Al-Hasan] How many burned villages and how many corpses did  you see?    [Salih] Nearly 200 villages in the Tolshi Mountains and the  number of corpses ranged from 20 to 150 [per village].    [Al-Hasan] Considering that you are familiar with the  reports  on the extermination operations, what is your estimate of the  number of people claimed as victims of the campaign during your  presence in the service?    [Salih] The reports aren't interested in those annihilated  but in losses suffered by the army and civil defense. Most of  the reports call for more military reinforcements to carry out  these brutal acts.    [Al-Hasan] So, how were you able to estimate the number of  Nubians killed at 60-70,000 people when you were in charge of  the province security, as you have said in your report to the  Sudanese Human Rights Organization?    [Salih] We received reports at the rate of two reports a  month. Each report indicated that the number of victims ranged  from 3-4,000. The reports mentioned no [exact] numbers. So, I  estimated that the lives annihilated during the seven months of  my control of the security branch amounted to these numbers.    [Al-Hasan] Why hasn't the army objected to these operations,  keeping in mind that a large number of NCO's are from Nubia?    [Salih] As of the first moments of the coup, the Front  [National Islamic Front (NIF)] cadres began to liquidate the  armed forces officers and to plant their own men in the military  intelligence. These cadres started dismissing members of the  regular forces on mere suspicion. Thus, trust among officers  has, to a large degree, been lost. Most of these operations are  carried out by officers chosen from the NIF and from its Popular  Defense Forces.    [Al-Hasan] Were you a member of al-Turabi's front and were  you chosen for the mission on this basis?    [Salih] No, I haven't been a member of the NIF  organizations.    [Al-Hasan] Were you chosen for this task because you are the  governor's brother? Is the governor himself from the NIF?    [Salih] I don't believe that I was chosen just because I am  the governor's brother but because of the security capability I  displayed. I was moved from the position of security official in  Khartoum North to Port Sudan because the regime feared that  forces loyal to Lieutenant General Fathi in Port Sudan would  stage a military coup or that a military landing would be staged  in that province. I believe that my security activity was  excellent, thus qualifying me to be transferred to Kordofan  Province.    [Al-Hasan] From your security experience, do you believe  that  your brother, the governor, was one of the Front's military  cadres prior to the coup and that he has a role in the schemes  that are implemented by the Front in the Nuba Mountains?    [Salih] This is an extremely embarrassing question. People  can judge my brother by his actions. All I know about my brother  prior to the coup is that he was extremely religious.    [Al-Hasan] Didn't it occur to you to broach this human  tragedy with him?    [Salih] I did. He said to me that the orders came down from  the top and that he was powerless to confront them. Lieutenant  General al-Bashir had visited Kurdufan and proclaimed its  governor the province prince of jihad [holy war] and himself,  i.e., al-Bashir, the imam of jihad. Al-Bashir also declared  1992-93 the year of jihad in Kordofan.    [Al-Hasan] How could jihad be declared against the Nubian  tribes when statistics show that 40 percent of them are Muslim  and 40 percent animist, and that Christians among them don't  exceed 20 percent?    [Salih] This is something that perplexes me too. I was  surprised when I saw that their harsh treatment made no  distinction between Muslim and Christian. I felt tortured when I  saw children separated from their families and turned over to  the Islamic Call authorities, even though the children were  Muslim in the first place. I was pained to see the children's  families sent to government production [crop?] collection sites  under those oppressive conditions and in that disgraceful manner.</p>

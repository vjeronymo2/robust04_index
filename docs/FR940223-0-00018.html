The Commission has reviewed the provisions of the Rule, and has concluded that due to inconsistencies with and duplication by later-adopted statements of policy of general application, the Tailored Clothing Rule is no longer in the public interest and should be repealed. This notice contains a Statement of Basis and Purpose for the repeal of the Rule, and incorporates a regulatory analysis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> March 25, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for copies of the Statement of Basis and Purpose should be sent to the Public Reference Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20580. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0065 forcenewline --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Neil W.

Section 2(d) and (e) of the Act require that promotional allowances and services be made available to competing sellers on proportionately equal terms. The Rule established a presumption that allowances in the tailored clothing industry that were not provided in accordance with a written plan were not available on proportionately equal terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The year after the Rule was promulgated, the Supreme Court decided the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FTC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fred Meyer, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 390 U.S. 341 (1968). In that option the Court suggested that the Commission might wish to expand on earlier guidance and issue detailed guidelines to promotional allowances under sections 2(d) and (e). The Commission accepted this invitation the following year by publishing the so-called ``Fred Meyer Guides.'' See 16 CFR part 240. These set out general standards for promotional allowances, applicable to all industries. The Fred Meyer Guides suggest that sellers ``would be well advised'' to put complex plans in writing, but they do not penalize the failure to have a written plan. The Fred Meyer Guides have been revised as needed to keep them current, most recently in 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the Fred Meyer Guides in place, the Commission was concerned that the earlier, industry-specific Rule was unnecessary, and that its different substantive provisions could be a source of potential confusion. In July of 1993 the Commission therefore requested public comment on a proposal to repeal the Tailored Clothing Rule. No comments were received in response to this request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Rulemaking Record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rulemaking record in this proceeding consists of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Comment dated July 2, 1993 (58 FR 35907), and a memorandum from the Office of the Secretary reporting that no comments were received in response to that request. In addition, the Commission takes notice of published court and agency decisions, and of the existence and provisions of the Fred Meyer Guides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

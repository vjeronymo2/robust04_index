			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 'WHAT IF . . . ' NOT TO BE ANSWERED;  </P> <P> DARK THOUGHTS HAUNT CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS REUNION  </P> <P> The most extraordinary aspect of last month's Moscow conference on the Cuban  missile crisis was the fact that it took place at all.  </P> <P> No one could have imagined in October, 1962, when Robert McNamara, McGeorge  Bundy and I were conferring in the Cabinet Room with President John F. Kennedy  and a dozen others on the world's first potentially nuclear confrontation, that  one day we would gather in Moscow with Soviet and Cuban counterparts for a  frank and friendly exchange of facts and views about the crisis.  </P> <P> On Oct. 18, 1962, as he met tensely in the Oval Office with Soviet Foreign  Minister Andrei Gromyko and Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, the President could  not have imagined that one day these men and their colleagues would be sitting  around a Moscow table amiably answering our questions on the crisis, exchanging  acknowledgements of error with us and openly disagreeing among themselves.  </P> <P> Among American scholars and experts, the 1962 confrontation over missiles in  Cuba is almost everyone's favorite crisis.  </P> <P> Hawks like to talk about Kennedy's naval blockade, facing down Nikita S.  Khrushchev and forcing his missiles out of our hemisphere.  </P> <P> Doves like to talk about Kennedy's cool diplomacy, peacefully resolving the  crisis without the United States firing a single shot.  </P> <P> Revisionist historians like to complain that Kennedy needlessly brought the  world to the brink of nuclear destruction over a Soviet action that, however  hostile and surreptitious, did not fundamentally threaten our security.  </P> <P> Right-wing scholars like to complain that Kennedy's refusal that October to  launch an invasion of the communist satellite 90 miles from our shore cost the  United States its last best opportunity and excuse to go in there and take Cuba  away from Castro.  </P> <P> War-games theorists are divided into those admiring the carefully executed  management of the crisis by Kennedy and his advisers and those castigating the  mistaken assumptions and miscalculations on both sides that nearly led the  world to a nuclear nightmare.  </P> <P> As the discussion in Moscow confirmed, there is some truth -- but only some --  in each of these perspectives. Ultimate release of the transcript of our  proceedings will no doubt provide new ammunition for each of these analysts,  justifying new editions of their books, new essays and new lectures on their  favorite crisis.  </P> <P> But the 1962 showdown over Cuba was my least favorite crisis. I hope never to  see its like again. Our discussions in Moscow refocused my mind not on the  successful, statesman-like resolution of that conflict, which filled me with  overwhelming pride and relief at the time, but on the terrible vulnerability  and fallibility of man in the nuclear age.  </P> <P> We talked earnestly in Moscow about the invaluable role of continuing  communication between the combatants during a nuclear crisis. I agree that this  was one of the most important lessons of 1962. But it is now clear that some of  those communications included deception, exaggeration and bluff, which could  have led to unthinkably disastrous consequences.  </P> <P> We talked proudly in Moscow about our respective commanders-in-chief,  exercising careful control of the situation to avoid plunging headlong into the  irrevocable and unknown. Kennedy and Khrushchev do indeed deserve praise for  their ultimate caution and their rejection of less temperate advice. But it is  now clear that no military machine can be wholly free from dangerous human and  mechanical errors beyond the control of the most prudent commander-in-chief.  </P> <P> We talked matter-of-factly in Moscow about the calculations and the numbers  that weighed heavily in the balance of choices during those 13 unprecedented  days and nights in 1962 -- the number of missiles on each side, the number of  nuclear warheads in place, the number of air sorties required for a "surgical  strike" at the missile sites, the number of troops on both sides, the number of  casualties expected, even the numerical odds of war.  </P> <P> But it is now clear that no one in the room in January, 1989, or in October,  1962, could quantify an acceptable level of nuclear destruction or an  acceptable risk of nuclear war. It is thus not surprising that the meeting in  Moscow has refueled old controversies -- within, more than between, the two  superpower delegations -- over how great the risks really were as the crisis  neared its climax on the night of Oct. 27, 1962.  </P> <P> In truth, we will never know with any certainty -- no matter how many  conferences we hold or how many pieces of evidence we selectively recall --  whether Kennedy would have in fact launched an invasion of Cuba had the Soviet  rockets not been removed promptly, or whether Khrushchev in response would have  launched an attack on Berlin or Turkey. We will never know whether the American  forces storming Cuba would have used the tactical nuclear weapons recommended  by the Pentagon. We will never know whether the Soviets, either before or after  such an attack, would have fired their Cuban-based missiles at American cities  rather than have them captured or destroyed by American forces. On these  questions, we simply do not know what might have been.  </P> <P> Thank God.  </P></p>

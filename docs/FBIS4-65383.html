			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Over to the Balkan crisis. The fighting  continues around the Bosnian city of Tuzla that was attacked  after the Muslim forces said that they had made territorial  gains at the Serbs' expense. Meanwhile, diplomatic initiatives  to end the war continue. The European Union [EU] foreign  ministers have shown their support for the international plan  agreed on last week, describing it as the only realistic way to  end the conflict. From Brussels, here is our correspondent  Nacho Hernandez.    [Hernandez] The EU supports the agreement reached at the  Geneva meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina despite its rejection by  the parties in conflict. The Twelve see the fact that Russia,  the United States, the United Nations, and the EU have a unified  position in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a positive move. Spanish  Foreign Minister Javier Solana said that for the first time  positions are coordinated.    [Begin Solana recording] If we are able to make this so by  focusing all of our energies on it over the next few days. I  repeat that the agreement that was reached with all the  concerned parties is something we have been wishing for a good  many months. [end recording]    [Hernandez] Furthermore, the Twelve have decided to grant  the  city of Mostar aid worth 7,500 million pesetas. The EU starts  to administer the city of Mostar on 1 June.</p>

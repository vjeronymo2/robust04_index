[as  received]    The Royal Gazette said on Thursday that her shock departure  followed a cabinet row over independence. She will remain as an  mp.    Premier Sir John Swan, already hit by Tuesday's resignation  of Technology Minister Michael Winfield because of business and  family reasons, said he was stunned by Mrs Decouto's decision.    In a letter released to the media Wednesday night, Sir John  held back from accepting her resignation.    In her resignation letter to the premier, Mrs Decouto said  she did not agree with the government holding a referendum on  the question of independence for this British colony at the  present time.    Bermuda is still trying to get to grips with the  implications  of the closure of three foreign military bases in the island.  The Canadians closed their base at the end of last year and the  United States and United Kingdom bases are to follow suit late  next year.    "Bermuda has too much on its plate at this time (with the  bases closing).    "I attempted to make my views clear at cabinet," said Mrs  Decouto.    Sir John called an emergency cabinet meeting for Thursday to  control what could mushroom into a crisis of confidence.    Sources said there was no connection between the two  resignations.    The departure of Mrs Decouto, a lawyer and former deputy  premier, ends a controversial ministerial career in which she  become known as Bermuda's iron lady.    As minister of social services in the mid-1980s, she oversaw  Bermuda's first responses to the AIDS crisis as well as  commissioning of the new prison.    But it was her appointment as environment minister that  solidified her reputation as a bold, no-nonsense politician.    In a bid to halt the island's dwindling stocks, she stood up  to the island's fishermen and imposed a fish pot ban.</p>

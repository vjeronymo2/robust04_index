			<p>BFN     [Text] The contract for sale of the Changsha City party  committee office complex to the Changsha city branch of the Bank  of Industry and Commerce of China was signed yesterday afternoon.    The Changsha City party committee office complex is situated  in one of the busiest sections of May 1 Road, with superior  geographical position and convenient transport facilities. The  complex was built in the early 1960's, accommodating all the  more than 10 departments of the Changsha city party committee.  In view of the fact that the city party committee office  complex had limited floor space and deficient facilities, the  Changsha city authorities, based on a thorough feasibility  study, decided to sell the property to the Changsha city branch  of the Bank of Industry and Commerce of China, at the price of  100 million yuan. In this connection, a new site will be sought  to relocate city party committee offices. It is believed that  this transaction will help promote the reform and opening up  process and economic development of the city.</p>

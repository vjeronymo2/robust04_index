			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: The singular art of success / Review of the work of Avigdor Arikha and other refreshingly non-avant-garde artists So much, in any successful artist's career, is a matter of luck. Talent will out, we say, to which the reply can only be: up to a point, Lord Copper. It is not to begrudge the Israeli painter, Avigdor Arikha, his long and continuing success, to take his current exhibition to make the point. Now 65, he has been showing regularly and consistently around the world - Tel Aviv, London, Zurich, Stockholm, Paris, New York, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Los Angeles, the Venice and Sao Paulo biennales, definitive group exhibitions from Washington to Vienna - for more than 30 years. Good luck to him. It is only when we consider the actual nature of his work that we come in for the surprise. For here is no darling of the avant-garde, no conceptualist or latter-day surrealist, no neo-dada, post-Duchampian, thought-provoking poseur. He is nothing more, nothing less, than a painter of unexceptionable portraits, figures and still-life, with a delicate touch and a quick eye for the charming gesture and the intimate detail. He is, in short, a somewhat old-fashioned and conventional figurative painter and none the worse for that. Who would then say that representation is old hat - Arikha paints old hats rather well: and who can begin to account for such critical success? How is it that he should be picked out for such shows as 'European Painting in the 70s' (Los Angeles 1974), or 'Art as Art (Venice Biennale 1982), or 'Raphael and French Art' (Paris 1983)? And how does he come to be painting the portrait of the keeper of the modern collections at the Tate? It is not that Arikha is no good. He is a very clever painter, with the gift of being able to make the simplest line or smudge of paint, or twist and scrape of the brush, register as the true and lively intended image. His prints are especially impressive in this way, with the subtlest effects achieved by the simplest means. His chief fault is only that he seems in the newer work a shade complacent in his cleverness, notably in his drawings and paintings of the figure and the nude, which proclaim an accuracy and attention of observation which are no longer there. He remains an interesting painter, but the more general and serious point is that even here in England, most especially here in England, there is no end of figurative painters at the very least as interesting in their work as he, and certainly no less competent. We have only to go round any summer show of the Royal Academy, or the prize exhibition of the Portrait Award at the National Portrait Gallery, both of them coming up next month, to be presented with the evidence. Yet who among those painters of the figure or the landscape is ever likely to be picked out for any British Council tour abroad, or international survey at the Grand Palais or Venice Biennale, or asked to paint a portrait of the deputy director of the Tate? The annual show of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters is another case in point. It may have as always rather more than its fair share of jokes in doubtful taste, but in the last few years, notably under a recent president, David Poole, it has revived remarkably from its former moribund state. Younger members have been recruited from the Portrait Award - Jeff Stultiens, a former winner, now indeed the Society's secretary - and the membership generally stiffened. Many of the works on show are very good by any contemporary measure. Howard Morgan, the current star, may continue to disappoint: his ambition is matched as yet only by his self-indulgence. If only he would give as much attention to drawing as to overall effect, and yet his drawings themselves betray the inadequacy. Directly alongside, three portraits by Michael Reynolds offer a merciless contrast, one, of a seated woman in a white jumper, as fine a portrait and as interesting a new painting as any we might see in a year. Its water-colour study is exquisite. Thomas Coates, hung at the other end of the exhibition, is another hero, an artist of true flair whose energy and variousness sometimes tend to obscure his underlying distinction. He is a remarkable draughtsman. I only take exception to an occasional eccentricity in his choice of subject. Were he to come down within the speed limit, more might be able to judge him at his true worth, as he flashes past. Daphne Todd, Hans Schwarz, John Ward, Tilly Willis and Martin Yeoman are among the others whose work stands out. John Boyd and Susan Ryder successfully take on the conversation piece, that most testing of genres. And do we find a Reynolds or Coates among the recent acquisitions at the Tate, or on tour with an Arts Council selection, or included in a survey of current painting at the Hayward Gallery? I only ask. Avigdor Arikha: Marlborough Fine Art, 6 Albemarle Street W1, until June 4. Royal Society of Portrait Painters Annual Exhibition; The Mall Galleries, The Mall SW1, until May 30.</p>

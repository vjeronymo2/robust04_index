			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Cetin] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has expressed the  view that the NATO decision reached on Bosnia-Herzegovina  yesterday is significant in many aspects.    In a statement today, Cetin stressed that the decision is  important from the viewpoint of the alliance's credibility and  relations between North America and Europe. He said: We  sincerely hope this decision will at least prevent further  massacres and facilitate a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Cetin recalled that Turkey prepared a similar plan in August  1992, and presented it to the five permanent UN Security Council  members. He continued: From that moment on, Turkey has  defended it views on the issue at every forum. When we look  back, we see that it would have been preferable to reach a  similar decision then, thus preventing the death of thousands of  people. Diplomacy that is not supported by a convincing  determination cannot succeed. This principle has once again  been confirmed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now what remains to be  done is to implement the decision without any changes and speed  up efforts toward a solution. Turkey will continue to fulfill  its duties on the issue.</p>

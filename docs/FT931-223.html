			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Public-sector pay limit accepted THE GOVERNMENT'S 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector has won its first acceptance from two groups of public-sector employees. The Education Institute of Scotland, representing about 45,000 Scottish teachers, accepted the deal at the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee, and about 10,000 Royal Mail managers have also formally endorsed the offer. Few unions are strongly resisting the public-sector pay squeeze but most are also refusing to accept it formally.</p>

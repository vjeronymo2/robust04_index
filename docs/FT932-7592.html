			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading WORRIES that the London market might have to soak up a spate of rights issues and fears of a turnaround on Wall Street led to a slide in stock index futures yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo. In a volatile session, the June contract on the FT-SE started trading at 2,828. A sizeable sell order brought a decline but June was later boosted by the late morning release of favourable inflation figures. It was then that June hit the day's high of 2,832. However, talk of a flood of rights issues particularly in the property sector, and fears that the New York market would start to tumble following its recent strength once again encouraged strong selling and the contract fell to the day's low of 2,803 in the last half hour of trading. June finished at 2,812, more or less in line with the cash market on volume of around 11,000 contracts. The main feature in the traded options was the expiry of the May Index options at 10.30 am. Total volume was 35,517 lots with Land Securities the most active issue.</p>

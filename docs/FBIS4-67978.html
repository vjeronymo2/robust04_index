			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luisa Amelia Rodriguez from the "National </F> Newscast"]    [Text] The Technical Judicial Police [PTJ] have ruled out  terrorism in this morning's bomb blast, which occurred at 0642  on the No. 1207 Caracas subway train. At the time of the blast,  the subway train was moving westward and headed toward the  Parque del Este station. Five people were injured in the  explosion.    As we announced during our noon newscast, PTJ investigations  are currently centered on a group of youngsters believed to be  students at the Don Bosco Industrial Vocational School.  Witnesses reported that they had seen the students behaving  oddly in the subway car in which the explosion took place. The  students left the subway train at the Los Cortijos station just  a few minutes before the pipe bomb exploded.    PTJ Chief of Homicide Leonardo Pia Baruta has the following  explanation:    [Begin recording] Baruta: At this time, the  Homicide Division is continuing its investigation into the  explosive device [words indistinct] in which four [as heard]  people were slightly injured. We have collected some evidence,  such as leaflets that had been scattered throughout the subway  car. We also collected some of the residue of the chemicals  used in the bomb.    Unidentified reporter: Could this incident be  interpreted as a reactivation of terrorist activities in our  country?    Baruta: In no way whatsoever. We cannot speak  about terrorism or anything of the sort. I would prefer to  associate it with a student protest. It was probably caused by  some youngsters who, as result of their immaturity and youth,  detonated this pipe bomb. [end recording]    In this way, the PTJ has ruled out the hypothesis that  terrorism was behind the Caracas subway explosion.</p>

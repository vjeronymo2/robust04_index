He conveyed a verbal message  from His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id to his brother His  Majesty King Husayn, dealing with matters of shared interest and  Arab and world issues of mutual concern to the two brotherly  countries.    Mr. Bin-'Alawi had this to say to Jordan television about  the  message and Oman's role in Arab fence-mending:    [Begin Bin-'Alawi recording] I communciated to His Highness  Prince Hasan a message from his majesty the sultan to his  brother his majesty the king. The message is a link in the  chain of consultations that have marked the personal  relationship between their majesties on matters related to joint  Arab action, Arab solidarity, and other issues. Just like  Jordan, the Sultanate of Oman wants to promote inter-Arab  reconcilation. We hope both their majesties' efforts will yield  results in order to advance the interests of the Arab nation.  [end recording]    The Omani minister left Amman this afternoon concluding a  visit to Jordan lasting several days.    On hand to receive and bid farewell to the minister were  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, the minister of state for foreign  affairs; the director general and the chief of protocal at the  Foreign Ministry; and the Omani ambassador in Amman.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Prague picks 12 telecoms contestants Twelve international telecommunications groups have been selected to enter the first round of bidding for a stake in SPT Telecom, the Czech Republic's national telephone monopoly for which the government is seeking a strategic foreign investor. The 12 are AT &amp; T, GTE Telephone, Ameritech International, Bell Atlantic International, Southwestern Bell International Development, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, PTT Telecom Netherlands, Italy's Stet International, Telecom Denmark, Swiss Telecom and Korea Telecom. Preliminary bids are expected by next month, from which a short-list will be drawn up of companies to proceed to a second round. The winner should be announced by the government by March 1 next year. Under the present plan, SPT Telecom's share capital is to be increased by 37 per cent. The government will then sell 27 per cent of the enlarged equity to the strategic partner. The state's shareholding will then fall from 74 per cent to 51 per cent, a stake it is to retain for up to five years. The remaining shares, representing 22 per cent of the capital, are held by institutional and private investors who have received them through the government's second wave of mass privatisation. Estimates of the value of the stake range from Dollars 650m to Dollars 1bn. J. P. Morgan is acting as financial and strategic adviser to the government and SPT Telecom in the bidding process.</p>

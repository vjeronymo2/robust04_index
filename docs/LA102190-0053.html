			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> So Joe Wilson, "Bush's Man in Baghdad" (World Report, Oct. 16), has "Old World"  diplomatic skills. Since this is not defined in the article, I'll have to  presume that the "skills" Wilson possesses are the ones mentioned in the  article.  </P> <P> They include Wilson's dreaming of being a diplomat in a war, coming from an  "established" Northern California family, taking his scheduled autumn vacation  on the French Riviera, collecting all that extra "danger pay" since Aug. 11,  and just enjoying the sun from his deck chair by his swimming pool in his  "Malibu-style" Baghdad home -- all this while wearing a festive Hawaiian shirt.  </P> <P> Is it any wonder that America gets involved in foreign wars when our own  diplomats freely admit that they "dream of war" and are "fascinated" to be in  the middle of it?  </P> <P> When I think of the 200,000 American troops risking their lives and living  uncomfortably in Saudi Arabia, Wilson's comments are insulting at best.  Diplomats are supposed to be there to prevent wars. Wilson appears to be  enjoying the whole experience.  </P> <P> JIM FUHRMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

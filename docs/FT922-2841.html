			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Carter Holt Harvey advances 22% CARTER Holt Harvey, the New Zealand and Chilean forestry group, reported a 22 per cent rise in profits before extraordinary items in the year to March 31, and says it is well positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions. Profits advanced to NZDollars 193.6m (USDollars 105.2m) from NZDollars 158.2m last year. But after an extraordinary loss relating to an investment company associated with the Carter family, who are no longer involved with the company, profit slipped 8 per cent to NZDollars 179.8m. Mr David Oskin, the new chief executive, said lower exchange rates and the benefits from restructur-ing helped to lift earn-ings. Mr Oskin's appointment follows the recent joint venture between his company, International Paper, and Brierley Investments to run CHH. The Chilean interests, 30 per cent of listed company Copec and investments in fishing, fibreboard and plastics, provided a much improved return, producing an after-tax share of retained earnings of NZDollars 72.6m, up from NZDollars 48.4m last year. In the past year, low international pulp and paper prices halved pre-tax operating return to Dollars NZ61.5m. The disappointing performance resulted from cyclically low prices combined with significant non-recurring charges and operating inefficiencies from the modernisation programme at the Kinleith mill.</p>

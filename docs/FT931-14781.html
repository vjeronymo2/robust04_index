			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Rao pledges financial help to victims of violence in Bombay MR P V NARASIMHA RAO, the Indian prime minister, yesterday made a flying visit to strife-torn Bombay and pledged financial help for the victims of the city's violence. The mission was a belated attempt to answer criticisms that the central government has done little to quell the violence, which, according to hospital estimates, has claimed 600 lives in Bombay alone and caused widespread damage. Over 50,000 have fled the city. Police and troops have restored order to most districts, but there were reports of further violence, including at least two deaths, yesterday as the premier toured the city under heavy guard. Businessmen were counting the cost following the second spate of violence since Hindu militants tore down a mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya six week ago. The demolition unleashed a nationwide wave of inter-religious violence. Many businesses were still shut yesterday for the 10th day in succession, while others closed early to allow workers to reach home before dark. The Indian Merchants Chamber, a trade group, estimated lost production in Bombay this month at Rs13.5bn (Pounds 5.9bn). Mr KRV Subramaniam, a former president of Bombay Chamber of Commerce, said it would take six months for output to return to normal. The whole economy will suffer since Bombay is the commercial capital and accounts for 35 per cent of the nation's exports. Moslems have been the chief victims of the violence - singled out for attack by Shiv Sena, a Bombay-based right wing Hindu political party with close links to the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main national opposition party. Shiv Sena has openly boasted of 'teaching Moslems a lesson.' The violence has been aggravated by criminals taking advantage of the turmoil for looting, extortion and grabbing land by driving Moslems out of their homes. Moslems also claim the police have often stood aside giving Hindu mobs free reign.</p>

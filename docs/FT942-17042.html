			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Plans to break up N Yorks attacked Trade and industry associations representing more than 600 companies in North Yorkshire have written to the prime minister opposing the local government review. The Local Government Commission wants to break up North Yorkshire and create smaller, unitary authorities. The name 'riding' would be revived for some of them. Yortek, which represents engineering and other manufacturers, has joined with Yorkshire Pantry - a food and beverage industry trade body  - and the Vale of York Small Business Association to support the status quo. In their letter, Mr Howard Chadwick, Mr Bill Taylor and Mr Ian Traynor - the organisations' respective chairmen - tell Mr Major: 'North Yorkshire has served us extremely well over the last 20 years. These proposals will lead to the break-up of professional and cost-effective services. 'The proposals are not generally supported by local businessmen and are based on predictions of financial savings which are marginal and so prone to error that we could certainly not recommend an investment decision on such a basis,' they add. The commission's plans are 'ill-founded, grossly unpopular and totally inappropriate'. Asking for discussions 'at the highest possible level', the chairmen claim the views of business have been ignored.</p>

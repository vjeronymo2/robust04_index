Thirteen of Japan's  biggest companies -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nichimen, Itohchu  corporation, and others -- have joined it. The committee is  headed by the Turkmen Vice Prime Minister Rejep Saparov, and  president of Itohchu Corporation, Minoru Murofushi.    Representatives of this firm who are attending the meeting  expressed their wish to become members of an international  consortium building a gas pipeline across Iran to Turkey, and to  take part in the modernization of a number of petro-chemical  plants.    The efforts of the joint committee have already resulted in  agreement on the construction of a polyethylene plant in the  town of Seydi, which will be built by Mitsubishi Corporation.  The Export-Import Bank of Japan is extending credit of $320  million for this project.    The next session of the Japanese-Turkmen economic committee  is scheduled for next fall in Tokyo.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Ruling over BCCI deposits THE HIGH COURT ruled yesterday that companies and directors were entitled to set off deposits they held at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International against company overdrafts. The decision is expected to have widespread implications for attempts by the liquidators to recover other bank debts with UK companies. The ruling was made in three cases involving seven companies and their directors. The High Court declared that their debts with BCCI could be reduced by the amounts held by directors on deposit with the bank. If the decision had gone against the companies they would have had to pay the full amounts of their overdrafts. A further setback would have been that the amount their directors received back from their deposits would have been subject to the payouts secured under the negotiated settlement between the liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. Mr Chris Henson, of Lovell White Durrant, solicitors acting for the BCCI liquidators, said they would be considering an appeal. He said the ruling would affect a large number of BCCI clients: 'A very high proportion of the loans made by BCCI has some sort of deposit associated. This will make a substantial difference to the amount they will be able to claim.' Mr Mohammad Sarwar, a director of two of the companies involved in yesterday's rulings, said the companies would have folded if the judgments had gone against them. He is a director of MS Fashions, a Leeds clothing retailer, and of MS Fashions (Wholesale) which together employ 50 people. Each company had given a debenture to BCCI and had cross-guaranteed each other's debt. Directors' deposits of Pounds 300,000 were being used to secure a combined Pounds 600,000 overdraft from BCCI. Touche Ross, the liquidator, had demanded the repayment of the whole overdraft. The companies argued that the directors' deposits should be set off against the overdraft. Receivers were appointed to the two companies in May by the liquidators but were discharged in July after Mr Sarwar repaid the Pounds 300,000 balance of the debt. The two other cases covered by the ruling were: High Street Services, Portmaid Fashions and Cira which together owed more than Pounds 1m against a deposit of Pounds 426,000 by Mr Raees Ahmed, a director; Impexbond and Tucan Investments, which owed BCCI Pounds 3.3m as against Pounds 4.5m held on deposit by Mr Nasir Amir, a director.</p>

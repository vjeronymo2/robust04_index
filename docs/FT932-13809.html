			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Balkan Conflict: Milosevic deaf to Owen entreaties LORD OWEN, the European Community mediator, yesterday failed in his eleventh-hour effort to persuade Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to swing his weight behind the international peace plan for Bosnia. During a one-day visit to Belgrade, Lord Owen made what many observers see as a final attempt to persuade Mr Milosevic to bring Bosnian Serb leaders to heel and support the plan, devised by himself and Mr Cyrus Vance, to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces, roughly along ethnic lines. After a 2 1/2 -hour session behind closed doors, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the mediators, admitted little hope remained that Serb leaders would drop their opposition to the plan. He said: 'I don't want to say last chance, but there's a particular pressure now on everybody to see if something can't be pulled out at the last minute.' Lord Owen, who also held talks with President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia, is due to return to Belgrade tomorrow for talks with President Milosevic, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and the Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. Mr Eckhard, admitting the failure to overcome fierce Serb objections to the plan, said: 'If the Serbs say 'no' as they have done today, they (Lord Owen and Mr Vance) have no option really but to turn it over to the Security Council.' The disarmament of Moslems in Srebrenica, the besieged eastern Bosnian town, was completed and the town demilitarised by noon yesterday, the UN said. But a Bosnian Serb army leader claimed Moslems had reneged on an agreement to give up weapons and had handed in only a small quantity of arms, 'mostly outdated and unusable'.</p>

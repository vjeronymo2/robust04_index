			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China's securities  authorities today overruled a Shanghai share-holding company's  plan to turn part of the "A" shares it has issued to foreign  investors into "B" shares.    "No such transformation of shares will be permitted until a  relevant policy is worked out," said a spokesman of the China  Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC) at a press conference  here today.    Stocks issued by Chinese firms fall into two categories: A  shares for domestic investors and B shares for overseas  investors. The two kinds of shares are traded at different  markets and follow different trading rules.    The CSRC spokesman said that the board of "Dazhong" Taxi  Company obviously has little knowledge about state securities  policies.    He said that opening "A" shares to foreigners means both the  sell-out of state property rights and the merger of the two  kinds of shares, which is something "under serious consideration  of the authorities," and if so, requires amendment of the  current laws and regulations on stock market monitoring.    "A grassroots company has no right to make the decision  without state permission," the spokesman said.    He said that a tentative distribution plan for the 5.5  billion yuan worth of nationwide stocks to be issued for 1994  has been made.    Timing of the issuance will be flexible and will depend upon  the conditions of enterprises as well as the capacity of the  stock market to absorb the new stocks, he said.    According to the spokesman, it is very likely that part of  the stock issuance will be postponed until next year.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES FILE SUIT OVER SEARCH  OF HOME  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies charged in a Los Angeles federal  court suit filed Wednesday that investigators probing charges of money-skimming  of drug funds had illegally searched their home.  </P> <P> The civil rights action, brought by Deputies J.C. Miller and Elizzie Mary  Anderson, said that while deputies and federal agents had a warrant to conduct  a search on Oct. 3, 1989, there was insufficient probable cause to indicate  that Miller had done anything wrong.  </P> <P> Miller was suspended with pay during the probe but has never been charged. The  investigation has resulted in the indictment of 10 deputies. Anderson has not  been suspended.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, which names Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and several  investigators, seeks unspecified damages for alleged civil rights violations,  false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and emotional distress.  </P></p>

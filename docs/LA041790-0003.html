			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DWP TIMID? YOU'RE KIDDING  </P> <P> There is more than a little irony in the Los Angeles Department of Water and  Power's being criticized for timidity in seeking new sources of water. Ever  since the city grabbed the Owens River early in this century, Los Angeles has  been branded as a water pirate. Even today, the mere words Owens Valley trigger  outrage and fear.  </P> <P> The department was faulted in an audit that the City Charter requires every 10  years. The $1.2-million study by a consulting firm also said the department has  relied too much on its membership in the Metropolitan Water District of  Southern California for a backup source of supply.  </P> <P> Everyone knows the city's water supply has dwindled in recent years, while  demand has increased because of population growth. The department has at least  worked with the Environmental Defense Fund and the Mono Lake Committee to  replace water the city is losing in the Mono Basin for environmental reasons.  </P> <P> The criticism of DWP for failing to develop major new water supplies reveals an  ignorance of Southern California water development. In 1928, the city of Los  Angeles became the major organizer and underwriter of the Metropolitan Water  District for precisely that purpose -- initially to get water from the Colorado  River and later, from Northern California via the State Water Project.  </P> <P> MWD is short of water these days, too. So the city cannot draw unlimited water  from MWD without causing considerable anxiety among other MWD customers like  Orange County, and particularly San Diego County, which relies on Metropolitan  for the bulk of its supplies. But Los Angeles also has invested $540 million of  tax money in MWD since 1928 just so that it would have a fallback source of  supply in the event of a dilemma such as it faces today.  </P> <P> Answers to the region's water problems won't be found in ill-informed  finger-pointing. Southern California officials have long agreed that importing  additional water should be handled by a single agency, the MWD Water District.  Should the Los Angeles DWP go out now in search of a major new source of water,  the department would only find itself in competition with itself.  </P></p>

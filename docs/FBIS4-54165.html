			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, Liberal Democratic Party </F> member of the House of Representatives and former deputy primer  minister, by unidentified editorial staff member: "Objections  to Prime Minister Hata"; place and date not given]    [Text] [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When you expressed your intention  to leave the party, a serious situation seemed to be created  with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] being split vitally, and  the political world being reorganized, though, after all, such a  situation did not actually occur. Please tell me your frank  impression.    [Watanabe] It was because I was too optimistic in grasping  the situation that I failed to realize my intention while  creating the serious confusion within the LDP. I want to deeply  apologize for creating such a confusion while the time was not  ripe.    However, it was a most noteworthy tendency seen during the  recent confusion that there was a change of factional alignment  based on policy consensus. The contents of the policy consensus  originally reached between the coalition parties and me has  changed considerably. I feel I can be proud of myself for  separating from the coalition parties for that reason. The fact  that our alliance turned out to be a failure proved, expressed  reversely, that the policy consensus I proposed was regarded as  a basis of factional alignment. Therefore, I do not feel  ashamed at all. As I firmly believe, I am totally prepared to  accept public criticism. I am not feeling as serious as people  might expect.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] From an early stage, you have been using the  words "save-the-nation cabinet."    [Watanabe] I have been using the words for half a year.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In declaring that you were to save the  nation, you must have been seriously determined. Yet, the fact  that, after all, you remained in the LDP makes the general  public feel that your attitude is irresolute.    [Watanabe] I suppose people will feel that way. I cannot  help being criticized for my behavior. However, you cannot be  allied since the difference between our policies have been  revealed, can you? In dealing with the problem of security, the  coalition parties do not express their positive support, but  they are simply to maintain or to succeed the same attitude of  the preceding administration. It is also not clear whether or  not they are in favor of making emergency laws. At a midnight  news conference held 21 April, the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] chairman said that the party was opposed to making  emergency laws. It is also not clear how the party is going to  deal with the consumption tax. Besides, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], the key party, had accepted the policy, which is  different from ours.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In the first place, when did the move to be  allied with the so called "reformists" -- Shinseito and Komeito  -- emerge within the [LDP]?    [Watanabe] To explain the background, I have to trace back  to the time when the Hosokawa Cabinet was formed. When it  became necessary to choose whether the coalition government was  to include or exclude the LDP, Hosokawa and Sakigake [Harbinger]  members, being incited by the mass media, preferred to form a  government excluding the LDP. In addition, Shinseito also  strongly rejected the LDP. Then, though the reasons are not  clear, Shinseito and Komeito were about to be allied. As a  result, the Hosokawa administration was formed without any  policy agreement.    Seeing this process, I thought this government is fragile,  and felt that, unless a policy agreement is reached, it will be  inevitable that the government will collapse in the near future,  in less than a year.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] It did not last even one year. The Hosokawa  administration collapsed in eight months, did it not?    [Watanabe] I thought the government would last at least  until June or July. However, being unable to clear the  suspicions cast upon him, Hosokawa suddenly threw out the  government. I myself was surprised. His act is extremely  irresponsible.    Now, what is important for us is that, in forming a new  administration, we should not repeat the same stupidity. The  ship of state will not be able to move forward or backward  unless boarded, at least, by people of the same thought.    Why Watanabe Thinks the National Welfare Tax Is Reasonable    Then, suddenly, the suspicion about nuclear development by  North Korea surfaced. If North Korea refuses to accept UN  inspection to the last, sooner or later, it will become  inevitable for the United Nations to give economic pressure. In  a worst case scenario, it is possible that an economic blockade  may take place. When we try to see what Japan can do under such  a situation, we realize that, not having an established  emergency law system, Japan is totally unable to deal with such  a situation.    In short, it is my fundamental concept that, if a new  government is to be formed, it should consist of members of the  same opinion to be able to deal with various problems.    If I refer to Japan-U.S. relations, I believe that Japan  should support the Security Treaty. Some people say that, since  the Cold War is over, it will be enough to maintain or to  succeed the same policy as the preceding government in dealing  with the Security Treaty. However, when trade conflicts are  ceaselessly taking place between Japan and the United States, we  should realize that the only way for Japan to keep ties with the  United States is to support the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. By  all means, we should be positive in supporting the Security  Treaty to not have the important ties loosened.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When the Hosokawa administration proposed  introducing the national welfare tax, you were the only person  in the LDP to support the proposal, were you not?    [Watanabe] No, I did not necessarily give my consent to the  national welfare tax. I agreed to the idea that indirect taxes  should be increased to secure fund sources for welfare in the  future. In fact, I myself was surprised. Anybody would be  surprised if suddenly told that the consumption tax is to be  abolished and a 7 percent national welfare tax is to be  introduced. If I were him, I would have taken a more moderate  way. I will fully explain the reason. Since the social  security expenses are to largely increase toward future, we need  to secure fund sources to support the long-living society.  Then, I will tell the people that, if business conditions  recover, the consumption tax rate may be increased by, for  instance, 2 percent two years later. And, after that, taking  the changing situation into consideration, I will tell the  people that, maybe in five years, the tax rate will be increased  another 2 percent. Basically, I simply wanted to say that it  was acceptable to give more weight to indirect taxes and to  review the ratio between direct and indirect taxes.  <H5>  I Wanted To Act As a Go-Between </H5>   [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Anyway, some people within the coalition  parties agreed that your idea was acceptable, did they not?    [Watanabe] It is true that Shinseito, Komeito, and the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], etcetera, thought that my  opinion was agreeable. Of course, they made approaches to me.  I could not say such a thing if there were no approaches at  all. Though I cannot tell with whom I met and what we talked  about, it is true that I felt I could work with them. It is  also true that we discussed the possibility of forming a group  centering around my policy, as I mentioned before.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] A news report says that there was a secret  talk between Watanabe and Hosokawa on 23 February, and that you  met with Ichiro Ozawa twice at the beginning of April. The  report says that Prime Minister Hosakawa asked you to join the  cabinet, and that Ozawa asked your intention about assuming the  post of prime minister or deputy prime minister. What is the  truth?    [Watanabe] Well, since everything is over, I want to refrain  from commenting on the subject. Anyway, though I felt that I  could work with them, they had to save their own face. Since  they have been acting as a non-LDP group, their face does not  allow them to join the LDP.    However, if they are seriously concerned about the state and  the people, it is reasonable for them to ask for LDP assistance  even if the next prime minister is to be elected from among the  coalition parties. Even in case it is not possible to do so  because of the time limit, it is possible for the people who  maintain a sound conservative idea in a good sense and the  people who maintain a nonsocialistic idea to join together since  these people share the same idea with the majority of LDP  members.    Therefore, I thought I might be able to play the role of a  go- between. I wanted to become a bridge between the two groups  by forming a new political party by myself or with several other  members.    However, I gradually came to realize that there was strong  opposition to my idea within the SDPJ, and that certain members  of other parties were also against my idea. Under that  situation, I had, in the first place, to secure members to  support me to replace members who were against me. And, above  all, through the repeated discussions, I had come to realize  that we could not reach a policy agreement. Under such a  situation, it became meaningless to form a new political party.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] After all, it was the SDPJ's opposition  that became a bottleneck, was it not?    [Watanabe] If we take the Constitution problem alone, it is  true there are people of different opinions even within the LDP.  I never intended to say that something should be done about  Article 9 of the Constitution. It is all right to leave the  article as it is. However, I wonder if the existing Constitution  is totally flawless as it is. What I am saying is that we need  to study the Constitution a little further. For example, the  ownership of land and the right to use land are too strong,  making it impossible to construct an additional runway at Narita  Airport while 15 years have already passed. Not enough  consideration is being paid to public interests. Also, not  enough consideration is being paid to the claim on minimum legal  inheritance, and no provision is being incorporated about  environmental rights. In many aspects, the Constitution is  outdated.    Yet, the SDPJ's so-called absolute defenders group even  prohibits studying the Constitution, not to mention reviewing  it. I cannot work with such fellows.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] During the talks with Ozawa you referred to  before, naturally you talked about forming, if you can secure  the necessary numbers, a Watanabe administration excluding the  SDPJ, did you not?    [Watanabe] I leave my answer to your imagination. I should  not make practical comments calling people by name. Though I do  not think that anybody will believe me if I say there was no  communication at all....    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] A political commentator says that Mitchii [a  nickname for Michio] Watanabe was hypnotized and was made a  puppet by Ichiro Ozawa. He says Ozawa kept two cards -- Hata  and Watanabe -- and used them at his will.    [Watanabe] I suppose so. He tried to shake the SDPJ with  such tactics, and forced the party to accept their intention to  the extent possible. It is not strange at all if he had such an  intention. It is natural for him to use such a tactics as a  professional politician.    Yet, even if I was used as a card, I think I could  contribute  to the national interests if such a process could help the SDPJ  grow to be a sound political party capable of dealing with the  world situation. I think the SDPJ has also been brainwashed to  follow a way of thinking similar to ours.    That I was used as a card has its own value if the SDPJ  changes its policy emerging from being blinded by avarice.  Whatever the general public may say about me, I do not regret  it at all. Besides, I understand that the SDPJ's rightist group  is beginning to show their understanding about the problems of  security and making emergency laws.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Let me trace the recent situation. On 13  April, the news reports said all at once that it had been  decided that Tsutomu Hata would be the successor. However, the  situation has suddenly taken a new turn as the news was spread  on 14 April that Watanabe was leaving the party. Ozawa also  said at a news conference that the wheel was turning, and that  history keeps moving. It seems that, at this point, Ozawa was  also thinking of forming a Watanabe administration. Can you  explain where and how the scenario was changed?    [Watanabe] After all, as I said before, it was impossible  for me to be allied with the coalition parties while bearing the  LDP label. I suppose Shinseito and other parties were also of  the same opinion.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Under such a situation, there was a final  choice of you leaving the LDP and running for prime  ministership. In that case, you could have won a large number of  LDP votes.    [Watanabe] I suppose so. I was confident that there would  be more LDP votes than I expected supporting my nomination for  prime minister. However, there was no guarantee that all the  members who voted for me would join my group. Similarly, I  imagine Ozawa and other leaders will also be feeling anxious.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] You mean that to vote for you does not mean  joining your group, do you not?    [Watanabe] Yes, you are right. However, it is also possible  that a new situation can be created through the voting process.  After all, we are not sure whether it was a hen or an egg that  came first.    Repulsion Against the "Ichi-Ichi Line" [from  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary  General Yuichi Ichikawa]    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] The Hata Cabinet has been formed after much  commotion. In your own words, the coalition parties are going  to repeat the same stupidity, are they not?    [Watanabe] So long as the Hata administration is formed  including the SDPJ, the administration will face, sooner or  later, a difficult situation. The coalition parties will face  the difficulty because they are being connected simply because  they want to be in power. If they are seriously concerned about  policies, they may ally with us instead of the SDPJ.    Perhaps they are not to be awakened unless they experience  hardship once again. They will remain totally ignorant unless  they take bitter medicine again. It is unfortunate. It is a  very unfortunate thing for the people.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When the political situation is in a great  confusion, is it allowable that they "repeat the same stupidity"?    [Watanabe] I think Ozawa also shares the same recognition  that we are in a serious situation. That is the very reason why  some people of the coalition parties feel that they should have  been more broad-minded in forming the coalition.    It is true that, even within the coalition parties, there is  a furious repulsion against the "I-I lines" formed by Ichiro  Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa. Of course, there is also a serious  repulsion within the LDP. After all, it is their tactics that  are being opposed.    Perhaps, they will have the bill proposing the divisions of  the single-seat districts approved at the next Diet session.  After that, they will force unnecessary candidates not to run  for the Diet. They will threaten the candidates that the bill  has already passed; that they are to fight the LDP at the  single-seat districts on equal terms; and that, should the SDPJ,  the DSP, and Shinseito put up their own candidates, there is no  guarantee of winning the election if the LDP comes up with only  one candidate, etcetera. This way, they intend to crash [the  LDP].    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Formerly, you mentioned that Ozawa is too  sharp in expressing his likes and dislikes about people, and  that he is too hasty in doing things, did you not?    [Watanabe] I think he is also doing the same thing this  time. Therefore, as far as tactics are concerned, I do not think  I can agree with him. Though the difference may come from the  difference of age and character, I doubt he can keep his  influence for a long time if he always behaves like Nobunaga  [Nobunaga Oda, a dictatorial leader during the age of civil  wars].    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Nobunaga first comes out of the castle by  himself. Then, he orders his men to follow him.    [Watanabe] We have the saying that an appropriate time, an  advantageous position, and the people's harmony are important.  After all, things do not go well if we disregard the people's  harmony. Yet, even if the people's harmony is important, we  should not compromise with parties having different policies as  it means that we are being blinded by avarice.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Talking about the future situation, is it  possible that you may be allied with Shinseito again?    [Watanabe] I am willing to form a coalition. We intend to  work together toward a future with those people who share the  same philosophy with us.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] At this point, let me ask you a question.  There is criticism about your being allied with Komeito because  you have been severely criticizing Komeito.    [Watanabe] Komeito has also changed. As we see from what  they say, the party seems to have tacitly admitted the necessity  of [increasing) the consumption tax, it does not express any  objection about supporting the security structure, it admits the  necessity of cooperating with the United Nations, and the party  is even ready to review the Constitution.    Though some people say that the nature of the Soka Gakkai [a  religious group supporting Komeito] has also changed, it will  take a long time before the people admit it. First of all, it  is necessary for the Soka Gakkai to be recognized in the  religious world. The group should no longer pursue its  customary expansionism and exclusionism. The group that behaves  as if the Soka Gakkai was the only religion should correct its  attitude. Of course, it is not possible to correct its attitude  in a year or two.    At any rate, I think it is all right to be allied with  Komeito as far as our policies agree. To be allied means to  ignore details and to uphold principles. In short, it is an  expedient. They do have the word expedient in the sutras  (laughter). However, it would be a big problem to be merged  into one party.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] What is your opinion about the Hata  administration's future?    [Watanabe] After all, I think they have taken a temporary  measure -- an emergency evacuation. Even if I were asked to  form an administration within the existing framework of the  coalition parties, the only way for me would have been to form a  temporary administration. Any administration formed without an  agreement of fundamental policies reveals its fragility the  moment it faces various practical problems. Since the people of  different thoughts and beliefs are boarding the same vessel,  some will pull their oars toward the east, and others toward the  west. Regretfully, the administration will not last long.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Some people say the administration's life  may be less than two months.    [Watanabe] Though I am not sure if it will be two months, I  do not think it will last long. Throughout the world, there  have been few coalition cabinets that lasted very long. Through  such a severe test, politicians are gradually classified either  as rightists or leftists. Though, of course, it takes time.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In case political confusion is created in  the near future, do you think there is an opportunity for you to  go on stage?    [Watanabe] Though I am not sure if there is an opportunity  for me, at any rate, I want to have the groups of the same  political vision and of the same policies allied, and I want to  act as go- between. I also want to play the role of a mediator  to terminate the politics of hatred. When the time comes, I am  willing to openly discuss the matter with dignity.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When you were determined not to leave the  party and not to run for the prime ministership, you mentioned  that "I still do not have to be in a hurry." Is that your real  view?    [Watanabe] Yes, it is. There will be another opportunity.    [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Will the opportunity come in the very near  future?    [Watanabe] Yes, the opportunity will come in the very near  future. The political regime will change again and again. The  world is always full of vicissitudes.</p>

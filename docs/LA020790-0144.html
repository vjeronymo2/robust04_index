			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL  </P> <P> Short sales increase: Just three months after its "grand reopening" to  celebrate a $100-million renovation, Newport Center/Fashion Island is noisily  touting its 54% mall-wide sales increase during the 1989 fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Predictably, mall officials relate the quarterly increase -- representing total  sales of $77 million or $67 per square foot -- to the renovation.  </P> <P> But considering that Fashion Island added 70,000 square feet of retail space  for 60 new stores, the upswing isn't too surprising.  </P> <P> Dana Lazzarevich, a mall spokeswoman, said fourth-quarter sales totals without  the newly added stores were not available. Not counting the mall's anchor  tenants, including Bullock's Wilshire and Neiman-Marcus, mall sales in the  fourth quarter climbed 33.4% to $39.9 million from $29.9 million, she said.  Those numbers, however, also include the new retail footage.  </P> <P> Among Orange County's other malls, preliminary indications are that 1989  fourth-quarter sales showed modest gains.  </P> <P> Not including anchor tenants, here are the sales tallies reported by some of  Orange County's top-grossing malls for the last period, October-December, 1989:  Brea Mall was up 8%; Westminster Mall down 1.5%, and Buena Park Mall up 5.5%.

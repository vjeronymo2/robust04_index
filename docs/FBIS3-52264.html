			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 30 Dec (INA)--A responsible source at the  Oil Ministry has ridiculed statements and allegations by the  so-called oil minister in the Kuwaiti region, 'Ali Ahmad  al-Baghli, blaming Iraq for the current drop in the oil prices  because it has been sending signals of its imminent return to  the market.    In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the source said  that  these statements represent a desperate attempt to cover up the  large-scale conspiracy being carried out by the U.S.-led  colonialist forces through their agents in the region, including  the rulers imposed on the Kuwaiti region, to plunder oil wealth.    The source added that the current collapse in the world oil  market and the drop in oil prices to levels unprecedented for  years are due to the overproduction of oil by the Kuwaiti region  and Saudi Arabia, which are pumping more than 10 billion barrels  per day in order to flood the market, lower prices, and deprive  their peoples and those of the developing countries of their  only source of income.    He asserted that what is going on in the market is a  conspiracy being carried out by the rulers imposed on the  Kuwaiti region and Saudi Arabia at the orders of their American  masters to reduce oil prices and create obstacles to Iraq's  return to the market. He said that these rulers are increasing  their production of oil and dropping oil prices to delay Iraq's  resumption of its legitimate role in exporting oil.    The source said that Iraq's resumption of its natural right  to export its oil will only have a positive repercussions on  prices, and that the states which have shared Iraq's quota  should reduce their production to allow the absorption of the  quantities to be exported by Iraq.    Concluding, the Oil Ministry source said: The return of  Iraq, which believes in OPEC's principles and in the protection  of the interests of its member states, will have positive  repercussions that will serve its people's interests.</p>

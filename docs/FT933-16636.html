			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Biotech babies find haven in London: The birth of a stock market sector ENCOURAGED by a relaxation of stock exchange rules, the UK's emerging biotechnology industry is flocking to the London market. More than a decade after Genentech's float on Nasdaq launched one of America's raciest stock market sectors, the UK is on the verge of providing a home-grown source of capital for European scientists. British Bio-technology, which reported full-year results on Tuesday, was the first company to persuade the exchange to loosen listing requirements for its Pounds 150m flotation last June. By next week, when the diagnostics group Celsis starts trading, there will be eight UK-quoted biotech companies and 11 more pencilled in for flotation, mostly within the next year. By US standards the sector is hardly off the starting blocks - there are 225 US bioscience companies with a combined market capitalisation of Dollars 35bn (Pounds 23.3bn). But at least the UK has joined the race. The rush to float does not imply British science is suddenly ready to move from the laboratory to the market place with a string of ideas based on molecular biology and genetic research. Rather, research-based companies have discovered that flotation is now an option in the UK - even though many still look as though they belong in the venture capital nursery. Most of the newcomers are either still developing their product or have negligible sales. Many will require additional capital after flotation and will not record significant profits until the late 1990s. All are benefiting from the stock exchange's change of attitude. 'For many years it has not really been possible to obtain a (UK) listing for businesses of this type, where the value is in the technology and has not shown through in the sales or the profits,' says Ms Janice Anderson, director of Grosvenor Development Capital. 'So people have had to go to the US.' Notable among these forced exiles are Cantab Pharmaceutical and Ethical Holdings. Encouraged to prevent this trickle becoming a flood, the London Stock Exchange last year allowed British Bio-technology to float without the usual three-year record of trading profits. The window of opportunity in the UK coincides with the US bio-science sector losing some of its sparkle. Genentech has disappointed with its TPA 'clotbuster' heart attack drug; and Synergen's sepsis treatment has not lived up to earlier expectations, according to stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The tempering of enthusiasm in the US should strike a note of caution. Some new biodrugs that have passed successfully through clinical trials have worked no better than existing chemically synthesised versions. Even if investors choose to ignore this, the prospectuses should leave little doubt about the risks. A typical health warning appears in the listing particulars of Celsis, which wants to replace the laboratory agar plate with a kit for faster measurement of microbial contamination. Private investors, who can apply for shares until this morning, are told: 'There can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations.' The warning may not be as prominent as it would be in the US - where the face of the prospectus often boasts the warning like an 'X' rating on a movie - but at least it is there. To counter these sobering statements, the newcomers have to rely on the feel-good factor. Celsis, for example, carries 'validations' from organisations ranging from the Laboratory of the Government Chemist to such heavyweight companies as Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. The newcomers are also recruiting big names from the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, the non-executive chairman of Celsis is Mr John Precious, finance director of Wellcome; British Bio-technology picked up Mr Keith McCullagh as chief executive when GD Searle, the US drug maker, was bought by Monsanto; and Chiros, which will float next year, can boast the backing of Mr George Rathman, the founder of Amgen, widely recognised as the most successful biotechnology company yet formed. The holy grail for all the new drug companies, needless to say, is the discovery and development of a blockbuster - unofficially defined as having annual sales of more than Dollars 500m. Few drugs are likely to match Glaxo's Zantac ulcer treatment, which transformed the company's fortunes in the 1980s. But according to BZW, the bioscience sector's 'hit rate' is not as low as many believe. The 75 longest-established companies in the US have already brought 12 new bioscience drugs to market. The newcomers also point to the prices some large pharmaceutical companies have paid to get aboard the bioscience research train. A dramatic illustration of value came when Switzerland's Sandoz group paid Dollars 392m for a 60 per cent stake in Systemix, a Californian company researching gene therapy, only a year after it floated. Such anecdotes do not, however, make valuation any easier. With no profits forecasts, valuation remains a hugely imprecise science. 'You have to take a view on the science, the people and the prospects and this is the only way to get to the valuation,' says one pharmaceutical executive. With valuation so inexact, some analysts believe venture capitalists should still be supplying the development funds. Mr Chris Evans, a microbiologist and founder of Celsis and Chiros, which will float next year, vehemently disagrees. Raising venture capital is extremely time consuming, distracts management and is no way to fund the development of a global market, he says. But more fundamentally, he says, the supply of equity finance is there. 'Institutional investors have seen people make outrageous capital gains from loss-making companies,' he says. 'If the stock market is prepared to finance development, why give a large slice of the company to venture capitalists?' Relaxed listing rules will, inevitably, lead to riskier ventures being quoted. But the stock exchange is trying to close the door on the worst forms of abuse. Rules now in draft form propose that most of the capital raised on flotation should be used to fund drug or product development. Founding shareholders will also, usually, be prevented from selling shares for two years after flotation. Both these rules should prevent them walking away with the cash before the venture proves itself. It is early days. But the often maligned stock exchange has been widely applauded for relaxing rules that could sustain a new, albeit risky stock market sector.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              UK BIOSCIENCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- To be floated                                             Date  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cantab Pharmaceutical                                  1993/94 Celltech                                               1993/94 Scotia Holdings                                        1993/94 Chiros                                                    1994 Fermentech Medical                                        1994 Pharmaceutical Proteins                                1994/95 Shire Holdings                                         1994/95 Xenova                                                 1994/95 Oxford GlycoSystems                                       1995 Cortecs International                                     1995  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Market          Market Companies                                 capitalisation  capitalisation already             Date of    Proceeds    at flotation    at flotation floated            flotation  (Pounds m)    (Pounds m)    now (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ML Laboratories      Dec '87     2.0           16.0           291.5 Haemocell            Dec '88     2.1           10.6            33.1 Proteus             June '90     4.5           18.0           107.4 British Technology  June '92    30.0          151.8           133.8 Tepnel Diagonostics  Oct '92     5.5           27.5            50.4 Drew Scientific      May '93     7.3           25.2            31.9 Celsis Diagnostics  June '93    22.0           60.0            60.0 Anagen              June '93    15.0           46.5            42.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Stock Exchange and Datastream  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

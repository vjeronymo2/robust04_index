			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 1 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "I have no idea who  belongs to this opposition Supreme Soviet." This is how Viktor  Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, commented  on the statement by supporters of the deautonomization of the  Crimea, who call themselves the "Crimean Opposition Supreme  Soviet", which was broadcast Tuesday. He said there is nothing  new in such statements. "Some Ukrainian public organizations  have previously made demands for the dissolution of the Crimean  parliament and for the introduction of presidential rule."    "It is incomprehensible," Viktor Mezhak said, "why,  broadcasting this information, journalists were not interested  in who created this `opposition Supreme Soviet', who gave it the  power to come out with a statement in the name of the Crimeans?  I think this was done in order to whip up passions around the  Crimea just a bit more."    Stressing the desire of the Crimean people's elected  representatives to tackle all the problems around the  negotiating table with their counterparts from Kiev, Viktor  Mezhak said: "We expect the Ukrainian parliamentarians to  continue the dialogue on settling our relations. We are  counting that they will come to the Crimea this Friday."</p>

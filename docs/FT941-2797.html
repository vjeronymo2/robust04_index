			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Bundesbank holds fire The bundesbank's decision to leave its key lending rates unchanged caused little consternation on the European foreign exchanges but was nevertheless enough to trigger further falls in the dollar, write Emma Tucker and Graham Bowley. Few had expected the German central bank to lower its discount rate, but the market had been hoping for a symbolic cut in the Lombard rate. A fall in this rate - which forms the ceiling for German market rates - would have had little real significance, but would have been interpreted as a sign of the Bundesbank's commitment to further relaxation of monetary policy. The dollar moved as high as DM1.6920 ahead of the Bundesbank's announcement and in anticipation of such a cut, but slipped once it became clear that the Bank had not acted. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said: 'The markets were very frustrated by the Bundesbank's lack of action. The D-Mark immediately strengthened against the dollar and other European currencies.' Analysts are now strongly optimistic that the Bundesbank will ease rates at its next meeting on April 14. In the meantime, the authorities are expected to continue making gradual reductions in the securities repurchase rate. The repo rate is now 5.88 per cent, compared with 6 per cent at the beginning of the month. Mr Huw Roberts, assistant bond strategist at NatWest Capital Markets, believes one more cut in the repo rate will give the French room to reduce their intervention rate - currently at 6.10 per cent - next Thursday. The last change in the French key rate was on February 24, but the authorities cut by only 10 basis points, a move which failed to impress those looking for a more trenchant easing in monetary policy to spark economic activity. The Bundesbank's caution was not the only thing contributing to the dollar's jaded performance yesterday. A report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed lower activity and subdued price pressures. As a result, fears of tightening in US monetary policy receded further. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said: 'The Federal Reserve published a low activity number, but the price indices were the main market focus, and both the input and output price numbers were lower than expected. They left the US bond market stronger and the dollar more vulnerable as expectations of a rate cut receded.' Other news from the US went largely unnoticed by the markets. Initial jobless claims for the week ended March 12 came in at 342,000, in line with expectations. Mr John LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said the economy's vigour has picked up, but White House economic adviser Mr Robert Rubin said the Clinton administration does not see any signs of a resurgence of inflation. He predicted growth of 3.0 to 3.5 per cent and said long-term interest rates should remain in a range consistent with that growth. The dollar closed in London down more than a pfennig on the day at DM1.68. But it rallied to end New York trading at DM1.6883. The pound remained vulnerable yesterday, following the mixed bag of economic statistics published earlier this week. A survey by IDEA, the financial market consultants, asked foreign exchange dealers to forecast a range for sterling over the month ahead. The results included a low of DM2.46 and a high of DM2.57 with a mid-point range of DM2.5025 to DM2.5425. 'Sterling is still definitely in its sick bed,' commented Mr Chris Furness, senior currency analyst at IDEA, adding that technically the pound looked 'very bearish indeed'. It closed in London at DM2.5158, down from the previous day's DM2.5227. Mr Turner said: 'The markets are still feeling last month's (UK) base rate cut. They feel the government is taking risks with inflation and doubt its commitment to keeping it down.' There was relief on the UK money markets when most of a Pounds 2.45bn shortage was removed in the early round. This followed several particularly tight days. The overnight rate softened after the early round to 5 5/8 per cent, only to move back up to around 6 per cent over the lunchtime when the Bank did not carry out any midday operations. Later the Bank provided the market with around Pounds 400m in unspecified late help, bringing total assistance for the day to Pounds 2.45bn. The Canadian dollar was very weak, falling to a seven-year low against the US dollar. It later rallied when the Bank of Canada intervened and bought Canadian dollars. Mr Turner said that yesterday's very good inflation figure meant that underlying inflation was no more than 1.0 per cent. 'Short-term interest rates could go below US rates, but real bond yields are attractive and could boost the currency,' he added. The Canadian currency finished at CDollars 1.3678 per US dollar, compared with the previous day's close of CDollars 1.361.</p>

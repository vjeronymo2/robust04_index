			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE DOG DAYS AND NIGHTS OF SUMMER  </P> <P> The mongrels of Monday.  </P> <P> NBC, in pairing snubbed series pilots "Poochinski" and "Turner and Hooch,"  calls this a "Two Dog Night." But actually it's a three-dog night if you  include the new CBS summer series "Prime Time Pets."  </P> <P> And a four-dog July so far, if you throw in last week's airing of "The Jackie  Bison Show" on NBC.  </P> <P> Suffice to say that "Prime Time Pets" (debuting at 8:30 tonight on Channels 2  and 8, before returning later this week in its regular 8 p.m. Friday time slot)  is a generally harmless, if inanely scripted alter ego of some of the more  benign animal footage on ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos." An even  earlier ABC ancestor is "Those Amazing Animals" from 1980-81.  </P> <P> Yes, tonight it's the pool-shooting dog, the gas pump-guarding goose, the  dog-riding ducks, the soap opera-watching cockers, the kitten-nursing Doberman,  the Labrador retriever that tends a physically impaired boy and so on and so  on. Name your performing animal and you get it during this half hour, hosted by  Wil Shriner.  </P> <P> But what is this? Here comes the show's bubbly roving reporter Dorothy Lucey --  whose last major roving assignment for her regular employer, KCBS-TV Channel 2,  was her memorable sweeps series on sleaze -- informing us that "Dean and Bobbie  don't mind keeping their cats in the home." Are we talking about some beautiful  human beings or what?  </P> <P> And here are these great naturalists Dean and Bobbie with their cats -- an  adult lion and an adult tiger, caged off together in the living room. And isn't  that a cute little tiger cub romping on the rug? Living-room zoos are such fun.  </P> <P> Just how is it that these magnificent animals came to be squeezed together in a  small space inside a private home? Isn't there a law against this? Don't bother  me, boy, it's time to move on to the Ping-Pong-playing house cat.  </P> <P> And listen, if your hamster tap-dances, send in the video.  </P> <P> "The Jackie Bison Show," a pilot that didn't get picked up, was an animated  spoof of show business through the eyes of a talk-show host who just happened  to be a bison. Aren't they all?  </P> <P> His announcer was Larry J. Lizard, his girlfriend Jill St. Fawn, his humor  mostly of the cheap play-on-names variety, eclipsing the few genuinely funny  moments in a format paying homage to "The Jack Benny Show."  </P> <P> Jackie (the voice of Stan Freberg) was billed as "America's beast of  buffoonery." One of several on NBC, as it turns out.  </P> <P> NBC could provide neither "Turner and Hooch" nor "Poochinski" in time for  review. The former (8 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39) spins off from the Tom  Hanks theatrical movie of the same name. Turner is a fastidious cop, Hooch a  big old messy dog. Turner and Hooch work together.  </P> <P> In "Poochinski" (8:30 p.m.), a straight-arrow cop named McKay is jolted when  his late partner, that slob Poochinski, returns in the body of a talking  English bulldog seeking to find the man who murdered his human self. McKay and  Poochinski work together.  </P> <P> Actually, NBC could merge these two shows into a single spectacular titled  "Hoochinski."  </P> <P> It's not that TV isn't loaded with some very wise programs showing wild animals  in their natural habitats, only that the humans-as-animals theme, and vice  versa, has an even longer, hairier tradition.  </P> <P> Even though Gentle Ben the bear and super dogs Rin Tin Tin and Lassie didn't  talk as we do, they were invested with some of the highest of human traits,  such as incredible bravery and astonishing intelligence. Good old Lassie once  not only fell in love with a male collie, but was also consistently psychic,  always seeming to know exactly when it was time to leave the cozy house and go  pull little Timmy out of the river.  </P> <P> Mr. Ed the horse did talk like us, and sing like us, too.  </P> <P> However, the series that few who saw it will forget -- and NBC would like to --  is "Manimal," which lasted three months into the 1983 season, endearing a  minuscule segment of America to a man for all skins -- a suave, handsome  superhero criminologist able to transform himself into any animal the occasion  demanded. Give him time for a few contractions and some heavy breathing and he  could be a snarling panther, a hissing cobra or a silently observing hawk.  </P> <P> He never did catch Frisbees as a dog, however, disqualifying him for "Prime  Time Pets."  </P> <P> Still, he's missed. NBC should bring him back as "Manimalinski."  </P></p>

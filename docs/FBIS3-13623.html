			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political </F> Department, by Hamidah Na'na' in Tunis--date not given]    [Text] [Na'na'] Following the Hebron massacre, the PLO set  a host of conditions for the resumption of negotiations. What  are these conditions? Are they sufficient to reassure the  Palestinian people in the territories about their security and  restore their confidence in the possibility of attaining peace?    [Qaddumi] Following the Hebron al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  which was perpetrated by the Israeli settlers, it has become  essential that protection be provided for our people in the  occupied territories. The issue of settlements has become an  urgent topic that should be discussed today and not tomorrow,  that is, not at the end of the transitional period. Secure  areas in Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem, which are the  friction areas, should have been created. Israel should have  adopted firm measures to disarm the settlers. We wonder why the  Israeli Army, which is occupying the Palestinian territories, is  allowing those settlers to carry weapons if it is not for the  sake of attacking the Palestinians? It is quite possible to  disarm them. The Security Council should also issue a  resolution defining a mechanism according to which the citizens  can be protected against the settlers' attacks.    Israel should expedite its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho  first. Postponing withdrawal on the pretext of Israeli security  is a big lie. They should have withdrawn on the fixed date.  The international community, which condemned this ugly  massacre, should support the Palestinian people and protect our  people in the occupied territories. The [Madrid] conference  co-sponsors should pressure Israel into adopting the necessary  measures to protect the Palestinian people. The Security  Council is still discussing this issue. Regrettably, the United  States said there is no need for a Security Council resolution  and that an official statement by the Security Council president  would be sufficient. But this does not commit the concerned  parties nor does it serve as a Security Council resolution that  is binding on those adopting it.    [Na'na'] Do you think that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  has endangered the Oslo agreement?    [Qaddumi] Yes, this horrendous incident has caused many  problems and dealt an almost fatal blow to the Oslo agreement.  Israel, particularly Yitzhaq Rabin, is responsible for that.  Rabin did not abide by the agreement and tried to exhaust the  Palestinian negotiators and dictate his own terms and personal  interpretation of this agreement. This robbed the agreement of  popular Palestinian support. This was followed by the horrible  mosque crime, which drove nails in the coffin of the Oslo  agreement and the negotiations.    [Na'na'] How responsible is the United States for this?    [Qaddumi] The United States bears direct responsibility. It  should have taken prompt measures instead of claiming that it,  as a big power, is protecting human rights and instead of asking  China to respect these rights. Can't it pressure Israel, which  it considers more than a friend, into safeguarding human rights?  Events have proven that Washington erred when it sought to  scrap the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. It is now  clear to the world that we were right when we asked the United  Nations to issue this resolution. We will ask it to reevaluate  this resolution. Our people have been exposed to a Palestinian  "holocaust" by those who say they were slaughtered by Nazism.  The United States, which claims to be a big power responsible  for peace and security in our region and the world, should adopt  the necessary measures to put an end to these serious inhuman  practices.    [Na'na'] You have been in contact with the U.S.  Administration since the massacre. Dennis Ross is expected to  visit Tunis before this interview is published, and President  Clinton's advisers as well as U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher held several contacts with President 'Arafat.  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev also visited Tunis and  met with the Palestinian leaders. Has a new plan emerged from  these contacts?    [Qaddumi] I would like to point out the fact that the  current  U.S. State Department team--Dennis Ross, Martin Indyk, Aaron  Miller, Dan Kurtzer, and others--sympathize with Israel and are  trying to blackmail the Palestinian people. However, this time  they know that they are absolutely incapable of blackmailing us.  They should shoulder their international responsibilities and  we appeal to President Clinton to personally shoulder this  responsibility and impose peace in the region by adopting  practical measures that protect our people, impose respect for  human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, and  pressure Israel into withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho without  any delay. If Washington really wants to sponsor peace and act  as a fair arbiter in this process, that is the way they can help  restore momentum to the political settlement process.    [Na'na'] In a telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary  Christopher and the Palestinian president, the United States  threatened the Palestinian leadership. What was the response to  this threat?    [Qaddumi] It would take a long time to describe the methods  the United States is using to impose its conditions on us. At  the same time, however, we realize that the United States is a  superpower. This does not hold off the fact that we have clear  demands that we will not revoke no matter what pressure is  exerted on us because these demands are just. The United States  must put pressure on Israel and not on the PLO. Such pressure  will not serve the peace process because it reflects injustice  meted out against the Palestinian people who are in danger.    [Na'na'] Let us return to the Russian stand, Moscow's  initiatives, and visits by Russian envoys.    [Qaddumi] Russia is a friendly country. It is a cosponsor of  the peace process. We welcome the Russian friends' initiatives  just as we welcome the initiatives of other friendly European  countries. Turkey has contacted us. The Turkish foreign  minister and Turkish President Sulayman Demirel offered their  good offices to help end the crisis. It is not an issue of  wagers but an issue of pursuing successful means that maintain  our people's security and safety and that push the peace process  forward.    [Na'na'] Do you have an alternative to continuing the  negotiations now that the peace process reached this point?    [Qaddumi] There is a wrong notion that signing the Oslo  agreement means stopping the Palestinian struggle. This is not  true. As long as there is an Israeli soldier inside the  Palestinian territories, then the resistance must continue. If  the Israeli soldiers get out of our territories, then the  intifadah will no longer be justified as it is meant to stand  against the occupation and get rid of it. I noted this at the  Arab League after the signing of the agreement. I very clearly  stated that the intifadah will continue as long as there are  Israeli soldiers in our territories. According to international  laws and the UN charter, it is our right to resist in order to  end the occupation, oppression, and persecution.    We are now in a better position because Israel will be  politically besieged just as it was during Shamir's days. The  world, which condemned the Hebron massacre, realizes that Israel  is a racist country and a hotbed of tension in the region.  There must be an end to its defiance, which threatens security  and peace. We sensed this from statements by countries that are  considered Israel's friends.    Moreover, the Jewish communities in many countries have  announced their condemnation. The Zionist movement is afraid of  a return to anti-semitic currents. They are now feeling the  pressure because they made a mistake and they themselves have  condemned it, as evident in the condemnation issued by the  Zionist organization AIPAC [American-Israel Public Affairs  Committee] in the United States. It is an admission of the  perpetration of a crime against the Palestinian people, the  price of which they will have to pay.    [Na'na'] Israeli investigations proved the Army's  involvement in what took place inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.  Despite this, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin responded to the  massacre by allying himself with a right-wing party. What are  your conditions for returning to the negotiations?    [Qaddumi] There are different roles in Israel. Peres is  playing games in an intelligent way and Yitzhaq Rabin is  intelligently taking advantage of Peres' games. We well realize  that Israel's basic objective is to absorb the West Bank and the  Gaza Strip. This is because the West Bank offers Israel four  advantages. These are:    -- Space for more settlement building.    -- It forms natural borders with the river Jordan.    -- The Israelis consider the West Bank area and the  heritage it contains as historical and sacred. This is where  the differences over Jerusalem and holy places come in.    -- Subterranean water.    The Israelis feel that Gaza is a burden to them. However,  this does not mean that they will do away with it without having  a foothold in it. As for the settlements, the discussion of  which was delayed for two years, they say that the agreement  affirms the removal of these settlements as soon as possible  without having to discuss the issue for more than the first year  or the beginning of the second one. In the end, they wanted us  to coexist with these settlements. However, the deal was for us  to accept a full withdrawal from Gaza and the Jericho area,  defined by the British Mandate for Palestine in 1932, and to  postpone the discussion of thorny issues, which we may not be  able to solve in a short time. These include the issues of  refugees, Jerusalem, and settlements. However, through the  negotiations, they insisted on controlling security at crossing  points, continuing their presence in and the protection of  settlements and expanding them beyond limits. This really means  that they will not get out of Gaza and Jericho, they will not  implement the agreement, and they will not withdraw as scheduled  under the security pretext. This is as if Peres is claiming  that Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin does not agree on this and that there are  differences between them while, in fact, there are no  differences but a distribution of roles.    If Israel wants peace, it should fully withdraw from Gaza  and  the Jericho area that reaches 345 square km. However, we know  that they are playing with the time factor and seeking to take  advantage of it. Yitzhaq Rabin does not want peace. Through  the Army, he is trying to obstruct the negotiations and to open  the way for Peres to say: There are problems inside the  territories. The PLO must forgive us as we promised the Knesset  to keep the settlements and we cannot go back on this.    The fact is that we do not accept these claims. As I said  from the start, Israel will not implement the Oslo agreement. I  opposed the agreement out of this conviction. There has to be  an Arab deal because we alone, as Palestinians, cannot stand  against this ferocious racist onslaught.    [Na'na'] At present, the Palestinian scene is in turmoil.  Your people in the occupied territories are concerned and  insecure. As Palestinian leaders, can you contain these  feelings of concern and insecurity, and provide the necessary  solutions to pacify the people under occupation, who constantly  feel threatened?    [Qaddumi] The Palestinian people expect the PLO and the  Palestinian leadership to take a firm position this time,  because the event is too colossal to be brushed aside by any  leadership, regardless of the credibility it may enjoy or the  popular esteem it may command. Physical and practical measures  are required. I hope that the United States will understand  this fact and promote peace and the peace process. Israel must  pay a political price. We feel that enormous wrath is raging  within the souls of Palestinian people. The leadership must  reflect the sentiments of the people by making the necessary  decisions. We must understand the signals given to us by our  generous people. We must provide them with the necessary and  proper protection. The current international circumstances  provide a propitious opportunity for obtaining such protection.  We must not let this opportunity slip from our hands.    [Na'na'] The Soviets [as published] have proposed the  reconvening of the Madrid conference. However, talk of such a  development died down after the United States opposed this. Do  you believe that a reconvening of the Madrid conference could be  useful, in terms of promoting the peace process?    [Qaddumi] Before the reconvening of the Madrid conference,  or  the start of any form of negotiations for that matter, Israel  and the United Nations must institute physical measures on the  ground, tangible measures the effect of which can be felt by the  Palestinian people, to maintain the momentum of the peace  process. As for a reconvening of the Madrid conference, it is  an important proposal. The proposal is a fine one if it means a  meeting held by the big powers to explore the reasons for the  procrastination in the peace talks, the developments of the  peace process, and its failure to yield results after 22 months.  With regard to the current U.S. Administration, it is biased  toward Israel. Consequently, the peace process will continue to  stumble and falter. The world community must realize that  Israel is to blame for these setbacks and difficulties, because  it has failed to comply with the Declaration of Principles [DOP]  and withdraw [from Gaza Strip and Jericho], it has set new  conditions not enshrined in the basic agreement, and also  because of its practices, which capitalize on the Palestinians'  strong desire for peace. Exploiting this desire, Israel seeks  to force its own interpretation of the DOP.    Yes, a reconvening of the Madrid conference is a good idea,  because it would allow us to draw up new foundations for the  peace process. I believe that the current U.S. Administration  is not as well-versed in the Palestine question as was the  previous administration. President Bush was well-intentioned in  his quest for progress in the peace process. Hence, we could  use a new conference that should include, not just the United  States and Russia, but also France, Britain, and China; that is,  the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This  means the rehabilitation of the UN resolutions that call for the  convening of a UN-sponsored conference with effective  international participation and with the attendance of the PLO  in its capacity as the sole legitimate representative of the  Palestinian people on an equal footing with the other parties  concerned to promote the peace process on clear bases.    [Na'na'] There is strong opposition to the Palestinian  leadership, both inside and outside the occupied territories.  Several memorandums and petitions opposed to the leadership have  been signed. Some of these memorandums have reached the  attention of President 'Arafat. Do you not believe that the  current phase requires a convening of the Palestine National  Council, or of the PLO Central Council, at least? Given the  tragedy being experienced by the Palestinian people, is it not  proper to call for a national reconciliation conference to be  attended by all factions?    [Qaddumi] Not all the memorandums submitted to the  leadership expressed opposition. Some of these memorandums have  expressed criticisms of the results produced by the DOP. Other  memorandums demanded the enhancement of national unity, and  urged that the Palestinian house be put in order. Some  memorandums have urged expedited efforts to put the Palestinian  house in order, streamline action, and promote collective  leadership within the PLO, and shun single-handedness. Other  memorandums noted the unsatisfactory state of affairs plaguing  the PLO and inter-factional ties. All in all, we deem this  constructive criticism. We welcome this criticism and hope for  its continuation, because it promotes construction,  organization, and favorable action. For Palestine is not the  property of a single leader or faction. It is the property of  the whole Palestinian people, with all their factions and  leading figures. The policymaking regarding Palestine should  not be the monopoly of anybody. I, in my capacity as secretary  of the Fatah Central Committee, am saying this in public, to  make things clear. Yes, we do make mistakes. We have an  abundance of flaws. Who does not? People who work make  mistakes. However, we must learn from these mistakes, correct  them, listen to people's views, and share with them. Sharing is  indispensable. For we cannot reach an understanding with other  factions if they do not share with us, in terms of work,  decisionmaking, and execution. He who believes that he can make  the masses and factions do whatever he likes is mistaken.  Future developments will prove this. When ideas and approaches  conflict, this should not lead to division. I might oppose some  leading figures on many issues. But, it remains to be said that  we must be able to work together. They, enjoying a majority  vote, want to go through the experience offered them by the DOP.  That is fine with me. We must respect democracy and hold free  discussions, away from character assassination. We must not  muzzle people. At the same time, there should be no division in  our ranks. because division results in losing both ourselves and  the cause, as well.    Nonetheless, when a decision is made, everybody must  demonstrate discipline and act within the fold.    [Na'na'] Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  world has been in a state of imbalance. This adversely reflects  on our region and the Third World in general. Can the PLO  assume the burden of this crucial stage alone without Arab  coordination or Arab solidarity?    [Qaddumi] The absence of world conflicts and diverse  opinions, which lead to rivalry in sympathizing with and seeking  a solution to just fateful causes, has an extremely negative  impact on areas of crisis and tension. Nevertheless, we note  that special attention is given to the Middle East due to the  existence of many material and strategic interests there.  Western Europe considers our region its main market, in  addition to black Africa. The United States has its oil,  commercial, and strategic interests, too. But all this is not  being exploited properly by us. What do we note when we take a  look at the Arab situation? We find that division, weakness,  and lack of solidarity have persisted since the end of the Gulf  war. This has adversely reflected on the Palestine question.  Had the Maghreb Union not supported the Palestine question  before the Madrid conference, the settlement process would have  been conducted under more unjust conditions for our people.    The PLO has restored relations with Egypt and Syria and has  begun to enter the Gulf region. We believe we are on the right  track toward Arab reconciliation. This, however, is not easy  because the wounds are deep. But there should be a collective  Arab security based on Arab terms that are respected by all so  that both small and big states will feel safe from injustice.  We are now trying to coordinate with the Arab brothers in order  to hold a five-member conference in Cairo directly after 'Id  al-Fitr. It will be attended by the Jordanian, Syrian,  Egyptian, and Lebanese brothers with the aim of establishing  full coordination.    [Na'na'] Apart from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its  outcome, much is being said about economic talks between you and  Israel. Some even say economic coordination is taking place at  the expense of the future Palestinian relations with Jordan and  the Arab states. You visited Jordan and held talks on this  subject and you are undoubtedly aware of the outcome of  negotiations with Israel. What can you say in this regard?    [Qaddumi] We categorically rejected customs union with  Israel  in our economic talks because it means we will become an Israeli  province. They asked that the shekel be our official currency,  but we rejected that although we do not object to using it  equally with others at a certain stage because necessity knows  no laws and we need some time to disengage the Israeli and  Palestinian currencies. We told them: When we become  independent and sit with you as peers, and when you withdraw  your soldiers from our occupied territories, we can strike  international agreements with you. The initial stage will be  transitional and there will be no customs union or imposition of  the shekel as an official currency.    Israel is an occupation force that robbed the Palestinian  economy of its infrastructure so that it can be absorbed. This  is one of their political aims. It is not an issue of  cooperation. How can cooperation take place between a state  whose national income is 26-28 billion [not further identified]  while the national income of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is  only 2 million? The individual's annual income in Gaza is $740,  in the West Bank $1,470, and in Israel $12,500. Moreover, the  economic annexes stipulate cooperation in all these fields.  Actually, they aim at getting concessions from us in what  concerns them, especially in subterranean water, electricity,  energy, agriculture, and industry. Therefore, we say that the  first step is economic independence and cooperation comes later  when our economy builds a sound infrastructure. Consequently,  no agreements can be concluded now because they will not be  sound and will certainly be tilted in favor of Israel.    The Palestinian-Jordanian relations are brotherly relations  between two peoples sharing common interests. These relations  should be promoted in the next stage on the political and  economic levels, especially since we are witnessing constant  changes that require us to bolster these relations in practice  and not only in daily statements. Therefore, we struck two  agreements with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to serve this  fixed target and to enhance cohesion between our two peoples who  are linked with distinguished relations.</p>

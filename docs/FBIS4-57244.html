			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roger Suarez] </F>   [Text] Vice President Virgilio Godoy told LA PRENSA that he  does not think the threat of a suspension of U.S. aid to  Nicaragua will be realized because the Clinton administration  has already decided to support President Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro until her mandate ends.    Last Friday the U.S. Congress approved the Helms-Gonzalez  Amendment, which sets a 90-day deadline for countries that have  not returned properties confiscated from U.S. citizens. This  matter is a cause for great concern in Nicaragua as  approximately 1,400 U.S. citizens have filed complaints.    Dr. Godoy does not believe that the threat of a suspension  of  aid will break the government's economic adjustment program  "because the Clinton administration wants the Chamorro  administration to fulfill its mandate without difficulties."    Godoy based his opinion on the "the unchanging attitude of  U.S. Ambassador John Maisto" and the reaffirmation of that view  by Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of State for  inter-American affairs, during his visit to Nicaragua, two  things that translate into clear support for Chamorro.    He described the latest news from Washington on the possible  suspension as a "kind of blot or shadow."    "I believe this is merely an invitation to the government to  respond to the complaints filed by U.S. citizens at the Attorney  General's Office or with the government directly to either have  their properties returned or be compensated," he noted.    Godoy expressed skepticism about a law to end the ownership  problem "because one cannot simply say four years later that we  should turn over a new leaf.... This calls for a high degree of  understanding."    He added that the National Assembly may enact a law that  will  end the problem, "but it will do no good, since nobody will heed  it. Let us remember that according to international law and the  general principles of human rights, there is no statute of  limitations on property rights." LA PRENSA asked Godoy if there  is a solution to the ownership problem in Nicaragua. He replied:  "It should have been resolved a long time ago. There was a way  to do it, but the government or the presidency minister lacked  the political commitment to do so."    The vice president affirmed that during a reception hosted  by  the Venezuelan Embassy, he told Presidency Minister Antonio  Lacayo that "if they put the ownership problem in my hands, I  could resolve it in 90 days." Godoy told Sandinist leader Daniel  Ortega the same thing last year.    Godoy explained that there are different levels to the  ownership problem, "and the main ones are the easiest to solve,  but the remaining cases are very specific and must be settled by  the courts.    Presidency Minister Lacayo confirmed that he spoke with  Godoy  on 8 September at the Venezuelan Embassy about the stability the  country required and how it entailed a solution to this problem.    On 27 September, Godoy, Lacayo, and Sandinist leader Henry  Ruiz met at the Spanish Embassy. "When I heard Ruiz and Godoy  say that a solution to the ownership problem was feasible based  on consensus, I asked them to draft a proposal endorsed by the  Sandinist National Liberation Front and UNO [National Opposition  Union]. (Godoy and Ruiz) shook hands," Lacayo stated.    Godoy later abruptly left the meeting. "I am still waiting  for the proposal," Lacayo said.</p>

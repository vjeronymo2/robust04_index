			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Untangling Australia's wool problems - Industry that needs all the help it can get after a slump in prices NO SOONER had Sydney corralled the Olympic Games for the year 2000, than the cry went up: uniforms, for Australian athletes and officials, should be made from wool. Marketing nous, or desperation? Perhaps a bit of both - for two years after a guaranteed pricing system for wool came to an end in Australia, the industry needs all the help it can get. In April, the real price of wool at auction slumped to its lowest level this century, and although matters have improved slightly since then, the outlook is anything but rosy. In its latest quarterly report, for example, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics forecast that average prices during the 1993-94 selling season would be below those of the previous year. Out on the hillsides, the number of sheep shorn this year is expected to be 156m, a 12.2 per cent drop from last year. This is no small problem. In value terms, wool is still one of Australia's largest export categories, and Australian sheep account for 30 per cent of the world's total wool production. The highly-fragmented industry, moreover, comprises about 65,000 individual wool growers, who are hurting badly. Incomes have been squeezed, and stories of bank loan defaults are rife. The government responded to the near-crisis situation earlier this year, when it called in Professor Ross Garnaut, from Australian National University. In August, the Garnaut commission reported, and its recommendations were immediately taken on board in Canberra. As a result, legislation is passing through parliament, which - assuming no hiccups - will further reshape the tattered industry. The question is, will it really solve the sector's problems ? These are basically two-fold. On the one hand, there is weak demand from Japan and Western Europe, largely reflecting recessionary conditions. The European Community cut imports of Australian wool by a fifth in 1992-93; Japan, by 23 per cent. China, the largest market for Australian wool last year, is a more complicated case. Demand has been increasing sharply, but there are concerns that the nation's tighter economic policies - in response to overheating - will mean that it becomes volatile in the short-term. Chinese import duties and tariffs, meanwhile, are high, ranging up to 100 per cent. On this score, wool-growers saw some signs of progress a few weeks ago, when talks between trade officials indicated that China might be willing to negotiate a reduction in return for support in its application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The discussion generated no concrete promises, but was, in the words of one Canberra official, 'a good bonding session'. But the supply and demand situation has been compounded by the presence of the large wool stockpile - all 824,000 tonnes of it - and associated debt that built up under the guaranteed pricing system. As the Garnaut report noted, 'the stockpile is almost as large as Australia's expected 1993-94 wool production. . . Its presence and its sale inevitably exert downward pressure on pricing, while generating costs in terms of storage and debt servicing'. In reality, sales from the stockpile over the past two years by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (which was set up for this purpose) have been fairly modest - and at July 1993, the stockpile still stood at 693,000 tonnes by July 1993. Nevertheless, its very presence, and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of sales from it, has been sufficient to depress the already lacklustre pricing situation. Just as the industry's problems are multifarious, so were the Garnaut Commission's solutions. On the trade front, it was emphatic that wool, wool-related products, textiles and garments should be fully included within the current Uruguay round of Gatt talks and that efforts should be made facilitate exports, both to China and to Mexico, under the planned North American Free Trade Agreement. On an organisational front, it suggested that the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Research and Development Corporation be merged into one statutory authority. This would concentrate solely on marketing promotion and research, leaving matters like training to private industry. The Australian Wool Industry Council, another statutory authority, would cease to exist. But by far the most controversial element of the report - and the legislation passing through parliament - is a plan to privatise the AWRC, under the name of Wool International. The privatised body would have two objectives: firstly, it would develop a range of wool-based financial mechanisms, like futures contract; and secondly, it would administer a fixed schedule of sales from the stockpile, retaining a balance to support its financial instruments. None of this would happen overnight. At the outset, Wool International would be a government-owned organisation. Shares in it would then be issued to growers in direct proportion to stockpile levy payments between 1993-94 and 1996-97. However, by mid-1997, when the privatisation would be scheduled to take place, the amount of wool in the stockpile should have reduced to around 240,000 tonnes. That would be 'within the range of centralised stocks that a smoothly functioning futures market would be able to accommodate without disruption'. The advantage to this plan is that it tries to turn at least part of the stockpile into a useful plus. The downside is that Wool International must gear up for this new activity while administering the fixed schedule of sales, which some industry players suggest will further unsettle a market which struggling to match supply and demand. Some Australian wool-growers have also argued that if wool prices do not lift, the plan may not be viable - yet responsibility for the stockpile will have shifted to the industry, regardless. Not least of those unhappy with the proposed set-up is the Sydney Futures Exchange, which argues that a plausible futures market needs to be independent of both government and suppliers. 'It's a bit like asking Opec to run an oil contract,' comments the SFE. Not surprisingly, the SFE is attempting to revitalise its little-used, existing wool contracts, and has been circulating a discussion document among members. But the exchange admits that while management of the stockpile remains uncertain and no significant forward market exists in wool, a viable futures market is unlikely to develop. But once the fixed stockpile sales schedule is up and running, Wool International will be in business. 'It's a case of chicken and egg,' it says. The Garnaut report, by contrast, suggested that there would be clear advantages in having Wool International tackle the futures market. 'There are. . . weaknesses on the Exchange - the absence of a capacity to make the contracts deliverable, and some international doubts about trading in commodities outside the main world centres,' it concluded.</p>

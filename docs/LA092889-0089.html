			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> WATER BILL FOR EACH TENANT  </P> <P> Future apartment residents may have to pay their own water bills.  </P> <P> The City Council this week directed the city attorney to prepare an ordinance  that would require the installation of individual water meters for each unit in  new apartment buildings.  </P> <P> Apartment buildings are now monitored through one meter, and the owner, not the  tenants, are billed for the water. Some landlords have complained that tenants  who waste water cannot be identified. The proposal would make individual  tenants liable for costs, as well as legally responsible under a new city  ordinance prohibiting water waste.  </P> <P> Some council members question the costs involved in installing the additional  water lines, water heaters and gas and electric lines required for individual  metering. Councilman Ken Genser also asked that city staff try to determine the  additional amount of natural gas and electricity individual lines would  involve.  </P> <P> The draft ordinance and staff reports are expected in about a month.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Vietnam's state companies discover the bottom line: A sector that has been told to stand or fall on financial merit For ten years, Mr Le Trong tried to persuade other state-owned companies in Vietnam to pay him to advertise their products, but he got nowhere. The companies said their raw materials were supplied by one government department and the finished products were distributed by another. All they had to do was to meet their production targets and everyone was happy. Five years on, Mr Le Trong is much in demand. His swish central Hanoi office is besieged by directors of the same state companies and he can barely hire enough staff to deal with the extra work. The reason is simple: in the intervening years the Vietnamese government has introduced pro-market economic reforms and told state companies they have to survive or fail on their financial merit. State-owned companies that for years had proceeded in the innocent belief that they were pleasing their customers have awakened to the awful truth that nobody actually wants to buy what they make. Others with bloated workforces have had to choose either to sack their excess staff or face financial ruin. Mr Le Trong's company, Vinexad, is owned by the Ministry of Commerce and he now proudly boasts that it is the most successful state-owned advertising agency in Vietnam. One of his prospective clients is doing rather less well. For 40 years after it was set up in 1947, Tran Hung Dao Engineering played an integral part in Vietnam's struggle for independence and socialism. Now, the company is in danger of being thrown on the scrap heap. During the war for independence against the French and then the war against the US, Tran Hung Dao made military hardware and other supplies for the war effort. After the war ended in 1975, the company was converted to civilian use. Until 1990, Tran Hung Dao made 6,000 small engines a year for use in tractors, water pumps and other agricultural equipment. All were taken away from the factory for distribution, and the company assumed its products were popular. Last year, the company sold just 200 engines. Now more than half its 2,000 workers have been laid off. Tran Hung Dao is pinning its hopes on a joint venture with a South Korean company. 'At present, we are facing a shortage of work for the workers,' says deputy director Mr Vu Duy Lieu. 'We are suffering from many difficulties, such as a shortage of capital, obsolete equipment and old buildings. We also have to compete with large numbers of illegal imports from outside, which are better quality and cheaper than what we can produce.' The charge that illegal imports - mostly from China - are undermining state industry in Vietnam is heard regularly from those in charge of running the state system. However, foreign economists say the main problem these companies face is internal inefficiency, not outside competition. It is not all gloom, though. Thang Long Garment Company is one state enterprise that has not only survived but has thrived under the new system of financial independence. Throughout its 36-year history, the company has adapted well to the economic conditions of the time. In 1958, Thang Long was set up to export garments to the former socialist bloc countries in eastern Europe. When that market collapsed into political turmoil and the Comecon trading system was abolished, Thang Long had to find new markets fast. At the same time, the government in Hanoi withdrew much of its financial and planning support for state industry. Five years later, the company's output has risen 30-fold and it now exports 4m items a year to Japan, other Asian countries and western Europe. With the lifting of the US economic embargo, it hopes soon to add North America to this list. The secret of the company's success? First, it invested in new equipment and improved the quality of its products, rather than dropping its prices; and second, 'We try to conform to the saying 'The customers are the gods' and we are trying to meet as many of our customers' demands as possible,' says assistant general director Nguyen Van Do. This enthusiasm for customer service is an indication of just how far successful state companies have moved away from the command economy of the past. So far, most of the survivors have been light industrial companies, relying on cheap labour and high levels of output. Heavy industrial and engineering companies, which require expensive capital input, are generally doing much less well and will either face bankruptcy under new legislation or will require high levels of state support to survive. The continuing existence of a state sector may not be a bad thing, though, according to some western economists in Vietnam. 'There will be certain areas of the economy where public enterprises will certainly continue to exist,' says Mr Roy Morey, head of the United Nations Development Programme in Hanoi. 'Public utilities and those areas of the economy that are considered to be of strategic importance to the country - I would expect that these would continue to function.'</p>

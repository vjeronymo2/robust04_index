			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Bank looks at stripping of gilt issues THE Bank of England is considering changing its rules to allow gilt-edged specialists to create zero-coupon issues by separating the interest and principal repayment flows on government bonds. A move to permit what is known in the trade as bond-stripping would help fund the public sector deficit by offering investors new ways of holding government stock. City economists estimate the government will have to sell Pounds 1bn of gilts each week in the coming financial year. The practice of stripping the interest coupons from bonds is common in the US, and some European markets have embarked on a similar system. The Netherlands has recently decided to start stripping 30-year bonds, prompted by demand from investors such as insurance companies. The Bank approached Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) recently and asked whether it would be worth developing a gilt strip market. The Bank is thought to have discussed gilt-stripping with other investment banks, but said only that it 'continues to monitor every aspect of the market'. Bond dealers point out that the main obstacle at the moment to the development of a gilt strip market is the UK tax regime. CSFB said the main problems concern the taxation of zero-coupon bonds in the UK, and the scatter of gilt coupon payment dates throughout the year, but said these obstacles are not insurmountable.

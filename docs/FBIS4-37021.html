			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Bin-Nun: "In The Old Middle East"] </F>   [Text] There is nothing new in the Middle East. They say  that after Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir died, his successor Anwar  al-Sadat was riding the presidential limousine. When he arrived  at a junction in the center of Cairo, the driver asked: Where  should we turn here? Where did the late president use to turn?  al-Sadat asked. The driver said: Left, of course! (the  Nasirist socialism). Well, then, al-Sadat said, signal to the  left, but turn right.    Israel has become part of the Middle East thanks to the two  governments of the late Menahem Begin who signed the Camp David  agreements. Agreements that included an autonomy for the  Palestinians, an Israeli withdrawal, and a strong Palestinian  police force. At the time, everyone realized this was merely a  fig leaf for Egypt allowing it to sign a separate agreement with  Israel. Everyone also understood that Begin gave up on the  entire Sinai to save Judaea and Samaria.    With one hand, Ari'el Sharon promoted the construction of  strongholds in the Yamit Strip but, in a careless phone call,  gave Begin his approval for the full withdrawal from the entire  Sinai, and destroyed Yamit to the ground himself.    Even the faithful of Eretz Yisra'el were part of the Middle  East then. The struggle conducted over the rooftops of Yamit  was, in fact, not over Yamit. It was an attempt to deter  possible negotiations over the fate of Judaea and Samaria.    We can say today that the struggle fulfilled its purpose  perfectly. When asked how come there was no bitter struggle  over Jericho, we answer that this struggle was conducted in  Yamit, and the result of that struggle is the fact that in the  current agreement, signed by a leftist government, the  settlements remain in place and the Palestinians were forced to  agree.    Now the struggle over Judaea and Samaria, and Jerusalem  begins; or to be more precise: the struggle over Judaea and  Samaria for Jerusalem, and over Jerusalem as the heart of Judaea  and Samaria. The whole truth is not always said in the Middle  East.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is now leading us to new  levels in the Middle East. Last week he explained that he  denied the letter on Jerusalem because: A. it was not released  in Cairo; B. it was not sent to 'Arafat; C. it was not  considered a commitment in the negotiations.    Here, Peres picked a noble example. If someone asked  Ben-Gurion whether he met someone at 5 o'clock when the meeting  was at 6, he would simply say no. No one asked him about a 6  o'clock meeting, therefore he did not answer. Peres calls this  "an absolute truth."    True, the open agreements contain clauses far graver than  this letter, and its exposure allows us to, perhaps, close some  of the loopholes regarding Jerusalem. But, what about the norms  of "our ministers'" conduct?    Now I understand what the foreign minister meant when he  said  that the PLO has not been involved in terror acts since the Oslo  agreement was signed. He made the remark when objective sources  reported that 35 acts of terror were perpetrated by Fatah groups  between the signing of the Oslo agreement and the Cairo  agreement. Peres was simply referring to PLO-Tunis diplomats who  were busy with the negotiations.    The time has come to examine Peres' economic vision for the  Middle East. Naturally, he was not misleading us when he spoke  of flourishing growth if the agreements succeed. He used the  "absolute truth" method. The Palestinians will flourish and  experience growth, Israel is supposed to shrink.    When Peres stood on the Knesset podium and spoke about the  Israeli agriculture, about making the desserts blossom and  glorifying Zionism, he knew he was delivering an eulogy. He  knew that Palestinian farming is about to inherit Israeli  farming; that every Palestinian well drilled in the Janin area  will dry up a Zionist well in the Yizre'el Valley; that there is  not enough water for two farming systems that make the desert  flourish. He also knew that the prices of the Palestinian  produce will eliminate the Israeli agriculture.    How do I know that he knew? Because, shortly after the Oslo  agreement was signed, I obtained the forecasts of "Israel Toward  the Year 2025," prepared by professional teams associated with  the foreign minister.    They clearly forecasted that Israeli agriculture, along with  other economic branches that require plenty of manual labor,  will collapse. They forecast that Israel will be crowded, with  people living in high-rises, and that housing prices will soar  seriously. They realized that the growth we have been  experiencing since the Six-Days War will be replaced by a  Palestinian growth.    They also knew that the only chance the Israeli economy has  to flourish depends on the level of our incorporation in "joint  projects" with the Palestinians. This is precisely why  Abu-Hulala [name as published], in charge of Palestinian  development, has announced that Israeli entrepreneurs will not  be incorporated in any of the projects.    Palestinians flourishing at our expense may not be critical,  but this will not convince the Tel Aviv stock exchange. There,  they have begun to understand this is the "absolute truth."    Does this have to happen? No! Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  can still come to his senses and retaliate for the dozens of  Palestinian violations of the agreements: A. He can send the  Palestinian national institutions to Jericho, with all due  respect. B. He can renew construction, if only in the Israeli  settlement strip in the western Samaria and Binyamin Districts,  where there is a clear Jewish majority even today.    In doing so, Rabin will be securing Israeli control over the  mountain aquifer, the Dan District water reservoir. He will  prevent the elimination of the Israeli agriculture in the Sharon  region, and will ease the pressure and distress in housing  construction.    By resuming construction work in the greater Dan District,  we  could signal a direction for Israel to thrive, before any  Palestinian growth. The Palestinians will gain, but not at our  expense.    It does not matter whether this is the third or the fourth  path. It is certain that the people will back it, no matter who  leads it.</p>

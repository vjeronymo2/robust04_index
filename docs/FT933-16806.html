			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Treasury boosts help for business THE TREASURY has set up a unit to co-ordinate policies to help industry in a fresh sign that it is attempting a cultural change to make it more sympathetic to wealth-creation, Peter Marsh writes. The new unit will have a roving commission to explore ways that Treasury policies could improve industrial competitiveness. The change is designed to meet criticism from industry that the Treasury puts too many resources into controlling public spending and not enough into understanding business. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'This change is exactly what the Treasury needs.' Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said it was 'a step in the right direction'. Credit insurance premiums on exports to Argentina and Lebanon are to be cut from today by NCM, the leading credit insurer in the UK. Premiums for Argentina are being cut from 6 per cent to 3.5 per cent and for the Lebanon from 6.33 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</p>

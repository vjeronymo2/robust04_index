			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Designed to run on air - Worth Watching Runners can now buy high-technology running shoes which borrow as much from the car industry as they do the world of sport. Adidas's tubular technology enables runners to customise their shoes by blowing up parts of the soles in a similar way to blowing up a car tyre. The Tubular shoes contain two chambers of air-filled rubber in the outer sole - the part of the sole which comes in contact with the ground. By blowing up the two chambers the runner can adjust the cushioning and stability. The shoes, on sale next week in France, Germany, the UK and US, come with a digital pump and guidance on the appropriate pressure. Adidas: UK, 061 419 2500.</p>

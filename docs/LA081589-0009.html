			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALLS FOR DRUG BOOT CAMPS SOUND A ONE-NOTE THEME  </P> <P> An emerging tool for throttling the small-time crack dealer is a rigorous 90  days in a good old-fashioned "boot camp." With drug czar William Bennett in the  lead, enthusiasts forecast great benefits from these military-style facilities  that are cropping up across the country.  </P> <P> Boot camps, we are told, give young culprits a strong measure of discipline  along with the lesson that we are not going to tolerate their activities. A  dose of shaved heads, push-ups and enforced obedience will deter inmates from  even thinking about peddling drugs again. They will be shaped up and shipped  out to join the mainstream of good citizens, sometimes even with new job  skills. Moreover, boot camps are fast-turnaround programs in which large  numbers of offenders can be quickly run through the system at a much lower cost  than in conventional prisons.  </P> <P> If all this were true, boot camps would signal the rebirth of incarceration as  a rehabilitative tool. For 15 years we have heard that rehabilitation in prison  was a failed idea and that the explosion in the prison population took place  simply to get criminals off the streets and deter potential offenders. But boot  camp is supposed to be different. It's a sort of car wash for criminals -- in  one quick drive-through, the offender is cleansed of errant leanings and  redirected toward a productive life.  </P> <P> Another crime-fighting fad caught our attention a few years ago. Every prison  warden was pushed to replicate a program called Scared Straight. Youngsters  from school classes would file into the depths of prisons to be verbally  assaulted by a group of tough-looking, hardened cons. In the rawest of terms,  kids were told to keep their lives in order or they, too, would end up in the  mess they saw before them. The program was to be the magic potion that would  stem our growing delinquency problem. But after a short flurry, it disappeared  with hardly a trace. The cure for delinquency is too complicated to be scared  into existence.  </P> <P> The boot camp fad also will pass when it becomes clear that it does little to  thin the ranks of drug peddlers. With its veneer removed, the boot camp is just  another version of the one-note theme that has been sounded for the past decade  as the solution to crime -- a pure, simple-minded and unsuccessful program of  more and more incarceration. However, rather than disappear like Scared  Straight, the boot camp facilities will be added to this country's growing  roster of prisons in which more people will do more time.  </P> <P> The real answer to America's intolerable crime and crack problem is to be found  by noticing who is in our prisons -- inmates drawn almost exclusively from the  ranks of the poor, black and Latino. Doing something about the conditions that  generate this lopsided situation is complicated, but at its most basic level it  means changing the environments in which the young see graffiti before they see  beauty, hear gunshots before symphonies and feel despair before hope.  </P> <P> That's a tough order, but we can start by being honest about what does not  work. Threatening drug sellers with penalties from boot camps to electric  chairs is to fail to recognize the feebleness of deterrence in the criminal  justice system. So long as drug dealing can put poor kids in BMWs, the  humiliating shout of a drill sergeant is short-lived noise. Aggressive  competitors in the drug trade are far more life-threatening than the specter of  an electric chair. And the last thing the young drug dealer needs to learn from  a boot camp encounter is how to be a bigger, better and more macho drug  merchant.  </P></p>

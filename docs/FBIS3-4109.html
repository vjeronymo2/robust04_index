			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Min-kuang (1728 2404 0342): "Deng </F> Xiaoping Issues New Instructions on Work in 1994"]    [Text] In 1993, China's GDP reached 3,138 billion yuan and  GNP exceeded 1,000 billion yuan, an increase of 13.4 percent  over 1992 and the biggest increase in the world. China hopes to  see a 9 to 10 percent economic growth rate in 1994 and an  inflation rate of less than 10 percent. Can these targets be  reached? How does the political and economic development look  like in China this year? Various sides have expressed great  interest.    This will be a year of great reform in China. Will the  reform bring risks and problems? Judged from China's actual  conditions at this time, the risks will not come from the reform  itself but from the following several aspects:    1. The scale of fixed assets investment is too large; last  year it reached 1182.9 billion yuan, a 50 percent increase over  1992. This trend is still strong this year and passing the point  of what the country can bear. If it is not brought under  effective control the consequences will be huge.    2. The agricultural problem is still pronounced, and  although last year's farm products harvest was a record and the  increased value of agriculture for the whole year was 665  billion yuan, the overall future situation does not allow for  optimism.    3. Some localities have differing opinions from the leading  departments: "When the upper level has a measure, the lower  level has a countermeasure," actions are not coordinated, and a  "local lord economy" has emerged.    Quite a number of officials, enterprises, and commercial and  trading departments compare speed, talk about layout, and opt  for high consumption, paying no attention to efficiency, cost  cutting, and stopping losses. They are not interested in  strengthening management nor have they adequate concern for the  people's sufferings.    4. The anticorruption drive and reform of the public service  system are also problems. Just as Jiang Zemin said, the  anticorruption drive must be a persistent battle and must be  supported by the system, whereas when reforms of several systems  are carried out simultaneously, the conflicts become more  pronounced.  <H3>  Deng Xiaoping Supports Jiang Zemin in Personally Formulating  the 1994 Reform Plan </H3>   However, Zhu Rongji said: Reform certainly is risky but not  carrying out reform carries an even bigger risk. Deng Xiaoping  expressed great support when Jiang Zemin personally formulated  the 1994 reform plan, and Deng said: "Do not be afraid to take  risks, be bolder. If one fears the wolves in front and the  tigers behind, then one cannot walk."  <H5>  Reform Is Risky But Not Carrying Out Reform Is More Risky </H5>   At present, some localities are indeed very rich, while the  central authorities have experienced a serious revenue drain and  the state has not been able to settle the deficit for many  years. If changes are not made, then things will be more  difficult.    In the past two years, China's foreign trade deficit has  rapidly soared while its exports have decreased. In January  this year, imports surpassed exports by $900 million; according  to a calculation based on this figure, the unfavorable trade  balance will reach $10.8 billion for the whole year. Because  the unfavorable trade balance will continuously expand every  year, the state will have less income from foreign exchange,  capital will drain, and if China does not seriously carry out  reform of the foreign exchange system, things cannot go on like  this.    Over the past many years, in the tradition of the planned  economy, the "symptom of being thirsty for investment," which  was characterized by mutual comparison and ceaseless expansion  of the investment scale, was banned by repeated orders but it  was not cured for a long time. It became even more prominent  and rampant when more efforts were made to tackle it, to the  extent that output was superficially large, the investment scale  was even larger, but most projects had poor returns, low  quality, many loopholes, and shortages of funds. This  phenomenon was particularly prominent in local provinces,  cities, counties, towns, and enterprise development zones. If  control is still not realized in the areas of finance and the  financial system, it will disrupt China's economic development.  <H5>  Deng Says: Make Some Adjustments When Problems Are Found </H5>   For this reason, Deng Xiaoping demanded they "be bold and  careful, promptly sum up experiences, make some adjustments when  problems are found to enable things to accord with reality."    Responding to the situation, Deng Xiaoping also pointed out  recently that: "To make the reform a success, it has to be  carried out in an orderly manner and with guidance; without this  condition, things become chaotic and people go their own ways.  Thus, how can things be done?"    Deng also said: "The CPC Central Committee and the State  Council should have authority; without authority they cannot  control the situation."   <H3>    Deng Xiaoping Says: "Macromanagement Must Be Embodied  in the Central Leadership's Ability To Keep Promises" </H3>   At the same time as China pursues a market economy, it must  continue to carry out macroregulation and control; according to  an estimate by the senior level in China, macroregulation and  control must be continuously carried out for 10 or 20 years.  Deng Xiaoping said that the most crucial thing is that  "macromanagement must be embodied in the central leadership's  ability to keep promises."  Where Does Enterprise Reform Go From Here?    This year, China will implement the "10,000, 1,000, 100, and  10" "mechanism-changing and system-building" plan. This means:  Granting 14 kinds of decisionmaking power to 13,000 state-owned  large and medium enterprises to enable them to really change  their operational mechanisms and accomplish the work of sorting  out assets and auditing capital; send supervisory committees to  1,000 key and backbone enterprises which have a bearing on the  national economy and the people's livelihood, to supervise  state-owned assets batch by batch; select 100 state-owned large  and medium enterprises to try out a modern enterprise system;  and choose 10 cities to carry out a pilot program to reduce  unreasonable burdens in enterprises and increase their  self-owned circulation funds.    Li Peng said that at present the first thing to do is to  organize 100 state-owned large and medium enterprises to try  things out. The reform of state-owned enterprises is to, first,  make it conducive to enhancing vitality among state-owned  enterprises; second, to enable state-owned enterprises to  preserve their value and increase output value; and third, to  make it conducive to maintaining social stability.    In order to promote technological progress among  enterprises,  this year, China will allocate 250 billion yuan for investment  in technological transformation, to mainly support 100 capable  and large enterprise groups to establish technology centers; and  to organize 100 important state technological development and  industrial experimental projects, 100 key locations for  promoting and demonstrating new technology, and 10 high-tech  industrial projects "combining production, study, and research."  The State Council will also abolish its "Important Technology  and Equipment Leadership Group," handing its business to the  State Economic Commission.    In future, state-owned enterprises will become independent  "tax payers" who have rights over property as a legal person and  who make own decisions on operation and take sole responsibility  for gains and losses, while the state, as a capital contributor,  will only enjoy ownership rights proportional to the funds it  contributes to the enterprises and will shoulder limited  liabilities. The unitary ownership system among state-owned  enterprises will be changed and, except for some state-owned  enterprises, other state-owned enterprises will be allowed to  absorb nonstate-owned funds as shares, whereas the enterprises  solely funded by the state or with an absolute majority of  shares held by the state are considered state-owned enterprises.  The market law of survival of the fittest will be implemented.  Enterprises which make losses over a long period of time and  which have capital smaller than their debts must be declared  bankrupt according to law.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cuban Government does not see any speedy chance  of improving relations with the United States. Isabel Allende,  acting foreign minister of Cuba, says there has been no progress  in relations, even during President Clinton's era. Allende is  critical of the United States for politicizing Cuban  immigration, saying that Cuba has launched a program seeking to  expand Cuba's foreign political relations. Antti Halinen met  the acting Cuban foreign minister in Havana.    [Halinen] No progress can be seen in the relations between  the United States and Cuba, says acting Foreign Minister Isabel  Allende very curtly. We waited to see what the Clinton  administration would do, but reality remains precisely the same,  only the political form is slightly softer, Allende says. She  refers to Clinton's recent meeting with some Cubans of Miami at  which the president promised to continue the trade and economic  embargo against Cuba. Progress has not been made in other  sectors either, even though Cuba has announced that it is  prepared to normalize its relations with the United States. But  if one wants to normalize relations, one cannot, of course,  maintain a trade embargo, Allende points out.    Allende accuses the United States of manipulating and  politicizing Cuba's emigrant and refugee affairs, which has not  happened to any other Latin American country. On the basis of  the treaty of 1984, the United States could grant as many as  20,000 visas to Cubans a year. According to Allende, just over  1,000 Cubans were granted a visa last year. Allende says the  United States is using the matter to its political advantage.  Visa applications are rejected, but at the same time the  country receives all those who have left Cuba illegally. The  Haitians' boats are turned back, but Cuban ferry people are  granted a residence permit immediately. In Allende's view, much  is spoken and written about these Cubans in Europe too, unlike  for instance the Mexicans, the so-called wet backs, who seek to  enter the United States illegally. The name wet back comes from  the fact that when crossing the border river, the Mexicans get  wet.    According to acting Foreign Minister Allende, the Cuban  Government is prepared to improve relations between Cubans, but  it presupposes one thing from its interlocutors: Opposition to  the U.S. anti-Cuban policy and recognition of Cuba's  sovereignty. At a recent meeting in Havana, some tangible  results were achieved but it is still difficult to get close,  Allende admits.    She cites an example. A Cuban lawyer, who attended the  meeting, a U.S. citizen and member of the Democratic Party, at  the final meeting thanked Fidel Castro for the conference and  kissed him on the cheek. Back home in Miami, abuse and murder  threats awaited the lawyer and her children, and the lawyer's  car was smashed to pieces.    [Announcer] The acting Cuban Foreign Minister Isabel Allende  is not the famous Chilean writer, nor is she the daughter of the  former president of Chile, with whom she is often confused on  account of her name.</p>

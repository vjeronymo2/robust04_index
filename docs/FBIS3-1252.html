Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha,  in a statement on behalf of the government and the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC], said the appointments followed a  request on Tuesday by Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo for an  interim administration to take over the running of the territory.    The government had taken into account that Brig Gqozo's  government no longer exercised effective governmental control in  Ciskei. The government and the management committee of the  Executive Council appealed to all sectors of Ciskei society to  lend their full support to the joint administrators, refrain  from violence, return to their daily functions and tasks, and  accept that all state employees would retain their pensions,  salaries and positions.</p>

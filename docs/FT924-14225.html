			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Old pals - Radio RADIO 1 and Radio 2 have both been celebrating their 25th birthdays; but radio anniversaries are not really worth celebrating, for they depend less on intrinsic merit than on the judgment of the higher-ups. Radio 1 got three spreads in the Radio Times and half-an-hour on BBC1. Radio 2 got nothing like that, although Jimmy Young had a half-hour interview with David Frost (on Radio 2). Radio 2 is for the fairly uncritical lower middlebrow listener. True, music tracks from the 1960s and later brought complaints, but not enough to ditch them. The Jamesons, even Jimmy Young, may say controversial things now and then, but they have their slots because they are everybody's friends, no more contentious than the man on the Clapham omnibus. If I seldom write about Radio 2 here, it is because those of its programmes that I hear are deliberately uncontroversial. I doubt if Radio 2 will celebrate a 50th anniversary. But I bet Radio 1 will. Radio 3's play on Sunday was a winner, Fernando de Rojas's tragi-comedy La Celestina, translated and adapted by John Clifford, who puts more fun into 16th century Spanish drama than anyone. Calisto (Jonathan Cullen) falls madly for cautious Melibea (Abigail McKern) and has to ask help from the local procuress, La Celestina, played with bewitching naughtiness by Frances de la Tour. The dialogue, in current English, is hilarious and bawdy. Most of the principals finally die, as in Hamlet. Calisto falls down a cliff making a covert exit from Melibea's home, and she kills herself in distress. Calisto's tricky servants Sempronio and Parmeno (nice playing by Jonathan Tafler and Matthew Morgan) murder Celestina for the wealth Calisto has paid for her help, and are duly executed. Only the women servants and Melibea's father, who has just one line, survive. The vigorously comic direction was by Eoin O'Callaghan. You Know It Makes Sense is a Radio 4 series on Wednesday mornings about the five senses. Radio 2 did them in August, but less seriously. The Radio 4 lot, presented by Geoff Watts, explains how they work - the connection between eyes and brain, the perception of colour. Watts mentioned various ways in which vision is put to the test, through cameras, against modern painting and so on. Next week, touch. Taste we have had, often enough, although in other circumstances. Talking of taste, on Tuesdays on Radio 4, Miles Kington is giving a world survey of humour, It's a Funny Old World. The snag is that one only laughs at foreign people's jokes if they are funny by our standards. Last week, we met the Nigerians, who often have the useful advantage of knowing English. Nigerian joke electricity comes from the NEPA, or National Electric Power Authority, so Nigerians say NEPA stands for Never Expect Power at All. This week we were in India, where, as in Nigeria they laugh at people from other regions. Funniest are Sikhs - Sikh jokes are the equivalent of Irish jokes in England. Indian cartoons illustrate politics. Indian cartoon: the goalkeeper in an Indian football team has to accommodate all his family in the goal. Kington is very sympathetic, and is not tempted to make jokes of his own. Next week we go to China, but this is strictly Indian week, for in the slot where we had the Bible readings, we now have readings from the Bhagavad Gita. I have heard three days' worth, and very interesting too, but so different from religious writing in Britain that I dare not offer any critical comment without first learning a lot more. Shall we later come to the Koran?</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Mountleigh The revolving door continues to spin at Mountleigh, a property company in rather more urgent need of revolving credit. Mr Steven Gerard, the new chief executive, is not a bank appointee. But as a former senior executive at Citibank, one of Mountleigh's main lenders, he looks suspiciously like the next best thing. Somewhat unnervingly for investors, Mr Gerard felt compelled to mark his appointment yesterday by promising a strategically focused operating and financial plan 'which will be satisfactory to all creditors'. He also undertook to maximise value for shareholders. In this regard, he could begin by updating them on progress made so far in completing the Pounds 125m sale of the Merry Hill shopping centre, first announced in January. No news is not necessarily good news.</p>

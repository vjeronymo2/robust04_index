			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Jordan set to quit as AEEU president Mr Bill Jordan is likely to stand down as president of the AEEU engineering union to take over as general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the biggest international union organisation with 174 affiliates in 124 countries. Mr Jordan, 58, is not certain to get the job, but with backing from the US, Germany and Japan, he is the favourite. His main rival will be Mr Luis Anderson from Panama, head of the confederation's Latin American region, who will have substantial backing in the developing world. If Mr Jordan does move to Brussels to run the confederation the way could be open for Mr Jimmy Airlie, a former leader of the left in the engineering section of the union, to take over as president. However, there will also be strong pressure not to replace Mr Jordan. Since the engineering and electricians' unions merged to form the AEEU it has had an executive of more than 20 people plus two presidents and two general secretaries. For financial and political reasons the dominant group on the AEEU executive may prefer to allow Mr Ken Jackson, current president of the electricians' section, to become president of the whole union. Mr Jordan, a powerful spokesman for rightwing craft trade unionism and a lobbyist for the manufacturing industry, is regarded as one of the most able of the older generation of British trade union leaders. He said yesterday that taking over the confederation after the collapse of communism would be a 'massive challenge'. The current general secretary of the confederation, Mr Enzo Friso, from Italy, is likely to stand down at the end of the year.</p>

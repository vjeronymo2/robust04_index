It is a country with which they are having to  reckon. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has declared this in  reaction to the remark made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin,  who today called on NATO member countries to disperse Russia's  fears that they have adopted a duplicitous attitude on this  issue.    Yeltsin also warned against the negative reaction of the  Russian public in case the bloc is expanded. He described the  arguments of those countries striving to gain entry into NATO as  unconvincing. Prime Minister Klaus is conscious that Russia  regards this to be a sensitive issue. However, there is no need  for fear yet because, as the prime minister has said, no one has  offered us NATO membership.</p>

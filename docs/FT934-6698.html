			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / EU sets working week limit: UK ready to challenge the Social Chapter's 48-hour directive European Union ministers yesterday passed directives on working time, setting a 48-hour week limit and guaranteeing mandatory time off. The legislation also limits the time children and adolescents can work. The meeting of employment and social affairs ministers was the first since the Maastricht treaty, from which Britain has an opt-out on the so-called Social Chapter, came into force. The UK has won extensive derogations, or opt-outs, with a review after 10 and seven years respectively on both these EU laws, put through under pre-Maastricht rules which attempted to keep the 12 on roughly the same social policy course. The European Commission and the UK's 11 partners yesterday also formally opted to decide without Britain about plans for compulsory consultation with elected works councils in pan-European countries, using Maastricht's Social Chapter. A proposal to give unpaid parental leave of three months to both fathers and mothers, with guarantees they would get their jobs back, was also abandoned after being blocked by the UK. It will now almost certainly be put forward again for approval by the 11, senior EU officials said. Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, was jubilant and combative, claiming that Britain was winning the argument about the cost to Europe's industrial competitiveness of EU social legislation. 'I'm very optimistic that more and more governments are listening to what we have to say,' he said, despite Britain's isolation on all four measures. Mr Hunt said the British government would be taking the working time directive to the European Court, probably in the new year, because it had been 'inappropriately' put through under health and safety provisions which denied the UK its veto. Under the measure, there are safeguards for the 2.5m British workers who now work more than 48 hours a week who no longer wish to do so. The UK will also for the first time be obliged to introduce laws giving mandatory daily rest periods after six consecutive hours; a minimum daily rest period of 11 hours; at least one day a week off; no more than eight hours a shift on average for night work; and four weeks annual paid holiday. UK officials insisted that Luxembourg also had problems with the parental leave plan. But this is because the tiny Grand Duchy offers eight times the amount of time off to look after children in the Euro-plan, but without the right of return to the same job. The 11 are happy to accommodate the Luxembourg mix - but the exasperation with the UK at yesterday's meeting showed that patience with Britain's blocking tactics has been all but exhausted. 'The UK is living in the stone age,' said one EC diplomat. 'Any kind of standards is anathema to them.' 'It's ideology rather than content,' said another, 'it's the word 'social' that offends.'</p>

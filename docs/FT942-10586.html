			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Russian weight and brilliance - Concert The stormwinds of Soviet change blew the Russian National Orchestra into being in 1990 - the first orchestra to be wholly separate from the state in Russia since 1917 - and already it sounds as seasoned in style, as effortlessly well-balanced and accurate of ensemble as one of the great orchestras of the world. That is not so surprising since the players count among the country's best, many of them soloists in their own right, all ready to muster at the founder-conductor Mikhail Pletnev's call, even if this meant abandoning prestigious positions. Pletnev wanted to create an orchestra with the highest ideals and free from bureaucratic imposition; one, you might say, that would restore Russian musicians to their purest native musicality, untainted by ideology. Once Gorbachev gained power, the dream became a possibility; and the combination of Tat'yana Sukhacheva's business skill and Pletnev's immense musical authority - he won the Gold Medal of the Moscow International Piano Competition when only 22 (in 1978) - proved galvanising. Soon the new orchestra was travelling the world. Three years after playing Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony in Moscow at its first concert, the RNO was recording it for Deutsche Grammophon. For its Festival Hall concert on Sunday night, the orchestra offered Tchaikovsky and Weber and secured a large audience. Romeo and Juliet overture was a fine advertisement for their sound, which, like that of the best Russian orchestras, is a compound of weight and brilliance. The stormy passages for rushing string octaves and crashing chords had all the decisive Russian despatch you would expect, and the lyrical music was mellowly, thoughtfully executed; but the true delight of the performance was perhaps the exact weighting of inner parts such as the roving thirds of the slow introduction or the throbbing woodwind triplets - just sufficiently audible in their own right - at the glowingly expansive reprise of the lyrical tune. For all its quintessential Russian virtuosity, the orchestra refrains from exaggeration, and such sensible musicality is made visible in Pletnev's unshowy, hugely effectual platform manner. Wonderful pianist though he may be, he seems a natural as a conductor. In a brilliant and discreetly tongue-in-cheek performance of Weber's vapid Konzertstuck in F minor he came before us in both roles. In Tchaikovsky's fourth symphony he conclusively demonstrated that colour and architecture are one. The recurrent fateful brass fanfare can rarely have sounded so blindingly brilliant, and thus as structurally effective, as this. And what cello resonance (near the close of the Andantino)] what flute agility (for the descants in the finale)] what violas] In the encore of a Dvorak Slavonic Dance, the latter sounded every bit as sharply characterful, as reedy, as the oboes they were playing with.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> OPRAH SWALLOWS HER PRIDE, ADMITS REGAINING 17 POUNDS  </P> <P> Battling the bulge while in the public eye hasn't been easy, talk-show queen  Oprah Winfrey said today, acknowledging she has regained 17 of the celebrated  67 pounds she lost last year.  </P> <P> "You order a side dish and they call 911 on you," she told her television  audience.  </P> <P> Then there was the time Winfrey ordered apple pancakes in a restaurant and  "read about it in two newspapers the next day."  </P> <P> Winfrey, who has not revealed either her "before" or "after" weight, shed her  pounds with a liquid-protein diet. Exactly a year ago, she showed off a new,  svelte self in tight-fitting jeans as her national audience applauded.  </P> <P> Her luck with losing was national news and in August, Winfrey's face --  superimposed on actress Ann-Margret's hourglass figure -- graced the cover of  TV Guide.  </P> <P> But today, Winfrey, 35, commiserated over the difficulties of dieting with a  studio audience loaded with folks on their way up or down the scale.  </P> <P> "Nothing would have pleased me more than to walk off into the sunset in my size  10 Calvin Klein jeans," she said. "I said it was going to be a struggle and  Lord knows, it has."  </P> <P> Winfrey said she's managed to keep most of the weight off by exercise and a  diet low in fat and sugar.  </P> <P> Winfrey made a final plea: "If you see me out someplace and I am ordering  pancakes -- just let me do it."  </P></p>

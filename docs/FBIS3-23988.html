			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy chairman of </F> the Russian Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service,  by Irina Petrovskaya, under the "Crisis" rubric: "We Have Been  Ordered To Survive"]    [Text] I met with Valentin Lazutkin, first deputy  chairman of the Russian Federal Television and Radio  Broadcasting Service [FSR], on the day when television screens  went blank in 60 regions of the country. Communications workers  had carried out their threat and stopped transmission of  television and radio broadcasts, demanding that state companies  and the government pay their debt of 80 billion. The same day,  Viktor Chernomyrdin firmly promised to pay the debts by the end  of the first quarter and pleaded with the communications  industry to resume transmission. The threat to be left without  the favorite "boob tube" has receded. For how long? How is state  television to live and survive in this extremely hard economic  situation?    [Lazutkin] We have always thought that we had not yet hit  the  bottom. Today it is clear--this is the bottom. What can we count  on? Only on radical political solutions. At this point the most  unpopular and painful method was used--they took the money from  some other sphere, where the house is not yet on fire, and gave  it to television. Naturally, this is not going to solve the  problem.    Of course, we now need to do full accounting, go through the  entire chain of calculations. Optimists believe that  restructuring of the economic mechanism of the federal  television system may produce savings measured by a two-digit  factor. This is a lot--two zeros are erased, by the way. But  expert modern economic analysis will take time.    Not too many people know that the entire system of signal  distribution rests on 8,500 retransmission stations. Can we  dispense with ground stations and shift to satellite  transmissions? Yes, but not before the year 2000. There is also  a problem with satellites. Those that serve the Far East  sometime by the spring will reach the end of their useful life  and quietly die. In the past, there was a rule: One satellite is  working; another is hanging nearby, just in case; and the third  is on the ground, ready for launch. Alas, this situation no  longer exists. Satellites are approaching the end of their  utility, and there is no replacement for them on the ground.  This is about television, but there also is radio. During  COMECON times, radio stations were equipped with Hungarian  equipment. Now all ties have been disrupted. There are no spare  parts. So radio stations will also begin to crumble soon.  Television centers are junkyards. Old equipment that keeps  breaking down. In short, an enormous complex of problems. Today  we felt it especially acutely, because everything went out at  once. I can tell you one thing: This year is a year of survival  for state television.    [Petrovskaya] But how can it survive when this and that is  not available, and the state is unable to provide a dignified  existence for television? By the way, Chernomyrdin, too, when he  spoke on television, suggested that state companies should start  thinking what should be converted to joint-stock holding, and  what should be privatized. There are rumors that Ostankino will  soon be converted to joint-stock holding with the participation  of large industrial and banking capital.    [Lazutkin] It is impossible to build the country without a  federal television and radio. This is the last thing that links  together the cultural and information space of Russia.  Therefore, it is necessary to preserve federal  broadcasting--naturally, in an economical, sensible, aware mode.    As to conversion to joint-stock holding--even if it applied  to Ostankino--I have no social allergy to it. Nevertheless,  today the only part that can be converted to joint-stock holding  is the top of the television iceberg--everything that is related  to production of programs. In this area, one can even earn a  profit. But as soon as you calculate the cost of one hour of  broadcasting, including communications services, you will  realize that nobody in the nonstate sphere of the economy has  this kind of money. Ostankino broadcasts 19 hours a day; its  budget for this year is 1.267 trillion rubles. Of this, 88  percent goes to pay for communications services. This amount can  be compared only with the national budget. I personally doubt  very much that stockholders will undertake the financing of the  real economic structure of television. It is unprofitable to  convert a money-losing enterprise to joint-stock holding. Or are  there illusions that it can be made profitable?    We can and need to put some other, healthy economic  foundation under television. I do not consider it a humiliation  to search for a possible model together with specialists who  have already come into their own in this country. Banks, large  concerns, financial-industrial groups. To make a joint effort to  give the country real, full-fledged, healthy television is our  common civic task. Real joint actions are possible--but, of  course, with the participation of the government. Because, I  repeat, I do not see this kind of untied money in the society  that can be thrown into the television furnace.    [Petrovskaya] But Gusinskiy and the Most Group did find and  did throw the money into the "television furnace." And, I think,  they hit the jackpot.    [Lazutkin] First, do not forget that this channel from the  beginning was set up as commercial, free of any formal  obligations. A charter of any commercial organization--both in  our country and in the West--says: This is an enterprise set up  for the purpose of making a profit. Programming is a vehicle for  advertising, a machine for extracting advertising money from the  airwaves. Therefore, I do not at all preclude the possibility  that economic analysis--which undoubtedly preceded the channel's  creation--showed that it could be made into a profitable  enterprise. Second, Channel 4 is incommensurately cheaper; you  cannot compare it with Ostankino, because it has a much smaller  coverage area. But the most important part still is that the  channel is separated from the state.    Both Ostankino and VGTRK [All-Russia State Television and  Radio Company] should probably remain state television--it has  developed historically this way. Generally, however, I do not  like the word "state." I prefer the model of "public television."    [Petrovskaya] "Public" is social-legal television, which  assumes, on the one hand, the existence of a law on television,  and on the other--society's ability to influence television  through taxes and subscriber fees. We do not have either.    [Lazutkin] But we should arrive at this point. Why not? Our  current status is transitional. We have to survive, to keep the  "furnace" warm. Do note that we are not touching upon the image  of television--whether we make good or bad television.  Naturally, all our ambitions, complaints, appeals to the  government, and to the president on behalf of the audience are  justified only if we make decent television. The revival should  take place not only in the economic and technological sphere,  but also the creative one as well. But it is not smart and  unnecessary to develop both the VGTRK and Ostankino in the same  mode as NTV [Independent Television].    [Petrovskaya] We lost the right to speak of Ostankino as  public or state television quite a while ago, because it is to a  much greater extent than NTV a machine for extracting  advertising money from the airwaves.    [Lazutkin] If we judge by formal attributes, simply by the  number of commercials on this channel, we have long been, of  course, in the category of commercial stations. We do not  collect the kind of money, however, that makes commercial  companies profitable. For a variety of reasons. Some money  settles in middlemen's pockets. Westerners coming to visit us  say that there are now quite a few traveling salesmen who sell  our advertising time in the West. We lose tremendous amounts of  money on it. And the advertising rates we charge are, of course,  far below those of a commercial station. At Western stations,  advertising costs tens of millions, and ours so far goes for  thousands of dollars. Unquestionably, we need to change the very  approach to advertising activities, create large and strong  advertising agencies around Ostankino. We are working on such  plans at Ostankino now.    What else describes the transitional character of today's  Ostankino? All organization of production is obsolete. Huge  staff. If one beautiful day everybody reports to work, Ostankino  may even collapse. We cannot live this way, as the classic said.  We need to switch to producer-based organization, as in the West.    [Petrovskaya] If I understand it correctly, whether state  television is to be or not to be, and what kind it will be, will  be decided first and foremost by your federal service?    [Lazutkin] The point is that the FSR has not been set up  yet,  only announced as a legal entity. Creating it will take time. We  have already written a sixth draft of the service's statute and  will still add to it, modify it, because the situation changes  and we cannot foresee everything. Of course, we will propose  some radical solutions, but the main point of our philosophy is  that the state cannot lose television. There is an immense  national broadcasting network; it has to be developed, and  opportunities created for new broadcasters to get on the air.  Another side of the service's activities is support of  entrepreneurship in the area of television, and control over  rational use of budget money--less ostentatious. But the  service's main task is to protect the interests of the audience.  The statute we are developing now will not have a single hint at  some powers related to the practice of interference in the  companies' programming activities. But the service will have the  right to monitor the integrity of broadcasting, that the  broadcaster's intents and obligations correspond to his  practice. The state has an obligation to protect the moral  health of the nation through its institutions.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   I left Valentin Lazutkin's office without being any closer  to  an answer to the main question: How to save and preserve state  television, which is on the brink of ruin? I agree that it is  necessary to preserve state television--not because of its  special mission, but simply because the more different kinds of  television we have, the better; but I still never got an answer  to the questions:    --Why it is so necessary to "disengage" commercial  television  from the state?    --Why is it not possible to predicate issuance of  broadcasting licenses on certain requirements to the programs  (the same "moral integrity," concern for expanding the  audience's outlook, carrying out informational, consolidating,  social-educational functions)?    --Finally, why not study recommendations developed in this  respect in European countries, where commercial television is  certainly not just "an instrument for earning a profit"--the  evidence of which, among other things, is ITN News broadcast on  Channel "2x2"?</p>

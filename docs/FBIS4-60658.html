			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled commentary] </F>   [Text] O sons of our proud Yemeni people in the city of  Aden and everywhere in our one Yemeni homeland: The forces of  apostasy and secession under the leadership of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, the criminal traitor and veteran terrorist, have never  hesitated about spreading terrorism and bloodshed to every place  reached by their spiteful, criminal hands.    In the same way as they directed their  internationally-prohibited missiles of mass destruction toward  Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Ma'rib, and al-Rahidah, killing  innocent children, women, elderly people, and men, and  destroying the secure residential areas, they did not spare the  valiant city of Aden from their treacherous, cowardly strikes.  Missile strikes were dealt to it by the forces of apostasy and  secession during the past few days, aiming at the residential  areas in the city of Aden as if the bloodthirsty criminals --  through this terrorist action -- are warning the citizens in the  valiant city of Aden with the aim of terrorizing them and  dissuading them from joining the ranks of unity and  constitutional legitimacy. The hand of treachery, rancor,  treason, and secession is being extended to steadfast and heroic  Abyan everyday. Missiles and shells are landing in it from  warships and aircraft that are still in the hands of the  traitors and secessionists, enemies of God, people, and the  homeland. These strikes are destroying houses and killing  innocent people. What more do the criminal secessionist  traitors have in store? Shall we allow them to continue their  criminal actions? That is something that will not be tolerated  by our proud Arab Muslim people -- our great Yemeni people.</p>

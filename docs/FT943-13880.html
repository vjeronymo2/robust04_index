			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Peres takes softer line on returning Golan Heights With encouraging signs in peace talks with Jordan, Israel has also softened its position towards Syria and the vexed question of the return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said last week that Israel now recognised Syrian sovereignty over the strategic Heights, which the Jewish state seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 'The government of Israel has recognised Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights and the concept of peace based on international borders subject to the security needs of Israel,' Mr Peres said. He also referred in a foreign ministry communique to a 1967 secret cabinet resolution calling for negotiations with Syria on the basis of withdrawal to the 'international border' in return for full peace, demilitarisation of the Golan and guarantees of the flow of water to the Jordan Valley. The foreign minister also spoke of the strong precedent of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt which had seen the return of all Egyptian territory occupied by Israel. Foreign ministry officials said the formal recognition of Syrian sovereignty effectively relegated Israel's annexation of the Heights in 1981 and that Mr Peres' 'far-reaching' remarks were the broadest hint so far that Israel would yield all the Heights up to the 1967 international border in return for full peace and security guarantees. The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked as Israel refused to specify how much of the Heights it would return to Damascus until Syrian President Hafez al Assad made a commitment to full peace including open borders, trade, tourism and the establishment of embassies. However, despite Mr Peres' apparent hints, Israel has still not met Syrian demands that Jerusalem formally declare it will withdraw to 1967 borders and return the entire Golan. Syria said Mr Peres' statements added nothing new, as Israel's recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Heights was 'a recognition of fact' in accordance with United Nations resolutions.</p>

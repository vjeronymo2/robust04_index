			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Banks to dispense adverts with cash in the high street Two high street banks are poised to cash in on their cash dispensers by selling advertising space and issuing discount vouchers. Instead of a vacantly blinking 'Welcome, please insert your card' sign, customers will be met with an advertisement, whether for a local shop or a national product. Money-off coupons will be dispensed with the cash. It is likely that banks will combat criticism about potential litter by allowing customers to opt not to receive the vouchers. Two high street banks in the UK are planning to test the scheme later this year at about 150 cash dispensers, according to Aimmedia International, the Kingston upon Thames, Surrey-based company which has developed the system. If the three-month trials are successful, the company hopes to market the system to other UK banks which together have more than 18,000 dispensers. Advertisers will pay an average of Pounds 110 a week for the exclusive use of a cash machine, which will issue a maximum of 2,000 vouchers during the week. It will be possible to target particular cash machines to maximise the effect of the advertising; for example, a dispenser near a large music shop might issue vouchers for compact discs and audio tapes. On the reverse side of the vouchers, banks will print their own, possibly linked, advertising. A voucher redeemable against a holiday, say, could also advertise travellers' cheques; a car test-drive offer might also promote the bank's car loans. In the US, the National Bank of Commerce, Tennessee, is testing out the idea, and Aimmedia plans to approach banks in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France and Scandinavia. Building societies could also be attracted to the scheme, the company believes. Mr Steve Ross, Aimmedia's managing director, said the advertising offered banks the chance to make money out of their costly dispensers. Manufacturers and retailers would be able to target consumers in the high street. 'A computerised geographical information system will allow the advertiser to specify the machines their vouchers are dispensed from,' he said.

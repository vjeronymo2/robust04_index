			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Leading Article: Science matters FOR A professional group, scientists show extraordinary hostility to the UK government. The election campaign has brought out the antagonism  - in letters to newspapers from senior researchers lamenting the decline in British R&amp;D, and in well-attended election meetings held by Save British Science, a lobby group. The researchers are justifiably angry with the Conservative party's selective use of statistics to show real growth in government funding of basic science. The five research councils have indeed increased spending by 24 per cent since 1979, but this has been offset by a decline in public support for research from other sources. Foreign scientists are also concerned about the erosion of UK public investment in research. On a visit to London last month, Mr Allan Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, deplored the planned closure of Daresbury Nuclear Structure Facility in Cheshire, which he said 'has established an absolutely enviable reputation for excellence'. Although industrial R&amp;D has increased since 1979, it has not made up for the shortfall in government R&amp;D. The UK was the only OECD country in which the percentage of GDP devoted to civil R&amp;D declined during the 1980s. The decline in British science may reflect the fact that no Conservative politicians really care about research. Margaret Thatcher once worked as a research chemist, but her governments had no champion of science and technology like Heinz Riesenhuber in Germany or Henri Curien in France. The complaints of the scientists, who are not traditionally a vocal lobby group, cannot be dismissed merely as self-interested pleading. The health of science matters for several reasons. As the Conservative election manifesto says, research 'enriches the quality of our lives and provides the feedstock of innovation'. An important aspect of science is cultural, even romantic. This is rooted in the origins of the subject as natural philosophy. Unfortunately, some of the questions asked by today's natural philosophers - for example 'how did the Universe start and how will it end?' - cannot be answered without investing billions of pounds in atom-smashers and astronomical observatories. The UK, as a culturally advanced nation, must pay for its share of international facilities such as Cern, the European centre for particle physics. But politicians inevitably see science mainly as a source of inventions for industry. There is a link between a nation's scientific excellence and industrial success, though it operates on a timescale of decades. Japan should not be seen as a counter-example - for several years Japanese industry and government have been investing heavily in research as the foundation for industrial pre-eminence in the next century. Science deserves better treatment from the next government. And the physical sciences - already in worse shape than biomedical research and vulnerable to the run-down in defence R&amp;D - will need particular attention.</p>

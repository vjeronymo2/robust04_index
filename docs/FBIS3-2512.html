Meanwhile, EU policy-making bodies are working on a plan to  keep such a union operating efficiently after accepting new  members.    Foreign ministers of the existing 12 EU nations gathered in  brussels on Tuesday to discuss for the first time technical  details on how to restructure the enlarged union. However,  following major disagreements over a voting mechanism, the  meeting closed without reaching any conclusions on Wednesday  morning.    While negotiations between the EU and Norway about its entry  are undergoing some difficulties, it is believed in Brussels  that an agreement could eventually be reached.    Further talks were held from Sunday through to Tuesday  between the EU and Norway but, once again, they broke down with  the two sides agreeing to reopen them on March 15.    The rights of fishing have been a thorny issue in the  enlargement talks between Norway and the EU.    Norway says it can not make any more concessions to meet  demands that EU fishing fleets from Spain and Portugal be  granted more fishing rights in Norway's North Sea waters.    But spain, which has the EU's largest fishing fleet, insists  that it must be able to fish more in Norwegian waters and  threatens to block Norway's membership bid if more fishing  rights are not given.    Observers here believe that even if Norway refuses to comply  with the concessions demanded by the EU, the enlargement  program, which involves admitting Sweden, Finland and Austria,  will not be effected.    However, they do stress that if the eu's reform of its  internal structure, especially the vital voting mechanism, is  not completed smoothly, all efforts to progress an enlarged  union will have been wasted.    When the European Community (EC), the EU's predecessor,  began  talks to lay a foundation for enlargement by admitting Sweden,  Finland, Austria and Norway in February 1992, it made it clear  that the plan was to energize the grouping instead of weakening  it or restricting the limits of its authority.    The European parliament has also made it clear that if the  enlargement has a negative effect on the operation of the  community, it will not approve the admission of new members.    When it was founded in 1957, the EC only had six member  nations. But over the past 30 years, the number has doubled.  However, it's policies have remained basically unchanged.    If everything goes to plan, by January 1995 the number of  members will have jumped to 16. This, though, means that its  original practices and principles will no longer be suitable and  institutional reform will become a major priority affecting its  ability to accept new members.    The council of foreign ministers is the EC's highest policy-  making body and enjoys legislative power. It consists of 12  ministers respectively from the 12 member nations. However,  each minister's voting rights differ, depending on each  country's population. The number of votes allocated to each  minister can vary from 2 to 10.    At present, the council's tally of votes is 70: Germany,  Italy, Britain and France each with 10; Spain 8; The  Netherlands, Greece, Belgium and Portugal each with 5 votes; and  Luxembourg 2.    According to reports, if the 12 nations fail to conclude an  agreement on a voting mechanism or "iron out" their other  difficulties for an enlarged union in the next two weeks, it  will be impossible for the European parliament to give its  approval for whatever has been decided before June 1, thus  delaying the process even further.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Saygi Ozturk report: "Operation Against Reactionary </F> Elements in the Police Organization"]    [Excerpts] The General Directorate of Police has issued a  report on the results of an investigation on reactionary  activities of several police officials. The investigation  revealed that many police officials, including several who  served as police chiefs, have been involved in reactionary  activities, have organized secret meetings, and have adopted  code names in the organization.    The investigation was secretly carried out by the inspectors  of the General Director of Police. The report written by the  inspectors has been submitted to the Ankara State Security Court  Prosecutor General's Office.    The investigation began when the General Directorate of  Police received a letter from a student at the Ankara Police  Academy, who was in his final year. State of Emergency Governor  Unal Erkan was the general director of police at the time. The  officials were shocked by the letter, which was submitted to the  Police Inspection Council.  <H5>  Placed Under Surveillance </H5>   The police moved to tap the telephones of several officials  and place their activities under surveillance. It was  ascertained that several students in the Police Academy and  other police training institutions took part in reactionary  activities. It was also ascertained that several police  officials held secret meetings in their homes, adopted code  names, and used coded expressions in their telephone  conversations.    The police inspectors concluded their investigation after  many years. They submitted their report and several documents  to the Ankara State Security Court Prosecutor General's Office.  Meanwhile, several of the high-ranking officials, whose names  appeared in their report, were removed from active duty.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Pressure </H5>   A police official said some time ago that the activities of  reactionary groups in the police organization has created  uneasiness. He stressed: "It is common knowledge that a  significant amount of reactionary activity exists in the police  organization. In fact, the reactionary officials have held  influential posts at various times. An urgent solution must be  found to resolve that problem. Meanwhile, a serious struggle  exists between the reactionary groups. The officials have to be  very careful on that matter. The inspectors, who are  investigating the problem, are under significant pressure at the  present time."    It has been claimed that the inspectors have asked for  protection on grounds that their safety has been threatened.  However, the claim has not been confirmed by the officials.</p>

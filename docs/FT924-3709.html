			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Sport: Get a good grip on your mind - Golf IT IS said that the most important inches in golf are those between the ears, and the more attention paid to the mental side of the game, the better. Certainly, at 8.30 in the morning, the 30 promising young professional golfers gathered in an hotel room in southern Spain were intent on listening to what Alan Fine was saying about mental training. Fine had already made clear what he thought of some of the well-worn cliches of golf. 'Practice makes perfect is bullshit,' he said crisply. 'Practice makes permanent, more like.' Now, he was teaching a couple of simple exercises to improve concentration. The golfers were ordered to collect a cotton thread and a safety pin from a table at the front of the room and attach the thread to the pin. 'Hold up the thread so the pin is dangling,' said Fine. 'I want you to concentrate on the safety pin and make it swing like a pendulum towards me.' The room went silent as the occupants concentrated on their task. Soon, the safety pins started swinging. 'Good,' said Fine. 'Now, I want you to concentrate on making the pins move anti-clockwise.' Again a deep silence fell over the room. Moments later, he said: 'Some of you have it moving clockwise and some of you anti-clockwise. That is all right. This exercise is an attention-grabber. It shows that whatever you think about generates a physical response.' Fine looked around at the surprised faces and smiled. For most of the golfers, being shown how the mind controlled the body was a new experience. They were promising professionals selected by Apollo, the golf shaft manufacturer, to attend this week-long course. For them, playing better golf was achieved by hitting hundreds of balls on a driving range. Fine, however, spends his life trying to improve the performances of athletes and businessmen and, for him, a simple demonstration of mind over matter such as this was old hat. He trains executives 'to maximise what they are capable of achieving.' The bulk of his work is done with companies such as Rockwell, IBM and DuPont and he spends part of each month in the US. But he is fascinated by the relationship between sport and business, believing that sport can be a metaphor for work. 'The value of sport is that, because it simplifies many actions and results, it is easy to see what has happened and thus to improve,' says Fine. 'Think of stress in sport. Its symptoms could be the same as stress in business. It is often caused by a lack of clarity as to what the goals are. Focusing on clarifying the goals, and the reality of achieving them, can reduce stress. 'Coaching in sport is about helping and empowering people to succeed. It is the same in business. When the task is greater than the skill available, then the classic response is to tighten up. You see that in golf and you see that in business. Top sportsmen use coaches because it helps them perform at their peak. The best managers coach their employees, too.' For Fine, the attraction of golf is that it is an excellent teaching and learning tool. 'Golf points up the results of not using your mind well, much more than other sports,' he says. 'At its simplest, almost everything we do is either observing, listening, taking action or thinking. Everybody does some things that are combinations of these. The combinations may be different between sport and business, between a gardener and John Major, a golfer and a musician. But what I am trying to do is to help people get better at thinking, planning, talking and observing, because then they will be able to do their jobs better.' Fine, who does not play the game himself, has worked with Colin Montgomerie and Howard Clark, the Ryder Cup players, and Bernard Gallacher, the Ryder Cup captain. He has had the most success, however, with David Feherty, who was a member of the Ryder Cup team captained by Gallacher in 1991. 'Before I met Alan, I was like a blind man looking for a black cat in a darkened room,' says Feherty. In those days in the mid-'80s, Feherty was a promising player and 15th in the money list, but he had yet to win a tournament although he and his peers thought him capable of it. After discussions, the two men decided Feherty was occasionally being over-cautious in producing a stroke. He would decide how to play it and then allow doubts to creep into his mind. Fine thought of a technique that would help. 'How much money would you have to lose for it to hurt?' he asked Feherty. 'Pounds 500,' said Feherty before adding, hurriedly: 'No, Pounds 100.' He knew something was up. 'I want you to write a cheque for Pounds 1,000 to your favourite charity and leave it with me,' said Fine. 'If you hit the ball fearlessly, I will return it to you. If you do not, I will give it to charity. I am trying to make you realise that it will hurt you not to commit yourself to every shot.' Feherty won the next tournament he entered. 'I've won,' he wrote in his diary. 'Why didn't I do this before?' The same technique has been used on businessmen. 'I have had men tell me that they are totally in control of themselves and will definitely do something and then, along the way, they change their priorities,' says Fine. 'Twice, I have cashed cheques, one for Pounds 50 and one for Dollars 10,000.' He adds: 'Golf as a culture is more open than many sports. Golfers are more willing to try anything. Tennis players, by contrast, are more reactive. I like working with sportsmen. They enjoy a challenge and they respond to adversity.' Alan Fine's company is Inside Out. Tel: 071-938-3365.</p>

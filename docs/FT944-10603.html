			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / MMC to study Thomas Cook travellers' cheques acquisition The acquisition by Thomas Cook Group, the travel company, of Barclays Bank's travellers' cheques business has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The acquisition, announced in August, would allow Thomas Cook, already the world's largest issuer of Mastercard travellers' cheques, to become the biggest issuer of Visa travellers' cheques as well. The deal would increase Thomas Cook's share of the world's Dollars 54bn (Pounds 33bn) a year travellers' cheque market from 17 per cent to 30 per cent. The market is led by American Express, which invented the travellers' cheque 103 years ago, and has 44 per cent of the market. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that Mr Heseltine had referred the acquisition to the MMC on the advice of Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. The MMC must report by February 16. The deal was originally due to be completed this week, but has now been put on hold until after the MMC report. Thomas Cook has not disclosed how much it paid Barclays to acquire Interpayment Services, the subsidiary, and yesterday refused to comment on the MMC referral. Thomas Cook intends to operate the Interpayment Visa brand separately although the two brands would use the same distribution and processing facilities. The integration of those facilities has not yet begun. The consolidation in the travellers' cheques business is in response to a slowdown in the world market, as plastic cards and automated cash machines have started to replace cheques as a means of transferring small sums of money abroad. Under the 1973 Fair Trading Act, the trade and industry secretary can refer to the MMC mergers that intensify a market share of 25 per cent or more in the UK. The MMC has to report whether the merger may operate against the public interest. 'Go West]' echoes in Barclays' ears, Page 25</p>

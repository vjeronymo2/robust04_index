			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (14): Tourism revenue drops - Terrorist attacks frighten off visitors The lure of cheap holidays in Turkey has been severely diminished by this year's spate of kidnappings and bombings by Kurdish separatists. Visitors to Turkey plummeted from 2.8m to 2.2m in the peak months of July, August and September, according to government figures. Earnings for the year are likely to be well below expectations and short of last year's Dollars 3.6bn. 'Terrorism has seriously undermined revenues from tourism,' says one western diplomat in Ankara. 'The government had hoped for Dollars 6bn from tourism this year. That is likely to be halved because of the PKK (Kurdish separatist group).' Tourism is still one of Turkey's biggest single foreign exchange earners. Last year, the country took a 1.3 per cent share of the world's Dollars 279bn income from tourism. And the government says it believes earnings will pick up again next year. 'I am cautious about this year,' says Ms Ayse Feyizoglu, of the Turkish tourism ministry. 'But in the long run I think the numbers should go on increasing.' The industry has grown rapidly since the mid-1980s when the government set out to encourage tourism by improving the infrastructure, including roads, hotels and airport facilities, particularly along the Mediterranean and Aegean coast. 'In 1987, we had only 65,000 hotel beds,' says Ms Feyizoglu. 'Now there are more than 300,000, and facilities for a further 200,000 are under construction. In the next two to three years, we expect the number of foreign visitors to rise to 10m a year.' Earnings from tourism rose sharply between 1985 and 1990 as droves of visitors, mostly from western Europe, took up the promise of a cheap and exotic holiday, with good food and virtually guaranteed sunshine. Between 1985 and 1990 the number of foreigners visiting Turkey jumped from 2.5m to 5.4m, with receipts from tourism rising from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 3.2bn. The rise was interrupted in the aftermath of the Gulf War, when earnings dropped to Dollars 2.65bn in 1991. Last year, the numbers bounced back, with 7m visitors, producing receipts of Dollars 3.6bn. However, up to September this year Turkey had attracted only 5m foreign tourists, against 6.7m a year ago. The latest figures, coupled with a rising number of Turks travelling abroad, undermine government attempts to improve the country's balance of payments position with earnings from tourism. An estimated 3.2m Turks going abroad will reduce the net figure from tourism this year by Dollars 950,000. Turks are expected to spend Dollars 1bn on holidays abroad next year. Ms Feyizoglu says that Turkey is making up some of the losses from Europe with a rising number of visitors from the south-east Asia, in particular from Japan. Last year, nearly 28,000 Japanese tourists visited Turkey, according to government figures, against 12,000 the year before. After terrorist attacks on coastal resorts and kidnappings of foreigners, the government has promised greater security at hotels and other holiday accommodation. The slide in earnings has also prompted new minimum regulations for the industry. Recession in Europe has discouraged visitors from abroad, says Ms Feyizoglu. The number of Germans, who account for the largest group of tourists in Turkey at about 12 per cent, has declined this year by more than 5 per cent. But officials say terrorist attacks are only part of the problem. 'The Germans also fear reprisals after neo-Nazi attacks on Turks in Germany,' says Ms Feyizoglu. 'But no-one here would contemplate such an act of revenge.' Western embassies in Ankara, including those of the US, Germany and the UK, are still warning their citizens to steer clear of south-east Turkey, although not of the rest of the country. Yet thousands of foreigners are staying away, for whatever reason, and next year's official target of 8m visitors to Turkey may prove optimistic.</p>

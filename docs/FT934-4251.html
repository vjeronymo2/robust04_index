			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs revive As the post-Budget buying spree waned, investors sat back and looked at areas of the market which have been left behind. The health and household sector was one of the first to spring to mind - it has underperformed the FT-All Share Index by almost 40 per cent over the past year. A year ago the p/e ratio on the 500 Index, which reflects the performance of all stocks excluding financial issues, was 17.12 while the health and household sector, traditionally viewed as a fast growing area was above 23. At the close of trading on Thursday the position was reversed. Several of the sector's leading companies are now seen as low growth yield stocks rather than rising stars. Hoare Govett sees Glaxo yielding 5 per cent and Zeneca 4.8 per cent. That yield potential was underlined as the market caught wind of a further cut in base rates yesterday. Glaxo, which received approval for an influenza compound to be tested on humans in the United States next year, rose 8 1/2 to 695 1/2 p, It was also said to have been upgraded by Smith Barney in the US. Zeneca gained 11 to 796p , Wellcome 8 to 684p and SmithKline Beecham 5 1/2 to 399p.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Westminster 'was told policy was unlawful' A leading QC warned high-ranking Westminster Council officials that selling homes to increase the Conservative vote in marginal wards was unlawful, the public inquiry into alleged vote-rigging has heard. Mr Andrew Arden, the barrister representing the Labour councillors and local residents who objected to Westminster's housing policy, said conflicting accounts existed of a crucial meeting between Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC and three of the council's senior officials - Mr Graham England, the director of housing, Mr Paul Hayler, a divisional director of housing, and Mr Robert Lewis, deputy chief solicitor between 1986 and 1988. All three are accused of vote-rigging in the provisional report published by the district auditor, Mr John Magill, after a four-year investigation. Mr Arden said there were three records of what was said at a meeting on May 5 1987. Mr Lewis told the district auditor that the three officials were very open with Mr Sullivan and explained that the 'hidden agenda' of Conservative councillors was to boost the Tory vote by concentrating the sales of the homes in marginal wards. Mr Sullivan replied that this was unlawful, the inquiry was told. On the same day, Mr Arden said, Mr England wrote to councillors saying that Mr Sullivan had advised that the homes should be sold in both marginal and non-marginal wards 'to protect the council'. Mr England noted that councillors had set a target of 'at least' 250 sales a year. He added that councillors would have to decide whether this target applied only to the marginal wards. He said if that was the case 'somewhere in the region of 300 to 350 properties' would have to be sold. In the event, councillors decided in July of that year on an annual target of 500. With only a limited number of homes becoming empty each year, the council had to put half of its housing stock into the scheme in order to reach the sales target. The inquiry has heard that Mr England repeatedly warned councillors that such a high number of sales would inevitably mean that the council would not be able to meet its statutory obligations to house the homeless. Documents circulated on August 3 1987 set out the targets for new residents - referred to as 'new electors' - needed in each of eight marginal wards. Mr Arden said that Mr Matthew Ives, the council's chief solicitor between 1985 and 1993 and now director of professional conduct at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, had written at the top of the document: 'This paper should not have been produced by an officer. Much more subtle approach required. This paper shows officers working for a Tory victory.'</p>

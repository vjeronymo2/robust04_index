			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Kenyan banking authorities caught by the political fallout: A complex rescue operation designed to reassure a sector hit by bad debts and questionable business ventures KENYA'S political reforms, coupled with western donor demands for better economic management, have exposed the fact that at least two of the country's banks have serious liquidity problems. Evidence of the difficulties, stemming from a long history of bad lending and an insecure deposit base, emerged this week, when the Kenyan Central Bank began an operation to rescue the two worst affected local banks. It amounts to a complex restructuring of the liabilities of Trade Bank and Pan African Bank, both registered in Kenya. A Central Bank document sent to the Financial Times said the banks had been experiencing a 'liquidity crisis' following a 'loss of public confidence'. In a press statement on Wednesday, the Central Bank reassured the market, saying that any problems in the banking sector 'will be eliminated without causing instability to the industry or loss to depositors'. It added that sufficient measures were in place to ensure that 'no bank should suffer on account of liquidity shortfall'. The Bank's intervention follows the fall from power last November of Mr Nicholas Biwott, the disgraced ex-minister and former confidant of President Daniel arap Moi. Mr Biwott's liabilities were estimated by bankers last week at Ksh1.2bn-Ksh1.4bn (Pounds 23m-Pounds 27m). Trade Bank and Pan African Bank, the fifth largest in Kenya, are among the main creditors. Unease in the business community deepened following the departure from Kenya in the same month of Mr Ketan Somaia, a Kenyan Asian tycoon with large banking and commercial interests in Kenya. Mr Somaia made a brief visit to Nairobi last weekend. The development highlights a weakness in the Kenyan banking system. Some of the indigenously owned banks were created in the 1980s with the backing of politicians. Several of these banks obtained much of their funds through large deposits from state owned companies, acting under directions from the political elite. The deposits would then be lent on to politicians, government officials, or business surrogates, often without adequate security, and used to develop their commercial interests. Many of these banks also have a large portfolio of non-performing loans. The accounts of state owned companies are now coming under scrutiny as western donors urge faster implementation of the privatisation programme. At least four banks, apart from Trade Bank and Pan African Bank, are struggling to deal with the combined pressures of large outstanding loans, many of them non-performing. In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this week, Professor George Saitoti, vice-president and minister of finance, acknowledged that 'there have been major withdrawals of money from the small banks in the last two months. The era of multi-party politics has brought insecurity and there was a kind of a panic.' In the Central Bank document outlining the rescue package, Trade Bank and Pan African Bank were described as having 'experienced a liquidity crisis'. Among the reasons cited were loss of deposits following bad publicity surrounding Mr Biwott's HZ Group, described as Trade Bank's main client, and large non-performing loans both banks provided to Mr Biwott's group of companies. In the document, the official stressed that 'the resources of the Deposit Protection Fund now amount to more than Ksh1.5bn and are adequate to meet any liquidity crisis'. Trade Bank, which was 75 per cent owned by Mr Biwott and his business associate Mr Gad Zeevi until 1989, is owed Ksh450m by Mr Biwott's HZ Group, according to the document. It says the bank was undercapitalised and suffering from diversion of funds worth Ksh200m to construct Trade Bank Centre, a business block in Nairobi, and Ksh300m to finance an associated company. A Trade Bank executive said the correct amounts were Ksh170m and Ksh108m respectively. Pan African Bank forged close ties with Mr Biwott during his nine-year stint as energy minister and handles the banking business for the Kenya National Oil Company, the state owned oil importer. It is owed Ksh250-Ksh300m, secured against Mr Biwott's Yaya Centre - a Nairobi commercial complex. The Central Bank document said Pan African had suffered an erosion of confidence after the death last December of its executive chairman. The bank was also struggling to cope with the diversion of depositors' funds to construct the Meridien Hotel, which Pan African owns. The total cost of the project is Ksh1.27bn, as is due for completion in June. Other insider loans, though secured, are said to exceed permitted limits. An official at Pan African said last week that borrowings from the Central Bank were 'in the course of normal business for a bank which finances the country's oil imports'. Loans to Mr Biwott were performing and well secured, he said. In a bid to stabilise the market, the Central Bank has intervened. According to Prof Saitoti, a deal was signed on Monday which would enable Mr Biwott to pay off some of his heavy debts to the banks. Prof Saitoti said a consortium of banks led by the Kenya Commercial Bank, a majority state-owned company, would lend the Deposit Protection Fund Ksh600m, which in turn would lend Trade Bank Ksh600m to buy Yaya Centre. The loan will be for one year. Of the Ksh600m, Ksh200m-300m will be paid to Pan African Bank and Ksh300m-400m to Trade Bank. This deal, combined with the Central Bank waiving penalties on the banks' overdrafts, will provide substantial relief to the two banks affected, said Prof Saitoti. He said Trade Bank had agreed to sell Diners Club, an associate company, to inject Ksh150m of new capital into the bank by February 29 and was closing a Ksh200m sale of its Trade Bank Centre. Trade Bank puts the sale price of the building at Ksh270m. A Trade Bank executive said of the restructuring exercise: 'The Trade Bank since 1989 has been professionally managed and we have taken dynamic measures to deal with the situation we inherited. We have now corrected the HZ debt problem by the assignment of Yaya Centre to Trade Bank thus eliminating any loans to any of Mr Biwott's companies from Trade Bank.' Trade Bank 'now have a very small proportion of parastatal deposits,' he said: 'We have restored confidence in the bank and its management.' The Central Bank has confirmed that Pan African bank is trying to sell assets including Pan African Building Society, Corporate Insurance and the Meridien project. The bank document disclosed that the government had appointed a manager 'to assume control of the affairs of the bank until such a time that irregularities have been eliminated'. However several senior Nairobi bankers say the package arranged by the Central Bank will still leave significant sums owed by Mr Biwott to be collected or written off. Yet to be tackled is a possible link between state owned companies and some of the smaller banks. As an editorial in Nairobi's Daily Nation this week put it: 'Why are some institutions enjoying unlimited access to deposits from the National Social Security Fund  .. while most of the rest are not?'</p>

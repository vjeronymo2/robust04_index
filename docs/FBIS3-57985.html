At a meeting of his  party's Central Committee in Helsinki on Saturday [27 November],  Hakanen said the general validity of collective bargaining  agreements and the labor union movement's rights to enter into  international agreements have not been recognized in the  membership negotiations. There has been too little mention of  the funding of social security and public services.    In Hakanen's opinion, a radical shift to the right and the  West has occurred in Finland's foreign and security policies.  Whereas an independent neutrality policy used to be emphasized,  now submission to the EU foreign and security policies is the  point of departure.</p>

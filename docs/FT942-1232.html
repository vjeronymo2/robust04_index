			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Japan's prime minister fights to defeat no-confidence vote Japan's nine-week-old minority government was early today fighting for survival after talks aimed at averting a no-confidence vote in the government broke down. The five-party government of Mr Tsutomu Hata was still hoping to persuade the opposition Social Democrats to rejoin the coalition. This would give it enough votes to defeat a no-confidence motion launched by the Liberal Democratic party, the largest opposition group. The vote was scheduled for the early hours of this morning. The impasse followed a breakdown in talks between Mr Hata, the prime minister, and Mr Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the Social Democrats. It increased the risk that Japan will descend into another leadership crisis just before the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Naples at the start of next month. Japan was expected to present to its partners plans to reinforce the fragile revival of the world's second largest economy. 'Japan will lose the trust of international society,' warned Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's strategist. 'We must send prime minister Hata to the summit . . . if the entire cabinet resigns, we won't be able to form a new cabinet in time,' he said. Mr Hata and coalition officials yesterday refused SDP conditions that the prime minister should resign and that the government should water down plans for a rise in indirect taxation and possible sanctions against North Korea. The Social Democrats walked out of the government just after it was formed in April, in protest at plans to exclude them from policy making. Angry SDP leaders warned yesterday they would put down their own no-confidence motion, in addition to the one launched by the LDP. The outcome of the motion was impossible to predict as both the main opposition parties are divided along generation lines. The LDP and SDP old guard are tempted to vote down the government in the hope of forcing an early general election, before parliament has a chance to pass a pending bill to reform the electoral system. The older generation fears it would do worse under the new system. The younger generation, including new parties such as Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party, wants an election under the new system, which it sees as a chance to improve on its successes in last summer's election.</p>

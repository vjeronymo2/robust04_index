			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Federation Vice President </F> Aleksandr Rutskoy by Tatyana Romanenkova and Aleksey Vorobyev;  place, date not given: "...Faith and Hope Should Be Given to  the Living"]    [Excerpts] [PRAVDA] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, it is six  months since the tragic events in Moscow in October 1993, since  the barbaric bombardment of the Russian House of Soviets. The  majority of our fellow citizens have already managed to work out  who was the criminal during those days and who emerged as the  fatherland's genuine defender. How would you assess these  events against the backdrop of our country's history and how  far, in your view, has the development of our civil society, and  of democracy in Russia in general, been put back?    [Rutskoy] First of all the events of those days are a  disgrace for us all. A disgrace for the nation. When the  people stop considering themselves a nation, they become a  population, a large group of private individuals, a crowd which  can be manipulated at will and tricked at every turn. On the  other hand, when people live with self-respect, aware that each  person is an individual representing a great nation and a  citizen of a great state, they will never allow such a thing to  happen. They will simply not permit anyone to exceed their  authority or that of the Constitution. Unfortunately, this did  happen here. The citizen's respect for his state was trampled  on, shot to pieces. People were broken. Therefore, this was,  alas, nothing but a tragedy for this great nation. [passage  omitted]    [PRAVDA] The idea of an accord is being discussed widely in  society today. It is noticeable that a few people are  attempting to use this exclusively for their own mercenary ends,  and a section of the presidential team sees the signing of such  an agreement more or less as an oath of loyalty to B. Yeltsin  personally. Is there nevertheless any chance of some kind of  national accord in society today?    [Rutskoy] We have been talking about civil accord since  February 1992, when the "Civic Union" was formed. Its original  slogan was civil accord. In other words, the creation of  conditions in which each citizen is clearly aware of the  country's aims, which tasks will be carried out, and what each  person will get from this. At that time this idea was not  successfully implemented and we were in many regards not to  blame for this.    Now the president himself has begun to talk about accord.  However, he is again basing it only on a small circle of  politicians. But, you see, an accord signed by some leaders or  other is not a people's accord, a civil accord. This is only  possible when society is stable. When the people have food and  housing, and when you and your property are protected.    Whereas earlier the reforms could have been adjusted and  channeled into performing vitally important priority tasks  affecting the stability of society, now it is already too late.  Everything which could have been destroyed has been; the country  and people have been forced to protest. A new policy, a policy  to extricate the country from this impasse, a policy of reforms  for the people, is now essential to stop our chaotic state  descending into criminality. How much longer can we play the  fool by trifling with this discredited regime and government,  surely we realize who these people are, what goals they are  pursuing, and what they are capable of? Surely we realize that  a government which brought the state and its economy to the  point of absolute crisis is not capable of overcoming this  crisis? For the reason that it not only does not know how to do  this, but is also incapable of doing it. How can we talk about  adjusting the reforms now? What kind of accord can there be and  with whom? With those who plundered and ruined the country?  With those who deprived children of the opportunity to have a  vacation, who did away with young pioneer camps and sports  schools, and who forced people to clamber over the rubbish  heaps? With those who destroyed our science, Army, culture,  education, and health service? With those who destroyed our  entire state?    [PRAVDA] But what way out of the current serious crisis is  there then?    [Rutskoy] There is much to discuss in this regard, but I  will limit myself to this. In order to extricate our country  from the current crisis, it is essential first and foremost to  create a management system. To evaluate our resources (not the  mythical aid and credits from foreign states which,  incidentally, will have to be repaid), work out what are the  priority tasks for the economy and the social sphere which  affect society's stability, and develop new market economic  relations and civilized entrepreneurship in this very direction,  and not speculation calling it business.    The following priorities are obvious to every citizen: food,  housing, health, education, and spiritual and physical  development. These issues will and can be resolved; no one will  go to rallies or strikes, and it will not be necessary to  indulge in demagoguery about an "accord." The execution of  these seemingly narrow tasks will have extensive economic  consequences which will allow us to rescue from the mire not  only agriculture, the construction industry, medicine,  education, and sport, but the economy as a whole. We will  create new forms of management which will work for the  individual. Therefore, whether we like it or not, a  concentration of the state's strengths and assets is necessary,  first and foremost to carry out these very priority tasks.    Only then will the people feel that the state exists for  them, that people have become individuals and not some gullible  sheep; then labor discipline and responsibility to society and  the state will appear in each person. You should not harbor any  illusions that things may change for the better with this  president and government. Therefore, it is essential to stop  this pretense about consensuses and agreements and get on with  things, having replaced the authorities by legal means.    [PRAVDA] What lessons have you yourself learned from  everything that has happened?    [Rutskoy] The first lesson is that you should not have blind  faith, especially in serious politics. Second, it is necessary  to be more reserved, not to give vent to your emotions. Third,  I had intended to quit politics, to give it all up. I do after  all have civilian skills -- I am an artist, an aviation  engineer, and pilot. I could also work as an entrepreneur.    But to leave politics today would be treachery, primarily to  those people who put their trust in me. I have never suffered  from delusions of grandeur or striven to get into power, but I  am sure that it is now simply immoral to quit and abandon  everything and everybody.    I will always remember those who performed their civil duty  to the very end when they defended the Russian Constitution in  September-October. I want the Russian people to know that there  was not a single bandit, "red-brownshirt," or fascist among us.  They were ordinary people, our fellow citizens, and fate will  bring us together again on more than one occasion.    I appeal to you, in honoring the memory of the fallen --  some  people were also wounded, some survived -- whoever is not  indifferent about our fatherland's fate, I want to assure you:  We are all necessary to the homeland, to resurrect this great  power, this great nation.    With faith, hope, and love for the fatherland we will  achieve  happiness, the life we deserve, and greatness for our people and  country.</p>

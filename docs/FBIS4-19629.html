			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to the Bundestag </F> in Bonn on 13 April]    Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen. In his eulogy for  the victims of the terrible act of arson in Solingen on 3 June  1993, President von Weizsaecker correctly described  German-Turkish relations as friendship between peoples. This  friendship has a long and exemplary tradition. It is an  important commodity for us, in foreign policy terms and in human  terms. The Federal Government has a firm desire to care for  this commodity also in difficult times.    Close cooperation with Turkey is no special interest of  Germany's. Rather, it is a common objective of NATO and the  European Union [EU]. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and  the transformations in Central and East Europe, Turkey has  gained even greater significance as a bridgehead between Europe  and Asia and as a stabilizing factor within the Muslim world,  and it requires solidarity particularly now.    Prime Minister Ciller has just announced an economic  stabilization program that calls for harsh measures and  sacrifices. At the same time, the country is being put to the  test by the strengthening of Islam. The Iraqi Kurd leader  Talabani, with whom I am due to hold talks this evening, has  just said that he considers the "growing fundamentalism" in  Turkey "a common threat both to the Kurds and to the Turkish  Government."    But, Ladies and Gentlemen, friendly relations, such as the  ones we maintain vis-a-vis Turkey, also involve the need for  each side to inform the other side as friend and partner about  any problems that exist. In this context, it must be said that  the situation with human rights and that of the Kurdish  population in Turkey is not satisfactory. On the contrary, the  situation has deteriorated. The EU admitted the same thing in a  31 March 1994 declaration on the subject of human rights in  Turkey.    This declaration was brought on by lifting parliamentary  immunity and arresting Kurdish deputies in the Turkish  Parliament at the beginning of March. Immediately after  receiving confirmation of the first reports on this subject, the  Federal Government pointed out that measures against freely  elected members of the Turkish Parliament create the impression  that the voice of the Kurdish population in Turkey is being  suppressed.    Both bilaterally and on an EU level, we have expressed our  expectations that the Kurdish deputies will be permitted to  avail themselves of their constitutional rights. In this  connection, the Federal Government trusts in the impartiality of  Turkish justice.    Together with Douglas Hurd, my British colleague, on 20  January I held a frank discussion with my colleague Cetin, who  is himself a Kurd, and with whom I happen to have been in touch  over the past few days, and still am. A recurrent subject of  our talks is the situation with the Christians and Yezidis,  torture during police custody, and restrictions on the freedom  of speech and opinion.    So that there are no misunderstandings, Ladies and  Gentlemen:  The Federal Government naturally considers combating the  terrorist Kurdish Workers Party to be legitimate. But even  combating terrorism must adhere to the framework of the rule of  law and the norms of human rights that Turkey has also  recognized.    The Federal Government believes, and we have said so again  and again in our talks, that the Kurdish issue, which is a  problem not only in Turkey, can only be resolved by peaceful  means and in mutual agreement between the Turkish Government and  the Kurds. Such a solution must respect and guarantee the  cultural identity of the Kurdish population.</p>

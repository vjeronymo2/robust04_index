			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Stock Exchange After the costly fiasco that was Taurus, it might seem unnerving that the Stock Exchange has started to increase the budget for Seaquence, the trading system being developed to re-place Seaq. But the decision to invest a modest sum to allow the Seaquence to handle order-driven trading - as well as traditional quote-driven business - looks sensible. Competitors such as Tradepoint and Reuters' Instinet are courting customers with order-driven systems. If these prove popular, the Exchange will at least have the systems capacity to respond. The seriousness of the competitive threat may depend on how London copes with the move to rolling settlement later this year. If the pessimists are right, five-day rolling settlement from the start of 1995 will lead to more failed trades, as creaking systems struggle to keep up. Investment institutions would then have a strong case for arguing for the same stock borrowing privileges as market makers to help them weather the storm. With their disclosure privileges already under scrutiny by the Securities and Investments Board, market makers could find many of their existing advantages eroded. If liquidity suffered as a result, competing trading systems would look all the more attractive. While market makers - and most investment institutions  -would prefer to maintain the established quote-driven system, the Exchange is right not to overlook a potential threat for fear of upsetting a portion of membership.</p>

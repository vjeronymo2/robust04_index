			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: (Asia Pacific): Obon holiday season takes its toll of Nikkei ARBITRAGE activity dominated trading, with most investors absent for the Obon holiday period, and share prices closed almost unchanged, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose by just 0.70 to 20,493.75. Initial optimism about economic stimuli from the new government produced a day's high of 20,655.27, but a fall in the futures market depressed the index to a day's low of 20,476.35 in late afternoon. Volume rose to 280m shares from 187m. Advances led declines by 524 to 415 with 215 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks ended 2.21 higher at 1,661.22 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.66 to 1,267.45. Afternoon trading concentrated on a press conference given by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister. Futures traders were discouraged by Mr Hosokawa's cautious stance on income tax cuts and the issue of government bonds to cover a budget deficit. However, specific sectors were bought on Monday's comments by individual ministers after their inauguration. Mr Kozo Igarashi, the construction minister, hoped for housing tax cuts, while Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the minister for industry and trade, indicated support for 'new' infrastructure projects centred around telecommunications. Housing and real estate companies gained ground. SxL, a home builder, rose Y50 to Y1,470, Sekisui House gained Y20 to Y1,310 and Mitsui Fudosan rose Y20 to Y1,330. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y19,000 to Y946,000 in active trading. KDD advanced Y300 to Y12,800 ahead of the listing of DDI, a new telecoms company. Nikko Securities rose Y30 to Y1,220 on the restructuring theme, although other brokers remained mixed. City banks were lower on profit-taking, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y10 to Y3,390 and Bank of Tokyo falling Y20 to Y1,760. Warehousing groups were higher on hopes that the new government's efforts to spur domestic demand would support profits. Mitsubishi Warehouse and Transportation rose Y10 to Y1,670 and Mitsui Soko advanced Y15 to Y924. In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 104.16 at 22,456.22 in volume of 14m shares. Murata Mfg rose Y30 to Y3,180 on buying by foreign investors. Roundup SOME strong performances were seen in the Pacific Rim region. SINGAPORE climbed after its holiday as the government announced that the economy had grown at an unexpectedly strong 10.1 per cent in the second quarter. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 27.59 to 1,898.84, but profit-taking left it unable to maintain a record intra-day high of 1,912.14. AUSTRALIA advanced as the shine returned to golds and the All Ordinaries index closed up 16.1 at 1,860.4. The gold marker gained 99.2, or 4.6 per cent, to 2,247.8. North Flinders Mines was 90 cents higher at ADollars 13.60. SEOUL saw a technical rebound in response to three consecutive days of losses, aided by a buying spree in construction issues on hopes that the government would decide today to boost infrastructure investment. The composite index rose 9.85 to 719.44. MANILA was driven higher by heavy buying of PLDT and the newly-listed JG Summit which spilled over into other stocks, and the composite index rose 18.40 to 1,734.19. A Dollars 1 overnight rise in PLDT to Dollars 41 on Wall Street fuelled local buying and the price rose by 10 pesos to 1,095 pesos. Summit closed at 6.40 pesos, up from the previous 6 pesos. HONG KONG's property sector was hit by rumours that Hang Seng Bank might be about to tighten mortgage lending and the Hang Seng index, down almost 100 points at one stage, finished 52.41 lower at 7,329.81. Cheung Kong shed 40 cents to HKDollars 27.60, Hongkong Land lost 30 cents to HKDollars 16.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 50 cents to HKDollars 38.25. JAKARTA felt the benefit of more good half-year corporate results and the official index rose 5.30 to 369.83.</p>

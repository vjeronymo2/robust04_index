			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> VOTERS REELECT COOK, BUT NEAL LOSES SEAT  </P> <P> Mayor Laurann Cook overwhelmingly won reelection to the City Council, but  voters ousted incumbent James E. Neal. Seats were won by community leader John  Collins and Guy Carozzo, a retired high school principal.  </P> <P> "I was elated and very pleased that the citizens expressed their confidence in  me by showing their wide support," Cook said.  </P> <P> Collins said he was surprised that he defeated Neal and speculated that strong  name recognition associated with his involvement in several community  organizations helped him get the votes.  </P> <P> "Serving on the council is just a logical extension of everything I have done  for the community in the last 17 years," he said.  </P> <P> Carozzo had been something of a dark-horse candidate, and he attributed his  victory to his promise not to accept campaign contributions.  </P> <P> "Whenever asked what I wanted for the city, I answered by asking them what they  wanted me to do," he noted.  </P> <P> Cook's term as mayor will end Dec. 4, when the position -- which is rotated  every two years among council members -- will go to the person next in line  based on seniority and council approval.ROSE APODACA  </P></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / They plough a lonely furrow: Why women farm-owners in Britain are such a rare breed Mrs Catherine Mack has come a long way since she and her husband bought five Shetland sheep to act as a lawnmower on their single acre of precipitous hillside. Today she runs Britain's only organic farm approved by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust - on 336 acres in the West Country, with a turnover of about Pounds 250,000 a year. It boasts 14 breeds of sheep, six types of cattle, four varieties of pigs, organic wheat, a shop, guided tours, goats and ponies. But her 14-year uphill struggle to success owed nothing to the male-dominated farming establishment. She found the National Farmers' Union, instead of welcoming her into the fold, was chauvinistic and clannish. 'I went to a meeting one night about muck-spreading - a major problem because of the pollution it can cause,' she said. 'I arrived and was told the cookery demonstration for wives was upstairs.' Women who own or manage farms in their own right are a rare breed. The Wye agricultural college in Kent, part of London University, estimates only 1 to 3 per cent of UK farms are headed by women. This means women are largely excluded from important decisions on agricultural policy. For example, the 83-member NFU council, whose views are influential in Whitehall, has only two women. Yet most farms would not function without an unpaid woman - the 'farmer's wife' - on duty from dawn until after dark to do the paperwork, answer the phone, deal with callers, cook meals and help with manual work. 'We have men who still look at women as the second sex,' said Mrs Julia Duffield, chairman of the Women's Farming Union. 'Yet women in agriculture do everything their husbands do and more.' The organisation, set up to promote British farm produce, has encouraged solidarity among farmers' wives - but is dismissed by some wives for not being involved in heavyweight political activity. 'Excluding women from managerial positions means denying the production end of the agricultural industry 50 per cent of the potential talent when new blood, new ideas, new approaches are needed,' said Dr Ruth Gasson, agricultural economist at Wye college. This undervaluing of women has not so far been a serious issue in the industry. But Mrs Gillian Shephard, appointed agriculture minister last summer - one of only two women in the cabinet - may change that. Her appointment has provided a rallying point for women in farming. 'When I go to NFU meetings, women come because I am a woman minister and a lot of them say, 'I feel I'm involved - you understand that',' Mrs Shephard said. Some are simply relieved the industry is at last represented by a woman; but others want action. Mrs Shephard is planning to respond to that pressure this summer by announcing a package of educational and other measures to promote women in farming. The biggest problem is inheritance. This is still the typical route into farming and most farmers name their sons as successors, reflecting the farming community's conservatism. Only one in five farmers, whose forebears were also farmers, name a daughter as successor, according to a survey by Dr Gasson. Yet the figure is almost one in three for farmers who have come from another industry. Mrs Sarah Ward, who owns a 800-acre mixed farm in Kent, said she had to be 'extremely strong-minded' to avoid being sidelined 15 years ago when her younger brother showed no interest in inheriting the farm and her father wanted to sell up. 'I felt, being business-minded, that it was a very big asset that shouldn't have gone out of the family,' she said. A former Woman Farmer of the Year and a member of the Countryside Commission advising the government on rural issues, she believes 'women will only have a more important role to play if they can get their hands on the money and the property'. For women who do not inherit farms, money or financial acumen - or a partner with either - may be the only way to overcome obstacles to ownership. Mrs Mack, a former state school teacher, is married to the financial director of United Friendly, the life assurance company. 'George had the right contacts and the earning power,' she said. 'I couldn't have done it.' For farmers' wives - as opposed to women in control of farms - one way of sharing the financial reins is via diversification. The incentives to follow such a route are growing as incomes are squeezed in traditional sectors such as dairying, hit by the introduction of Common Agricultural Policy quotas. Diversifying into horse riding or bed-and-breakfast helps raise cash and awareness of the woman's contribution. New skills, such as the use of computer records or sophisticated financial management, will also be needed as the industry is exposed to market forces under CAP reforms and the Uruguay Round deal. Mrs Marie Skinner, one of the two women on the NFU council, farms 500 acres of cereals in Norfolk in partnership with her husband. She is responsible for buying and selling the grain and uses options to hedge against unexpected price changes. 'The way farming has changed has made it possible for me to become involved because there's a lot more work that needs to be done on the business side,' said Mrs Skinner, a former teacher who started farming when her father-in-law died. Her high profile in the NFU arose from a letter she wrote to a farming magazine 10 years ago attacking the union for complacency. It caused such a stir that she was offered a regular column on agricultural issues in Farmers' Weekly, the trade magazine. Although Mrs Skinner writes about general policy issues, rather than women per se, she believes there are female strengths in farming: 'Where women are better is in anything to do with diversification, anything that means standing back and looking at the business in a new, more open way.' That may explain why women are better represented in less conventional areas, such as organic farming. 'It makes a lot more sense to women,' said Ms Helen Browning, chairman of British Organic Farmers, which has six women on its 12-strong committee. She inherited the tenancy of a 1,350-acre Church of England farm near Swindon from her father and is converting it to organic production. Though a business with a Pounds 1m a year turnover clearly requires financial ability, she argued women had different priorities to males. 'Conventional agriculture can be very macho,' she said, adding that competitiveness led farmers to focus on producing more. 'But there's another side of humanity which says: hang on a minute, are we just chasing our tails? Isn't money better spent doing something more long-term and enjoyable?' Ms Browning believed women are barred from management positions by a lack of all-round training opportunities. 'Women tend to be isolated in things like calf-rearing which men see very patronisingly as a maternal thing. It's rare to find a skilled female tractor driver or mechanic. But to get a farm manager's job you need to be able to convince your boss you can handle that side of things.' At Harper Adams, one of the country's largest agricultural colleges, the proportion of women graduating has nearly trebled to 30 per cent in the last decade. But most train for jobs in marketing, food retailing, research and advisory services rather than farm management - 'an area that's still extremely difficult for women,' said Mr Tony Harris, principal. Mrs Shephard sees training as the key to change: 'The more women train, the more likely it is that when farms pass from hand to hand, women will have a claim.' So will Mrs Mack's eldest daughter Eleanor, aged 19, be taking over Norwood Farm when her mother retires? That's far from certain. 'I want to be an engineer,' she said.</p>

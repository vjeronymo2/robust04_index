			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By O Chae-suk] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, May 29 (YONHAP) -- The just-ended visit to  China by Rep. Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the ruling  Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], was a rare opportunity to enrich  Sino-Korean relations that entered a higher realm following  President Kim Yong-sam's official trip to Beijing last March.    Mun's six-day tour was scrutinized even more closely because  it was the first high-level personnel exchange between the  ruling parties of the two countries.    His visit could mean that bilateral relations, which had in  the past been limited somewhat to exchanges of government  officials and businessmen, have developed to the point of ruling  party-level exchanges. Party-to-party exchanges with the Chinese  are especially significant because in China the ruling Communist  Party stands above the administration in terms of real power.    Naturally, Rep. Mun met key figures from the Chinese  Communist Party to swap opinions on matters of mutual concern,  such as promotion of bilateral ties and coping with the North  Korean nuclear issue. It was through these contacts that the  Chinese leadership was found to feel an acute need to resolve  the nuclear question and play a positive mediatory role.    "Even for our economic development, for which we exert all  available efforts, a stable and peaceful international situation  is needed," said Hu Jintao, a member of the powerful Communist  Party Secretariat who is regarded as one of China's  next-generation leaders. Hu, who in effect oversees party  affairs on behalf of President Jiang Zemin, told Mun that China  is trying to help settle the nuclear dispute.    Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan conferred with Mun in an  unscheduled meeting, confiding that his country had been  advising Pyongyang to resolve the issue through dialogue and  compromise. "We have already informed the United States and  South Korea that North Korea, too, is interested in a peaceful  resolution," Tang said.    Though no conclusive assurance was obtained, the two parties  seem to have reached a tentative agreement on exchanging top  party leaders in the foreseeable future.    "Since the two countries' relations are very good, I  personally expect one of our senior leaders could visit Seoul  before the end of this year," said Li Shuzheng, head of the  Chinese Party's International Liaison Department.    Li made the remarks in the presence of Mun while seeing him  off for Xian at the Beijing Airport. He is said to have  conferred with Kim Il-song during a visit to Pyongyang last  February. If a high-ranking leader actually visits Seoul, it  could be either President Jiang, Premier Li Peng or a Party  Standing Committee member, Li said.    South Korea's DLP originally hoped that a leading Chinese  party official would reciprocate Mun's visit, followed by DLP  Chairman Kim Chong-pil's trip to Beijing toward the end of the  year. But the Chinese party has been circumspect about the  matter, apparently in view of its half-century of amicable  relations with the Workers' (Communist) Party of North Korea.    Mun's visit also showed that China attaches greater  significance than Korea thought to the Seoul-Beijing summit last  March. "We could confirm that with the summit as momentum, the  Seoul-Beijing distance has narrowed significantly while  Pyongyang's weight in Chinese foreign relations has been  dwindling," said an official who accompanied Mun to Beijing.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / How To Spend It: A cracking choice  - Lucia van der Post tests designer trees, pulls tasteful crackers and examines inventive alternatives to paper streamers and battered baubles CRACKERS go on getting better and better. Times were when to find a cracker that one could bear to look at, let alone one which made the spirits soar, meant a trek to decorator shops whose stock-in-trade was chic and which had a vested interest in keeping up taste levels - with prices to match. These days the wares offered by even the humblest chain store have vastly improved. BhS, for instance, offers miniature crackers in good plain colours like silver, red, green or gold, at just Pounds 2.99 for 12 and grown-up sized ones filled with Belgian chocolates, at Pounds 2.99 each. But for those who want something a little different there are several companies that will do crackers to order. Minds Eye Crackers sells crackers which you can fill yourself. A set of six in green, red and gold, costs just Pounds 5.99 and comes complete with a joke and hat to add to the present you choose. Find them in in most good stores - Harrods, House of Fraser, John Lewis, Selfridges, Hamleys, WH Smith and more. Completely Crackers offers what you might call a bespoke cracker service. There are nine designs from which you choose first the look and then the filling. Presents include such things as pot-pourri, beeswax candle, a natural sponge or sunglasses. Standard crackers are Pounds 21.95 for six, luxury ones (presents like a rosewood box, pewter photo frame) Pounds 24.95 for six. From Completely Crackers, Mandara House, 56 High Street, Pewsey, Wiltshire, SN9 5AQ. Tel: 0672-63229. Designer Crackers offer 17 designs, all hand-made, ranging from The Businessman's (made from the FT, what else?) to Glitz at the Ritz (day-glo colours and sparkles). Choose the fillers from a comprehensive list - finest Belgian chocolates, bottle openers, cufflinks, tape measures, finger puppets and the like.

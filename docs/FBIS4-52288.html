			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 6 KYODO -- Japan will soon reply to  U.S. demands for further proposals to reduce its heavy trade  surplus, Japan's trade minister promised U.S. Commerce Secretary  Ron Brown in a meeting in Warsaw on Friday [6 May].    Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro  Hata and Brown had a brief talk while they were here for a  meeting of economic, industry and trade ministers from the Group  of Seven (G-7) industrialized states and 10 former East Bloc  nations.    Brown expressed a wish to reach a common understanding with  Japan on the three points raised by U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor in Marrakech last month -- that Japan take steps  on both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels and set "objective  criteria" to reduce its trade surplus, Japanese officials said.    Such an understanding is a prerequisite to the resumption of  talks with Japan on a new bilateral trade framework, the U.S.  secretary said, according to the officials.    Hata replied that he understands the importance of the three  points and Japan wishes to see the issue settled in a way that  would not lead to "managed trade," the officials said.    The Japanese minister indicated that efforts will be made to  resume the trade framework talks ahead of an upcoming summit  meeting of the G-7 countries in Naples, Italy, in July.    In a separate meeting with Russian Deputy Premier Aleksandr  Shokhin the same day, Hata said Japan will continue support for  Russia in its efforts for reform.</p>

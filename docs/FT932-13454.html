			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Drugs industry attacks policy GOVERNMENT POLICY towards the drugs industry was strongly attacked yesterday by the Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, Paul Abrahams writes. Mr Stewart Siddall, association president, said the extension of the list of products for which the National Health Service would not pay had come as a 'real bombshell'. He warned: 'Some companies will be profoundly damaged. I have correspondence from one company which could lose all of its sales.' The proposals, which had come without warning, could affect about Pounds 400m in annual sales. The UK pharmaceutical industry generated exports of Pounds 3m last year, four times more than Japan. Yet spending on medicines a head in the UK was half that in in Germany, France and Italy, he said.</p>

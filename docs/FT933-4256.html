			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: TNT losses mount as directors quit TNT, the Australian transport group which saw five directors resign last week after a boardroom disagreement, yesterday announced an operating loss after tax and abnormal items of ADollars 256.7m (USDollars 171.1m) for the year ended June, on an equity-accounted basis. This compares with a ADollars 195.4m deficit 12 months earlier. However, the large loss stemmed partly from some sizeable abnormal items. TNT said that its operating loss before these items, but after tax, stood at ADollars 44.7m, compared with a loss of Dollars 100m in 1991-92. Before tax, the company made a small operating profit of ADollars 14.2m, in contrast to last time's deficit of ADollars 75m. Last year TNT's revenues fell from ADollars 6.06bn, to ADollars 5.52bn. The company said this was due to the flotation of TNT Freight-ways in February 1992, and the creation of the international express delivery business GD Express Worldwide as a joint venture in October 1991. Abnormal items, after tax, amounted to ADollars 212m, up from ADollars 95.4m in the previous year. Included in these charges were a write-down of future income tax benefits, to comply with a new accounting standard; unrealised foreign currency losses; provisions related to the carrying value of the Sydney Monorail, and a further, previously-announced provision related to GD Express Worldwide. TNT announced yesterday that Mr Morley Koffman had resigned from the board due to personal commitments and his inability regularly to attend board meetings in Australia, although he will remain non-executive chairman of TNT Canada. Mr Morley Koffman is the sixth director to quit recently. Last week, Sir Peter Abeles, TNT's co-founder, and four other board members left after a disagreement about future company strategy.</p>

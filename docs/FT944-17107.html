			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: State of grace may prove fleeting - New York Wall Street may have had a lucky break with last week's employment figures. But concerns over interest rates are still lurking just below the surface as the quarterly results season gets under way this week. 'It's going to be a classic tug of war between rising interest rates and superlative earnings,' says Mr Steven Einhorn, head of equity research at Goldman Sachs in New York. The stage was set on Friday, when the jobs data proved to be inconclusive. Still, after so much hand-wringing ahead of the report, there was enough mollifying news to allow equity investors to squint at the awkward bits. In the end, it was the realisation that the Federal Reserve would not put up interest rates immediately that carried the day and averted the hammering which many had feared. The headline figure - a weaker than expected gain of 239,000 in non-farm payrolls - caused the Fed to hold its fire, at least until after considering this week's flood of economic reports. As a result, bonds improved and stocks appreciated after a week of steady declines. Friday's state of grace, if it can be characterised as such, may prove fleeting. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond is just a shade below the 8.00 per cent level, a red flag for investors. 'The likelihood of the long bond yield moving above 8.00 per cent and of staying there increases the more the Fed delays,' say J. P. Morgan analysts in their October market briefing. With a sixth interest rate increase looming: 'Wouldn't it be nice if the market could focus on earnings?' asks Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. He is not alone in the opinion that many companies will show solid improvement for the quarter. Mr Johnson goes a little further than some in predicting plenty of pleasant surprises, based on stronger than expected exports by US companies to recovering European markets. 'That will be good for stocks provided we don't get blind-sided by bad inflation or interest rate news,' he says. He sees the September data on producer and consumer prices, due out at the end of the week, as the key. He expects both inflation readings to be tame, allowing the bond market to stabilise, or even improve. 'If that proves to be the case, then the stock market could focus on what really counts and we could move higher,' says Mr Johnson. Mr Einhorn is less certain, however. 'My sense is that the market will remain stuck for the next month or two,' the Goldman Sachs analyst says. 'It will have some upward bias but it will be constrained in that bias by the level and likely direction of short-term interest rates.'</p>

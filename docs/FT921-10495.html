			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Miti calls for an end to frequent design changes JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry has asked electronic goods manufacturers to cut the number of times they redesign their products, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Frequent model changes do not benefit consumers, use up natural resources and lengthen working hours, a Miti official said yesterday. Makers change models of videotape recorders and air-conditioners about once every six months while cordless telephones and word processors get a face-lift every few months. Competition between electronics makers for market share and the hefty appetite of Japanese consumers have led to a frenzy of model changes. 'Consumers have to buy new products because they often can't get hold of parts for broken ones,' Mr Hiroko Ota,a social and economic analyst, told the daily Sankei Shimbun yesterday.</p>

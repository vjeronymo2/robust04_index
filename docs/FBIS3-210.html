Addressing a kwaZulu legislative assembly caucus meeting in  Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi said: "We need to separate the kingdom of  kwaZulu from the rest of South Africa."    "If this can be done through a constitutional principle in  the 1993 Constitution then we will entertain constitutional  amendments to this effect."    If the African National Congress and the SA Government went  ahead with the April poll without the Zulu king's demands being  met, "the kwaZulu government cannot be held responsible for the  anger of the Zulu nation".    Mr Buthelezi made no mention of his talks with ANC [African  National Congress] President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday at which  he agreed to consider registering the IFP for South Africa's  first all-race elections in April.    Repeating his rejection to recent constitutional  concessions,  the IFP president said these did not even begin to address  demands for exclusive provincial powers, autonomous regional  taxing powers, and the protection and guarantee of regional  constitutions against arbitrary decisions of the constituent  assembly.    King Goodwill Zwelithini was demanding formal recognition  and  constitutional accommodation of the kingdom of kwaZulu, he  added. Furthermore, the constitution had to make provision for  the "establishment of a constitution by the provincial  legislature of kwaZulu/Natal which shall recognise and protect  the institution, status and role of the king of the Zulus, the  kingdom of kwaZulu and the traditional leaders as well as their  powers with regard to indigenous laws, customs, culture,  language and land tenure system".    The "intractable" problem concerning the problem of King  Zwelithini and the kingdom of kwaZulu could not be resolved  through amending sections of the present constitution, but  through a constitutional principle only. The new constitutional  principle on self-determination was not compatible with the  king's demands, said Mr Buthelezi.    "The position of our government regarding the failure of the  SA Government and the ANC to accommodate our reasonable demands  remains exactly the same as before.    "To deny the citizens of kwaZulu the right to  self-determination is a savage attempt to strip us of our  cultural heritage, to belittle the traditional importance of his  majesty the king of the Zulus, and to eradicate all evidence of  our Zulu existence."    Mr Buthelezi again slammed the ANC for "manipulating" the  constitutional process to subject Zulus to the "illegitimate  sovereignty of the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance without our  consent, without these people having defeated us, and against  our will".    "As far as his majesty the king is concerned, elections in  kwaZulu can only take place once this issue of sovereignty has  been resolved."    The Zulu nation was demanding an end to the illegitimate  domination of its territory, said Mr Buthelezi, and "what the  king is demanding is not so wild when one has been watching the  ease with which the (State President F W) de Klerk government  has just handed back Walvis Bay to Namibia".</p>

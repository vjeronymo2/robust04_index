			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / BNP plans a share split BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), the largest of France's state-controlled banks, yesterday took a step towards its privatisation this autumn by announcing plans for a two-for-one scrip issue to make its shares more marketable. Meanwhile, the French economics ministry said it had appointed Lazard Freres, one of the most prominent Paris investment banks, as the government adviser on BNP's privatisation. The government yesterday also appointed Banque Indosuez, a subsidiary of the Suez holding company, as its adviser for the sale of Rhone-Poulenc, the public sector chemicals company to be privatised at the same time as BNP. Rhone-Poulenc and BNP are the first candidates for sale in the French privatisation drive, which is one of the most ambitious programmes in Europe and could involve the sale over the next two years of as many as 21 state-controlled companies worth up to FFr360bn (Pounds 40bn). BNP yesterday said that the scrip issue, whereby investors will be given two new shares for each existing share, was intended to improve the shares' liquidity, making them easier to trade. The issue, which will be submitted to shareholders for approval at BNP's next investors' meeting on September 17, will double the number of shares in circulation by halving the nominal value of each share. Scrip issues are becomingly more common in France, where the nominal value of shares tends to be higher than in the US or the UK. Rhone-Poulenc last month announced plans for a four-for-one share split as part of its strategy of streamlining its share structure in preparation for privatisation. LVMH, the luxury goods group, which is already publicly quoted, also recently split its shares. The next stage in BNP's privatisation will be the launch early next month of the strategy devised by Mr Michel Pebereau, the French banker who was two months ago drafted in as chairman. Mr Pebereau, who was chief executive of the Credit Commercial de France banking group at the time of its 1987 privatisation, has been mapping out his strategy. He will present his proposals to BNP's staff in early September and to shareholders at the September 17 meeting.</p>

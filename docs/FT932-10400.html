			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Skiing without tears for Anglophones in the Alps - A business that has found a niche on the ski slopes WHEN YOU are young and single and learning to ski, it does not matter what your ski instructor says to you as long as he is young, good-looking and skis like a dream. There comes a point, though, when you realise that you need some good lessons. But good, affordable teaching in English in the Alps is scarce. That is a niche filled by Sue and Kenny Dickson, their partner Alan Hole and their school, Ski Masterclass. Two years ago, Sue and Kenny were offering private lessons in Aviemore. Like Alan, they have been qualified ski instructors for 25 years and taught mostly in the UK. They met in St Anton in 1991 where, Sue says, they 'all had the same idea at once': setting up an English-language school in the Alps. For Sue and Kenny, it was the perfect time to go abroad, their three children had grown up and left home. They decided on Courchevel 1850 where Alan had worked briefly the previous year. It has, Sue says, 'ideal teaching terrain'. Courchevel offers a vast skiing area at high altitude and is popular with British skiers. In spring 1991 they gained the French instructors' diploma. They started teaching in December but without the priority access to ski-lifts and free lift passes enjoyed by instructors from the Ecole de ski Francais. The business cost little to set up. The three rented flats for the season and bought matching ski suits. They sold lessons from the reception area of the Ski Lodge, a hotel in Courchevel 1850 run by the British tour company Ski Activity, mostly to Ski Activity's clients. The three also visited other tour operators' chalets on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings to fill spare places. Classes were limited to eight compared with a supposed maximum of 12 at the ESF. There is no shortage of qualified ski instructors in France where there are 42 alternative ski schools in addition to the ESF. Outsiders find it difficult to break into the local monopoly. The local mairie controls concessions and looks after the interests of local businesses and ski schools. In Courchevel, Masterclass was competing with the ESF and Ski Cocktail, an independent ski school. 'We took a lot of trade from both as neither had British ski instructors,' says Alan. Demand was so great that Masterclass needed more English-speaking instructors. It also needed an office and a shop to rent out equipment and to sell clothes from Kenny and Sue's shop in Aviemore. At the end of the first season, Masterclass was approached by Wendy Parrott, a former ski company rep, and her fiance Jean-Yves Lapeyrere, whose company Wavehill International ran Ski Cocktail's ski schools and shops in Courchevel, Meribel and Meribel-Mottaret. Ski Cocktail was struggling in Courchevel. Lapeyrere offered to invest in Masterclass. This would entitle Masterclass to the same same privileges as Ski Cocktail which had won equal status with ESF after court actions by Lapeyrere against Meribel's mairie and ski-lift company. The five founded a holding company - Auld Alliance SA. Lapeyrere owns 51 per cent of the shares, but Alan, Sue and Kenny are in charge and enjoy better administrative back-up and more capital. They call themselves Ski Masterclass. Wendy, who is a shareholder, runs the shop, rented for FFr100,000, (Pounds 12,500) close to the main lift station. 'Having to buy all the equipment for the shop from scratch was a bit of a shock,' says Sue. They had to buy far more equipment than they anticipated, ending up with 150 pairs of skis and bindings and 100 pairs of boots. They expect to spend FFr170,000 a year on replacing equipment. Equipment rental should bring in about FFr450,000. This season a fourth instructor Dave Renoulf and a full-time equipment technician joined. Most bookings come through the shop, but on Saturday and Sunday the instructors still go to the Ski Lodge and to Courchevel 1650 to take bookings, communicating frantically with Wendy in the shop over a walkie-talkie. Masterclass offers five different two hour group classes for adults at FFr600. 'It's more expensive than the ESF, but we teach in English and only have eight in a group,' says Alan. Private tuition costs FFr400 for the first person and FFr200 per extra person up to a maximum of four people. This season, Masterclass is turning clients away and lessons should bring in some FFr750,000 which is on target. Sue believes that Masterclass has been too small to be affected by the recession, but admits people are buying less ski-wear than she had hoped. Kenny says the aim is to grow the business through off-piste courses, race camps, touring and children's classes. The main problem is finding British instructors qualified to teach in France. However, he expects a standard European qualification to be implemented from May 1993, which would allow more British instructors to teach. It is a relatively straightforward business and there have been few problems. All the instructors apart from Kenny - who is trying valiantly - speak fluent French and relations with the local ESF are good. Masterclass has full third party insurance cover: an instructor's worst nightmare is causing injury to a client. Judging from the lessons I attended, it seems more likely to be the other way round. Total turnover for the 17 week trading period is expected to FFr1.2m. After salaries have been paid, it does not leave a lot but, as Sue says, 'it's comfortable'. The environment is one compensation. As one of the instructors said, gesturing at the mountains basking in the sunlight, 'this is my office.'

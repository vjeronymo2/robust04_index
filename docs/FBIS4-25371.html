			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ella Lee] </F>   [Text] Legislators yesterday said press freedom would be  taken away if the government carried out a proposal to ban  disclosing information about an investigation.    As a part of the Organised and Serious Crimes Bill and  Criminal Procedures (Amendment) Bill 1992, the government  proposed it be made an offence to disclose information likely to  "prejudice" any investigation. The law would be restricted to  an investigation which could lead to conviction resulting in a  minimum fine of $20,000 and a year in jail.    The deputy solicitor-general, Robert Allcock, told the  Legislative Council group studying the amendment that the ban  could help to avoid any tip-off to the person under  investigation.    Legislators feared that a new power prohibiting disclosure  of  investigation information would "go too far" against press  freedom and public interest. A legislator, Emily Lau proposed  that a separate clause should be put into the bill to state  reasonable grounds for information disclosure if it was in the  public interest.    Group members had reservations about the proposal to abolish  the requirement binding judges to warn juries to treat  "uncorroborated" evidence given by an accomplice "with caution."  Allcock said accomplices might have an interest of their own in  giving evidence against the defendant. However, the government  said the directions a judge would be compelled to make would be  so confusing as to make the law unworkable.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Roche to sell or close drugs research centre in Edinburgh A 280-employee drug development centre in Edinburgh is to close or be sold by its new owner, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company. Roche said yesterday: 'We are in the process of trying to sell it.' A decision would probably be made by the end of January whether a sale of all or part of the centre was possible or whether it would close. A closure would be a blow to the small Scottish pharmaceuticals research sector. The centre was acquired by Roche in May, when it bought Syntex, a Californian drugs company, for Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.23bn). The company said that employees at the Edinburgh centre, which conducts pre-clinical trials with potential drugs discovered at other parts of Syntex, would be free to apply for vacancies in Roche. The company has its own research centre in the UK, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, which employs about 300 people. Roche has said that it plans to cut 5,000 jobs worldwide from its pharmaceutical division following the integration of Syntex, including several hundreds at its Basle headquarters. Roche retains its Scottish manufacturing plant, at Dalry in Ayrshire, which makes vitamin C.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Analysis by Harry Carrel, Stuart Mather Gibson III, Julia </F> Miezejeski, and Kevin Sara: "LM Ericsson: A Strategic  Analysis".]    [Text]  <H5>  Company Overview </H5>   LM Ericsson is aiming to become a major systems supplier in  telecommunications. Behind this grand ambition are Ericsson's  three main areas of business:    -- It's AXE public switching systems    -- Its cellular business (Ericsson is the world leader in  cellular, with one of the most innovative systems)    -- Its MD110 business network system.    The company is hoping this combination will push it from a  second to a first-tier position in telecommunications. Ericsson  has a lot going for it, but the company has a long and difficult  road to travel before it realizes its ambition. The company  knows that all second-tier players have to try harder in today's  cut-throat telecom marketplace. Ericsson has been trying  harder, and has realized some admirable success, but it will  have to make difficult and uncomfortable decisions in the near  future, and allocate its resources very shrewdly, if it is going  to succeed.    In public telecommunications, the company has shown  remarkable resilience, emerging from a recessionary climate in  Europe and North America with the most impressive year in its  history: installing 7.1 million local AXE lines and 2.9 million  trunk lines in 1992. The company commands 13 percent of the  Western European market, 15 percent of the Eastern European  market, and 7 percent of the U.S. market (up from 2 percent in  1990), and has easily defended its 14 percent share of the  lively Chinese market and its 33 percent share of the Latin  American market.    In mobile communications, Ericsson has managed to maintain  its 40 percent world market share since the early 1980's, well  ahead of its closest competitor. The company leads with 58  percent of the European market, holds third place in North  America with 20 percent of the market, and commands 40 percent  of the Latin American market. Ericsson is the only manufacturer  to have developed systems for all the three international  standards (U.S.A., Europe and Japan), guaranteeing it universal  acceptance. Mobile communications order booking in 1992 jumped  58 percent from 1991, and the company remains at the forefront  of system and product development.    Even Ericsson's PBX [private branch exchange] business,  which  has experienced sporadic ups and downs over the years, managed  to increase sales by 31 percent in 1992, owing largely to  increased sales activity in China. The company installed 1  million lines in 1992 and now has a total of 6 million lines  installed worldwide.    The company has successfully rationalized its worldwide  manufacturing; has restructured its organization, entrusting  core competencies (technology development and marketing) to its  regional operations; and has successfully undertaken  company-wide cost-cutting measures. These factors have all  contributed to its recent impressive results. The company  reported a profit of SEK428 million [Swedish kronor] (US$60  million) in first-quarter 1993 compared with a loss of SEK363  million (US$51 million) for the same period in 1992, and its  order backlog was the highest in its history. (The exchange  rate used throughout this report is SEK7.1 = US$1.)    Ericsson has aggressively pursued research and development.  The company delivered its ISDN [Integrated Services Digital  Network] and Intelligent Network (IN) products in 1992,  continues to develop the transport network products (ETNA) that  it introduced in 1991, and is pushing forward with its  operations and support systems (TMOS) and ATM-based  [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] research. However, this commitment  to R&amp;D has had its cost. The company spent 16 percent of its  sales on R&amp;D in 1992 in the face of a drop of 46 percent in  net  income for the same period. This Herculean effort, however,  pales beside competitors such as Siemens, whose net R&amp;D  commitment for the same period (11 percent of its sales) was  over three times Ericsson's.    Ericsson has entered into strategic alliances with  Televerket  (the Swedish PTT), General Electric, Hewlett Packard, and Texas  Instruments. These alliances have provided Ericsson with  resources that would otherwise be unavailable to it, but this  too has had its cost. Ericsson does not own any of the  technology developed in these alliances, and in the increasingly  interrelated world of telecommunications has found itself  sleeping with strange bedfellows. For example, Ericsson has a  joint venture with Toshiba to install and service cellular  telephony in Japan. Toshiba also has an alliance with Motorola  (Ericsson's arch-rival in mobile communications) to develop  DRAMS [dynamic random access memory]. Motorola and Ericsson  entered into a joint licensing agreement for their GSM [Global  Systems for Mobile Communications] patents. (Motorola entered  into similar agreements with Cellnet in the U.K. , Alcatel,  Siemens, and with Ericsson's French partner, Matra.) Ericsson's  mobile partner in the U.S.A., General Electric, is developing  network software for Motorola's IRIDIUM project. Obviously, all  of this partnering can lead to some sensitive situations.    It is not uncommon for telecom players to team together,  especially in increasingly costly R&amp;D. However, Ericsson does  not have the capital resources of its competitors to build on  this teamwork to deploy proprietary technology that could yield  strong strategic advantages. For Ericsson, all this  collaboration is only keeping it in the game. The company has  also "given away" some of its more impressive technology, as  when it licensed its PBX portable business phone to its  arch-rival Siemens (and, by extension, to Rolm). No doubt  Ericsson will come up against its own technology in its  competitors' hands when it vies for critical contracts in the  U.S.A. and Mexico (crucial and precarious markets for the  company).    Ericsson is a company known for responding to the  marketplace, not for dominating it. The company is gambling  that the merger of public switching, mobile telephony, and  private networks will place an increased emphasis on networks  and software applications. In this scenario, hardware becomes  increasingly less important. This may explain why the company  has maintained a single product line for so many years. This  approach to the market requires substantial and sustained  R&amp;D --  something the company cannot afford.    Entering joint ventures and sharing R&amp;D costs with  customers  is a clever way of dealing with the situation, but it is not the  policy of a technology innovator and leader. Also, what is to  deter Ericsson's competitors from doing the same? They  certainly have the resources. In short, Ericsson's approach has  its short-term advantages, but it must be questioned as a  long-term strategy.    Ericsson's most recent successes are to a great extent the  result of the company's historic ability to move into new  markets quickly, not necessarily because of its technological  innovation. The company's impressive performance in China is in  response to a huge new market. The company's success in Eastern  Europe, particularly in the former East Germany, is again in  response to a new market. The company's advances in Spain,  Mexico, and Australia are primarily the result of the expansion  and revitalization of networks in regions where the company has  an established presence. In mobile telephony, the company has  seen increased orders in expanding markets: China, Southeast  Asia, and Eastern and Western Europe. But Ericsson has always  been a leader in mobile, and will take its fair share of any  expanding market.    The company's "systems house" approach (whereby Ericsson  transfers the latest technology from other computer and software  vendors to PTTs [Post, Telegraph and Telephone Authorities],  providing customized products for its customers) has already  begun to bear fruit in the U.S.A. The company has gained  acceptance with five of the RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating  Companies] and MCI. Ericsson's sales in the U.S.A. decreased in  1992 primarily due to severe price pressure -- a difficult pill  to swallow for a company without the large resources of its  competitors. Mobile sales have shifted from the U.S.A., which  had been the company's major market for cellular telephony, to  Europe over the past three years. Europe now accounts for 43  percent of Radio Communications sales, while the U.S.A. accounts  for 29 percent (down from 42 percent two years ago).    Ericsson's new attempt to enter the U.S. market is proving  difficult. The U.S.A. is one of the most demanding markets in  the world, and is undergoing dramatic changes. Even Siemens,  with all its muscle, is finding it difficult to get its  bearings. Ericsson must succeed this time in the U.S.A. if it  is to fulfill its ambition and move up to the first tier of  telecom suppliers. It remains to be seen if Ericsson can do it  alone. The company tacitly acknowledged the difficulty when it  entered into joint ventures with GE and, recently, Hewlett  Packard; but these alliances are concentrated in niche markets.  It is also interesting to note that Ericsson is buying out its  partners in these ventures (it has increased its holdings in  both), suggesting that the company views these alliances as  short term.    The company's ace in the hole is its mobile telephony  operations. Ericsson has effectively parlayed its advantage here  into public switching, and is trying to do the same with private  networks with its mobile business phone. In the short term,  Ericsson can continue to take advantage of the expanding markets  to push its mobile technology. However, this is not going to  guarantee Ericsson a place at the table. Ericsson will need a  strong partner to ultimately succeed in the U.S.A., and if the  company is to make a stand in public switching and PBX in the  recently liberalized markets, it will need something more than  innovative mobile telephony. It will need the financial muscle  to stand firm against increasing competition and pursue its  proprietary R&amp;D. It will need resources that we do not  currently see on the company's balance sheet to develop and  deploy a global technology embracing mobile, public switching,  and private networks. We do not suggest that the company's  recent successes are not representative of long-term growth, but  they are better viewed as a reward for being a shrewd player in  the right place at the right time. In the current unsettled  telecom environment, only companies with a clear vision of the  future and ample resources will succeed.    Ericsson has the vision, and the company is a survivor. We  do not question its ability to remain a formidable player in  telecoms, but we do question its ability, within the confines of  its present resources, to move itself up to the first tier of  telecom suppliers without help. Until then, the company will  have to resign itself to enjoying a seat near, but not at, the  head of the table. Perhaps it was said best back in 1923 by B.  Wahlqvist, an employee of Ericsson in Spain, who remarked after  Ericsson lost the Spanish concession to ITT: "...as you see,  there should be no shortage of work for some time. The  question, apparently, is how to find the capital to join in the  competition."  <H5>  Business Areas </H5>   Until year-end 1992, Ericsson had six business area (BAs):    -- Public Telecommunications    -- Radio Communications    -- Business Communications    -- Cable and Networks    -- Components    -- Defense Systems    In January 1993, these BAs were reduced to five. Cable and  Networks was split, with cable operations merged into Components  and networks operations merged into Business Communications to  form a new business area, Business Networks. Of the six  business areas operating in 1992, all but two (Components and  Defense Systems) were directly and exclusively involved in  telecommunications.    In 1992, the four BAs exclusively engaged in  telecommunications accounted for 94.7 percent of the company's  sales. This ratio has remained relatively constant for the past  three years. In 1990, these four BAs accounted for 94.9 percent  of sales. The company's decision to concentrate on those  activities directly related to its core business --  telecommunications -- made in 1986, when these four BAs  accounted for only 85 percent of sales, has remained unchanged.  The recent reduction in the number of BAs to five is a further  indication of the company's dedication to this strategy; the  reduction further consolidates the corporate organization within  the company's core business.    To further distinguish it from its competitors, Ericsson is  for all practical purposes a single-product company centered  around the AXE public switch. The AXE was introduced 20 years  ago, and the company has continued to develop new products based  upon the AXE's core platform. The company's cellular systems  are also based upon the AXE platform. While this focused  product line has allowed the company to streamline operations,  particularly manufacturing (the AXE is modular and is  manufactured in "mother" plants and then shipped to assembly  plants around the world for installation), and offers economies  of scale unavailable to most of its competitors, it also  presents risks. The failure of any key component, a delay in  delivering new products based on core technology, or a serious  manufacturing glitch can have far-reaching implications for the  company.    The two business areas (BAs) not directly related to the  company's core business (Components and Defense Systems) have  been retained for strategic purposes. Components is engaged in  the development of advanced microcircuits and components. Most  of the development is done in cooperation with U.S.-based Texas  Instruments. The investment necessary to develop advanced  microelectronics is beyond Ericsson's resources. Therefore,  this teaming with TI has guaranteed the company access to the  necessary customized technology and large-scale production  facilities critical to its public switching and cellular  businesses. The Components BA is also constructing a  manufacturing plant for small-scale production for new products  during their start-up phase. In 1992, 59 percent of Components  sales were to other Ericsson business areas.    Defense Systems provides radar, systems computers, and  display equipment, primarily to the Swedish and Norwegian  Defense Forces. This is a niche market in which the company has  been involved for many years. In addition, the Defense Systems  BA is engaged in R&amp;D related to digital mobile telephony,  high-frequency radio technology, and broadband communications.  This R&amp;D is "purchased" by other business areas.    Public Telecommunications accounted for 36 percent of  Ericsson's sales and 36 percent of its 1992 profits. Radio  Communications accounted for 32 percent of the company's sales  and 39 percent of 1992 profits. The third largest BA, Cable and  Networks, accounted for 14 percent of 1992 sales and 11 percent  of profits. Business Communications, the fourth-largest BA,  accounted for 13 percent of company sales, but just 9 percent of  profits. Components accounted for 2 percent of sales and 1  percent of profits.    Ericsson traditionally groups Public Telecommunications,  Radio Communications, Business Communications, and Components  into the category of "telecommunications systems", which it uses  in reporting its results. These systems accounted for 85  percent of the company's profits in 1992. This grouping is  somewhat misleading, since the company's Cable and Networks BA  was a serious element in the company's core business, but is not  included in this category. Ericsson obviously believes it  should be, as is evidenced by its decision in January 1993 to  divide this business area among two other BAs that are included  in "telecommunications systems." When the Cable and Networks BA  is added to the company's telecommunications systems, these  systems account for 96 percent of Ericsson's sales and Profits.  <H5>  Financial Analysis </H5>   After entering the 1990s with record sales and profits,  Ericsson has hit a rough patch in the road. Sales remained flat  from 1990 to 1991, and profits dropped from SEK3,450 million  (US$486 million) in 1990 to SEK886 million (US$125 million) in  1991. Sales increased slightly in 1992, but profits declined to  SEK479 million (US$67 million). Over this same period,  Ericsson's debt ratio has been increasing and liquidity has been  deteriorating.    While Ericsson could obviously use the help of a strong  financial partner, especially for tough-to-crack markets like  the U.S.A., the company's financial position is not  catastrophic. Order bookings are at record levels, and the  company, with its streamlined global product line, is well  positioned to ride any upswing of economic activity in its major  markets.    It should be noted that the Swedish krona lost some 20  percent of its value against major international currencies when  it was allowed to float in the fourth quarter of 1992.  According to Ericsson, the change in exchange rates will have  little immediate effect on Ericsson's financial position because  its operations are fully hedged, and because international  clients are billed in local currencies. The long-term  consequences of the devaluation will be largely beneficial to  Ericsson: Sweden, its home market and the site of its  manufacturing "mother" plants and main R&amp;D facilities, is  emerging as a low-cost zone, compared to the situations of  competitors such as Alcatel and Siemens, whose core operations  are based in "strong" currency countries, i.e., France and  Germany.  <H5>  Ericsson's Private Networks Business </H5>   Ericsson has been shepherding its Business Communications  business area for some time. In 1985, Business Communications  represented 31 percent of Ericsson's sales and had an operating  income of SEK806 million (US$113.5 million). By 1987, Business  Communications had reduced its work force by 8,000 employees and  its operating income loss to SEK2 million (US$281,700). Yet it  still accounted for 29 percent of Ericsson's sales. In 1988,  the BA restructured, selling 80 percent of its Data Systems  Division to Nokia and all of its Office Equipment Division to  Design Function A/S. It also announced that it would shift  production of its telephone instruments from Sweden to Southeast  Asia.    1988 marked a watershed for Business Communications. While  it now accounted for only 11 percent of Ericsson's sales (most  of what it gave up, Mobile Communications took over), it was  holding its own and showing some encouraging signs of growth.  The BA's sales jumped 28 percent in 1989. Through  manufacturing rationalization and clever marketing, it managed  to maintain 23 percent growth in 1990. It suffered a loss in  1991 (-23 percent growth) under increased price pressure and a  weak economic climate, but went on to increase sales by 31  percent in 1992, despite a continued tough economic environment.  It appeared that the company had finally found the right  formula for Business Communications; yet in January 1993, the  company undertook the most radical restructuring of the BA to  date.    In Northern Business Information's 1991 report on Ericsson,  we asked if the company would do better to direct its limited  resources to Public Telecommunications, Radio Communications,  and Cable and Networks; casting off Business Communications.  Ericsson obviously disagreed, and has regrouped its resources  from Business Communications and Cable and Networks into a new  business area -- Business Networks. The company claims that  this new BA is a reflection of the corporate-wide restructuring  that it undertook in 1991. However, the synergies that the  company expects the restructuring to yield are not readily  apparent, and we cannot but wonder if the company is  reorganizing, as it has in the past, in preparation for a  spin-off of the new BA.    Business Networks consists of the Business Communications BA  plus the networks part of the Cable and Networks BA. Cable was  spun off from Cable and Networks to the Components BA. The new  Business Networks BA has seven business units:    -- MD110 Communication Systems with 4,500 employees and  SEK3,399 million (US$478.7 million) in sales (1992);    -- Small Business Systems with 1,200 employees and SEK1,010  million (US$142.3 million) in sales (1992);    -- Data Networks with 700 employees and SEK686 million  (US$96.5 million in sales (1992);    -- Business Mobile Data Networks with 300 employees and  SEK29  million (US$4.1 million) in sales (1992);    -- Fiber Optics with 90 employees and SEK132 million  (US$18.6  million) in sales (1992);    -- Network Engineering with 2,600 employees and SEK1,382  million (US$194.6 million) in sales (1992);    -- Ericsson Engineering with 4,200 employees and SEK2,865  million (US$403.5 million) in sales (1992).    The MD110 Communication Systems, Small Business Systems, and  Data Networks business units were part of the former Business  Communications BA. Business Mobile Data Networks was originally  a Major Local Company reporting directly to corporate  headquarters in Stockholm. Business Mobile Networks, located in  the Netherlands, is responsible for the development,  manufacture, and sales of Ericsson's new Digital Cordless  Telephone system, DCT900 (Freeset). Part of Network Engineering  was transferred from the old Cable and Networks BA and merged  with the network company Ericsson Business Networks, AB, which  was originally part of the old Business Communications BA, to  create the new Network Engineering business unit. Fiber Optics  consists of the hardware units (opto welding, terminal products,  and sensor systems) from the original Network Engineering and  the Optical Network Research Center, Ericsson Sielte is an  Italian subsidiary (Ericsson Sielte S.p.A.) originally  associated with Cable and Networks and engaged in traditional  network operations in Italy and other countries.    The new BA has 50 subsidiaries and affiliated companies  worldwide and is headed by Lars Berg, past head of the Cable and  Networks BA. Business Networks is intended to target a newly  defined customer base requiring system solutions that draw upon  the unique capabilities of the old BA and the synergies made  possible by the merger. Ericsson believes that the traditional  network activities of the network sector and the traditional  business communication activities of the Business Communications  BA can be combined to provide new kinds of services to a new set  of customers.    The new BA's ability to work with many customers competing  with traditional telecom operators in a limited market, to  provide a wide array of technical solutions, to function in a  decentralized and customer-oriented environment, and to deliver  unique solutions in short carry-through times will give it an  advantage over its competitors. However, the competition is  steep and the market is unsettled, with potential customers  viewing technology evolution as a reason for caution. Selling a  solution in this environment will put very serious demands on  Ericsson. How seriously the company considers the task ahead is  underscored by its delay in appointing a head to its new Network  Engineering business unit. This unit will include a special  function to deal with the identification of new customers and  markets for the entire BA. The company is looking for the right  manager, one who will be able to be creative and take a lot of  pressure. While the BA was formally created as of 1 January  1993, it is not expected to be completely functional until the  spring of 1993.    Business Communications has performed well. The MD110 is an  established product that has found strong acceptance with many  PTTs, including those in Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Mexico,  and the Netherlands. Of special interest is Telefonica's  (Spain) virtual private network utilizing the AXE and the MD110.  Ericsson maintains a strong presence in many parts of the  world. It increased sales in Germany, the U.K., Italy, and  Australia last year, even though it faced a very difficult  economic environment and increased price pressure. It has also  targeted China as a major market. Since its first major sale of  MD110 there in 1988, it has managed to keep up the pace, and now  commands 25 percent of the Chinese market. China is also  Ericsson's largest market for the MD110 in terms of volume, with  over 65,000 delivered lines. The company showed great  cleverness and determination in this all-important market; it  developed a special version of the MD110, the DRX1, which can be  used as a public exchange in rural areas while traditional  public networks are being built. After completion of the public  networks, the DRX1 can be quickly moved and installed elsewhere.    While Ericsson has held sixth place worldwide in PBX sales  for the past few years, it has shown itself to be a sly player.  Sales increased sharply last year (31 percent over 1991),  primarily due to sales of the MD110. Ericsson prides itself on  its direct customer experience and its ability to provide  advanced network applications.    As the division between PBX and public switching becomes  increasingly blurred, Ericsson sees an opportunity to parlay its  public switching presence into PBX sales. It did this in  Australia by setting up an ISDN network using eight AXE switches  and selling MD110s for business applications. The company's  recently announced collaboration with INTEL to develop  communications platforms allowing telephony, video  communication, and data transfer in a single "call" accessible  on a PC further underscores its determination to be a total  system provider. Of course it is not the only player with this  ambition, and it does not command the resources of many of its  competitors, but its global player status guarantees that it  will remain a competitive threat.    Mobile communications is probably the overriding reason for  Ericsson to stand firm in PBX. The company's undisputed global  presence and ambitions here permeate not only Business  Communications' (Business Networks') ambitions, but Ericsson's  overall global strategy as well. Ericsson is betting that the  mobile business communications market will take off as the  mobile residential and mobile public network markets did in the  1980's. The company premiered its digital cordless telephone,  the DCT900 (later renamed the Freeset), at the 1991 CeBIT trade  show. Soon after, it launched the product in Sweden, Brazil,  Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia. The  company also committed itself to a speedy adaptation to the  European DECT [Digital European Cordless Telecommunications]  standard, which was finally adopted in July 1992. However, in  an unusual twist, the company also "gave away" the technology by  entering into a joint marketing agreement with Siemens, giving  Siemens worldwide marketing rights to Freeset.    Ericsson has established itself as one of the major powers  in  mobile communications. It has created and maintained strong  positions in public cellular, paging, mobile radio, and mobile  data. The company commands a 40 percent world market share for  mobile telephone systems, and is a market leader in  analog-to-digital conversion. More importantly, Ericsson has  shrewdly merged its switching system with its cellular radio  systems and is doing the same for the MD110. For example the  company is participating in the preliminary work on PCS  (Personal Communications Systems) in the U.S.A., and is a  leading supplier of PCN (Personal Communication Networks) in the  U.K.    All the pieces are, therefore, in place for an impressive  global telecom network. Whether Ericsson can realize this on  its own remains to be seen. The increasing demands on the  company's R&amp;D budget could force it to seek an alliance with  Bosch or, more adventurously, with Northern Telecom. Of course,  any partnering would create its own set of problems. It would  upset the clean product line in place at Ericsson and the rapid  response possibly only in a company the size of Ericsson.  <H5>  Private Network Products </H5>   The MD110 is the core of Ericsson's private network product  line. Since being introduced in 1988, the company has installed,  or placed on order, over 6 million lines in over 50 countries.  Ericsson's BCS 90 line of business communications systems is  targeted for small organizations requiring up to 70 extensions.  The BCS 150 is another system, targeted for small to  medium-size businesses, that offers voice, data, messaging, and  information-handling capabilities. In March 1993, the company  announced interface capabilities between the MD110 and IBM's  CallPath Services Architecture (CSA), allowing full interface  between MD110 and IBM computer-based databases through the MD100  Applicationlink. In late 1992, the company announced similar  interface capabilities with Tandem's Call Applications Manager  (CAM) computer-to-switch interface. The company expanded its  relationship with vendors of network management products through  an agreement with Hewlett Packard to develop another network  management system. The company also announced in 1992 a new  accounts manager package for the ERIPAX X.25 wide area data  network system.    Ericsson is committed to developing the MD110 to the end of  the decade and beyond. The company regularly releases new  products and enhancements. In 1991, the company's worldwide  development organization released its second global product, BC  6.0, which was developed at the company's design centers in  California, Sweden, and Australia.    Ericsson's global approach to product development has  reduced  its costs and, more importantly, allowed it to introduce new  products in several new markets simultaneously. In 1992, the  company announced a new release for its business switch, BC 6.3.  The new release offered several additional services:    -- Extension Manager V.3 allows a telephone call to be  shifted from one extension to another from a personal computer  attached to the switch.    -- VAX Account allows a personal computer to complement a  larger VAX computer when maintaining accounts.    -- VAX Directory allows an operator to see on a computer  screen who has gone to lunch, is attending a meeting, etc.    -- ACD/MIS [Automatic Call Distribution/Management  Information System] Multisupervisor monitors queues of calls and  directs them in an economical way.    One of the advantages of the Ericsson product line is its  simplicity. It is a primary platform on which the company is  committed to developing new features and capabilities within a  migration strategy, allowing existing customers to upgrade to  new releases, features, and applications. The company has plans  for two new generations of products: BC 7 and BC 8.    Features planned for the BC 7 generation of products  (1993-1994) include:    -- 2B+D Trunk Interface (ETSI [European Telecommunications  Standards Institute] ISDN-compatible) as a private or public  interface;    -- Enhanced call center with new ACD functionality;    -- Enhanced integral RVA [Recorded Voice Announcement]  functions, including customer ID;    -- Voicemail, RVA integration with host computers,  application link providing voice banking, etc.;    -- Digital POTS [Plain Old Telephone Service];    -- DECT-standard cordless telephone support;    -- Widebank N*64K switching providing wideband applications  such as videoconferencing, LAN [Local Area Network]  connectivity, and multimedia applications;    -- Integral voice compression;    -- Premises broadband switching (25 gigabits).    Features planned for the BC 8 generation of products  (194-1995) include:    -- Universal network transparency;    -- Full ETSI/ISDN for voice, DAT [Digital Audio Tape], and  virtual networking;    -- ETSI/ISDN terminal interface;    -- New PC OP9 console and centralization of peripherals;    -- TAU 2680 data terminal.    The company has targeted vertical markets for the MD110,  developing application packages for one market and then  transferring them to other markets. The company's global R&amp;D  structure facilitates such an approach by allowing each market  to concentrate on its specific customer requirements, providing  new products as tested and successful (association selling).  The vertical markets targeted to date are:    -- Educational institutions    -- Municipalities    -- Banking and building societies    -- Utilities    -- Airlines    -- Financial institutions and services    -- Health authorities    -- The insurance industry    -- Retail marketing    -- Public transport  <H5>  Sales in Private Networks </H5>   Table 3 shows that private network sales dropped from  SEK5,106 million (US$719.2 million) in 1989 to SEK4,870 million  (US$686 million) in 1991, then rose to SEK6,293 million  (US$886.3 million) in 1992, a CAGR of 7.2 percent. The increase  in 1992 was primarily due to increased sales of the MD110; over  half of Business Networks' sales were for the MD110. In 1991,  Business Networks sales accounted for approximately 10 percent  of all of Ericsson's external sales. In 1992, the BA accounted  for 13 percent of the company's external sales. This is an  impressive accomplishment, especially since Business Networks  has confronted serious price pressure. 1992 performance was  also positively affected by the acquisition of majority interest  in the Austrian company Schrack, and by strong sales in Germany.    Business Networks saw its best sales performance in 1992 in  Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Mexico. China also proved to be a  fast-growing market. The company now holds a 25 percent market  share for PBX in China. The largest markets for the MD110 are  in Europe: Sweden (48 percent), Spain (44 percent), Italy (12  percent), the Netherlands (17 percent), and the U.K. (6  percent). The company also has a strong market presence in  Germany and Eastern Europe.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ericsson Private Network Sales by Product Line, 1989-1992 (SEK millions)     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sales by pr-|1989        |1990        |1991        |1992        |CAGR        |  |oduct Line: |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MD110       |2,910       |3,587       |2,873       |3,902       |10.3%       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other Subsc-|1,021       |1,259       |925         |1,133       |3.5%        |  |riber Excha-|            |            |            |            |            |  |nge         |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone I-|460         |566         |341         |441         |-1.4%       |  |nstruments  |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Data Networ-|357         |441         |390         |441         |7.2%        |  |ks          |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Other Produ-|357         |441         |341         |378         |1.8%        |  |cts         |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PBX and Rel-|4,340       |5,349       |4,252       |5,513       |8.3%        |  |ated Total  |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KTS Total   |306         |378         |278         |340         |3.5%        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Terminals T-|460         |566         |341         |441         |-1.4%       |  |otal        |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Private Net-|5,106       |6,293       |4,870       |6,293       |7.2%        |  |works Total |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Source: Northam Business Information Estimates)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The full report was published in July 1993 and contains a  detailed analysis of Ericsson's divisions, products, and  financial results.

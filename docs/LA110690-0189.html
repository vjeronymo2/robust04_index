			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CLEMSON TO PLAY IN TAMPA BOWL  </P> <P> The 18th-ranked Clemson Tigers have accepted an invitation to play in the Hall  of Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Day, two newspapers reported today.  </P> <P> The Tigers, 8-2 under first-year Coach Ken Hatfield, will probably take on  either Michigan or Illinois in the bowl.  </P> <P> Bowl bids do not go out officially until Nov. 24.  </P> <P> In opting for the Hall of Fame Bowl, the Tigers turned down a chance to play in  the inaugural Blockbuster Bowl, which pays up to $1.4 million as opposed to $1  million for the Hall of Fame. But other factors figured in Clemson's decision,  according to both the News of Greenville and the State of Columbia. Clemson  apparently wanted to play on New Year's Day and on national television. The  Hall of Fame is on Jan. 1 and will be televised by NBC. The Blockbuster is on  Dec. 28 and will be shown by Raycom.  </P></p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Banks set out Pounds 1.5bn rescue package for Euro Disney The Euro Disney banks have presented outline proposals for a FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) restructuring package to rescue the troubled leisure group. Walt Disney, its powerful US parent company, would bear half the cost of the restructuring. 'Disney got us into this mess and it's only fair that it should play its part in finding a way out,' said a senior banker involved in the rescue talks. 'It seems reasonable that if we put up half the money, Disney should stump up the rest.' Negotiations between the banks and the Disney companies began in earnest after the banks on Monday received the final version of an investigative audit of Euro Disney's finances commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group. KPMG has calculated that Euro Disney, which made a net loss of FFr5.3bn on turnover of FFr5.7bn in the financial year to September 30, will require a capital injection of FFr13bn to reduce its FFr20.3bn net debt to a manageable level. The group is in a dire financial state after struggling to service its debt at a time when its operations have been affected by the recession. Under the banks' proposal, Euro Disney would receive part of the FFr13bn through an injection of capital from a rights issue and, possibly, a debt-for-equity swap. The remainder would be provided indirectly by reducing its contractual payments to Walt Disney and the cost of servicing its loans. The package would involve Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, injecting half the FFr13bn by participating in the rights issue and significantly reducing its entitlement to management fees and royalties from Euro Disney. The banks would provide a similar amount by underwriting the rights issue, and possibly by swapping part of their debt for equity, and by agreeing to reduce the interest rates payable on some of their loans. The main sticking point is expected to be Disney's stance on royalties. It has already temporarily waived its entitlement to a management fee of 3 per cent of turnover which would have been worth FFr145m last year. It still receives royalties of 10 per cent of admissions and 5 per cent of food and merchandise sales that totalled FFr262m last year. The US group is understood to have accepted the principle of further concessions in these areas but is trying to limit the scale of the cuts. However, both camps are confident they will be able to find a solution by March 31, the deadline set by Disney. 'The numbers seem to add up and both sides really want to do this deal,' said one negotiator.</p>

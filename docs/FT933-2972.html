			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Lloyd's faces 'lingering demise': Gloomy forecast shows reinsurance failures helping to keep market in loss SYNDICATES at Lloyd's of London are suffering additional losses because of a number of failures of reinsurance companies, according to Chatset, the company which monitors the results of syndicates at the insurance market. Up to 40 syndicates have mentioned reinsurance failures as a contributing factor to losses in their accounts for 1990, according to Mr Oliver Carruthers, a Chatset consultant. Chatset believes that the insolvencies mean syndicates cannot claim in full on some reinsurance policies they had taken out and this could cost the market as much as Pounds 500m. News of the problem emerged when Chatset presented a gloomy assessment of the market's recent performance and prospects in its annual Lloyd's League Tables. Following losses of Pounds 2.9bn in 1990 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989, Chatset forecasts that Lloyd's will lose a further Pounds 1.5bn over the next two years when it reports results for 1991 and 1992. 'For 1992 we believe that another overall loss is inevitable,' Chatset said. 'The future for Lloyd's is bleak,' it added, saying that the market faced 'a lingering demise, going down with a whimper rather than a bang as Names are crushed'. Chatset is particularly gloomy about the weight of US asbestosis and pollution claims arising on policies underwritten up to 40 years ago. Lloyd's announced earlier this year that it is intending to transfer some of its reserves for claims on all policies underwritten before 1986 into a new reinsurance company, NewCo, effectively 'ring fencing' new investors from these liabilities. These reserves, which are contained in Lloyd's premium trust fund, amount to several billion pounds, but may need to be topped up because syndicates use different actuarial standards for setting reserves. Chatset has yet to carry out detailed work but says the shortfall could amount to between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 6bn. 'We believe that such a demand on current Names is unfeasible. At best those Names that have trade on will have to utilise their future profits to pay past losses, so we do not see a rosy future for existing Names,' said Chatset. Chatset say the ring fence must be strong enough to allow the Lloyd's policy to survive, but this is going to impose an 'intolerable' strain on the old Names. Lloyd's League Tables 1990.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Arkhipov: "They Raise a Ruckus But Are Not </F> Heard"]    [Text] St. Petersburg--St. Petersburg party leaders, having  failed spectacularly at the elections to the City Assembly and  hoping to make up for this at the fall elections, have engaged  in a search for their "political faces"--somehow in the spring  the voters were unable to see them clearly.    Of the 25 City Assembly members elected in April, only two  are "party" deputies. This is an achievement of multiparty  democracy in St. Petersburg. Which definitely shows that no  party structures have a real influence on political processes in  the city. At the microlevel, on the regional scale, even federal  parties, which distinguished themselves by an advertising blitz  on the threshold of 12 December, do not have enough symbolic  potential. And St. Petersburg, by the way, is not a provincial  town where "serious" politicians have yet to tread--it is the  "second capital," which many party builders call a political  testing ground for their initiatives. What is the cause of such  a flop?    As usual, the losers began summing up the results by looking  for someone to blame. They accused the authors of the rules of  the game, who set the signature collection threshold at a level  unsurmountable for some parties; they accused the city  authorities, who extended the elections by an extra day, which  destroyed the financial and tactical plans of party headquarters  staff; and they accused the Moscow party leadership, who had not  shown enough attention to St. Petersburg grass-roots cells...  Everybody got it.    Party functionaries have a much more difficult time  recognizing their own mistakes. Why, one would ask, did the  election campaign, which theoretically should have consolidated  party ranks, in reality result in complete confusion?    Before we answer this question we need to ask another: Was  there a boy? Essentially, all the parties in St. Petersburg are  imitations. It is hard to talk about them as structures  representing social movements or trends in political thought.  Formerly numerous political organizations in St. Petersburg  completely crumbled. Over the past half-year rallies and other  events have attracted between 10 and 50 people, which does not  come close even to attendance at Krishna-ite Saturday  processions. Movements have disappeared, their only  accomplishment being that several club organizations have  emerged in each part of the political spectrum. They did not  have enough time to form stable connections with the  corresponding sociocultural strata at the city level, remaining  merely relics of the times of political activism.    Ideological connections proved no more reliable, which also  is natural. It is hardly likely that narrow-ideology  organizations (and the liberal, social-democratic, communist,  and nationalist parts of the spectrum are represented by three  to five small structures) could solidly "cover" the  corresponding strata of the electorate. The mind of the city man  on the street does not identify them with broader and not  necessarily political preferences.    In addition, most party structures did their best to lose  their "political face." Their leaders assumed that if they  dissolved in hastily slapped-together electoral blocs and  acquired stereotype rhetoric on the subject of economic  "improvement," they would become more attractive to the  depoliticized population. Only the LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia] and the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian  Federation] escaped being merged into blocs of the most  unimaginable configurations; the rest scattered in every  direction. For instance, the Communists-Bolsheviks, the RKRP  [Russian Communist Workers Party], and Working Leningrad  disguised themselves as patriots in the Motherland bloc; the  Republicans, the SvDPR [Free Democratic Party of Russia], and  the SDPR [Social Democratic Party of Russia] split three ways...    Finally, there was a specific trait of local political  leadership that had an effect. The independence of "second  capital" politicians, traditional for this city, who often tried  to compete with the Moscow "stars," only weakened the old  personified image of parties. This special trait of the city  party elite defined, by the way, the style of political  interaction between various organizations. For instance,  "democrats" who knew each other from the National Front, now  finding themselves in some 15 different parties, made an effort  to retain the luggage of old interpersonal confrontation. For  them, discarding it meant crossing out their own political  biography, to be deprived of the indulgence to commit the sin of  independent "party organizational development."    Therefore, contrary to the hopes, the elections could not  systematize the political market in St. Petersburg and become a  beginning of organizational and ideological integration of party  structures--after taking into account the political needs of the  population.    Was there anything new in the behavior of the political  leaders after the unsuccessful elections? Nothing that is  principally new. Perhaps there are fewer "combiners" still  searching for a cover in the form of some bloc or another--some  have decided now to try their luck on their own.    Democratic Russia's obvious disintegration contributes to  sovereignization and the search for an individual "political  face." The elections have demonstrated the worth of its internal  strength and moral unity: Even a conference decision that  Democratic Russia is to participate only in the Democratic Unity  of St. Petersburg bloc was ignored by many party leaders. After  the elections Democratic Unity, on a shared basis with  like-thinkers from All Petersburg, began to put together  "Gaydar's party." And run into a problem again: Gaydar has  bequeathed the cell organization to Arsenal plant director  Vitaliy Sychev and State Duma Deputy Yuliy Rybakov. The result  was a dispute between democratic movement romantics and  pragmatists-privatizers from directors' corps and  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Administration of State  Property] structures.    Parting ways with this company is the Christian-Democratic  Union [KhDS], with its roughly 40 members. State Duma Deputy  Vitaliy Savitskiy, to the great displeasure of his Democratic  Russia colleagues, announced the creation of a "populist party."  The KhDS, which has proclaimed itself the only real political  force, is beginning to test the unfamiliar populist rhetoric,  having proclaimed a merciless struggle against  "pseudo-democracy," "compradorial bourgeoisie," and "red  directors," against "democrats getting into bed with mafiosi  structures..."    The only example of political integration is the city's  Public Chamber set up by 10 blocs. It is at the same time an  example of how highly St. Petersburg politicians value their  party principles. Opposition to Mayor Sobchak brought together  communists, Zhirinovskiyites, nationalists, the NTS [People's  Labor Union], socialists, and radical Democratic Russia  members...    The public actually is not shocked by this. While the  politicians are busy playing marbles among themselves, the  public does quite well without them.</p>

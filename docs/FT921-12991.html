			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Heavy trade in Zale bonds AS A bankruptcy decision looms today for Zale Corporation, the largest retail jeweller in the US, analysts reported volatile trading in the various debt issues belonging to company and its subsidiaries. The retail group faces an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed by bondholders in early January. At midnight today, a 20-day response period for Zale expires, and a court hearing has been scheduled for Friday morning. The initial response of Zale to the filing was to suggest the bondholders' move was 'unfortunate' and that it would prefer to achieve an out-of-court reorganisation. Since then, analysts suggest, the company has sought to win support among creditors for a restructuring that would involve a 'pre-packaged bankruptcy' - where the bankruptcy process is used briefly, to implement technically a financial reorganisation. But some observers still thought it likely that Zale would be forced to accede to the Chapter 11 petition, and that a full bankruptcy process would result.</p>

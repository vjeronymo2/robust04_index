			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME DERBY  </P> <P> Paula Abdul, Milli Vanilli, Skid Row, Neneh Cherry, De La Soul, Clint Black,  Texas and Soul II Soul had the kind of debuts in 1989 that fledgling  record-makers dream about.  </P> <P> But, what about a quarter of a century from now? How will their impact on pop  music be measured in 2015?  </P> <P> That's the year when any act that made its formal recording debut during the  last 12 months becomes eligible for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> It's humbling for the newcomers to imagine themselves eventually being measured  against the long-term commercial and/or critical success of several of the  artists who'll be inducted during the fifth annual Hall of Fame ceremonies  Wednesday night in New York -- a lineup that includes the Who, Simon &amp;  Garfunkel, the Kinks, the Four Tops and Bobby Darin. (See Don Waller's look at  the 1990 Hall of Fame class on opposite page).  </P> <P> The contributions of the eight artists being inducted this week aren't equal,  but even the weakest entries in this year's class helped define pop genres and  accumulated a massive string of hits.  </P> <P> This year's induction class brings to 43 the number of artists or groups  honored by the Hall of Fame -- and the selections offer a guide to the  standards set by the approximate 300 Hall of Fame voters (mostly recording  executives, musicians and critics) who determine who will be saluted.  </P> <P> The discouraging thing about this year's crop is a slight decline in past  standards. Where the voters continue in most cases to favor artistic merit over  simply commercial credentials, the election this year of the Four Seasons and  the Platters -- ahead of the far more influential Bob Marley or Curtis Mayfield  or Yardbirds -- suggests a tendency to be swayed by the sheer number of hits.  </P> <P> For all his impact, both in and out of the reggae movement, Marley, for  instance, never had a Top 40 single in the U.S., though two of his albums made  the Top 20. By contrast, the Platters, the smoothly designed, but narrow Los  Angeles R&amp;B vocal group, registered 20 Top 40 hits between 1955 and 1961.  The Four Seasons, the vibrant, but also limited East Coast vocal outfit,  generated 26 Top 40 hits between 1962 and 1968.  </P> <P> This slight shift toward the commercial rather than the significant suggests a  boost to the future Hall of Fame chances of contemporary artists -- such as  Billy Joel and Phil Collins -- who do little to stretch pop's artistic  boundaries, but are gifted enough craftsmen to be consistent hitmakers.  </P> <P> In putting together this year's annual report on the chances of today's  artists' eventually being inducted into the Hall of Fame, the emphasis is kept  on significance rather than sales, in the hope that this year's slight break  from that tradition was not the start of a trend. The chances are presented on  a scale of 0% (hopeless) to 99.99% (congratulations) -- along with an  indication, where appropriate, on whether the status improved or diminished  from last year.  </P> <P> Artists are listed in alphabetical order with new entries following the main  list.  </P> <P> The Bangles -- When the Go-Go's broke up after just three albums, the Los  Angeles band left the door open for another group to challenge for the spot  reserved in the Rock Hall of Fame to salute the first great all-woman group.  The Bangles looked like they had a chance, but they too have called it quits  before putting a lock on the claim. 5%. Down 5% from last year.  </P> <P> Bon Jovi -- Nothing here on an artistic level, but the last album sold 5  million copies and sharp management is positioning them well. Note the  headlining shows in Moscow. 12%. Up 5%.  </P> <P> Tracy Chapman -- Because the race for the Hall of Fame certification is so  long, even someone who makes as celebrated an arrival as this protest-minded  singer did last year can only be given a 10% chance of eventual success.  Strangely, Chapman's second album, "Crossroads," did little to clarify her  standing. Her craft seemed intact, but her vision didn't expand. 10%. No  change.  </P> <P> Elvis Costello -- When a strong marketing push by Warner Bros., Costello's new  label, and almost universally glowing reviews failed to push "Spike" into the  Top 20, it's clear that Costello is never going to be able to depend on sales  to earn his way into the Hall of Fame. Fortunately, he doesn't need to. His  artistry should be enough. 95%. Up 5%.  </P> <P> Terence Trent D'Arby -- Like Chapman, D'Arby was awarded a maximum 10% for his  flashy 1988 debut. Even though his second album, "Neither Fish Nor Flesh," has  bombed (so far), he exhibited enough artistry and ambition to earn a slight  upgrade. 13%. Up 3%.  </P> <P> Eurythmics -- Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox were once the essence of style in  pop-rock, as reflected by their 40% rating in the 1988 edition of the Hall of  Fame report. But the English duo seems to have run out of ideas, leaving it on  a l-o-n-g downhill spiral. 10%. Down 15% for the second year in a row.  </P> <P> Guns N' Roses -- Even without a new album in '89, this hard-rock band's  standing increased dramatically, thanks in part to continued heavy rotation on  MTV. Sharing the stage with the Stones also helped spread the word that this  band isn't just another in the disheartening tradition of hollow, recycled '80s  hard-rock acts. If the new album, due this fall, matches the best moments on  "Appetite for Destruction," the band's standing next year could take an even  bigger jump. 30%. Up 15%.  </P> <P> Billy Joel -- Not a personal favorite, but the hits continue to come and  there's every bit as much creative vision as the Four Seasons. So, it looks  like he's going to make it. 77%. Up 12%.  </P> <P> Janet Jackson -- Good year and now she's getting ready to tour. Question of  depth, however. 12%. Up 2%.  </P> <P> Madonna -- She has so much star power and cultural impact that she moved up 5  percentage points in 1988 without even releasing an album. Thanks to good sales  and generally good reviews for "Like a Prayer," she moves up dramatically this  time. 99%. Up 14%.  </P> <P> John Mellencamp -- The absence of a tour this year made it a quiet year, but  the best moments of the "Big Daddy" album demonstrated continued growth as an  artist. 70%. Up 5%.  </P> <P> George Michael -- Even more important than the 7 million-plus sales of "Faith"  was the way that this former teen idol continued in 1989 to gain industry  respect. There's already a buzz about his new album, due this summer. 35%. Up  5%.  </P> <P> Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers -- Even though Petty showed with "Full Moon  Fever" that he can operate quite nicely without the Heartbreakers, he made his  reputation with the band and he will be on the Hall of Fame ballot with the  band rather than a solo artist. Still, "Full Moon Fever," coming on the heels  of the Traveling Wilburys success, gave him another boost. 92%. Up 10%.  </P> <P> R.E.M. -- The leaders of the '80s' college/alternative rock may have lost some  urgency in moving into the mainstream, but there's still enough of a history  and time left to make them serious contenders. 70%. Up 5%.  </P> <P> Run-DMC -- They've become suddenly passe, but their standing as the first  superstars of rap may still be enough. 40%. Down 5%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Change  </P> <P> These artists, either through inactivity in 1989 or no dramatic moves, rate the  same scores as given them last year: Anita Baker (12%), Peter Gabriel (90%),  Whitney Houston (20%), Michael Jackson (99%), Pet Shop Boys (12%), Prince  (99%), Duran Duran (5%), Replacements (35%), Bruce Springsteen (99%), U2 (95%).  </P> <P> </P> <P> New to the Competition  </P> <P> Paula Abdul -- She's ideal for the video generation, but is there enough  beneath the flash? 3%.  </P> <P> Aerosmith -- Since returning to action in the '80s, this veteran hard-rock  band's chances have improved markedly. There's more consistency on stage and  greater range on record. 70%.  </P> <P> Clint Black -- Lots of support in country circles, but country artists haven't  done well with Hall of Fame voters. Even Johnny Cash -- someone with a rock  connection -- has been passed over by Hall of Fame voters. 1%.  </P> <P> Bobby Brown -- He's got great moves on stage and his records carry a sizzling  contemporary heat, but his singing is limited and his vision is suspect. 8%.  </P> <P> Neneh Cherry -- She has a chance. She seems intelligent, has ambition and  style. One key will be how good she is live. 8%.  </P> <P> Phil Collins -- A remarkable eight No. 1 singles during the '80s and a trickle  of critical respect has to be taken seriously in light of the Four Seasons' and  Platters' victories, but not that seriously. You see how his stock falls when  you place his body of work alongside, say, Lou Reed or Neil Young. 20%.  </P> <P> De La Soul -- Gifted new rap group, but the burn-off factor in rap is real  h-i-g-h. 6%.  </P> <P> Fine Young Cannibals -- The English trio was a disappointment live, but the  album was one of the year's most acclaimed. 10%.  </P> <P> Living Colour -- A breakthrough for black musicians in rock and an excellent  leader, on stage and off, in Vernon Reid. 12%.  </P> <P> Richard Marx -- Lots of sales, but little imagination. 3%.  </P> <P> Milli Vanilli -- Even more sales and less imagination. 1%.  </P> <P> New Kids on the Block -- Amazing success story so far, but can the Boston group  move beyond its teen-idol base? Some people feel there is enough in the group's  first two albums to suggest the group can break through, but it's going to be  tough. 3%.  </P> <P> Public Enemy -- The politically-minded New York rappers started off 1989 by  winning the Village Voice critics' poll for album of the year, but ended it  amid troubling questions of anti-Semitism. Can the group answer the questions  satisfactorily and then regain its artistic momentum? It won't be easy. If they  can, double their Hall of Fame chances. If they can't, so long. 12%.  </P> <P> Linda Ronstadt -- Returning to the Top 10 with an Aaron Neville duet, Ronstadt  may surprise us in the long run. She's always had a great voice, but there was  always a question about how strong a vision she had, but her instincts seem  increasingly daring. 60%.  </P> <P> Skid Row -- Sebastian Bach seems to be a legitimate hard-rock hero, but the  music needs more personality and punch. 3%.  </P> <P> Soul II Soul -- "Keep on Movin' " was a sensational start and Jazzie B  certainly has the determination, but it is a group project and it's not clear  just where the real creative energy lies. 9%.  </P> <P> Texas -- An exciting young band from Scotland that was especially appealing  live, blending lonesome guitar strains and sharp, bluesy songs. 6%.  </P></p>

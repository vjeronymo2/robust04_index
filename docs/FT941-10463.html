			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Parkside to join market with Pounds 32.8m price tag Parkside International, the packaging group that underwent a Pounds 3.2m management buy-out five years ago, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 110p to give a market capitalisation of Pounds 32.8m. The company is raising a total of Pounds 12m through the sale of 11.04m shares. Of this, Pounds 7m of new money is being raised before expenses from the sale of 6.36m shares. The remaining shares are being sold by directors and senior management for Pounds 3m, and by investment institutions for Pounds 2m. Mr Geoffrey Stewart, the chief executive who led the MBO from Jarvis Porter, said the new money would be used to continue expansion. The management would retain 40 per cent of the company and had agreed to sell no shares for two years, he said. The institutions had agreed not to sell any shares for one year, and were retaining 22 per cent. Parkside specialises in flexible packaging, which uses reels of plastic or paper sheeting, and plastic labels. Among its leading customers are Tate &amp; Lyle, Walkers crisps, Coca Cola and Andrex. It has two factories in Leeds and another, opened in 1992, near Wakefield. Mr Stewart said the company had spent Pounds 6m in upgrading its technology since the MBO and was planning to spend Pounds 3.25m on capital investment to end-February 1995, with a further Pounds 4m the following year. In the year to February 28 1993, pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.86m on turnover of Pounds 21.9m. The company, which employs 236 people, is forecasting pre-tax profits in the current year of Pounds 2.2m. Earnings per share are estimated at 6.5p, which gives a prospective p/e of 16.9. The notional dividend of 3p would give a gross yield of 3.4 per cent. Brokers to the issue are Panmure Gordon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 22--Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej  Olechowski on Wednesday expressed satisfaction over Russia's  joining the "Partnership for Peace" plan on Wednesday.    He said that Russia's joining the "Partnership" on the same  terms as other partners is in the interest of Poland. "And it  has happened that way. Russia has joined the programme within  the framework of the same general document," Olechowski said.    Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  sidestepped the issues of Poland's bid for the membership of  NATO. He told newsmen that Russia has excellent relations with  Poland. So are my relations with my "good friend" Andrzej  Olechowski, he said.    Speaking at a news conference with NATO Deputy Secretary  General Sergio Balanzino after the signing ceremony at the NATO  headquarters in Brussels, Kozyrev was asked by Polish  journalists whether Russia will be friendly towards Poland's  NATO membership and whether it sets any conditions after it has  signed a far-reaching cooperative relationship with NATO. He  answered that the only condition of all actions is that they  "fit into the building of a stable, united, democratic Europe  from Vancouver to Vladivostok."    He went on to say that "being equal members of Europe and  equal partners of NATO, we have equal rights to speak out our  mind with Poland."</p>

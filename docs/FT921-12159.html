			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Case for February The correct time to ann-ounce a general election is today. At once. Immediately. Be-fore any further ado. Straight away. Or, as some residents of Calcutta would put it, in the wonderful improvement on English that they have evolved, 'now itself'. I say this because we already know more than most of us want to about the merits of the contesting parties. Let's get it over with. It would be surprising if Mr John Major were to do any such thing, but you never can tell. One of his senior ministers remarked recently that he thought the 1992 election would be 'our revenge on Labour for February 1974'. February? Does he mean February? Surely not. The two largest parties each attracted 37-per-cent-plus-a-fraction in the February 1974 election, but the Conservatives won the larger fraction. This translated into a national lead of some 225,000 votes. Under Britain's idiosyncratic electoral system this clear Tory victory produced a Labour minority government, based on 301 parliamentary seats against the Conservatives' 297. At that time 318 seats constituted a majority, so the Liberals had to help prop Labour up. In the October re-run the Tories lost nearly 1.5m votes and 20 seats, and Labour moved ahead to 319. This put the country under five years of mismanagement by the worst Labour government ever to hold office. I cannot say which of these events the above mentioned minister imagines will be the subject of revenge - the inversion of the electoral arithmetic; the coincidence of two elections in one year; a switch in Liberal support; or the subsequent confirmation in power of, on his logic, one of the poorest-performing Conservative governments of the century. Any of this is possible. What persists is the February question. The case against an immediate election is that to go now would deprive the government of one of its strongest potential weapons, namely a budget that would seek to buy votes with the electorates' own money. The case in favour is that the chancellor would be absolved from the temptation to offer an outrageous bribe, such as an unjustifiable cut in the standard rate of income tax. Perhaps the Tories can persuade themselves that they can win without doing the indecent thing. They are clearly on a roll. Voters have been frightened by blatant, ruthless, and lying propaganda into believing that Labour will increase taxes for ordinary wage-earners. This has been achieved almost too easily. The Conservative tabloids have cast aside pretensions to honest journalism or democratic principles. They have become propaganda pamphlets for central office. There is plenty for them to crow about. Mr Major - a trump card - is spending this The chancellor would be absolved from the temptation to offer an outrageous bribe week high in the headlines. There was, first, Sunday's masterly appearance on the BBC's Desert Island Discs, then yesterday's re-launch of the Citizen's Charter. The prime minister has an opportunity to make news at today's Question Time. That will be followed by Thursday's visit from Mr Boris Yeltsin, and capped by Friday's flight to New York to chair a special session of the United Nations Security Council. Imagine a half-point cut in interest rates at around the same time, and how could anyone resist the temptation to announce a snap election? The answer, alas, is 'quite easily'. Mr Major's reason for not calling an election last spring, on the crest of the wave of Tory popularity that followed the Gulf war, is that it would have been the wrong thing to do and that, anyway, the government still had to make good its undertaking to abolish the poll tax. As to an election last November, he had promised to represent Britain at the Maastricht summit in December. This was wise: the probability is that the Conservatives would have lost a November election. If the prime minister persists with this year's apparent game plan, which is April 9 (polls permitting), May 7 (if all else fails), and early July (if he's desperate), he will have no excuse if he loses. The best reason for ploughing on for a few more months is that he cannot be sure of winning. The FT poll of polls suggests that it would be touch and go. If you take Mori's poll in this week's Sunday Times the responses work out at a Tory overall majority of about 10 seats. In present circumstances, with most of the economic news bad, that would be a triumph for Mr Major. The FT's average of all polls tells a different story. In December one version of our computer model produced a hung parliament with the Tories the largest party, another a similar stand-off with Labour just ahead. The same is true of the January results to date. Unweighted, the score is 41 per cent Tory, 40 per cent Labour and 15 per cent Liberal Democrat. You need 326 seats to win; our model says that these percentages would leave the Conservatives five seats short of that. If the same results are weighted according to the size of the polling samples, and then averaged once again, the Tories come out at 40.85 per cent against Labour's 40.18 per cent - and the number of Conservative MPs is down to 318, or eight short of the goal. These mathematical games can be played all day. They become more complicated if you feed in regional differences, although the complexities tend to work out in the Tories' favour. The essence of the matter is that a few weeks of encouraging news do not constitute an election victory. From the government's point of view, that is the case for holding on. Yet there can be no certainty that two more months of politicking, plus a giveaway budget, will further improve the Conservatives' standing. On the political fundamentals - their management of the economy - they should have fallen off the bottom of the chart by now. If they wait, they might. That is the case for daring to go in February.</p>

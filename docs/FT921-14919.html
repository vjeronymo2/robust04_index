			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US Navy foothold for Rolls-Royce ROLLS-ROYCE of the UK and Westinghouse of the US have gained a first foothold on a new generation of ship engines for the US Navy with a Dollars 160m (Pounds 89.3m) contract to develop a gas turbine propulsion system. The deal is the first fruit of a collaboration between the two companies announced in September 1991. Rolls-Royce is the sub-contractor to Westinghouse. Its share of the deal is worth Dollars 67m, but this could rise to Dollars 120m if all the contract options are taken up. If the US Navy then presses ahead with full-scale development and manufacturing, it could provide Rolls-Royce with a lucrative new source of income. 'This is our first contract for US Navy ships for more than 20 years,' said Rolls-Royce yesterday. The four-year contract is to develop a 26,400 horse power intercooled recuperated (ICR) gas turbine engine from Rolls-Royce's RB211 aero engine. The ICR technology alternately cools and heats gases in the engine to improve fuel efficiency. Rolls-Royce says that the result is a 30 per cent fall in fuel consumption. The contract includes design, development and testing.</p>

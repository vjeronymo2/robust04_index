			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 5 May TASS -- One of the main objectives of  the current visit to Moscow of the state and government  delegation from Tajikistan, led by the Republic's leader Emomali  Rakhmonov is to convince Moscow that it is necessary to speed up  the process of unification of the monetary systems of Russia and  Tajikistan, a ranking source in the Tajik Government told  ITAR-TASS.    The Tajik delegation includes Prime Minister Abdudzhalil  Samadov, Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov, National Bank Chairman  Kayum Kavmidinov and a large group of experts. According to an  official version, set forth by Emomali Rakhmonov's press  secretary Nabi Karimov, the deepening and expansion of bilateral  political, economic, and military cooperation will be discussed  with the Russian leadership in Moscow.    A Tajik Government official said any further procrastination  on the process of unification of the monetary systems can lead  to unpredictable political and economic consequences, since the  industrial production slump has already reached a critical point  because of blocked payments and the majority of the population  have not received pay packets and various social allowances  since the beginning of the year.    Asked whether Tajikistan was planning to introduce temporary  banknotes for the duration of the transitional period, as  announced by the prime minister at recent press conference, the  government official said there was no uniform approach to the  problem among the Republics leaders. Moreover, Emomali  Rakhmonov and National Bank Chairman Kayum Kavmidinov are  against this measure. According to the official the Tajik  leader will ask Moscow for more Russian cash to last through the  transition period.    Russian journalists at Dushanbe airport were denied even a  blitz interview with the republic's top leaders before their  departure for Moscow. Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov said  all details of the visit will be released to journalists after  the visit.</p>

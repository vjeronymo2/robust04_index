			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Softer line by France on farm accord FRANCE'S new prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday asked leaders of the country's farmers' to spell out their objections to last November's US-EC agreement on subsidised agricultural exports. He warned them, however, that he did not want a trade war with Washington. In his first meeting as prime minister with the farmers, Mr Balladur signalled clearly that while he might well try to persuade the Community to renegotiate last November's draft agreement with the US on cutting subsidised EC farm exports, he would not seek to go back on the Community's reform of its own agricultural policy. He thus asked the farm union leaders to prepare for him a list of their basic objections to the EC-US agreement. This accord provides not only for a reduction in the volume of subsidised EC farm exports, but would also give the US more scope to increase its own soya exports to the Community by restricting the EC's own output of oilseeds. This followed a Gatt decision against the current EC scheme for subsidising oilseeds. Mr Balladur was described yesterday by his officials as 'respectful of the Gatt decision', but insistent on some 'alteration'. On the other hand, the prime minister sought from the farmers only a list of 'reasonable compensation measures' for the 'harmful effects' of the EC's internal farm reform, officials said. The implication was that the new French government would basically accept the EC reforms which enter into force on July 1, seek minor changes in Brussels and look into its own constrained national budget to see what extra money could be found for its farmers.</p>

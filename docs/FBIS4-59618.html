			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Labor Party Deputy Yosi Katz and PLO </F> representative 'Ahmad al-Tibi by Robert Hochner in Vienna --  live; Katz and al-Tibi speak in English with superimposed German  translation]    [Text] [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, how do you assess the  handing over of power from Israel to the PLO so far, and what is  the next major objective you want to negotiate with the Israelis?    [Al-Tibi] We are here in Vienna, both Israelis and  Palestinians, at the invitation of the Bruno-Kreisky-Forum to  negotiate the touchy issue of the final status, which means the  issues of Jerusalem, the settlements, refugees, the right to  return, borders, etc. These are the most difficult issues. I  can tell you that the first day has already brought very  productive and constructive discussions, particularly on the  issues of refugees and the return of refugees.    [Hochner] Mr. Katz, Jerusalem has always been an integral  part of Israel, the capital of Israel for the Israeli Government.    [Katz] I hope that Jerusalem remains united and under  Israeli sovereignty. Yet, this is one of the controversial,  sensitive issues. Of course, we are discussing this issue, too,  as well as other issues that create difficulties for the  Palestinians. This is in the very nature of mutual talks. We  must also discuss controversial issues, because otherwise, we  will not reach an agreement.    [Hochner] One of the controversial issues is the settlements  on the West Bank. Can you see Israel one day giving up these  settlements to exchange peace for land here, too?    [Katz] I believe we can convince the settlers that it is  worthwhile to leave this area and move behind the green line in  order to create a good atmosphere. I think we can convince them  by starting a new Zionist movement. I think we can convince  them to leave those areas. I hope we will achieve this by  convincing them and not by forcing them. I am sure we can  overcome this problem. I do not think the settlements will  remain where they are now, at least not all of them. Maybe  there are some strategic points, such as the Jordan Valley,  where the settlers can remain and should remain. Yet, settlers  who live near Arab municipalities with Palestinian inhabitants  should leave these areas and move behind the green line. I hope  they will move to Galilee and the Negev, thus strengthening the  State of Israel.    [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, a lot will depend on whether the PLO  manages to get the security situation on the Gaza Strip and in  Jericho under control. What danger do you see, or how much  rivalry from fundamentalist Hamas?    [Al-Tibi] You know, it is legitimate to have opposition,  democratic opposition. There are Palestinians who do not  support this agreement, although the great majority of  Palestinian people support the peaceful settlements and the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, the Palestinian people also  want to see tangible achievements. The most important factors  for the success of this agreement are the development of the  infrastructure, the creation of new jobs to eliminate high  unemployment on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, and the  financial support by the World Bank, the European Union, and the  Arab world. I hope that part of the Islamic movement will  participate in the government in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho.  They can even participate in the elections scheduled for next  year.    [Hochner] Mr. Katz, the objective of the Palestinians is  clear: a state of their own. Is that conceivable for Israel,  and, as with the question of Jerusalem, when do you think that  Israel will feel safe enough to grant the Palestinians this  state next to Israel?    [Katz] I belong to a minority in my party. I believe that  an independent Palestinian state would be something useful for  Israel, for Israel's security. I think it is up to the  Palestinians to take a decision on a safe future. I think that  if we offer them the opportunity to create an independent  Palestinian state, it will increase their sense of  responsibility for what is going on there.    [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, the Palestinians have political  expectations as well as political ones; certainly expectations  for an independent state and not just the Gaza Strip and the  Jericho area. When do you think the PLO will get this  independent state, by what time does it want to have it?    [Al-Tibi] Under the agreement, the final solution regarding  the status should be discussed at the beginning of the third  year at the latest. However, we hope that official talks on the  final status will begin as soon as possible. I think that the  Gaza-Jericho agreement will naturally lead to an independent  Palestinian state according to the developments in the area.  First, because the Palestinians are seeking self-determination  and an independent state. Second, I think that even in the  Israeli cabinet, a majority of ministers supports the idea of an  independent Palestinian state. I think that the whole thing  might take place before the conclusion of the fifth year of the  interim stage.    [Hochner] Thank you very much, Mr. Katz and Mr. al-Tibi.</p>

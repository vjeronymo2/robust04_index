			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Defying the discounters - The OFT is crippling competition, argues William Bishop Colin Deas has a problem: Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, is trying to prevent him from competing effectively. Deas manages a small, growing company called Rael Brook which manufactures high-quality shirts. He is trying to build a reputation for his brand name and he has a problem with discounters. Discounting upsets the high-street retailers who give him wide distribution and whose stocking of his products helps him build brand awareness. He decided Rael Brook's future was best served by distributing only through high-street retailers and refusing to supply discounters. But soon the Office of Fair Trading began to pursue him, threatening him with expensive legal action. Deas had no real choice: last week he reluctantly agreed to resume supply to the complaining discounter. He is now hoping the anger of the loyal high-street dealers will not lead to destruction of the brand value he has worked hard to build. Deas is not alone. At least four other companies have had similar problems. Andrew Brownsword (greeting cards), TVR Engineering (sports cars), Anna French (fabrics) and OIly's (children's wear) are small firms, with small market shares, struggling to survive and grow in their respective market. They have all during the last eight months been harried by the OFT. Each has been made to sign an undertaking that interferes with its preferred methods of distributing the products it makes. This bizarre result has come about because of the Resale Prices Act of 1976 (re-enacting the original statute of 1964), which makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to insist on minimum resale prices for his products. Only two exceptions have been allowed - for books and some pharmaceuticals. This statute probably accomplished something useful when first enacted, but today is harmful to the public interest. Resale price maintenance (RPM) is a paradoxical phenomenon. Why would any manufacturer want dealers to keep the price of his product up? Lower prices at retail normally mean greater sales for the manufacturer. Economists have put forward three basic theories to explain why a manufacturer might want to maintain resale prices: the dealer-cartel explanation, the manufacturer-cartel explanation and the dealer-services explanation. When the act was adopted, RPM was widespread in the UK. Some of it probably was attributable to manufacturer cartels. All cartels suffer from the problem of secret cheating by their members - Opec suffers from it all the time. RPM may help a cartel to maintain price discipline because price uniformity at the retail level makes it easier for other manufacturers to detect secret 'cheating'. This is a problem only if there are few manufacturers, each with a high market share. Historically some RPM in the UK was attributable to the second explanation - dealer cartels. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, groups of dealers would threaten to boycott a manufacturer's product unless he imposed RPM on all dealers. This was especially important where retail was dominated by small shopkeepers organised in federations. In effect, they insisted manufacturers act as their cartel agents, stamping out price-competing retailers. Again, stopping this type of RPM is beneficial. But today UK retailing is not dominated by federations of small inefficient shopkeepers. That leaves only one sensible interpretation: that these five companies are buying valuable dealer services. A manufacturer who faces competition wants his products distributed effectively. He wants his dealers to have the incentive - by means of a healthy retail margin - to display and promote the products. And he wants dealers to feel assured the value of their efforts will not be taken away by discounters who have done nothing to promote the product, yet who try to take the benefits of the promotional efforts of others. Here the manufacturer needs RPM in order to stop the low-service, cut-price discounter from getting something for nothing. Without RPM, his dealer network will lack commitment and may even melt away. UK government policy today is clear: it consistently favours major retailer interests in preference to producer interests. In this respect, the UK is more keen to regulate than even the European Commission, which has always allowed selective distribution - often only a substitute for RPM. Yet, as Michael Birkin of Interbrand has noted, the UK economy has failed in recent decades to generate many new, world-famous brands, especially luxury brands. Most luxury or high-quality items on sale in the UK are foreign. One reason is that UK manufacturers cannot get started at home - as soon as they create some brand awareness they are forced to supply discounters who erode the brand value. Every single case recently pursued by the OFT falls into this category. Significantly, the main UK instances of recent brand creation (Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn) control their own distribution. Innovation in retailing is important, but so is product innovation. There is no reason for UK law to favour retailers - or manufacturers either - the law should be neutral and let free-market forces decide the balance. The time has come to re-think the Resale Prices Act. It is probably no longer necessary. Both dealer and manufacturer cartels can be dealt with more effectively today under our general anti-cartel laws or by a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of problem industries. But even if the act is still needed, there is a clear case for a general exemption in favour of small firms. Then Sir Bryan and his staff could devote more of their scarce resources to the useful work of reducing the disadvantages of cartels and monopolies and less to the harmful work of making life difficult for entrepreneurs such as Colin Deas.

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REFEREE PREPARES TO COUNTERATTACK IN ASSAULT CASE;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: PLANNED LAWSUIT TARGETS SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PALMDALE COACH FOR  LACK OF CONTROL IN GAME AGAINST SAUGUS.  </P> <P> A high school football referee said that he will sue a school district and a  football coach for what he claims is negligent supervision of the player who  attacked him during a game between Palmdale and Saugus highs last fall.  </P> <P> Referee Brad Woolley, who sustained minor injuries when he was knocked to the  ground by Palmdale High player Darius Wilson, said he will file the suit in  mid-April against Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell and the Antelope Valley Union  High School District.  </P> <P> Wilson, who already has pleaded no contest to misdemeanor-battery charges and  received 400 hours of community service work, also will be named in the suit.  According to Woolley, the inclusion of Bothwell and the school district will be  to determine who is ultimately accountable for the behavior of players.  </P> <P> Woolley says that National Federation of State High School Assns. guidelines  clearly state that " 'the responsibility for the conduct of players is  attributable to the head coach.'It's as simple as that."  </P> <P> The Oct. 13 incident at College of the Canyons occurred in the fourth quarter.  Woolley, along with two other officials, was attacked by Palmdale players after  three consecutive penalties against Palmdale. Woolley had flagged Wilson for  unnecessary roughness on a punt, then called two unsportsmanlike conduct  penalties when Bothwell "cursed me," Woolley says. "Then all hell broke loose."  </P> <P> Aside from the violence, a disturbing aspect of the incident was a charge of  racism by Palmdale players. Not only were they taunted by racial slurs from the  Saugus sideline, the players claim, but the referees also made derogatory  remarks.  </P> <P> But at a hearing before the 10-member Southern Section Executive Committee on  Wednesday, all five of the referees who worked the game were cleared of any  misconduct. Palmdale High will not be able to appeal Wednesday's decision at  the state level but might go to court, according to school Principal Linda  Janzen.  </P> <P> "I was disappointed in the results of the hearing," she said. "All along, I  said there were more people responsible than just my players. I still believe  that. I don't believe they made up the things they're saying."  </P> <P> The Executive Committee voted unanimously to exonerate the referees. "It wasn't  a matter of not believing one over the other," said committee president Tom  Jacobson, principal at Corona del Mar High. "We had to look at the whole  picture in this very messy, unfortunate incident. Was there enough there to  make a determination? My personal feeling: The evidence was inconclusive."  </P> <P> Woolley believes accusations of racism on the part of referees were "smoke  screens to draw attention away from the incident." The referees claim they did  not hear any racist remarks by Saugus players, although independent sources say  that Saugus players were directing slurs at Palmdale players. In a Jan. 10  hearing, a Palmdale player testified that Bothwell was apprised of the slurs  and didn't do anything about it.  </P> <P> "Had the officials been aware of the situation," Woolley said, referring to the  slurs, "we would have stopped the contest and fixed it. But the Palmdale  players did not complain to us."  </P> <P> Bothwell is culpable, Woolley said, because he ignored his players' complaints  and because of his behavior before the incident. From the beginning of the  game, Woolley said, Bothwell was "complaining about everything, including the  coin toss." During the game, "he verbally abused the officials. He was not in  control."  </P> <P> The attacks on the officials happened, Woolley said, because "once verbal abuse  is accepted, it turns into physical abuse. The players just follow the example  of their coach."  </P> <P> Bothwell would not comment on the charges.  </P> <P> On March 1, Woolley's attorney, David Rosenberg, set the stages for the lawsuit  by filing a claim with the school district, a state requirement for suing a  government agency. The lawsuit will be filed in Lancaster Superior Court.  Rosenberg won't say how much he's asking in damages, but the minimum amount in  Superior Court is $25,000.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure this kind of thing doesn't happen to other sports  officials," Rosenberg said. "It has to be shown that this is not the way high  school sports should be run."  </P> <P> Woolley, employed in the wardrobe department at Walt Disney Studios, didn't  miss work or any officiating assignments because of his injuries. A high school  referee since 1975, Woolley has been working football games for only four  years. The Palmdale incident, he said, "got me to the core of my being."  </P></p>

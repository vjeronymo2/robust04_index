			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Khamis Confirms Split From </F> `General Command'"]    [Excerpt] Damascus, Amman, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT --  Mustafa Khamis, a Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine--General Command [PFLP-GC] leader, has confirmed his  split from the Front and the formation of a new command under  his leadership called the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine--Islamic General Command.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in his residence in  Amman  yesterday Khamis said that he has taken this step in protest at  the attitude of the Front's leadership, saying that he had, on  several occasions, asked the Front's Central Committee to form a  special committee to investigate the accusations leveled at him  by some officials in order to judge them and expel them from its  ranks. But his requests fell on deaf ears and, as a result, some  Central Committee members conspired against him and hence  dismissed him as official in charge of the General Command on  the Jordanian scene and action in the western sector of the  occupied territories.    However, circles of the PFLP-GC led by Ahmad Jibril were  surprised by these reports when AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT went to ask  them about the causes that led to the split.    General Command officials expressed their astonishment at  and  rejection of the idea. An employee in Jibril's office told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it is a personal action, and the  Palestinian issue does not need further splits and  fragmentation. Such actions harm Palestinian struggle, which he  is working to unify in order to confront the Israeli enemy, his  practices, and his agreement with Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat.

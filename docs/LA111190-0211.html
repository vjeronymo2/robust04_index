			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLYSTYRENE FOAM JUST WANTS A LITTLE RESPECT FROM ENVIRONMENTALISTS;  </P> <P> PACKAGING: MAKERS OF THE USEFUL BUT ECOLOGICALLY UNPOPULAR WHITE MATERIAL ARE  TRYING NEW METHODS OF RECYCLING TO HELP IMPROVE THE PRODUCT'S IMAGE.  </P> <P> Despite its setbacks with McDonald's switch to paper packaging, the polystyrene  foam industry sees progress behind the scenes and promising technological help  for efforts to change the product's public image.  </P> <P> Industry officials hope to do this primarily by persuading the public that  polystyrene foam, unlike waxed- or plastic-coated paper, already can be  recycled.  </P> <P> "Our industry has been behind in recycling, but we're catching up very  quickly," says Larry E. Rembold, president of Dolco Packaging Corp. in Sherman  Oaks.  </P> <P> Dolco, the world's largest producer of foam egg cartons, is a major buyer of  the least-promising type of recycled polystyrene -- material reprocessed not  from relatively clean industrial scrap but from such post-consumer products as  used hamburger packages.  </P> <P> Until last week, Dolco also had produced those clamshell foam containers --  from virgin polystyrene -- for McDonald's.  </P> <P> The fast-food chain, which yielded last week to a long lobbying campaign and  announced that it would switch from polystyrene clamshells to more  environmentally popular paper packaging, accounted for about 10% of the firm's  $70 million in annual sales.  </P> <P> "We're pursuing other business and will have to make some cost adjustments  because of McDonald's decision," Rembold concedes.  </P> <P> But in the long run, he and other observers of the industry say, McDonald's may  most be missed for the role it might have played in educating the public to the  attributes of the much-maligned foam material.  </P> <P> Environmentalists have long faulted polystyrene foam on several counts. The  Washington-based Environmental Action and other groups see serious  environmental problems in the emissions and effluents involved in its  transformation from petroleum to plastic.  </P> <P> Yet many environmental groups also have warned lately that producing  alternative packaging materials, such as paper, also has an environmental cost,  which should be rigorously examined.  </P> <P> Polystyrene foam also has been blamed as a bulky, nondegradable filler of  scarce municipal trash dumps, although industry representatives note that the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that it takes only 1% of the space  in the nation's landfills.  </P> <P> "Environmentalists are tired of everyone saying, 'Oh we're just a tiny part of  the problem,' " says Jerry Powell, editor of Resource Recycling magazine. "No,  you're not. You're part of the problem too."  </P> <P> But polystyrene foam is most notorious among the environmentally conscious  because it is so litter-prone. Light, durable, a popular container for takeout  food -- and easy to spot -- it long has been a highly visible reminder along  the nation's highways of environmental blight.  </P> <P> Powell recalls the rueful comment of one plastics executive, who, when talking  to the Portland, Ore., city council, about polystyrene foam said, "If we  weren't white, it wouldn't be such a problem."  </P> <P> A vigorous recycling effort would stifle many of these complaints. But the  entire plastics industry has lagged behind other container-materials  businesses. Of all plastics, only 1% now is recycled; almost none of the  clamshell foam packs are recycled.  </P> <P> There have been technical problems, particularly for polystyrene foam. In part,  this can be traced to problems in cleaning food waste from recycled foam  packages.  </P> <P> Although the Federal Trade Commission doesn't allow use of recycled foam to  make new food containers, most in the industry feel that there would still be  deep markets for recycled foam, but only if it can be cleaned to the stringent  standards demanded before it can be run through narrow extruders used to  produce new foam.  </P> <P> By mid-January, 1991, however, the National Polystyrene Recycling Co., an  industry-sponsored consortium, will open its second of several planned  facilities. That plant, in Corona, will use a new system that cleans even  food-tainted foam.  </P> <P> The plant will be operated by Talco Recycling Inc., an experienced materials  recycler. The first plant, in Leominster, Mass., has successfully cleaned used  foam for more than two years, said Phil Fusco, Talco vice president.  </P> <P> NPRC hopes to recycle 25% of all disposable polystyrene products -- foam and  hard form polystyrene -- by 1995.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Dart Container Corp., based in Mason, Mich., and the giant of the  foam cup manufacturers, is about to launch a program to place foam compacting  machines with food-service operators nationwide.  </P> <P> These machines, called "densifiers," compress used foam containers, making them  easier to transport and reprocess.  </P> <P> In California, tests are under way at Walt Disney Co. headquarters of a  densifier for possible use in the company's theme parks, Dart officials say.  </P> <P> The Associated Students-UCLA Food Service plans to sign up for what Dart is  calling its CARE recycling program; the company in August persuaded Los Angeles  County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon to keep using foam coffee  cups in county offices.  </P> <P> Dixon cited polystyrene's ability to retain heat and resist contamination. He  also touted its economy. In his report to Los Angeles County Supervisors, he  compared the cost for a thousand cups: $1,030 for glass, $450 for hard plastic,  $27.50 for wax or plastic-coated paper -- and $9.93 for polystyrene foam.  </P> <P> But cost has been an obstacle to recycling.  </P> <P> The inherent value of recycled foam is so low that a recycling system would not  work if it were based on waste-producers' potential to make money by selling  old foam cartons to recyclers. Many in the industry believe that manufacturers  will inevitably have to subsidize the recycling effort.  </P> <P> But Rembold, of Dolco, still plans to make money on his recycled egg carton  operations. He will buy recycled, clean foam from the new Talco facility for 45  cents a pound. That sum includes a subsidy to the collection company of as much  as 10 cents a pound.  </P> <P> The recycled material will still be cheaper than the 50 cents a pound he now  pays for virgin polystyrene.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem now is creating the incentive or the desire for consumers  to deposit used polystyrene" at collection sites still being created, Rembold  says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POLYSTYRENE IN THE WASTE STREAM  </P> <P> Polystyrene foam has been blamed as a bulky, nondegradable filler of scarce  municipal trash dumps, although industry representatives note that the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency reports that it takes only 1% of the space in  the nation's landfills.  </P> <P> Percent of municipal solid waste material, by volume.  </P> <P> Glass: 2%  </P> <P> Metals: 14%  </P> <P> Other plastics: 18%  </P> <P> POLYSTYRENE: 1%  </P> <P> Paper and paperboard: 37%  </P> <P> Other: 28%  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> </P></p>

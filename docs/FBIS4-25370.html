			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Chris Patten Plays `Press Freedom Card'"] </F>   [Text] Recently, Chris Patten has been very fond of  playing the "press freedom card." After making a fuss about  "press freedom" with regard to Xi Yang's case and a BBC  documentary, he then used the administrative dispute inside Asia  Television and the subsequent resignation incident to exaggerate  matters, saying that "the Hong Kong Government is working hard  to ensure that after 1997, Hong Kong can enjoy the press freedom  it enjoys now, and the Hong Kong Government is looking at  whether some regulations have been abused to jeopardize press  freedom. If the Hong Kong Journalists' Association asks that  more regulations should be examined, the Hong Kong Government  will consider it."    That is to say, Patten's "press freedom card" is not just  something to talk about, but will be implemented through  amending many relevant regulations.    However, the biggest flaw in Patten's "press freedom card"  is  precisely reflected by the fact that in the past, the British  Hong Kong authorities have for a long time exercised very tight  control over news and information, however, since the signing of  the Joint Declaration, and particularly as 1997 draws closer,  they have suddenly amended regulations and even want to amend  and abolish regulations which have been drafted for the normal  management of news and information. This flaw shows that the  Hong Kong British authorities are hypocritical when they talk  lavishly about "press freedom," and that Patten uses "press  freedom" to sow discord between Hong Kong's press circles and  the Chinese side on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to  amend relevant news and information regulations. He wants to  kill two birds with one stone by trying to change some mass  media in Hong Kong into a tool with which the British side  confronts the Chinese side and to create difficulties in news  and information management for the future special administrative  region government.    In the past, the regulations used by the Hong Kong British  authorities to restrict and control news and information were  not only numerous but stringent also, and the British Hong Kong  authorities once used these regulations to sue patriotic  newspapers and ordered them to suspend publication; they also  put certain journalists in jail. For a long time, the British  Hong Kong authorities only allowed "press freedom" which  protected and safeguarded colonial interests, while doing their  best to attack and restrain real press freedom, which expressed  other voices and ideas, and this method was an important  component of colonial and despotic politics. Hong Kong's press  circles have always expressed strong grievances with regards to  this.    After the Hong Kong question was settled by the decision  that  Hong Kong would return to mainland China, and particularly as  1997 draws closer, the colonial governor has suddenly changed  into a savior who "defends Hong Kong's press freedom." He has  ulterior motives. Patten once incited people by saying that  "Hong Kong people must stand up to safeguard press freedom, not  only after 1997 but also before 1997." People cannot but ask:  What kind of "freedom" is this "press freedom" instigated by  Patten? Only two examples are needed to illustrate the problem.    First, when China's judiciary acted according to the law to  handle Xi Yang's case of stealing state secrets, this was  totally unrelated to press freedom, but Patten used the  opportunity to accuse the Chinese Government of suppressing Hong  Kong's press freedom. According to Patten's logic, any person  who wears a reporter's identity card can feel free to steal  political, economic, and military intelligence and jeopardize  state security without being punished by law. Where does this  "freedom" exist in the world? In the 1989 Official Secrets Act,  which was imported from Britain by the British Hong Kong  authorities in 1992, six kinds of information continue to be  restricted, including "confidential data obtained from another  country." Is it not true that data stolen by Xi Yang for a  certain Hong Kong newspaper to publish falls into the scope  restricted by the Official Secrets Act? [sentence as published]  In order to stubbornly assert that the crime of stealing state  secrets was "press freedom" and "legitimate," Patten claimed  that "more regulations" must be examined and amended, and this  fully reveals Patten's wanton trampling on the spirit of the law  and the system.    Second, when a Hong Kong television station decided not to  broadcast a BBC documentary, Patten insinuated that Hong Kong's  mass media were "exercising more self-discipline as 1997 draws  closer," and he exerted pressure on the relevant television  station by saying that he wanted to wait and see "if it would  broadcast or not." This BBC documentary substituted one thing  for another and fabricated and distorted facts in order to  viciously slander Mao Zedong; when the relevant television  station refrained from broadcasting it, this was a responsible  attitude toward the audience, and precisely the kind of  responsible attitude which is a guarantee of press freedom.  What surprises people is that Patten went so far as to view the  social responsibility of journalists as a mistake and a crime,  against which he launched an attack. In Western countries,  "news undertaking regulations" are very common, and journalists  are restrained and guided by "responsibility," "justice," and  "honesty." When media exercise self-discipline by conforming to  the facts and according the external rules such as news  regulations and policies, press freedom is not abused, press  freedom can have a full role, and both things are guaranteed.  Even the "slander regulations" of the British Hong Kong  authorities stipulate that if a mass medium broadcasts or  reports a program or information which is slanderous in nature,  the relevant supervisory person can be arrested on criminal  charges. Here we can see that when the television station  refrained from broadcasting the BBC documentary which was  slanderous nature, it embodied the application of press freedom  both in terms of self-discipline and external rules, but Patten  wantonly interfered in this and attacked it, and this precisely  indicates that Patten tramples on and strangles press freedom  and intervened in the television station's right to handle news  at its own discretion.    What is laughable is that Patten plays the "press freedom  card" enthusiastically on the one hand, and, on the other, tries  hard to intervene in the mass media to control it, and, as a  result, his "press freedom card" collapses into itself. When a  colonial and despotic governor of Hong Kong sells "press  freedom" as 1997 draws closer, and when he amends information  management regulations and dismantles the machinery of the rule  of law, the whole thing resembles his efforts to promote a  "quickened pace of democracy," and the purposes is nothing but  an attempt to sow discord among the Hong Kong people, incite  them, poison relations between Hong Kong's mass media and the  Chinese Government, serve the aim of extending Britain's  political control over Hong Kong after 1997, pave a road for  pro-Britain and anti-China political forces to expand their room  to maneuver, and to allow disturbances and confrontation to  arise in Hong Kong after 1997. However, Patten's "press freedom  card," like all the "cards" he has played, will never succeed.</p>

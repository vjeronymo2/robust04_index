			<p>BFN     [Text] President Carlos Menem spoke yesterday before the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.  He took the opportunity to demand democracy for Cuba right in  front of Fidel Castro, to highlight the changes in Argentina  since 1989, and to reject abortion. In his seven-minute speech  -- the time allowed for the presidents to express their position  -- Menem called for a political "change" in Cuba based on a  request made earlier to Castro by Venezuelan President Rafael  Caldera. He concluded his message calling on the 21 heads of  state and government to speak out against abortion. "No Latin  American government has been able to develop under a  dictatorship or totalitarianism, which are systems that have  completely failed" said Menem in reference to the situation in  Cuba. "I understand that perhaps in some countries those  conditions do not exist but that depends on each of those  countries, and it is not my intention to meddle in the affairs  of other countries." Menem was quick to clarify that he had not  made a special reference to Cuba.    After recalling that he also suffered "imprisonment,  persecution, and torture," like some of his colleagues, Menem  emphasized: "The Venezuelan president (Caldera) referred to this  issue. With great affection and love I also call on this friend  who is the commander of Cuba, under the same terms and form, on  the need for change in Cuba which is a country we all love."  Menem never mentioned the name Castro and only identified him  as "the commander of Cuba." He spoke at noon yesterday. He was  the third speaker after Fidel Castro spoke. The first session  was interrupted for a few minutes over a special request by  Menem to the summit president, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria  Trujillo. Following Gaviria's address, the speakers were  Brazil's Itamar Franco, Uruguay's Luis Lacalle, Guatemala's  Ramiro de Leon Carpio, Venezuela's Rafael Caldera, Cuba's Fidel  Castro (who harshly criticized the United States), Ecuador's  Sixto Ballen, Panama's Guillermo Endara, and Carlos Menem whose  speech was delayed for a few minutes after Gaviria granted the  brief recess he requested.    Menem's speech first covered economic matters, which is one  of the main issues of the summit that will close this evening  when Menem will deliver another speech, as will Gaviria, because  Argentina will host the next summit. Unexpectedly and based on  the mention by Venezuela's Caldera, President Menem talked about  dictatorships and could not avoid referring to the Cuban issue.  Menem returned to his prepared speech to talk about the state  reform. He said: "Based on our experience, I can say that a  reform strengthens the state in such a way that it can begin a  process of profound economic change."    Directly addressing President Gaviria, who spoke on this  issue, Menem pointed out that in Argentina "we are conducting an  all-out struggle against corruption. Argentina has completely  changed its history with the state reform." He emphasized that  "every enterprise that we have privatized was a monument to  corruption." The privatizations "have given us an opportunity to  begin a new stage with growth and development, and to fight the  worst scourge that could hit a community which is  hyperinflation." Menem wore white pants and a light blue shirt  as the meeting was informal. He compared the $60 million in the  safe of the Central Bank when he assumed the government with the  current $18 billion. He added: "We have made some great  achievements, and those who say this is just some kind of  adjustment policy are lying." He said: "Argentina has the  greatest growth in the western world and is third at the global  level thanks to the state reform, a market economy, and a strong  fiscal adjustment."    President Menem took this opportunity to urge the summit to  speak out against abortion. Menem said the leaders will  probably talk about "human rights, democracy, freedom ..." He  then paused for a deep breath and said: "The protection of life.  For me, and I hope the other presidents agree, life begins at  the moment of conception in the mother's womb." Menem added:  "These issues related to man's dignity will be discussed and  talked about." He was applaused by those attending the summit.</p>

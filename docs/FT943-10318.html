			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Eyes on horizon after the clouds - The hopes pinned on the revamped Dowty Dowty Aerospace will today deliver another of its flagship products - a set of landing gear capable of setting an aircraft gently on to a runway at 140 mph. Another so-called 'ship set' will leave its Gloucester plant on Monday and further deliveries to manufacturers such as Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas are expected every working day for the next 12 months. TI Group, the specialist engineering company which paid Pounds 500m for Dowty in June 1992, hopes that the order backlog will finally lay to rest the suspicion that it paid too much for the aerospace business. Sir Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, yesterday pointed to increased half-year operating profits from Dowty and predicted that the division would emerge as the group's third pillar, making a similar contribution to the John Crane seals business and the Bundy tubing division. Dowty, however, is some way from achieving parity with its engineering siblings. Operating profits of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 8.5m) in the six months to June 30 represented just 17 per cent of the group total and turnover fell from Pounds 158.4m to Pounds 149.8m amid flat demand for most aviation components. City analysts, meanwhile, warned yesterday that the aerospace market could decline further before new orders fed through. 'Airlines are trying to get better utilisation of short-haul aircraft, which could mean fewer new orders,' said one analyst. 'Although that could boost the spares business.' Another analyst predicted that recovery from current levels would be difficult. 'Apart from Airbus, there are not many new aircraft programmes they can rely on.' Sir Christopher is undaunted. 'Dowty hurt us in the first two years, but it's picking up and I'm quite proud of the margins.' He has charged Mr Tony Edwards, the division's chief executive, with developing Dowty into a world leader in aerospace components. For Mr Edwards, recruited in November 1992 from Lucas Industries, success depends on one equation coming good: that aircraft orders follow past trends by increasing in line with airline operating profits. 'We believe airline profitability will be healthy enough by 1996 to kickstart large-scale orders,' he says. By that stage, he expects to have fully reorganised Dowty, creating a lean supplier focused on four main areas: landing gear, engine rings, propellers and hydraulics. That strategy has so far seen the workforce cut by 25 per cent to 4,200, the removal of several management layers and the transfer of its Polymer Engineering business to John Crane. The central plank of the restructuring, however, has only just been completed. Encouraged by TI, Dowty has joined with Messier-Bugatti - the subsidiary of Snecma, the French aero-engine manufacturer - to form the world's biggest landing gear manufacturer. Together, the Messier-Dowty joint venture has annual sales of Pounds 250m and 2,300 employees. More importantly, it is the sole landing gear supplier to Airbus and serves a further 20 international manufacturers. 'This will be the driving force behind Dowty,' says Mr Edwards. 'It will enable us to grow even in a flat market.' Profits at the Anglo-French venture could also be enhanced by its ability, unlike its US rivals, to adapt its technology for new customers. Menasco and Cleveland Pneumatic, the largest US landing gear companies, manufacture to patterns owned by customers such as Boeing, whereas Messier-Dowty retains its intellectual property rights. This should allow the joint venture to exploit expertise gained in serving manufacturers such as Airbus, while retaining sole supplier status for spares and repairs. That expertise has enabled Dowty to win new contracts on civil and defence programmes, including the Canadair Global Express business jet and the F-18 US Navy fighter-attack aircraft. Sir Christopher claims such orders, worth more than Pounds 250m in the past 18 months, show how far Dowty has come in embracing the TI culture. 'The challenge has been to bring a marketing culture into an engineering company,' he says. 'I've been at TI for eight years and I'm only just getting the message across.' For Dowty, that has meant cutting jobs; winning new civil customers to offset reduced spending on military aircraft and persuading airlines that they can no longer afford to defer new orders. City analysts, however, warn that TI may find it more difficult to extract cost reductions and introduce a new culture at Messier. As part of the Snecma group it has been used to state subsidies and a government pay formula. Sir Christopher predicted that such problems would be ironed out by Mr Edwards, who has formerly worked with a number of current Messier executives at GE Aerospace. 'We have been through the worst,' he says. 'Passenger traffic is growing and aircraft are getting older; the airlines will have to start ordering soon.' His hopes depend on carriers investing operating profits in new aircraft. Although such investment is by no means certain, the TI chairman is confident that it will make Dowty an equal partner in the engineering group. 'It has every prospect of being a world class business with a global network and customer base. The prospects for growth and improved financial results are very exciting.'</p>

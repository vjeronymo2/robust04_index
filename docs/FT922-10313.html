			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Judgment day for City of Angels: An eyewitness account of Los Angeles in turmoil THE SMELL of smoke and distant shouting was the signal that a violent demonstration was in progress outside the headquarters of the Los Angeles police department. The court acquittal of four white policemen filmed on video brutally beating a black motorist was only the latest spark to set an American city burning. When the protesters came into view, people with their shirts off were dancing up to the flames of a burning kiosk. The front doors of the police station were smashed. The crowded chanted : 'No justice, no peace.' A black cyclist stood watching the fire. 'I came for a demonstration, not a fight,' said Robert Collins. His wife had resigned from the police force after seeing too many beatings, he said. Mr Collins was sympathetic with the demonstrators' rage, saying he had been arrested repeatedly based on his skin colour. Night workers stood watching at City Hall nearby as the crowd began to move. When rocks and bottles were thrown, a policewoman shouted to her colleagues: 'Everybody inside.' She locked the main doors to City Hall and all garage doors were quickly closed. A short time later she let in two women reporters who had run from the criminal court across the street. In a press room on the 14th floor of the criminal court, they had smelt smoke and ran, in a panic, down 14 flights of stairs. In the lobby of the criminal court they found police officers who escorted them out of the building. All the lobby windows had been smashed, and smoke from burning shrubs filled the first few floors of the court house. Safely inside City Hall, they watched as the turbulent crowd led by five young men went down the street, smashed windows, overturned cars and set them on fire. In driving to a hospital a mile south, the crowds's wake was evident. Huge panes of windows had been broken out of banks and the Los Angeles Times building, leaving venetian blinds and chairs askew. Firefighters were spraying water on an overturned car, filling the canyon between buildings with white smoke. A news kiosk had been overturned and burnt to a cinder. In the hospital waiting room a large black man in shorts waited patiently with a bloody bandage around his calf. He had been shot. Another woman was wheeled in, and she weakly handed her insurance papers up to the receptionist. She said she had been shot in the foot. A local resident, Mrs Delores Hill, said a liquor store where her husband bought cigarettes had been looted and burned. The shopkeeper had become a friend, she said. 'It's like a family,' said Mrs Hill. 'The neighbourhood family has been wiped out.' As looting went on unchecked in some areas, outnumbered police stood helplessly. 'They're taking advantage of the situation to come and have a shopping spree,' said a police sergeant who refused to give his name. Many of the establishments looted belonged to Koreans, who have increasingly come to dominate business in black neighbourhoods, fuelling resentment among residents. But blacks also suffered heavily. 'They've looted and burned my store,' said Michael Stennis, owner of a fried chicken outlet. 'My family's been in this area for 35 years. We're black. It's senseless.'</p>

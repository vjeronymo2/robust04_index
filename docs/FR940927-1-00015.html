			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background on the Oklahoma Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program. General background information on the Oklahoma program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Oklahoma program can be found in the January 19, 1981,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (46 FR 4902). Subsequent actions concerning Oklahoma's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 936.15, 936.16, and 936.30. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated February 17, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. OK&hyph;959.01). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment in response to the required program amendments at 30 CFR 936.16 (a) through (i). Oklahoma proposed to amend the Bond Release Guidelines that are referenced in subsections 816.116(a) and 817.116(a) of the Oklahoma rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 8, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (59 FR 10770), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK&hyph;959.06). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on April 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns with Oklahoma's proposed revisions to the Bond Release Guidelines. OSM notified Oklahoma of these concerns by letter dated May 20, 1994 (administrative record No. OK_959.10). Oklahoma responded in a letter dated July 21, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory information (administrative record No. OK&hyph;959.11). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the July 21, 1994, revisions to the proposed amendment in the August 9, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (59 FR 40505) and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK&hyph;959.16). The public comment period closed on August 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated September 2, 1994 (administrative record No. OK&hyph;959.19), Oklahoma, at its own initiative in response to the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, Oklahoma State Office (SCS), August 29, 1994, comment letter (administrative record No. OK&hyph;959.18), submitted a revised amendment. Oklahoma proposes revisions to the Bond Release Guidelines in Appendices A, F, and O, concerning, respectively, the definition of ``productivity,'' the method of sampling for production on pastureland and grazingland, and the methods for calculating a technical standard for productivity on lands reclaimed for use as pastureland and grazingland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, Oklahoma proposes to revise the definition of ``productivity'' to refer to the amount of total, rather than harvestable, biomass. Also, with respect to the method of production sampling, Oklahoma proposes to (1) recommend that pastureland or grazingland with a predominance of warm season species be clipped during September or October and cool season species be clipped during May or June and (2) require that vegetation be clipped to ground level rather than within approximately two inches of ground level. Lastly, with respect to the calculation of technical standards, Oklahoma proposes (1) to require for pastureland that SCS soil productivity figures expressed in animal unit months (AUM's) be converted to pounds per acre by multiplying the AUM's by 1560 and (2) to clarify for grazingland that clipping for productivity is a direct comparison to the SCS soil productivity figures expressed in pounds per acre. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters addressed the question of funding for replacement housing. One recommended that such funding be built into the Section 5(h) Program itself, while another suggested a priority for Major Rehabilitation of Obsolete Projects (MROP) funding. The Department has not adopted those recommendations. Although special funding priorities for replacement housing in connection with Section 5(h) homeownership plans may be established in the contexts of the other HUD programs from which the funding becomes available, no provision for such funding is incorporated in the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that the regulation set a time limit on the actual provision of replacement housing. In recognition of the different factual situations that may affect the time required to have replacement units ready for occupancy, the Department believes that it would be unwise to set a rigid time limitation by regulation. However, reasonable time frames for this and all other major steps must be established in the timetable to be included in the homeownership plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter argued against the flexibility afforded by the interim rule for the HA to address the community's current priority housing needs, urging that the regulation impose a rigid requirement to replace with units of the same sizes as those sold, regardless of current needs. The Department believes that such rigidity would risk absurd results, in those local situations where identical replacement would be at odds with intelligent prioritization by the HA of the community's current housing needs. One commenter urged that the replacement housing requirements be applied retroactively to plans approved or pending before publication of the interim rule. That point is addressed in paragraph (d) of this section, which, as in the interim rule, reflects the legislative mandate in Section 5(h) of the Act that the replacement housing provisions shall not apply to ``applications'' (proposed homeownership plans) that were submitted to HUD prior to October 1, 1990_the effective date of the legislation that added the replacement requirement to Section 5(h). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 906.17&blank;(Records, Reports and Audits) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;906.17 of the PHA rule only ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Records, reports and audits <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), language has been added to specify that, as evidence of compliance with fair housing and equal opportunity requirements, the sale and financial records maintained in the files of the PHA must contain information on the racial and ethnic characteristics of purchasers. (No such requirement applies to Indian housing.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 905.1018/906.18&blank;(Submission and Review of Homeownership Plan) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraph (b) of &sect;&sect;905.1018/906.18 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submission and review of homeownership plan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the phrase, ``in a format prescribed by HUD,'' has been inserted. While allowing for due flexibility, HUD will issue administrative instructions and guidelines regarding the format and processing of homeownership plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 905.1020/906.20&blank;(Content of Homeownership Plan) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;&sect;905.1020/906.20 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Content of homeownership plan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the order of some items has been changed, for a more logical sequence that places administrative items after those that describe the principal provisions of the plan. In the PHA rule only, a provision on affirmative marketing (applicable only if the plan allows purchase of vacant units by families who are not public housing residents or already on the PHA's waiting lists for those programs) has been added to paragraph &sect;906.20(c). (There is no affirmative marketing requirement for IHAs.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 905.1021/906.21&blank;(Supporting Documentation) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraph (a) of &sect;&sect;905.1021/906.21 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Supporting documentation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the final rule explains that the purpose of the property value estimate is merely to assist HUD in determining whether the plan adequately addresses the risks of fraud and abuse and the potential for windfall profit. For this item of supporting documentation, a rough estimate is sufficient, backed by information to support its reasonableness. Submission of a formal appraisal is not required at this point, because the Department does not believe that such an expense is justified for the purpose of HUD review of the proposed homeownership plan. (Note, however, that this is a matter involving only the initial process of preparation and review of the HA's proposal. It is not intended to contradict the rule's separate requirement, in &sect;&sect;905.1014(e)/906.14(e), for the appraisal of individual dwelling units at the point of sale, made with the distinct purpose of calculating the amount of resale profit that would be payable to the PHA by the individual purchaser.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 906.21(f)&blank;(Nondiscrimination Certification) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the PHA rule only, language has been inserted in &sect;906.21(f)_the requirement for the PHA's nondiscrimination certification_to add citations to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11063, and implementing regulations. (The parallel provision of the IHA rule (&sect;905.1021(f)) remains unchanged, citing the different nondiscrimination requirements that apply to Indian housing under &sect;905.115.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Other Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter observed that the interim rule contained no explicit mention as to whether the Section 5(h) authority can be used in conjunction with other public housing homeownership programs, such as HOPE. Such questions will be addressed in the context of the other programs involved, on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was also observed that the interim rule contained no explicit mention of whether Section 5(h) can be used in conjunction with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). The Department believes that this is not an appropriate matter for rulemaking at this time. The Department has not received any Section 5(h) proposals involving LIHTCs, and no determination has been made as to whether it would be possible to design a feasible proposal of that nature. If warranted by future experience, the Department will consider this question for further rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that the rule incorporate a specific list of all statutes and regulations that must be complied with. A list of all of the multitude of Federal statutes and regulations that might possibly be applicable to all of the variety of possible features of all of the many possible types of homeownership plans would be excessively lengthy for inclusion in a regulation. While cross-references are cited for some especially important Federal requirements_notably, as to fair housing and nondiscrimination_the possible variations among local homeownership plans make it impossible to present a standard matrix of applicable legal requirements. As emphasized in the requirement for the HA to include in its supporting documentation a legal opinion from its own counsel (&sect;&sect;905.1021(g)/906.21(g)), it is the responsibility of the HA to ascertain for itself just what requirements of Federal, State, Tribal and local law are pertinent to the facts of each particular homeownership plan. Compliance with State, Tribal and local laws and regulations on real estate transactions is one of the critical points that must be carefully reviewed by the HA's counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

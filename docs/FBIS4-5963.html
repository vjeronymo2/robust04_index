			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 16 Apr (INA)--Foreign Minister  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has stressed the need to implement  Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687 providing for  allowing Iraqi exports to the world after Iraq has honored its  obligations in accordance with relevant UN resolutions.    Al-Sahhaf, currently on an official visit to Malaysia,  explained, in a news conference at the Iraqi Embassy in Kuala  Lumpur yesterday, that the aim of his visit is to brief  Malaysian officials on the latest developments in the relations  between Iraq and the UN Security Council, the effects of the  continued unjust blockade imposed on Iraq since 6 August 1990,  and Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council resolutions.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that Iraq's compliance with  the  relevant UN Security Council resolutions has obviously confused  the UN Security Council. Evidence of this is that a majority of  the permanent members states--such as China, France, and  Russia--as well as nonpermanent member states are demanding that  the economic blockade be lifted as soon as possible and that an  appropriate timetable be set.    Asked about the extent of damage caused by the 30-state  aggression, the minister explained that during the U.S.-led  aggression, approximately 107,000 tonnes of explosives were  dropped on Iraq, equal to six nuclear bombs similar to the type  used by the U.S. forces to bomb Hiroshima at the end of World  War II.    The minister said that all these explosives were dropped on  Iraq's cities and on its civilian and services facilities, thus  causing interruptions in civilian services, especially in the  health, sanitary, and agricultural fields. As a result, he  said, there has been a big increase in the mortality rate among  children and the elderly.</p>

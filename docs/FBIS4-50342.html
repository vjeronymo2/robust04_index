			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 17 (XINHUA) -- A major new ceasefire  agreement for the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh was  signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday [16  May] in Moscow, Russian news agencies reported.    The agreement was signed after talks between Azeri Defense  Minister Mamed Mamedrafi, Armenian Defense Minister Serzhik  Sarkisyan and Samvel Babayan, the military leader of Nagorno-  Karabakh.    Under the agreement, that was mediated by Russia, Azeri and  Armenian forces will stop firing at midnight (2000 GMT) on May  25 and begin a withdrawal, thus forming an exclusion zone.    The agreement calls for the warring sides to pull back to  form an exclusion zone some five to 10 kilometers wide within  which 49 observation posts can be established.    The three officials, along with Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev, agreed to start posting observers in the region  on May 24. Peacekeeping forces from the Commonwealth of  Independent States - the bulk of them 1,800 Russians - will also  be sent to the area of conflict.    In principle, Armenian forces will then start pulling out of  most of the Azeri territory they occupied in a series of  sweeping offensives last year.    The agreement is to be presented to Russian President Boris  Yeltsin this week for his approval, ITAR-TASS reported.    Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region within Azerbaijan, is  populated largely by Armenians.    The war for control of the region is the most protracted  ethnic conflict in the former Soviet Union. A senior  Azerbaijani official disclosed on Saturday that an estimated  20,000 Azerbaijanis have been killed and a further 50,000 maimed  since a separatist movement was launched in 1988, which led to  the declaration of an independent republic in the region in  September 1991.</p>

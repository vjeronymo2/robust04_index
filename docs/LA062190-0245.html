			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BORG MAY LOSE HOUSE OVER DEBT  </P> <P> Former tennis superstar Bjorn Borg's elegant seaside home will be seized and  sold to the highest bidder if he doesn't pay more than $1 million within a  month, court officials said today.  </P> <P> Bailiffs visited Borg's home in a Stockholm suburb Wednesday to assess its  value.  </P> <P> "They were not let in because nobody was home," said Bjorn Edgren, a senior  court official.  </P> <P> Borg reportedly was in Italy to watch World Cup soccer action with his wife,  Loredana.  </P> <P> He was given an extension until July 20 to pay the debt. "Then we can use a  locksmith," Edgren said. The house would then be sold at auction.  </P> <P> The $1.1-million debt owed by Borg's former business partner, Lars Skarke, was  personally guaranteed by the retired tennis star. Skarke was managing director  of Borg's clothing company, which collapsed last year.  </P> <P> Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, said the debt payment was being arranged from  Italy but had been delayed. He said Borg plans legal action against Skarke  aimed at getting the money back.  </P></p>

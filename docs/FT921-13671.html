			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Monday Profile: Courage of a Russian reformer - Yegor Gaidar, the man with the gargantuan task of reshaping the economy There are a lot of risk factors, but they don't guarantee us a fatal blow.' This is how Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first Russian leader to conduct market reform rather than talk about it, calmly sums up his terrifying job. Indeed, the first quality which strikes you about this short, balding, 35-year-old economist, who is deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, is his steely courage. A superpower bristling with nuclear weapons has collapsed, production is in free-fall, hyperinflation looms, the army is large and hungry, and he has very little time to switch the country to a market system after 74 years of Communist rule. 'I feel like a chess player who is not only playing a very difficult match, but who is also surrounded by other players who may at any time sweep my pieces off the board,' this former journalist told the Foreign Correspondents' Association in Moscow over dinner last week. There are ambitious politicians waiting in the wings to exploit the unpopularity of his reforms for personal gain. Some of the country's best economists - including Mr Nikolai Petrakov and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, who themselves were unable to achieve any results while advising Mr Gorbachev - have sourly rallied against him. And with the west still nostalgic about Mr Gorbachev and the union, western states may be tragically late in throwing their full weight behind President Boris Yeltsin's courageous and able government. A former economics commentator for Pravda, the Communist party daily, Mr Gaidar is one of a group of talented young economists who were taught by Professor Stanislav Shatalin, the veteran economist and author in 1990 of the 500-day plan for radical reform. A scion of the Soviet establishment - his grandfather was a popular author of children's books and his father a rear-admiral - Mr Gaidar used his privileged position to spend much of his career studying ways of abandoning the system, before his rapid rise to the top. Although some of the criticism by fellow economists is sour grapes, Mr Gaidar himself is aware that his reforms are far from perfect. But he says simply that there is no alternative, and he is no doubt right. 'After a lengthy period of populist policies which led this economy towards full collapse, we are having to take responsibility for changing course and adopting harsh measures,' he says with a suave smile. 'We never expected such measures to be either painless or politically profitable.' The state can no longer afford to keep up with food subsidies because producer prices are out of control. It cannot print any more money without totally destroying the currency. The financial crisis is too pressing to wait for structural reforms, which should have been started a few years ago by predecessors who preferred to talk about market reforms rather than act on them. Endowed with a sort of Levantine charm - his oriental sounding surname is a nom de guerre picked up by an ancestor - Mr Gaidar has had to acquire basic survival skills quickly. For somebody who has never been in politics before, he has learned fast. After a first gaffe - when he declared that the present central bank chief would be replaced before he had even agreed to go - Mr Gaidar is polite and tactful about everyone, and that includes Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the thuggish parliamentary chairman who has taken no such pains when attacking him. Although still a little clumsy in public, Mr Gaidar is articulate and endowed with a biting sense of humour and a coolly rational mind. Almost comically dwarfed by the rostrum from which he defended his policies in parliament last week, Mr Gaidar warned deputies that the greatest threat to his reforms was that of panic. He said that it would be panic to reimpose price controls, loosen credit policy, increase public spending, give in to limitless pay claims and lower taxes at a time when financial stabilisation was a key priority. With price liberalisation under way, the government is getting to grips with privatisation and the next stages of financial stabilisation (including a tight budgetary and monetary policy). It also has to deal with the defence industry's conversion to civilian uses - defence procurement this year is down to 15 per cent of last year's level. The task is gargantuan, but not hopeless. The Russian people, exhausted by five years of wavering, may well give this government a chance, simply because it is taking action. Mr Gaidar, who leaves his government dacha at 7.30am and gets home from the office at 11.30pm, is putting everything into the job. 'I have no news of how my family is doing because I hardly ever see them.' Unlike previous Communist administrations, this government is not only serious about market reforms, but competent and well-advised. Mr Yeltsin has so far stoically stood by the government he appointed last October. But the Russian government's pleas for massive financial help to achieve results - going behind humanitarian aid which will be discussed in Washington later this week - should not be discarded as in the past. Much of the government's success depends on its ability to keep the population fed with basics such as bread, and to cushion it against the worst effects of reform until market mechanisms can begin to take effect. In contrast to the chaos and back-biting of the previous administration, this government is also refreshing for its unity - the result of Mr Gaidar's insistence that he should bring like-minded colleagues, many of whom are his friends, into office with him. Their straightforward businesslike approach - 'they want to create a relationship of trust with the west,' as one diplomat explains - has cheered western interlocutors. However, they are not without their domestic critics. Reproaching them for their youth and lack of political experience, Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, an Afghan war hero with no knowledge of economics, recently referred to the cabinet as 'little boys in pink shorts'. The problem with Russia, as it tries to switch to market economics after decades of socialist planning, is that its older people tend to have the wrong kind of experience for such an undertaking. It seems to be only the younger generation that can adapt to both new ideas and new methods of work  -witness the rise of the young economist, Mr Yavlinsky, to chief Soviet economic strategist after the coup. Such a generation gap is not new in Russia. Ivan Turgenev, the great Russian writer, captured a similar divide in the 19th century with Fathers and Sons, a novel contrasting the ineffectual older generation - looking for change but tied to the old regime - and young radicals attached to western ideas. This has produced the striking sight of Mr Yeltsin, the former party boss, shielding with his personal authority a government whose policies he may not understand, but which he has embraced intuitively. The fear is that he will lose his nerve if these policies cannot show results quickly enough; hence the feverish attempts to make the reforms irreversible. 'The problem is not whether Gaidar lasts - because he will not last - but how long he will last; . . . how long Yeltsin is prepared to give him political support to carry out reforms before he becomes too much of a political liability,' says one western diplomat. 'If he lasts until next autumn that will be ideal and enough. I don't think he expects any more.' Why has Mr Gaidar taken upon himself this role of sacrificial lamb? The answer is probably for a mixture of reasons: ambition - for if he succeeds, he will have earned a name for himself in history; conviction  - not many economists have had the chance to conduct reforms that they have long known to be necessary; and a dose of patriotism no doubt as well.

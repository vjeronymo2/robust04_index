During the meeting, Itsusei Koga, parliamentary vice  minister of the Economic Planning Agency, referred to the  drastic appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar  following the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework talks and  said, "The government needs to formulate clearer plans to expand  domestic demand." During the meeting, one parliamentary vice  minister after another also voiced the need for the government  to quickly take steps to deal with the steep rise in the yen's  value against the U.S. dollar.    Commenting on the impact of the recent sharp rise in the  value of the yen against the U.S. dollar, Eisei Ito,  parliamentary vice minister of the Construction Ministry, said,  "I have no intention of raising questions about the outcome of  the recent Japanese-U.S. summit talks, but if the government  fails to deal properly with the drastic appreciation of the yen,  the package of stimulus measures compiled recently by the  government would have little effect in stimulating the economy."    At the meeting, Toshi Masuda, parliamentary vice minister of  the National Land Agency, stated: "The government should make  public its plans to deal with the recent steep rise in the yen's  value in a way so that other nations can easily understand them.  All government officials should realize the need to reform the  structure of Japan's economy." In this way, he called for a  change in economic policy in order to convert Japan's economy  into an economy driven by domestic demand.    In connection with the issue of opening the Japanese  mobile-phone market, the U.S. Government is poised to slap  sanctions on Japan after confirming "Japan's violation of a  Japanese-U.S. agreement." In commenting on the move by the U.S.  Government, Aogu Matsumae, parliamentary vice minister of the  Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, criticized the U.S.  Government for taking such a step, saying, "The assertion by the  U.S. Government is unreasonable, and the Japanese Government  cannot go along with the request from the U.S. Government."</p>

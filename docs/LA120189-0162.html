			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NO FACE LIFT, IVANA TRUMP SAYS  </P> <P> Ivana Trump asserts that her new, younger appearance is due to a change in her  makeup and hair, not a face lift.  </P> <P> "No! No plastic surgery," the 39-year-old wife of tycoon Donald Trump told USA  Today. "Why? Do I look like I've had plastic surgery?"  </P> <P> "Frankly, yes," USA Today wrote Thursday, noting that "wrinkles around the eyes  and excess chin folds" were apparent in a 1988 photo but not in pictures taken  this year.  </P> <P> Mrs. Trump, president of the Plaza Hotel, said she merely "got rid of all my  makeup. I gave it to my housekeeper. I went from reds to pinks, from rust to  beige. I let my hair grow and I let it be straight."  </P> <P> The former model also said workouts three mornings a week with a personal  trainer has brought her weight down from 114 or 116 pounds to 110 pounds.  </P> <P> "You come into a certain age and you know less is more," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The armed forces of Singapore and the Philippines  will carry out regular joint military exercises and training.    A memorandum of understanding (MOU) formalising the training  arrangement, as well as co-operation between the two sides, was  signed between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the  Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] on Thursday.    The signing of the MOU took place at the Department of  Foreign Affairs Building in Manila between Mr. Roberto R.Romulo,  the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Tan Seng  Chye, Singapore's Ambassador to the country.    Anoa-Singa 2/94 will be the first exercise which will be  held  following this newly signed agreement.    It will be conducted here from May 12-18.    Under the Anoa-Singa series, regular joint land exercises  will be held between the two armed forces, with the venue  alternating between the countries.    The first exercise under this series took place last year in  the Philippines.    Thursday's MOU is, however, not the SAF's first training  agreement with the AFP.    Under an earlier one concluded in 1979, the Republic of  Singapore Air Force [RSAF] was allowed to deploy regular  training detachments at the Clark Air Base.    The RSAF ceased this deployment only when the eruption of  Mount Pinatubo in 1990 made the air base inoperable.    The air force agreement expired subsequently, in December  1991.    The Ministry of Defence said that the signing of the new MOU  affirmed the friendly relations existing between the two  countries and their long-term commitment to closer defence ties  and co-operation between the SAF and the AFP.</p>

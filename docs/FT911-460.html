			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Major pledge on public services MR JOHN MAJOR sought to set out his personal agenda for the general election campaign yesterday with a pledge to unveil this summer the most comprehensive initiative ever launched to improve the quality of public services. Addressing a packed rally to end the Scottish Conservative conference in Perth, the prime minister discouraged speculation that the election could come as early as next month. Earlier, he gently chided journalists for being in a 'hurry' for the election campaign. Senior ministers said it was 'touch and go' whether the Tories would hold Monmouth in next week's by-election. A poor performance at the seat, where the party is defending a majority of more than 9,500, would confirm the cabinet's view that the autumn is the earliest possible time for Mr Major to seek a fresh mandate. Mr Major's speech, building on his proposals earlier this year for a Citizens' Charter to underpin a more efficient public sector, came at the end of week which has seen government and opposition locked in a bitter pre-election battle. Attempts by the Tories to push Labour on to the defensive over its tax and spending - emphasised again by Mr Major yesterday - have been hampered by the continuing political row about the impact of the health service reforms. Even as Mr Major was speaking, Mr Neil Kinnock was completing a week of assaults on the Tories' health service reforms at a rally in the Monmouth constituency. Calling on voters to signal their dissent by voting 'no' to the government, the opposition leader launched a fierce personal attack on the prime minister for his part in formulating Tory policy during his time in government. Mr Major, in a move designed to put in place one of the central building blocks of his election manifesto, said he would publish later this summer a white paper on the Citizens' Charter. It will include a mixture of incentives for public sector workers to deliver better services and measures to compensate consumers who receive poor treatment. Mr Major cited the regulatory framework for the performance of privatised industries such as telecommunications and gas supply as a model for services which remain in the public sector. The charter programme would have four main strands: more competition and privatisation; improved incentives and penalties to improve performance; new inspectorates; and, where possible, mechanisms for direct compensation to consumers. If the general election date is pushed back further into 1992, Mr Major plans to introduce legislation in the autumn to implement the charter. In a reference to the furore over the health service, the prime minister said he remained determined to push ahead with reforms which provided better patient care by ensuring that NHS resources were properly spent. He said Labour's plans on public spending and National Insurance contributions could add as much as 10p to the present 25p basic rate of tax. He sought to build on the Tories' recent modest recovery in Scotland by announcing plans to inject a further Pounds 15m aid into the depressed region of Lanarkshire.

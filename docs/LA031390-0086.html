			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIOUX CITY CRASH PROMPTS FAA ORDER TO ALTER DC-10S  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday ordered air carriers to modify  all DC-10 jetliners' hydraulic systems, hoping to make them less vulnerable to  the kind of crippling accident that last year caused the fiery crash of a  commercial aircraft.  </P> <P> The FAA's order came in direct response to the July 19 destruction of a United  DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa. In that accident, the plane's tail engine exploded,  severing the three independent hydraulic lines that powered all of its controls  and sending the aircraft toward a cartwheeling crash landing that killed 112 of  the 296 people aboard.  </P> <P> In a statement, the FAA said placing electronic shut-off valves and check  valves in the hydraulic system "would keep the hydraulic fluid from leaking out  in the event hydraulic lines in the tail are cut by flying debris, as was the  case in last July's accident."  </P> <P> Such a change, the statement said, would "preserve enough hydraulic power  following damage to the system to enable the flight crew to safely fly and land  the airplane," even if all three hydraulic lines were severed in the tail  section.  </P> <P> The FAA's order follows design changes recommended for the airliner by its  manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp., of St. Louis. It is likely to be given  final approval after a period of public comment ending May 1, after which  airlines would have six months to make the modifications in DC-10-10s and a  year for all other DC-10 models.  </P> <P> The DC-10-10 is the DC-10 model most widely in use for domestic flights. It is  similar to McDonnell Douglas' five other design variants but has a  comparatively shorter range, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> The 130 DC-10-10s in service are first in line to be modified because "they  are, unfortunately, the aircraft identified with the Sioux City accident," said  Steve Swinney, a spokesman for Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas' Long  Beach-based component that will coordinate the modification with the airlines.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas and the FAA estimate that the cost to modify each of the 243  U.S.-registered DC-10s, including 59 KC-10s in use by the military, will be  $25,000 to $29,000 per plane. The FAA expects foreign aircraft authorities to  follow its example in ordering the modification of the 185 foreign-registered  DC-10s in service.  </P> <P> United Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, the pilot during the Sioux City disaster who is  widely credited for having saved the lives of most passengers aboard, has told  investigators that the only way he had been able to turn the plane was by  increasing the thrust of one of the wing-mounted engines and decreasing it in  the other. However, he recalled, the plane had been sapped of hydraulic fluid  and had no way to get its nose up.  </P> <P> With the FAA's proposal for less vulnerable hydraulics, the pilot of a DC-10  suffering comparable damage still would lose control of most of the  tail-mounted controls -- the rudder, which turns the airliner, and the  elevators, which help control climb and descent.  </P> <P> But other controls, such as the wing-mounted ailerons that allow the pilot to  keep the plane level, would remain operable, the FAA said. So would the wing  flaps, which primarily slow the aircraft when landing.  </P> <P> Also, if the system controlling the horizontal stabilizer trims in the plane's  tail was left intact, the FAA said, the crew could control the angle and rate  of descent.  </P> <P> The FAA already is under way with an ultrasonic inspection for possible  microscopic defects in DC-10 engine fan disks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> INVENTORIES RISE; PRODUCTION CUTBACKS EXPECTED  </P> <P> "The implication is that production is going to slow some more in the second  half of the year," said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital  Markets in New York.  </P> <P> "It could imply a small inventory correction in the second half," said James  Annable, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.  </P> <P> The May business activity produced a slight increase in the ratio of  inventories to sales. It was 1.5, meaning it would take 1 1/2 months to exhaust  inventories at the May sales pace. The ratio was 1.49 in April and 1.51 in  March.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that the buildup was most felt in the retail area, where the  economy has slowed the most as the Federal Reserve tightened credit to contain  inflation. Inventories were up 0.9%, compared to a sales decrease of 0.1%.  </P> <P> "I'm starting to wonder whether retailer inventories are getting out of hand,"  said Michael Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York. "The numbers  suggest they're growing a little too fast."  </P> <P> The automobile industry, which has seen new car inventories swell, already has  reduced production at some factories. The Commerce Department said auto  inventories rose 0.9% in May while sales dropped 1.8% from April.  </P> <P> But even without the automobile category, inventories rose 0.9% in May.  </P> <P> Other major inventory increases were noted at department and clothing stores,  Steinberg said. Overall, general merchandise inventories rose 2.2%.  </P> <P> All categories showed increased inventories in May, however.  </P> <P> In addition to the 0.9% increase in the retail area, manufacturers' backlogs  were up 0.6% while wholesalers' buildup was 0.8%. Inventories were 8.1% above  the level in May, 1988.  </P> <P> Wholesalers registered the only sales increase in May, up 0.5%. Manufacturers'  sales fell 0.2% and retailers' were down 0.1%. Sales rose 8.2% over May of last  year.  </P></p>

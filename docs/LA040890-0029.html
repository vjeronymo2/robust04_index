			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUP KITCHENS PROVIDE A RARE COMMODITY: HOT MEALS;  </P> <P> FOOD: DOZENS OF GROUPS DONATE GROCERIES TO THE POOR, BUT THAT IS OF LIMITED USE  TO PEOPLE WITHOUT COOKING AND STORAGE FACILITIES. ONLY THREE AREA AGENCIES  REGULARLY SERVE PREPARED FOOD.  </P> <P> After meticulously cleaning a plastic tray of its spaghetti, bread and salad on  a recent sunny afternoon, Troy Tutt sat back on a bench outside the House of  Yahweh, a Lawndale soup kitchen, and summed up one of the problems facing the  hungry and homeless around the South Bay.  </P> <P> "Some people don't remember -- I don't have a house, so I don't have a  refrigerator, or a stove, or even silverware and a can opener," said Tutt, a  homeless man wearing a cast on his arm. Tutt said he lost his job and home  after he was hit by a car and was unable to work. "That's why I come here."  </P> <P> Tutt's observation echoes what homeless advocates say about the problems  homeless people face when it comes to finding food: Dozens of South Bay  churches, volunteers and government agencies dole out tons of flour, canned  goods and other foodstuffs to poor people with places to prepare the food, but  only a handful of agencies serve prepared food.  </P> <P> For many homeless people, receiving a bag of groceries can be as frustrating as  it is helpful.  </P> <P> "I went to another place I heard about in Torrance where they gave out  groceries. But that was hard, because I had nowhere to fix the food," said a  man at the House of Yahweh who asked to be identified only as Howard. "If I  don't get it here, I can sometimes go to stores where they are throwing out  (bread). If not, I just go hungry."  </P> <P> Though many South Bay organizations began feeding poor and homeless people in  the early 1980s, some have closed their doors in recent years because of crime  problems or because the numbers of volunteers began to drop. Others have  refocused on more time-consuming counseling and referral services, forcing them  to reduce the numbers of people they feed.  </P> <P> The House of Yahweh, which serves about 150 people every day, is one of only  three agencies in the South Bay that regularly serves hot meals. The Crossing  in San Pedro feeds about 150 people four times a week. And the Beacon Light  Mission in Wilmington feeds up to 80 people nightly.  </P> <P> Homeless advocates estimate there are hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of  homeless in the South Bay, but operators of soup kitchens do not know how many  of their clients fall into that category. Although firm numbers are elusive,  social workers say the need for food is increasing.  </P> <P> "Many of the people come in here on Thursday and say they have not eaten since  they were here last Saturday," said Edwin Kise of The Crossing, a group  composed of volunteers from 16 San Pedro churches that feeds and ministers to  the poor and homeless every Thursday through Saturday.  </P> <P> Soup kitchens face a host of obstacles: inadequate facilities to serve  increasing numbers of people, few volunteers willing to make a long-term  commitment and complaints from neighbors that they attract unsavory elements to  the neighborhood. Those pressures have forced many groups to end or curtail  feeding programs in recent years.  </P> <P> St. Joseph's Table in Wilmington, which opened four years ago and at times fed  more than 100 people a day, gradually scaled back operations to two days a week  because of a string of robberies and security problems. Early in March, two  more robberies left the program without cooking utensils, forcing it to end the  meal service altogether.  </P> <P> "We are really disheartened. There is still a great need for this kind of  service in Wilmington," said Carol Smetzer, who coordinated the soup kitchen's  activities for Catholic Charities. Smetzer said the agency is evaluating  whether to reopen the kitchen, but that it may not be feasible.  </P> <P> Some relief workers say they do not have enough volunteers to handle the work  entailed in preparing food for increasing numbers of homeless.  </P> <P> "Community interest is hard to maintain," said Carolyn Olney, program  coordinator for Food Partnership, a Carson group that trucks donated food to  shelters and soup kitchens. "It is very difficult to keep up private sector  support. What was once considered an emergency food problem has now become a  chronic problem."  </P> <P> Olney said a decrease in government donations of foodstuffs such as cheese and  butter has also placed more of the food supply burden on private citizens, who  often cannot keep up donations over the long term.  </P> <P> Many groups, sensing the impossibility of feeding all the homeless in their  areas, have begun to focus their efforts on specific populations of homeless,  such as the mentally ill and women with children.  </P> <P> Crossroads in Redondo Beach, a branch of the Didi Hirsch Mental Health Center  in Culver City, distributes sandwiches and coffee two days a week to mentally  ill homeless people who gather at local sites such as Alondra Park and Lennox  Park.  </P> <P> Craig Fenner, program coordinator for Crossroads, said providing food gives the  agency a way to contact such people so they can direct them to established  medical and social service programs. Despite the focus on the mentally ill,  Fenner said, staff workers find it hard to ignore other homeless people.  </P> <P> "We are getting distracted by the general homeless population in the South Bay.  It is very hard to pull up in the van and say, 'Sorry, we can't give you  anything because you are not mentally ill,' " Fenner said. Volunteers generally  do not turn away someone who is obviously hungry, he said.  </P> <P> Other groups have turned to a more comprehensive approach after deciding that  their soup kitchens were doing little to strike at the roots of homelessness,  including poor education, drug and alcohol abuse, and unemployment.  </P> <P> The FISH Emergency Center, once an independent organization known as  Harbor-Peninsula FISH (Friends in Service to Humanity) and now a part of the  Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro, is one such group that abandoned the  feed-and-let-be approach. Volunteers used to provide groceries to homeless and  needy people without attempting further services. The group now interviews food  recipients to help volunteers direct them to government programs.  </P> <P> "We no longer see ourselves as primarily a distributor of food as we once did.  It seemed ridiculous for us to give them groceries for two or three days. We  decided it was much more sensible to sit down with the homeless and assist them  with the process of getting more help," said David Christiansen, executive  director of the shelter. "But that obviously slows down the process; it takes  more time and volunteers."  </P> <P> Such efforts are not universally welcomed by the homeless.  </P> <P> Robert Anthony is a homeless man who comes to the Beacon Light Mission in  Wilmington, a shelter that serves meals for up to 80 homeless men every night  after a short chapel service. Anthony said it is the food, not the ministry or  counseling, that draws many homeless people to the mission.  </P> <P> "We all go to services here. But really, when you look around, not that many  guys are paying attention," Anthony said outside the mission one recent night.  </P> <P> The House of Yahweh in Lawndale requires only that participants be sober and  that they wear shirts and shoes when they eat.  </P> <P> "I do want the opportunity to get somewhere, but I don't think I should have to  do something just so I can eat," said Howard at the House of Yahweh. "I used to  work, pay taxes. Hopefully I won't be in this situation too long, but I don't  need anybody pushing me."  </P> <P> Homeless advocates say that people with long experience on the street are adept  at finding food when no shelter or soup kitchen is available.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody would necessarily die if we stopped feeding," said  Fenner of Crossroads. "They are very resourceful at finding food. They know  when certain restaurants dump food. They know which bins at stores have  leftover food and which don't."  </P> <P> But homeless advocates say their clients sometimes turn to crime in order to  feed themselves. Some predict that the problem will grow worse as the numbers  of homeless increase and food resources dwindle.  </P> <P> "They are going to have to steal for food, beg for food, sell drugs for food,  unless we start to do more," said Richard Kennedy, executive director of the  Employment Readiness and Support Center in Carson, which houses and feeds 22  homeless people.  </P> <P> "We would like to run a soup kitchen facility, but we just don't have the time  and resources to devote to that. I'm afraid there are very few people out there  who realize this problem exists. If all those people could help, we might get  somewhere."  </P></p>

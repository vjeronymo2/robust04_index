			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEAD, PENWARDEN LOST EARLY, SANTANA FALLS TO GROSSMONT  </P> <P> Santana High School knew it was in trouble when Grossmont's Erik Weichelt  returned the opening kickoff 69 yards to set up a two-yard touchdown run by  Keith Price 2 1/2 minutes into the game.  </P> <P> The Sultans may have readied themselves for a Grossmont offense that had  outscored its previous three opponents, 153-10. But Santana was not prepared  for what happened on its first offensive play of the game.  </P> <P> Andy Penwarden, the second-leading rusher in the county, was gang tackled after  a two-yard gain. Penwarden went back to the huddle, but when the second play  started, he just stood in the backfield, holding the right side of his back.  </P> <P> Two yards was all Penwarden would end up with for the night, as he was  eventually taken to the hospital with a possible kidney injury or fractured  vertebrae. And the Sultans did not fare much better as No. 6 Grossmont (8-0-1)  scored on its first six possessions for a 41-0 victory that virtually decided  the Grossmont 2-A League championship.  </P> <P> With Penwarden out, Santana (5-2-1) not only lost its leading rusher but also  its leader. Santana never seemed to recover emotionally, and a dominating  Grossmont defense became even more so.  </P> <P> "I think more than anything it was an emotional let down for Santana,"  Grossmont Coach Judd Hulbert said. "But it's awful hard to run against our  defense."  </P> <P> Grossmont proved that point by holding Santana, which was averaging 387 yards  rushing per game, to 87.  </P> <P> "We want to shut down every team we play," said defensive lineman Dave Park.  "We wanted to prove we could do it to any team, anywhere, any time."  </P> <P> Keith Price finished with 168 yards and four touchdowns on 23 carries to lead  the Grossmont offense. The Foothillers scored on their first six drives and  looked as if they would score on its seventh when Price fumbled at the Sultan  five.

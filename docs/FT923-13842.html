			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure rises to Pounds 7.8m REDUCED overheads helped Stanley Leisure Organisation, the betting shops, casino and snooker clubs group, increase pre-tax profits by 10 per cent, from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 7.8m, for the year to May 3. Turnover increased from Pounds 187.6m to Pounds 203.3m. Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said it continued to be difficult to improve sales in the two main divisions of racing and casinos, with the effects of recession still apparent. The casino division produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.9m, compared to Pounds 5.3m, as margins improved and overhead costs were tightly controlled. Profits from racing inched ahead from Pounds 6.12m to Pounds 6.22m. The average number of shops trading during the year increased by 7 per cent to 325, reflecting the acquisition in November of the 25 Mawdsley shops for Pounds 4.3m. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.3m related to the loss on the disposal of the printing division. A proposed final dividend of 3.3p makes a total of 5.2p (4.85p). Earnings per share rose from 14.4p to 15.4p. There is a 1-for-4 scrip issue.</p>

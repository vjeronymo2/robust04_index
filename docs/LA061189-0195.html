			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISMISSING IMPERIALISM  </P> <P> If ever there was a biased, distorted and self-serving review of a book it is  Phillips' arrogant dismissal of Parenti's "The Sword and the Dollar." To  paraphrase Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "The mind of a Conservative is like  the pupil of the eye. The more light shed, the greater the contraction."  </P> <P> Phillips is offended by Parenti's preoccupation with United States policies and  failure to condemn those of the Soviet Union. I don't believe that was  Parenti's objective. He probably thought that the condemnation of the Soviets  was left in better hands, i.e., those of Pat Buchanan, George Will, Henry  Kissinger, et al. I am certain that Phillips does not consider these writers  biased when they excoriate the policies of the Soviets while exculpating us,  the good guys.  </P> <P> Phillips also takes a sideswipe at Parenti's Ph.D. One wonders why. To  Phillips, the book is terra incognita. The only thing Phillips did not accuse  Parenti of was Willie Horton's furlough.  </P> <P> EDMUND MORRIS  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA  </P></p>

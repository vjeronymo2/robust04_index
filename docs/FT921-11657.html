			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Anger as schools bill guillotined - Education THE government last night curtailed debate on its Education (schools) Bill, accusing Labour of trying to delay its progress, David Owen writes. The guillotine means that the bill, which includes controversial provisions for schools to start choosing their own inspectors, will return to the Commons to complete its report stage today. Labour responded furiously to the move, claiming it revealed that the government was desperate to 'get the bill into the House of Lords' to meet its election timetable. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow Commons leader, challenged the government to 'just announce the election date now.' He said it was 'complete nonsense' to charge Labour with filibustering when there were 31 government amendments on the order paper. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, said the Opposition had never asked for more than a single day's debate on the measure. What had happened, he said, was that well into the debate there was an indication that Labour was not prepared to see it through in one day. The bill now displaces a scheduled discussion on the 1992-93 revenue support grant orders for local councils. This debate will be delayed until next week.</p>

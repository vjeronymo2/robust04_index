			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kobe Steel forced to cut profits forecasts KOBE Steel, a leading Japanese steelmaker, yesterday revised its long-term management plan, sharply cutting profit forecasts for the next three years. Most Japanese steelmakers expect a loss in the first half of this year, and are counting on a recovery in the domestic economy in the second half. Kobe's announcement, however, suggests unexpectedly tough conditions have forced a review of ambitious production and diversification plans. For the year ending March 1996, Kobe had predicted sales of Y1,810bn (Dollars 16.5bn) and a pre-tax profit of Y118bn. However, the company has revised the sales target down to Y1,440bn and the profit figure to Y40bn. Kobe expects to trim its workforce by 9.5 per cent to 18,200 over the next three years, while the payroll in the iron and steel division will be reduced by 15.9 per cent to 7,400. Steel workers are to be transferred to new businesses, although the company is expecting fewer sales from diversification than originally planned. Japanese steelmakers launched a remarkable range of diversification projects during the 1980s, including a mushroom farm and an artificial beach. However, the most ambitious foray was into electronics, in the belief that as steel had been the 'industrial rice' of the past, so semiconductors would be the 'rice' of the future. In its long-term management plan released in December 1991, Kobe had predicted that the electronics and information division would account for about 13 per cent of sales in the year ending in March 1996, up from 6 per cent last year. However, that target has been revised to 9 per cent, which includes sales at its property development arm. Over the next three years, Kobe expects capital spending to be around Y60bn annually, down by half from investment during the 1990-92 period.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Docklands trust is withdrawn OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the property company developing Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, has withdrawn its Pounds 215m Cabot Square Trust, the largest enterprise-zone trust yet launched. The decision results from the impact of the general election on the Finance Act. The shortened act omitted some provisions that extended enterprise-zone tax relief to include occupied buildings which were crucial for the trust's success. Olympia &amp; York said it was 'very disappointed' that the trust could not go ahead. It said there was insufficient time to restructure the trust before the end of the tax year. The transaction might be relaunched when the legislation was enacted. The trust, which was due to buy the Cabot Square building from Olympia &amp; York, would have allowed investors to benefit from the tax allowances in enterprise zones. The Pounds 30m already raised by the trust is being returned to investors. Independent Property Securities, the trust's promoters, had been confident that it would have raised a substantial part of the Pounds 215m target in the last two weeks of the tax year. The trust's progress was hampered, however, by concern about the finances of Olympia &amp; York, which has been forced to withdraw its commercial paper programmes after a loss of confidence among investors. Further controversy stemmed from the lack of detail given about the building's valuation, which sparked an inquiry by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' asset valuation committee. It was concerned that the valuer had not considered the strength of the developer's covenant in making the valuation. The Cabot Square Trust was an ambitious attempt to expand the enterprise-zone trust market, which raised a combined total of just Pounds 150m last year. It was an innovative scheme offering investors an option to sell the building back to the developer after 10 years at a guaranteed sum of Pounds 215m. Property Market, Page 13</p>

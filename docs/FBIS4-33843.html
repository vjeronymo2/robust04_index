			<p>BFN     [Text] The Argentine Government has accepted a Paraguayan  proposal to postpone until 16 July the start of filling the  Yacyreta Dam. This was announced on 8 June at the end of a  meeting at Government Palace between President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy, Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, and  Argentine Ambassador Raul Carignano.

Carignano said President Wasmosy assured him that the Paraguayan  Government will guarantee the fulfillment of the treaty schedule  and that the postponement will not affect the date established  for the first generator to begin operations -- 1 September.</p>

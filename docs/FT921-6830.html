			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading hits Sedgwick DIFFICULT trading conditions in the London insurance market were the main factor in a fall in pre-exceptional profits at Sedgwick Group, the international insurance broker. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 82.4m, compared with Pounds 90.7m before an exceptional charge of Pounds 21.4m reduced profits to Pounds 69.3m in 1990. There was a slight rise in operating income to Pounds 621.9m but the reduction in interest rates resulted in a fall of Pounds 7.2m in investment income, while adverse movements in exchange rates depressed profits by a further Pounds 4.1m. The US subsidiary performed well for a 23 per cent increase in profit despite depressed insurance rates and a slight fall in operating income. However, difficulties in the London insurance market depressed profitability with the results showing a 7 per cent fall to Pounds 43.6m. A contraction in capacity at the London reinsurance market led to a 5 per cent fall in income at EW Payne, the reinsurance broking subsidiary. The fall in profits at the Lloyd's underwriting agent subsidiary's to Pounds 500,000, compared with Pounds 5.2m, reflected the reduction in commission paid by Names in 1988, when the Lloyd's market produced its first overall loss for 20 years. Earnings per share were 12.8p, compared with 10.4p in 1990. A final dividend of 8p is proposed for an unchanged total of 12p. COMMENT Although falling interest rates and the weakness of the dollar are adversely affecting profitability, the good news from yesterday's results is that Sedgwick has costs firmly under control. And with more than 36 per cent of its income generated in the US, the group is well placed to benefit from the long awaited turnround in insurance rates there. Unfortunately that prospect is still somewhat distant judging by the pessimistic views yesterday of Sedgwick's senior executives. Even so with margins in the group's retail worldwide operations improving and rates in some sectors of the London market rising strongly, profits should increase after last year's disappointing outcome. A pre-tax outcome of Pounds 90m is possible, a result, which on today's closing price of 212p, puts the share on a prospective p/e of just over 15, a little less than the average for the sector.</p>

They are the commander of the 51st  Armored Division and Staff Colonel [name indistinct], commander  of the 47th Brigade.    According to the sources, the division commander was killed  in an attack launched by the Islamic Resistance last week  against a military convoy in the area of al-Rumaylah, in  al-Basrah governorate. The sources added that the men of the  resistance inflicted heavy losses on the regime troops and  forced them to retreat to their back positions.    Our sources in al-Basrah marshlands have said that tyrant  Saddam's 47th Brigade has sustained heavy human and material  losses due to the courage and steadfastness of the Islamic  Resistance troops. The sources affirmed that dozens of bodies  were scattered over the battlefield and that the body of the  brigade commander was seen among those of a number of officers  of different ranks.    Our sources in the southern marshlands report the continued  massing of regime troops around the marshlands to prepare for  new attacks against displaced civilians.</p>

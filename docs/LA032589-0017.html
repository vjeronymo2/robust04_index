			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAUCHOS AND BIG WEST HAVE EARNED RESPECT  </P> <P> I want to thank you for the generous, fair and even-handed way in which you  covered the UC Santa Barbara basketball team these past two seasons.  </P> <P> Even though UCSB is not in the greater Los Angeles market, you have recognized  something others have not: It is a significant Southern California program.  Thank you, too, for your improvement in covering the Big West Conference in  general. It is definitely a conference on the way up.  </P> <P> KEITH E. EDWARDS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

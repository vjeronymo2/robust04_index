			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car manufacturers forecast to use 40 per cent more aluminium ALUMINIUM WILL benefit most among the traded metals from developments in car design in the next decade. Nickel will also make big percentage gains from a very low base. But the outlook for copper and zinc is not so positive, suggests the Brook Hunt &amp; Associates consultancy group. It says in a report published today that more than 1m tonnes of aluminium a year will be consumed by new cars and automotive spare parts by 1997-98, a 40 per cent increase from present levels. Some of the gain will be from an increase in car output but Brook Hunt says the average car is likely to contain 30 per cent more aluminium. In percentage terms, the greatest growth in use will be in aluminium body parts, which are forecast to consume more than 100,000 tonnes a year by the end of the decade against 12,000 tonnes in 1990. More significant uses for aluminium in tonnage terms will remain transmission casings, cylinder heads and alloy wheels. However, the report says European car makers are not likely to make a substantial switch to aluminium for engine blocks to save weight, given the generally small size of European car engines. Car producers are being driven to make changes by a renewed emphasis on weight saving, tougher exhaust emission standards and the development of new materials, the report points out. Nickel's main use in cars so far has been as an alloying addition to steel employed in drivetrain applications such as gears. Future use will continue to be in these steel alloys, particularly in stainless steel exhaust systems and in high nickel alloy required for turbochargers, says Brook Hunt. Although nickel use is forecast to increase by nearly 40 per cent by the middle of the 1990s, it is starting from a low base of just over 1 kg a car. Copper already has suffered from the substitution of aluminium, in radiators for example. Copper's use in wiring may fall because of the introduction of multiplexing (in which many components are powered through a single conductor), although no big changes are foreseen until the second half of the decade. In the meantime, says the report, more electrically operated components and electronic engine management systems in high-volume cars should ensure that the amount of copper per car will continue to increase. Brook Hunt says growth in the car industry's consumption of zinc depends on an increase in the use of galvanised steel sheet. The report estimates that about 35 per cent of steel sheet used in car manufacturing in 1990 was galvanised on at least one side. This proportion is forecast to rise to 48 per cent by 2000. Over the same period the use of zinc per car for galvanising is predicted to grow by 65 per cent. This gain will, however, be offset to some extent by losses elsewhere - particularly by the widespread introduction of fuel injection systems using aluminium instead of die-cast carburettors made largely from zinc.

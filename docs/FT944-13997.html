			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Steel traders rekindle interest in Ilva operation Two Italian steel traders have reignited interest in the sale of the flat steels activities of Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel manufacturer, with their attempt to assemble an international consortium to acquire the company. A spokesman for Mr Bruno Bolfo and Mr Vitorio Malacalza yesterday said their consortium could propose an offer for Ilva Laminati Piani (ILP) in the next few days. IRI, the Italian state holding company which owns Ilva, is trying to meet a European Commission deadline of the end of this year for the break-up and sale of the company. In June it agreed the sale of Ilva's special steels business, AST, to a German-Italian consortium for L600bn (Dollars 392m), but no firm offers have been put forward for the much larger flat steels operation. Industry analysts expressed doubt yesterday about the viability of a Bolfo-Malacalza offer, but the appearance of a new potential bidder could accelerate the sale process, just when it seemed becalmed for lack of interest. For example, Lucchini, the private Italian steel manufacturer, is understood to be stepping up discussions with Usinor Sacilor of France about ILP, after Mr Bolfo approached Mr Francis Mer, Usinor's chairman, with his plans last week. Mr Bolfo, who used to work for the export arm of Ilva's predecessor Finsider, and Mr Malacalza claim already to have the support from CSN, the Brazilian steel producer, and the US securities house Smith Barney, which they say would put together funding for a minority stake in ILP. Apart from Usinor, they are also courting Bethlehem Steel of the US and Dofasco of Canada. Press reports suggest an offer could be worth about Dollars 900m. Bethlehem has expressed caution about its involvement with Mr Bolfo, who founded Duferco, an international steel trading company, in 1977. Lucchini has said it would offer industrial backing to ILP, if required. IRI has also been approached by a consortium organised by the Washington-based merchant bank G William Miller, and including local Italian entrepreneurs.

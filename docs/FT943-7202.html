			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures rallied after an uncertain start, responding to a sharp upturn in international bonds and a firmer showing by the dollar. Dealers took the view that both areas were oversold, writes Steve Thompson. The September futures contract opened at 3,185 but ran into selling pressure, unsettled by the recent slide in the dollar and worries about the big US bond auctions taking place yesterday, retreating to what turned out to be the day's low, 3,171, in mid- morning. Thereafter, the contract began to rally with support triggered by a gradual improvement in international bond markets and a strong opening on Wall Street, which was over 20 points higher when London closed. By the close of trading the futures contract had moved up to 3,191, a premium of around eight points to fair value. Dealers said it was set for another move above 3,200. It was another disappointing day in traded options where volume came out at 21,800 lots. The FT-SE option was especially disappointing, dealers said, with turnover reaching only 5,000 contracts. HSBC was the busiest stock option, attracting turnover of 2,206 contracts, reacting to a sharp decline in the underlying shares which were undermined by news that the Hong Kong authorities had withdrawn its latest land auction.</p>

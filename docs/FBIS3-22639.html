			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras, Jan. 24 -- While the West claims to have  almost obliterated leprosy, India has the unique and disturbing  distinction of having more than half the number of leprosy  patients in the world. The reality becomes even starker when  statistics reveal that out of every 10,000 in Tamil Nadu, 11  persons have leprosy and in some tribal pockets in Kerala the  incidence is so high that 30 out of every 1,000 suffer from this  disease which still raises instant revulsion on anybody's face a  manifestation of the stereotyped perception about the disease.    At present, achieving a leprosy-free condition is only a  distant possibility and the plausible target before the  leprologists in the country is to bring the incidence down to  one in 10,000 by the turn of the century. Even this demands  untiring and committed endeavour on the part of leprologists and  depends on various other factors including treatment regimen and  diagnostic facilities, public awareness, authentic information  on the subject, etc. A plethora of information on various  aspects of leprosy was deliberated upon at the 18th biennial  conference of the Indian Association of Leprologists held  recently at Madras.  <H5>  Significant Findings </H5>   About 300 delegates from all over the country and a few from  abroad participated in the conference. Several scientific papers  and findings of various projects on diverse aspects of the  disease were presented of which some findings were very  significant and encouraging, Dr. Simon, Organising secretary of  the conference said. According to one study conducted by Dr. C.  Appanraj, district leprosy officer, Tuticorin, even infants were  found to have been infected by leprosy, defying popular belief  that the incubation period of the causative bacterium was very  long and intra-uterine infection was not possible. The infection  was found even in a two and a half month old baby. This study  warrants that all children with suspicious lesions should be  evaluated, irrespective of their age.    Another study on the effect of Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) on  Women, by Dr. K. Bhaskar Subuddhi of the Gandhi Memorial Leprosy  Foundation, Wardha, Maharashtra, revealed that the eradication  of leprosy would be earlier among women than men. The study  showed that the incidence rate, prevalence rate, relapse rate  and child incidence rate were always less among females. A paper  presented by a group of doctors of B.S. Medical College,  Bankura, West Bengal, showed that 5 percent of the 2,000  patients selected for study were found to be blind either in one  eye or both the eyes. The study reiterated the fact that  although the regimen of MDT had reduced ocular leprosy, many  instances of blindness were still found among leprosy patients.  About 40 percent of them were blind in both the eyes and 68  percent of them curable.    A paper on the new, four week regimen of treatment by Dr.  Amar Kant Jha Amar of the Patna Medical College Hospital  indicated that the method was very effective, well tolerated and  needed wider trials. Various papers covering the entire gamut of  leprosy were also presented and evaluated at the conference.  <H5>  Fresh Cases </H5>   Dr. M.D. Gupte of the ICMR, president of the Indian  Leprologists Association told THE HINDU that still substantial  number of fresh cases of leprosy were being reported. The  findings of the experiment of vaccines, MW and ICRC, currently  being conducted in Tamil Nadu, will be available by 1998 and if  the results were positive it would go a long way in the  eradication of the disease. It is the first study of its kind in  the world. The incidence of single lesion leprosy was  widespread, but 60-70 percent of it healed without treatment, he  said. The experiments on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PRC) and  Molecular Biology were in the preliminary stages and the results  would be useful for the detection of leprosy. The participation  of the younger generation at the conference was encouraging, he  said.    And a piece of advice by Dr. Simon: "Please don't turn the  health visitor away. Anybody can contract the disease, whether  rich or poor, it is completely curable and early detection is  very important for treatment."</p>

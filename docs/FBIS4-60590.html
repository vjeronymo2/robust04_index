			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Betwixt And Between"] </F>   [Text] The visits abroad of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao, have come to acquire an undefinable and ethereal  air of unreality. Some months ago, he visited the UK ostensibly  to witness the signing of an agreement guaranteeing to British  investors certain safeguards against expropriation and the like  which were nothing new and had been Government pollcy for years.  No doubt, he met the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major,  and addressed businessmen and NRIs, but these are akin to the  perks of a dignitary on official visit. Now, his U.S. visit  leaves us wondering, much as little Peterkin was in Robert  Southey's gem of a poem `Blenheim', `What good came of it at  last?' Even those who supported Mr. Rao in his decision, taken  braving the preponderant opinion in the country against the U.S.  visit, must be asking the same que@tion. At least the old  raconteur in the poem had the gumption to say, `That I cannot  tell... But it was a famous victory.' Mr. Rao's vlsit was no  famous victory; it fits no description other than being betwixt  and between.    True to type, Mr. Rao's to-ing and fro-ing from Houston to  Boston to Washington falls into a nebulous category, devoid of  any sharp focus or sense of concrete achievement. He need not  have gone half the way round the world to tell manufacturers and  captains of industry what most of them must have, in any case,  heard many times before. They must have been told, sometimes by  the Prime Minister himself, during their probing mlsslons to  Indla, that the reforms are irreversible, that India is the  largest emerging market, that it is a good country to do  business wlth and that any obstacles brought to notice would be  swiftly attended to. Mr. Rao's address to the Harvard  University audience cannot exactly be hailed as earth-shaking.  The Memoranda of Understanding signed are of no such  significance as to require the Prime Minister to lend the weight  of his presence. The members of the delegation of Indian  businessmen were all persons who knew their way about in the  world and whether any particular bonanzas came their way by  synchronising thelr travels wlth those of Mr. Rao is for them to  declde.    Of course, when a Prime Minister officially visits a  country,  he gets his meed of courtesies and ceremonies. Mr. Rao made  good use of the invitation coaxed out of the U.S. Congress to  address it by buttressing his reiteratlon of India's known  position on contentious issues wlth quotations and parallels in  American hlstory. The reference to the U.S. Supreme Court  judgement of Texas was particularly relishable and apposite.  However, the US Congressmen and Senators are hard nuts to  crack, and while graciously punctuating the speeches of  distinguished visitors in their midst with applause and  according them standing ovations, they still manage to keep  their own counsel and go their own way.    And that leaves Mr. Rao's encounter with the U.S. President,  Mr. Bill Clinton. For all the advance bllling it received as the  grand climacteric of the visit, the outcome of the meeting seems  to have turned out to be a let-down for both parties. That much  was obvious from the body language of both of them at the joint  press conference following their talks. And with Mr. Clinton's  clear indication that there was no narrowing of differences  between the two countries on issues on which the IJS had chosen  to wield the big stick, the one event by which much store was  set could only be said to have misfired. Indeed, it must have  been painfully embarrassing both for the Prime Minister and  those who watched the live telecast of the press conference that  he stood forlorn at the lectern for a full half-an-hour, whlle  the U.S. President was having a fun time answering questions on  subjects that had nothing to do with the occasion.    So, what is there to show for the visit? Mr. Clinton's  agreeing to keep an open mind on India's claims for a permanent  seat on the UN Security Council? His promise of visits by the  U.S. Defense and Commerce Secretaries to India in July and  November? His accepting Mr. Rao's invitation to visit India  himself? The indeterminate continuance of the dialogue for as  long as it takes to arrive at a convergence? Judged with  hard-headed horse sense, the cost-benefit ratio of Mr. Rao's  visit looks like nothing to write home about.</p>

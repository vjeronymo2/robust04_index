			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis described as a big  success the decision by the European Union [EU] summit in Corfu  to include Cyprus in the Union's next expansion. President  Kliridhis expressed Cyprus' thanks for the Greek presidency's  action, which resulted in this success, and referred  specifically to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias, and Alternate Foreign Minister  Theodhoros Pangalos.    Referring to a statement by Rauf Denktas on blocking Cyprus'  course toward the EU, President Kliridhis said the Turkish  Cypriot leader speaks irrationally when he talks about blocking  the course and about a struggle in the spirit of the terrorist  organization TMT [Turkish Resistance Organization].</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Sihanouk ditches plans for coalition government PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the unpredictable Cambodian leader, yesterday angrily renounced his new coalition government only hours after creating it, leaving in a state of confusion the Cambodian and United Nations officials who are responsible for administering the country. The prince abandoned his plans in the face of opposition from the royalist party Funcinpec, led by his son Prince Ranariddh, and suggestions by UN officials that the move amounted to a bloodless coup d'etat. Addressing his father in a fax message as 'most venerable Papa', Prince Ranariddh said he learned of the new government - in which he was supposed to be deputy prime minister - with 'great surprise'. Funcinpec won the largest share of the vote in the election organised by the UN last week, beating the incumbent communist Cambodian People's party, but to the chagrin of Funcinpec the two parties were given equal powers in Prince Sihanouk's short-lived government. The UN has not yet finished counting the votes, and the shape of the new Cambodian assembly, charged with writing a new constitution and forming an internationally recognised government under a UN-backed peace plan, is not yet clear. Prince Ranariddh, who is apparently either in Bangkok or in a Funcinpec enclave on the Thai-Cambodian border, accepted in principle the idea of a coalition, but raised a number of objections. In particular, he said it would be morally impossible for him to sit next to certain senior CPP officials because of their responsibility for murdering innocent Funcinpec members during the election campaign. He said he would be unable to work with Prince Chakrapong, his estranged half-brother who is a CPP leader, because Prince Chakrapong wanted nothing better than his destruction, even his death. Prince Ranariddh also insisted that the CPP declare its acceptance of the election results. Prince Sihanouk responded bitterly in another fax, renouncing his new government and telling his son that he would henceforth leave it to Funcinpec and the CPP 'to assume responsibility for such bloody and tragic events as might afflict our unfortunate fatherland and our unhappy people'. Prince Sihanouk, who normally calls Ranariddh 'my beloved son', addressed him coldly as 'Royal Highness'. Cambodians were bemused by these royal manoeuvres. On the black market, the Cambodian riel soared yesterday morning on news of the coalition to 3,000 riels per dollar from about 4,500 on Thursday, before plunging as the government collapsed. As negotiations continued yesterday between the UN and the various Cambodian factions on an interim arrangement for running the country, diplomats expressed concern that the existing CPP-led administration - which had been delighted by Prince Sihanouk's proposal - would be more reluctant than ever to hand over power. There were also fears that Prince Sihanouk would lose interest in reconciling the rival factions after his abortive attempt this week and would seek refuge at his home in Beijing. 'It's even more unhelpful when he's away,' said one official of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia. Negotiations are likely to continue for some time. In the words of another senior Untac official: 'In Cambodian politics, if you paint yourself into a corner you can all of a sudden tunnel your way right out of the building.'</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee falls despite ICO optimism WORLD COFFEE markets fell back yesterday after rising this week as optimism emerged over progress at talks on a new international coffee agreement. Sentiment was dampened by remarks made in Washington by Mr Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank. He told the Reuters news agency that he was sceptical that an agreement would succeed in reviving the coffee market, which had suffered a sharp decline in prices mainly because of a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. In London the November robusta coffee contract closed at Dollars 797 a tonne, down Dollars 16 on the day, as profit taking emerged. Earlier this week the contract touched a recent high of Dollars 826 a tonne. In late trading in New York yesterday the nearby contract was down 0.70 at 56.10 cents a lb. At these levels, coffee prices are about half what they were when the international coffee agreement collapsed in July 1989. Delegates at the International Coffee Organisation headquarters in London this week appear to have made some headway with their negotiations. They have agreed on the definition of 'universal quota', under which exporting members will send their coffee to all destinations 'without distinction between importing member and non-member countries'. There also seems to be an admission by producers that they will have to bear most of the burden of regulating an export quota system. However, traders and analysts have yet to be convinced that further progress will be made before the talks end next Friday. 'What's coming out of the ICO is very positive, but it's still very difficult to see how they can come up with an agreement. They are making progress, but there are still huge stumbling blocks,' said one trader yesterday.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santa Fe urges rejection of Union Pacific bid Santa Fe Pacific, the US railway company at the centre of competing bids, yesterday advised its shareholders to turn down the latest Union Pacific offer in favour of an agreed merger with Burlington Northern. Burlington's Dollars 3.1bn offer would not be payable until the deal had been approved by federal rail regulators. Union Pacific is offering Dollars 3.3bn and says it will acquire Santa Fe immediately, putting its shares into a voting trust pending regulatory approval. Santa Fe's board said that Union Pacific's bid was 'too uncertain' because it was not clear that the regulators would allow it.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: New issues Monday's 103-point fall in the FT-SE index was not the ideal backdrop to a new equity issue. However, for Trinity Holdings' shares to be priced at a discount of more than 20 per cent to last week's informally indicated level is a measure of the market's caution. Some allowance must be made for pre-placing hype. But the issue probably only got away because a firm order book for this bus and fire truck maker and its high proportion of overseas sales attracted institutional interest. Market volatility is not the only problem facing those wishing to raise new money. The heavy gilt funding programme has also caused indigestion. That problem has recently abated, thanks in part to massive foreign exchange intervention, but it will be back with a vengeance next year. Current projections show that the gilt funding requirement in 1993-94 may be greater than domestic institutions' total cash inflow. Thus there is a real prospect of equity issues being crowded out by gilts. In an ideal world, companies might prefer to wait for solid signs of recovery and lower interest rates so that they can paint a prettier picture for the institutions. In a less than ideal world, those with a good exports story to tell may be tempted to beat the rush.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN AWAKENING TO POWER OF PHOTOGRAPHS  </P> <P> Gordon Parks spent the 1930s working a variety of odd jobs that included  playing piano in a brothel and cleaning up after alcoholics in a Chicago  flophouse. In the mid-1930s, Parks married a St. Paul woman and took a railroad  job where he discovered the power of the camera. Here is Part III of a  five-part excerpt from "Voices in the Mirror," the autobiography of the  renowned photographer.  </P> <P> I applied for a job as a waiter on the North Coast Limited and got it. It was a  fine transcontinental train that ran between St. Paul, Chicago and Seattle,  Wash., which took about four days.  </P> <P> On quieter runs, in between meals, when the wealthy passengers were either  sleeping or consuming alcohol in the lounge cars, I read every magazine I could  get my hands on.  </P> <P> In one that had been left behind by a passenger, I found a portfolio of  photographs that I would never forget. They were migrant workers. Dispossessed,  beaten by storms, dust and floods, they roamed the highways in caravans of  battered jalopies and wagons between Oklahoma and California, scrounging for  work.  </P> <P> The names of the photographers stuck in my mind -- Arthur Rothstein, Russell  Lee, Carl Mydans, Walker Evans, Ben Shahn, John Vachon, Jack Delano and  Dorothea Lange. They all worked for the Farm Security Administration, a  government agency set up by President Roosevelt to aid submarginal farmers.  </P> <P> These stark, tragic images of human beings caught up in the confusion of  poverty saddened me. I took the magazine home and studied it for weeks.  Meanwhile, I read John Steinbeck's "In Dubious Battle" and Erskine Caldwell and  Margaret Bourke-White's "You Have Seen Their Faces." These books stayed in my  mind.  </P> <P> During layovers in Chicago, I began visiting the Art Institute on Michigan  Avenue, spending hours in this large, voiceless place, studying paintings of  Monet, Renoir and Manet. At a Chicago movie house, I watched a newsreel of the  bombing of the United States gunboat Panay by Japanese fighter planes.  Courageously the cameraman had stayed at his post, shooting the final belch of  steam and smoke that rose when the boat sank in the Yangtze River.  </P> <P> When the newsreel ended, a voice boomed over the intercom. "And here he is --  the photographer who shot this remarkable footage!" Norman Alley, the  cameraman, had leaped on the stage to rousing cheers. And I was carried away by  his bravery and dedication to his job. From that moment I was determined to  become a photographer.  </P> <P> Three days later, I bought my first camera at a pawnshop for $7.50. It was a  Voightlander Brilliant. Not much of a camera, but a great name to toss around.  I had bought what was to become my weapon against poverty and racism.  </P> <P> I got a porter's job on the 400, a fast train that ran between Minneapolis and  Chicago.  </P> <P> The 400 allowed me layovers in Chicago. There, visual imagery multiplied  tenfold, with skyscrapers, boats plying Lake Michigan, bridges and the  inner-city canals. But before long I realized that such imagery, although it  was fine for the family album, was hardly the kind to put steak and potatoes on  my family's table. A beautiful sunset over the lake was just a beautiful sunset  -- no more.  </P> <P> Natural instinct had served to aim my sights much higher, and those Farm  Security photographs with all their power were still pushing my thoughts  around. Before long I had deserted the waterfronts, skyscrapers and canals for  Chicago's south side -- the city's sprawling impoverished black belt. And there  among the squalid, rickety tenements that housed the poor, a new way of seeing  and feeling opened up to me.  </P> <P> A photograph I made of an ill-dressed black child wandering in a trash-littered  alley and another of two aged men warming themselves at a bonfire during a  heavy snowfall pleased me more than any I had made. They convinced me that even  the cheap camera I had bought was capable of making a serious comment on the  human condition.  </P> <P> Subconsciously, I was moving toward the documentary field, and Chicago's south  side was a remarkably pitiful place to start. The worst of it was like bruises  on the face of humanity.  </P> <P> A collection of photographs I had taken in the impoverished area of the black  belt came to the attention of the Julius Rosenwald Fund, a cultural foundation  established by its namesake to aid promising blacks and Southern whites.  Writers, painters, sculptors and scholars had been recipients of fellowships --  but never a photographer. I was considered to be promising, so my work was sent  to be judged by a jury of Chicago's most esteemed white photographers and, to a  man, they turned thumbs down.  </P> <P> To allow my application yet another chance, my work was then sent to a jury  composed of painters and sculptors. While I awaited their decision, time  crawled ever so slowly. Worry set in. The postman arrived with nothing but  bills. After three weeks the jury was still out, still feeding my anxiety and  sleepless nights. The fourth week an envelope, with the fund's masthead,  appeared in the small pack of mail. I was fearful of opening it; it  </P> <P> seemed to be shaped with rejection. I handed it to Sally, my wife, so that she  might read the bad news. She tore the envelope open, read its contents and  smiled weakly. "You are a Julius Rosenwald Fellow." The news was astonishing.  </P> <P> Through the prodding of the fund, I was to serve out my fellowship with the  Farm Security Administration, with these same photographers whose work had  beckoned to me when I was a waiter on the North Coast Limited. It was an  extravagant moment as we began packing, and for the next two years Washington,  D.C., would be our home.  </P> <P> I arrived there in January of 1942 with scant knowledge of the place, knowing  only that beneath the gleaming monuments and gravestones lay men who had  distinguished themselves. What I had learned along the way had little to do  with this sprawling city where Washington and Lincoln had been empowered.  </P> <P> Sensing this, Roy Stryker, the photographic mentor at FSA, sent me out to get  acquainted with the rituals of the nation's capital. I went in a hurry and with  enthusiasm. The big blue sky was without clouds and everything seemed so pure,  clean and unruffled. It appeared that the entire universe was pleasured in  peace.  </P> <P> My contentment was short-lived. Within the hour the day began opening up like a  bad dream; even here in this radiant, high-hearted place, racism was busy with  its dirty work. Eating houses shooed me to the back door; theaters refused me a  seat, and the scissoring voices of white clerks at Julius Garfinckel's  prestigious department store riled me with curtness. Some clothing I hoped to  buy there went unbought. They just didn't have my size -- no matter what I  wanted.  </P> <P> In a very short time, Washington was showing me its real character. It was a  hate-drenched city, honoring my ignorance and smugly creating bad memories for  me. During the afternoon my entire childhood rushed back to greet me, to remind  me that the racism it poured on me had not called it quits.  </P> <P> I had gone to a restaurant to eat, to a store to buy clothing and to a movie  theater for enjoyment. And Washington was telling me, in no uncertain terms,  that I shouldn't have done it. Now I was hurrying back to Roy Stryker's office  like an angry wind.  </P> <P> When I reached there, he looked at me for a few moments without speaking. He  didn't have to. The gloom shadowing my face told him everything. "Well," he  finally asked, "tell me -- how did it go?"  </P> <P> I answered him with a question. "What's to be done about this horrible place?  I've never been so humiliated in my life. Mississippi couldn't be much worse."  </P> <P> He rubbed his chin, thinking. "As for that city out there, well -- it's been  here for a long time, full of bigotry and hatred for black people. You brought  a camera to town with you. If you use it intelligently, you might help turn  things around. It's a powerful instrument in the right hands."  </P> <P> He paused, thinking things through for me. "Obviously, you ran into some bigots  out there this afternoon. Well, it's not enough to photograph one of them and  label his photograph bigot. Bigots have a way of looking like everyone else.  You have to get at the source of their bigotry. And that's not easy. That's  what you'll have to work at, and that's why I took you on.  </P> <P> "Read. Read a lot. Talk to the black people who have spent their lives here.  They might help to give you some direction. Go through these picture files.  They have a lot to say about what's happening here and other places throughout  this country. They are an education in themselves. The photographers who  produced those files learned through understanding what our country's problems  are. Now they are out there trying to do something about those problems. That's  what you must do eventually."  </P> <P> Eventually. All well and good -- but I was still burning with a need to hit  back at the agony of the afternoon. I sat for an hour mulling over his advice  and the humiliation I had suffered.  </P> <P> It had grown late; the office had emptied and Stryker had left for the day.  Only a black charwoman remained, but she was mopping the floor in an adjoining  office. "Talk to other black people who have spent their lives here," he had  said.  </P> <P> She was black, and I eased into conversation with her. Hardly an hour had gone  by when we finished, but she had taken me through a lifetime of drudgery and  despair in that hour. She was turning back to her mopping when I asked, "Would  you allow me to photograph you?"  </P> <P> "I don't mind."  </P> <P> There was a huge American flag hanging from a standard near the wall. I asked  her to stand before it, then placed the mop in one hand and the broom in the  other. "Now think of what you just told me and look straight into this camera."  Eagerly I began clicking the shutter. It was done and I went home to supper.  Washington could now have a conversation with her portrait.  </P> <P> Stryker appeared astonished when I laid the enlarged photograph on his desk the  following afternoon. "My God," he said. "You're going to get us all fired." I  smiled, but to myself, knowing I had found a little justice in that sea of  bigotry.  </P> <P> Stryker's advice was sound but not easy to follow. While some black people  talked freely about racial problems in Washington, some, especially older ones,  viewed my curiosity with suspicion. Feeling hopelessly ensnared in the city's  bigoted ways, they looked upon change as an impossibility. Yielding to racism,  they had given up.  </P> <P> Photographing bigotry was, as Stryker had warned, very difficult. It didn't  have a repulsive body with a head of horns. Yet it was there like a stone wall,  revealing itself in a voice, a mannerism or some empirical way.  </P> <P> The evil of its effect, however, was discernible in the black faces of the  oppressed and their blighted neighborhood lying within the shadows of the  Capitol. It was in those shadows that the charwoman lived, and I followed her  through them -- to her dark house, her storefront church; to her small  happinesses and daily frustrations.  </P></p>

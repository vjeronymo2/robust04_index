In a statement read shortly after the expiry of the midnight  GMT deadline as was set in a February 9 ultimatum by the NATO,  Clinton warned that "all parties should be aware that the  ultimatum stands."    "The deadline has not been extended," Clinton said, "NATO  and  the United Nations will continue to monitor compliance extremely  carefully."    White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, who read the  Clinton statement, said "the vast majority of heavy weapons have  either been moved from the zone or placed under UN control."    She was referring to the 20-kilometer heavy weapons  exclusion  zone in Sarajevo.    "Only a handful of areas remain outside UN control and we  expect that very soon most or all of those will be within UN  control," Myers said.    She said the U.S. and allies will continue to monitor the  situations on the ground very carefully.    Clinton congratulated the UN and the NATO allies as well as  Russia for their contributions in the Bosnian peace effort.    He said that "NATO's decision applies to any heavy weapon  attacks on Sarajevo from within or beyond the zone."    On the diplomatic front, Clinton said, U.S. diplomats will  be  working with the warring parties and allies and partners to  transform the potential of peace into reality.    During a 20-minute telephone conversation during the day  between him and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton and  Yeltsin agreed to send their aides to Bonn, Germany for  consultations over Bosnia with others from France, Britain and  Germany on Tuesday [22 February].</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Recession and Gulf war behind Pounds 8.4m Wembley loss WEMBLEY, the international leisure group which owns the national stadium, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.37m for 1991 - broadly in line with its forecast at the time of January's debt-reducing rights issue. Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said recession and the Gulf war had made 1991 a dreadful year but that the perception of debt-financed growth had also changed. Gearing had been reduced to 65 per cent by the rights issue and would fall to about 50 per cent by the current year-end. 'We spent Pounds 250m over six years creating businesses with Pounds 175m of debt,' Sir Brian said. 'The market said this was the wrong level of equity and debt.' Included in the pre-tax loss, a reversal from profits last year of Pounds 13.2m, was a Pounds 7.47m exceptional item. Almost half related to the restructuring of Pacer CATS, the ticketing machine business in the US, and a similar amount related to the write-down of the group's residual interest in its Juliana's night club business. Losses per share emerged at 8.5p (earnings 13.3p). A proposed final dividend of 0.9p makes a 1.8p (2.4p) total. While the company would have been able to maintain its dividend, a reduced level was considered less of a burden and would allow dividend growth in line with expected profits growth. Sir Brian said that even with no improvement in UK economic activity, a number of income sources were on stream this year. Tickets will be on sale for 12 concerts whereas in 1991 the reluctance by performers to travel after the Gulf war cut this to three. Furthermore, legislation has been introduced to allow more live greyhound racing days in the US and the UK and the new Club Royale bingo club is currently showing record attendances. COMMENT Few can blame Wembley for the fact that Whitney Houston, and other stars, decided on State Department advice that flying during the Gulf war was a security risk and postponed her European tour; nine fewer concerts than expected made a nasty dent in the bottom line. But Wembley's investments in exhibition halls and ticketing operations are reducing this historical dependence on filling the stadium. Coupled with the Pounds 6m lower interest charge after January's Pounds 37m debt-reducing rights issue, Wembley should substantially recover after what was a ghastly year. Brokers forecasting pre-tax profits at Pounds 11.9m, give 2.9p of earnings, and a prospective multiple of 12. But there is a need for caution: this time last year Wembley was hugely optimistic and the ground fell from under shareholders' feet. For all Sir Brian's optimism, the group's fortunes are still heavily tied to consumer spending.</p>

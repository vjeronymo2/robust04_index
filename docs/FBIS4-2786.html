			<p>BFN     [Text] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Yunnan Provincial  CPC Discipline Inspection Commission wound up in Kunming  yesterday afternoon. The closing session was presided over by  Lang Dazhong, provincial party committee standing committee  member and discipline inspection commission secretary.    The closing session adopted the "Resolution By the Fourth  Plenary Session of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Discipline  Inspection Commission." The "Resolution" fully affirmed the  province's anticorruption struggle achievements scored since the  Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Committee in August, 1993.    The "Resolution" emphatically stated: The year 1994 is  crucial for Yunnan in implementing and carrying out the spirit  of the 14th CPC National Congress, the spirit of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and also in  building a socialist market economic structure. Therefore, we  should firmly adhere to economic construction as the center;  submit to the overall interests of CPC work; conscientiously  implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Committee in light of actual local  conditions and in accordance with arrangements made by the  provincial party committee; profoundly, protractedly, and  fruitfully push forward the province's ongoing anticorruption  struggle on the basis of the existing achievements in this  connection; and strive to persistently consolidate and carry on  the ongoing anticorruption struggle with a view to attaining the  three anticorruption goals put forward by the central  authorities. To this end, we should mainly concentrate on the  following two work aspects:    1. Conscientiously study and implement an important reccent  anticorruption speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin and the spirit of  the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Committee; correctly view and further the ongoing anticorruption  struggle and orient it toward such overall interests as reform,  development, and stability;    2. Work hard and strive to attain the three anticorruption  goals put forward at the Third Plenary Session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Committee. To this end, leading cadres at  all levels across the province should: Persistently take the  lead in honestly discharging official duties and observing party  and government discipline; strictly abide by the five  regulations mapped out in 1993 by the central authorities for  ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among  cadres; conscientiously carry out self- examination and  self-rectification in accordance with the five requirements laid  down at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Committee; strengthen leadership over the ongoing  anticorruption struggle; persistently and successfully  investigate and handle each and every major and serious  corruption case; and should make continued and earnest efforts  to eradicate professional malpractices and improve social order.    The "Resolution" maintained: This year, the province's  anticorruption struggle is bound to come across a host of new  situations and problems. In view of this, we should make every  possible effort to successfully accomplish each and every  arduous task and overcome as many difficulties as possible. To  this end, party committees, governments, and principal party and  government leaders at all levels in the province, should:  Firmly grasp the two key work aspects at the same time; take  the ongoing anticorruption struggle as an indispensable  component of the party and political power building work and a  prerequisite for reform, development, and stability; place the  anticorruption work high on the agenda; earnestly strengthen  leadership over the ongoing anticorruption struggle; vigorously  support discipline inspection and supervision organs in  discharging their official duties; and should strive to  successfully attain the three anti-corruption goals set by the  central authorities.</p>

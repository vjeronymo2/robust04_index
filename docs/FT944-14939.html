			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Indosat shares rise on Jakarta SE debut Shares in Indosat, the Indonesian state-owned satellite telecommunications company, made their debut on the Jakarta Stock Exchange yesterday after a listing of American Depositary Shares in New York earlier this week. Indosat shares ended the day in Jakarta at Rp8,475, up from the initial price of Rp7,000. ADSs, equal to 10 Indosat shares, were trading at Dollars 38.25 around midday yesterday, up Dollars 1.12 on the day and up from the initial price of Dollars 32.05. Some brokers claimed the unexpectedly high opening price on the Jakarta exchange was orchestrated to stimulate domestic demand. 'The first trade was a well-rehearsed transaction,' said Mr Andrew Vaughn, head of research at GK Goh Ometraco in Jakarta. However, the fact that investors were prepared to pay almost 20 per cent more than the initial public offering price in both cities is a sign of confidence in the company's future. Brokers say Indosat is one of Asia's most profitable companies. It employs about 1,600 people and recorded net profits of Rp237bn (Dollars 109m) in 1992 against Rp208.5bn in 1991. Indonesia is expected to invest about Dollars 10bn by the year 2000 in expanding telecommunications across its archipelago of more than 13,000 islands. Indosat raised about Dollars 1bn in its New York float, or 25 per cent of the company's stock. It listed 10 per cent of its stock in Jakarta. A report on the initial public offering of the shares in Jakarta is expected to show that the shares were more than twice subscribed. American Depositary Receipts of Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the Philippines' biggest telecommunications company, were listed yesterday in New York and on the Pacific stock exchange in the US, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Each of the ADRs represents one share of common stock. A total of 22m ADRs were listed at an opening price of Dollars 59.50 each, corresponding to the common stock's closing price on October 18. Citibank, which packaged the programme, said holders of the stock would be entitled to exchange without charge their shares for the corresponding amount of ADRs. Citibank will also provide depositary facilities for the ADRs and will act as custodian bank in Manila for the PLDT shares. PLDT said its common stock 'will benefit from the increased visibility and liquidity afforded by the NYSE listing'. Trading in PLDT common shares in the US will be suspended.</p>

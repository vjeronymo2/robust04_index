			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Spurred by growing Japanese  investment in China, Japanese commercial banks have switched  their attention to the Chinese market from the United States and  Western Europe, industry sources reported Wednesday [4 May].    The sources said a host of senior bank officials will make a  fact-finding tour of China later this month. They said 20  branch managers of Sumitomo Bank will set out on a four-day  mission in two groups May 25, one on a tour of Beijing and  Shanghai, and the other on a visit to Hong Kong and Shanghai.  Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank also plans to send a group of about 10  branch managers on a weeklong tour of Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai  and Hong Kong, starting June 4, they said.    The sources said Fuji Bank, which started a regular  inspection tour of China last year, now plans to increase the  number of visits, sending three groups in the first fiscal half,  which ends in September. Mitsubishi Bank also is prepared to  step up inspection tours of China while Tokai Bank and Daiwa  Bank have moved to form a team of experts on China, they said.    Japan's investment in China in 1993 soared to about 3,500  cases from about 1,800 cases in the preceding year as an  increasing number of Japanese manufacturers established  production bases in the country, according to industry figures.  Commercial banks intend to improve their services to Japanese  firms doing business in the Chinese market, the sources said.</p>

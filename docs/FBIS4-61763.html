			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi May 6 TASS -- Chairman of the State Duma  Committee for the Commonwealth Konstantin Zatulin has made a  trip to Abkhazia to specify the Abkhazian stand on the eve of a  regular round of Abkhazian-Georgian negotiations.    Asked about conditions to introduce peace-makers in the  conflict zone, Zatulin stressed it should be separating and not  occupational troops.    "The introduction of peace-makers in all Abkhazian areas  would be an insult for a party to the conflict, since it would  entail the side's recognition as incapable de facto on its  territory. Bearing in mind the principle of equal  responsibility of the sides, this would also result in the  introduction of troops in Georgia," said Zatulin.    In his opinion, a plan to stabilize the Abkhazian situation  should include the introduction of separating peace-making  troops in the area of the Inguri River, presence of  international observers in the conflict zone and a possibility  of flexible reaction in case of a threat of conflict resumption.    "I hope that the upcoming negotiations will manage to bring  closer together the Georgian and Abkhazian stands on the issue,"  said the committee chairman.</p>

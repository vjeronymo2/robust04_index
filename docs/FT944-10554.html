			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Adjudicator at Revenue to be Customs watchdog Ms Elizabeth Filkin, the complaints adjudicator at the Inland Revenue, was named yesterday as the new watchdog at Customs and Excise. Ms Filkin will bring both departments under a new joint adjudicator's office from April, although she will publish two annual reports setting out complaints and recommendations. Ms Valerie Strachan, who chairs Customs and Excise, said she was pleased with its complaints procedures but 'recent surveys have indicated that there is a strong case for external adjudication similar to that for the Revenue'. She added: 'The benefits of such a system - increased confidence on the part of the complainants and improved feedback for the department - are clear.' New guidance leaflets are to be published and will be available at ports, airports and local offices. The introduction of an independent element into Customs' complaint handling does not limit the right to ask an MP to take a case to the ombudsman. Ms Filkin will deal with complaints about customs officers in the dealings with the general public and businesses and also with delays in value added tax repayments. In her annual report she will be able to recommend the payment of compensation in some cases. At the revenue Ms Filkin took up 308 cases for full investigation in her first year. She settled 105 during the period, 65 wholly or partly in favour of the complainant. The government has issued figures showing that gains to income tax payers in 1995-96 are concentrated among the low-paid and the well-paid compared with broadly comparable figures for 1987-88. Those paying more tax are concentrated on those earning Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 50,000 a year. Income tax payments for those earning between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 70,000 are to be reduced by an average of Pounds 620. Those earning more than Pounds 80,000 will benefit by Pounds 16,900 on average. The figures were given in a written answer to Mr Clive Betts MP by Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury.  -------------------------------------------              INCOME TAX 1995-96            COMPARED WITH 1987-88  ------------------------------------------- Range of                      +/-income income                     tax compared 1995-96 (Pounds)           with 1987-88  ------------------------------------------- Less than 5,000                 -30  5,000-10,000                   -70 10,000-15,000                   -10 15,000-20,000                   +60 20,000-25,000                   +90 25,000-30,000                  +120 30,000-40,000                  +640 40,000-50,000                  +620 50,000-70,000                  -620 70,000-80,000                -3,120 Over 80,000                 -16,900 Average                        -110  ------------------------------------------- Source: Treasury  -------------------------------------------</p>

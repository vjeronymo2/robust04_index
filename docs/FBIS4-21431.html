			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 30 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The export  of hazardous waste from the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD  countries has been banned with immediate effect.    The decision was reached during the second meeting of  parties  to the Basel convention on control of transboundary movement of  hazardous wastes and disposal concluded in Geneva four days ago,  after five days of intensive debate.    A Foreign Ministry statement said here Tuesday that the  meeting also decided that the export of hazardous waste from  OECD countries, destined for recovery or recycling in non-OECD  countries, should also cease on 31 December 1997, at the latest.    The consensus was reached after long and difficult  negotiations between the Group of 77, a grouping of developing  nations and China, and leading opponent OECD countries led by  Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States, it added.    Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding,  who led the Malaysian delegation to the meeting, and his Danish  counterpart played a key role in steering the political  direction and decision in arriving at the landmark agreement, it  said.    In his address at the meeting, Law labelled the export of  hazardous waste to developing countries as environmental crime,  the statement said.    He called on the OECD countries to uphold environmental  justice and assist devaloping countries in environmental  capacity building, it said.    Law also informed the meeting about the illegal dumping of  toxic tanker sludge in Malaysian waters and the attempt to seek  exclusion of control under the Basel Convention.    He said stern enforcement action would continue to be taken  against any ship or tankers engaging in such activities in  accordance with Malaysia's interpretation of the convention.    Law warned that such ships would be detained and auctioned  under Malaysian laws.</p>

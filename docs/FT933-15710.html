			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sears sells Asprey holding THE DECISION by Sears to sell its 25 per cent stake in Asprey saw more than 20m shares being sold into the market, with Smith New Court, newly appointed yesterday as Asprey's broker, placing the stake in a bought deal. Smith refused to divulge details of the exercise, but marketmakers said they believed the broker got most of the stock away at 267p. The price Smith paid for the stake was unknown. Details of the share placing had not appeared on the Seaq information service yesterday - prompting some speculation that perhaps not all the shares had been placed. Sears also converted its 18.5m non-voting participating preferred shares into 41m 8.25 per cent preference shares, which were subsequently placed with around 65 institutions by Collins Stewart, the stockbroker. The preference share placing was 'heavily oversubscribed', according to Collins Stewart. Sears also said it was closing down a loss-making Dutch mail order business. The costs of this virtually wiped out the profits - some Pounds 7m - made from the Asprey sale. The shares closed a halfpenny off at 98 1/2 p, while Asprey put on 5 at 293p.</p>

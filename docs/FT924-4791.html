			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / India may delay job reforms THE INDIAN government is considering whether to delay long-awaited reforms to increase employers' rights to sack workers following strong union protests. The government had been expected to announce a new employment policy before the end of this year as part of the economic liberalisation programme launched in 1991. However, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, suggested in a speech yesterday that it would be at least a year before the government could implement such a controversial move because of fierce union criticism. 'In a year's time, labour's attitudes will change and then we can change provisions in labour laws,' he told a conference organised by the World Economic Forum, an international research organisation. Mr Singh was speaking after hundreds of thousands of workers demonstrated in Delhi last week against reforms which trade union leaders claim would lead to mass redundancies. The government had never published details of its plans but it was widely expected that employers would be given the freedom to dismiss workers from loss-making enterprises. This has been almost impossible for large businesses under current legislation.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY THEY WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT AIDS;  </P> <P> COVERING THE PLAGUE AIDS AND THE AMERICAN MEDIA BY JAMES KINSELLA (RUTGERS  UNIVERSITY PRESS: $22.95; 299 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Atlanta. 1982. Dr. Donald Francis, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease  Control, is growing increasingly impatient over the federal government's  failure to properly fund work on a new but ominous disease.  </P> <P> As his frustration mounts, he begins calling the New York Times, the Washington  Post and other media outlets, talking to reporters who had interviewed him  during his pioneering work on smallpox and other major medical stories. Francis  figures a few well-placed stories about his lack of resources -- there isn't  even enough money to buy basic lab supplies or to put doors on makeshift  offices -- will force the Reagan Administration to act. But to his astonishment  and chagrin, Francis can't get a single reporter interested.  </P> <P> "They told me it wasn't a news story," he says.  </P> <P> "It" would soon have a name, though -- AIDS -- and in time, "it" would become  very much a news story, a national tragedy responsible for tens of thousands of  deaths. Francis' early experience -- with the Reagan Administration and the  media alike -- was, however, all too typical of the prevailing attitude toward  AIDS in the United States in 1982 (and in 1983, 1984 and most of 1985 as well).  AIDS was "their" disease -- it was, after all, initially known as GRID  (Gay-Related Infectious Disease) -- and few editors or politicians were  terribly concerned about it, not in a country still largely uncomfortable with,  if not downright hostile toward homosexuality (vide Andy Rooney, Middle  America's foolosopher-in-residence, just this year).  </P> <P> With a few notable exceptions, the American media didn't cover AIDS in any  meaningful way until it seemed to threaten "normal" (i.e., heterosexual) men  and women . . . and their children. When an erroneous story in a respected  medical journal suggested in the spring of 1983 that AIDS could be spread by  "casual contact" -- that "children living in high-risk households are  susceptible to AIDS . . . (without) sexual contact, drug abuse or exposure to  blood products," a media-feeding frenzy immediately ensued. Then, just as  quickly, it faded -- until Rock Hudson died in October, 1985. Then, as USA  Today editorialized -- its irony seemingly unintended -- "With Hudson's death,  many of us are realizing that AIDS is not a 'gay plague' but everybody's  problem."  </P> <P> Media coverage of AIDS more than tripled in the next six months.  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> Hudson was the first person with AIDS whom we all "knew and cared about," says  George Strait, medical reporter for ABC network news. That connection -- "at  once personal and impersonal" -- became the "most important agenda-setter of  all" for the media, writes James Kinsella in his insightful new book.  </P> <P> Kinsella, former editorial-page editor at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner,  provides a detailed, damning account of media insensitivity, indifference and  ignorance, of media squeamishness and sensationalism throughout the early  months and years of the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> The New York Times? Kinsella says AIDS was "virtually ignored for years by what  is arguably America's journal of record," largely because A. M. Rosenthal, then  executive editor of the paper, was widely thought by his reporters and  subordinate editors to be homophobic. No AIDS story appeared on Page 1 of the  New York Times until May 25, 1983 -- by which time more than 500 people already  had died of the disease in the United States.  </P> <P> The networks? ABC, CBS and NBC combined devoted 13 minutes to AIDS in the  entire year of 1982, and as late as 1985, the only way George Strait could get  the words anal sex on the air was to ask Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National  Institutes of Health to use them in an interview. Kinsella writes about media  coverage of AIDS in small cities like Kokomo, Ind.; Arcadia, Fla., and  Mesquite, Tex., as well as in such big cities as New York and San Francisco,  and he repeatedly comes to the same conclusion -- that the quality of coverage  almost invariably depended on the quality, the commitment and the courage of  the individual journalist. Not that Kinsella automatically praises those  journalists who wrote early and often on AIDS. Some of these journalists saw  themselves as educators, and Kinsella argues that the educator-reporter "may be  a laudable paradigm, but it's not really what journalism is about. The basis of  the craft is telling a story you happened to hear, and that somehow touched  your own life so significantly that you want to share it with another."  </P> <P> True enough. And yet it is also true that the journalists whom Kinsella most  praises for their AIDS work -- Laurie Garrett, formerly of National Public  Radio; Art Kern and Jim Bunn of television station KPIX in San Francisco;  Robert Bazell of NBC -- did indeed serve as reporters cum educators on AIDS.  </P> <P> Indeed, some of the best AIDS reporting at times came perilously close to being  not just education but advocacy -- crusading -- and while Kinsella is even more  critical of that stance, he never fully comes to terms with the  incontrovertible fact that were it not for the educators, advocates and  crusaders in the press corps, the record of the media would have been even more  appalling than it already was on this story.  </P> <P> Thus, Randy Shilts -- who provided the most comprehensive early coverage of the  epidemic for the San Francisco Chronicle and subsequently wrote the powerful  book "And the Band Played On" -- clearly engaged in some unprofessional  behavior in pursuit of the story. Kinsella rightly chastises him for that. But  Shilts' stories, alerting San Francisco gays to the new dangers of promiscuous  sex, probably saved hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives by helping to "tame  the voracious sexual appetites of many gay men in San Francisco," as Kinsella  concedes.  </P> <P> Would Shilts' reporting have been as powerful -- and as effective -- had he  not, as a gay man in San Francisco, become so personally committed to AIDS  coverage? Is it possible for a reporter to have both professional detachment  and personal commitment on a story? These are interesting and provocative  questions, and Kinsella grapples with them but doesn't ultimately provide  satisfactory answers.  </P> <P> His book succeeds as a journalistic account of journalistic failure; it's less  successful exploring the moral and ethical dilemmas of the journalist. Perhaps  that's not surprising. Kinsellas is a working journalist, not a social  philosopher.  </P></p>

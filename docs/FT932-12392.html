			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Timber growers attack Forestry Commission privatisation plan now under discussion by a government committee - was 'not a subject which the forestry industry wanted on the agenda at this time', the chairman of Timber Growers UK, which represents private woodland owners, said yesterday. Mr Andrew Christie-Miller said that it was vital for the government and the industry to produce together a national forestry strategy to take forestry into the next century as a part of an overall land use strategy for the UK. The industry had to be consulted in the review, he said. 'If not we'll have a solution thrust on us that almost certainly won't be to our liking,' Mr Christie-Miller said. Last month Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, revealed that a committee of civil servants was reviewing options for the 'ownership and management of Forestry Commission woodlands', and was reviewing the effectiveness of forestry investment incentives. Mr Christie-Miller told the annual meeting of TGUK: 'We have to be politically aware of the considerable pressures within government for privatisation. My view is that current government philosophy suggests that it is now more a question of when rather than if (the Forestry Commission's woodlands are privatised). 'We are not abandoning our friends in the commission - merely trying to steer the debate in the best interests of the whole industry,' he explained. The forestry owners are concerned that the question of privatising the Forestry Enterprise, the part of the Forestry Commission that owns and manages its forests, will arouse political controversy and divert attention from what it considers the more important issue of agreeing a new set of objectives for forestry and incentives to revive tree planting. They are also worried about the lack of formal consultation by the committee which is chaired by the Scottish Office, with representatives from the Treasury, the No 10 Downing Street policy unit, the Forestry Commission and several other ministries. The privatisation of Forestry Enterprise was denounced at the meeting as 'a silly piece of dogma' by Mr Patrick Gordon-Duff-Pennington, chairman of the official Red Deer Commission and former convener of the Scottish Landowners Federation. 'We don't like the dogma that is being thrust down our throats. The government is talking rubbish,' he said. The Forestry Commission, he said, was 'bloody marvellous' under its chairman Sir Raymond Johnstone and its director-general Mr Robin Cutler.</p>

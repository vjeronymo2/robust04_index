			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Cunningham urges party overhaul THE GROWING demands of those seeking a 'fundamental overhaul' of the Labour party and the pressures on candidates for the party leadership to defend its historic traditions emerged vividly yesterday. In an interview on TV-am, Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign co-ordinator, reiterated his support for the abandonment of the Labour rule book's Clause 4, which calls for public ownership, and warned that the way the party conducts its affairs was putting off voters. His comments appeared tacitly to back a sharply diminished union role as part of a 'fundamental overhaul' of the party's image. 'For too many people, the Labour party still remains a closed organisation, an organisation that is difficult to join, very difficult to participate effectively in,' he said. His views were echoed by Mr Gavin Laird, the engineers' and electricians' leader, who used an article in the AEEU's newspaper to attack the 'antiquated' links between the party and the unions. Yet within hours Mr Bryan Gould, the self-proclaimed radical candidate for the leadership and deputy leadership, found himself forced on BBC television to defend the controversial Clause 4 of the party's constitution and its historic ties with the unions. At the same time, in an interview on LWT's Walden programme, Mrs Margaret Beckett, the favoured candidate of Mr John Smith in the deputy leadership race, was also thrown on the defensive. Stung by charges that she was merely the 'establishment candidate', the shadow chief secretary found herself insisting that she was not a 'docile individual' who simply did as Mr Smith told her. She denied that she was slipping behind in the deputy leadership race and claimed she was getting a good reaction from the grassroots of the party, especially women. Both Mr Gould and Mrs Beckett have found themselves increasingly under pressure to emphasise their leftwing and pro-union credentials after widespread speculation that Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary favoured by many union traditionalists, is gaining ground in the deputy-leadership race. After arguing for the unions to withdraw from future leadership contests in favour of a one-member, one-vote system, Mr Gould has recently been emphasising his support for a continuing union role in policy-making and on the ruling national executive.</p>

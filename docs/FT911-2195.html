			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Sunday trading may grow after appeal court ruling THE prospect of more stores opening on Sundays increased yesterday after a court ruling threw doubt upon the enforceability of Sunday trading laws. The Court of Appeal lifted injunctions banning B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself chain, and Wickes Building Supplies from opening stores in West Yorkshire and Somerset on Sundays. A lawyer for Kirklees Borough Council, one of the local authorities involved, said after the hearing that the ruling made the Sunday trading laws 'virtually unenforceable'. Retailers were digesting implications of the decision last night. The British Retailers' Association, representing the multiple chains, described the decision as 'a further muddying of the legal water' and said it 'made it all the more imperative for the government to grasp the nettle'. Texas Homecare, the 230-store DIY chain owned by Ladbroke Group, said it would open a further 20 stores on Sundays, bringing the total to about 200. High Court injunctions were granted last May to Kirklees council forcing Sunday closure on Wickes centres in Huddersfield and Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, and to Mendip District Council in respect of a new B&amp;Q store at Glastonbury, Somerset. The Appeal Court said yesterday that neither local authority had been willing to give undertakings that, if it eventually lost the case, it would compensate the stores for any financial losses resulting from enforced Sunday closure. The court ruled that, as a settled point of law, in the absence of any such undertakings the injunctions should not have been granted. The maximum penalty for Sunday trading is a Pounds 1,000 fine, per store on any one Sunday. This has not proved a sufficient deterrent to large chain stores which can make as much as Pounds 500,000 profit a year per store from Sunday trading. Local authorities have turned increasingly to injunctions during the past 18 months as the only effective means of enforcing the law. Mr David Ramsden, B&amp;Q's controller of retail services, called the decision a 'resounding victory'. Councils would have to think hard before risking taxpayers' money on prosecutions. Mr Roger Butterfield, senior solicitor for Kirklees, doubted if many local authorities would give undertakings to back applications for injunctions because of the enormous cost involved if they lost. 'This judgment has made the Shops Act virtually unenforceable,' he said. The council has yet to decide whether it will appeal. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the shopworkers trade union, said the ruling was 'a technical victory for illegal Sunday traders'. The union's annual conference passed a motion affirming its opposition to reform of the act. Mr Connor said the act was 'all we have' to protect workers from having their hours extended against their wishes. B&amp;Q estimates that up to 100 stores are affected by injunctions banning them from Sunday trading. The company said it would be contacting local authorities involved to ask them either to give undertakings or drop the injunctions. The legality of the Sunday trading laws will be challenged by B&amp;Q in the House of Lords next month. The group is appealing against a ruling by Mr Justice Hoffmann in the High Court last July that the 1950 Shops Act does not contravene free trade principles of European Community law. The Law Lords may refer the issue to the European Court in Luxembourg, which could prolong the uncertainty about the Sunday trading laws for another two years. Usdaw votes, Page 11</p>

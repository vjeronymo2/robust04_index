			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium retreats from highs at LME - Market report Speculative and Japanese buying took the three months ALUMINIUM quotation near to a three-year high of Dollars 1,394 a tonne in early trading at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. But the move quickly ran out of steam and heavy bouts of profit-taking ensured that the price closed at Dollars 1,378 a tonne, up just Dollars 3.50 on balance. Other base metals closed lower, having followed the early fall in copper. Among the precious metals gold and silver prices ended little changed, but PLATINUM crept back below the Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce mark following the overnight fall in New York. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices, like coffee, recovered from an early fall, though less spectacularly. The July position ended unchanged at Pounds 947, having dipped to Pounds 927 at one stage. Traders drew some encouragement from the fact that the July contract had filled a chart gap, but noted that September and December also had unfilled gaps about Pounds 10 below yesterday's lows.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy </F> Shmarov by Olena Lisychna; place and date not given: "Ukraine's  Last Nuclear Season" -- first two paragraphs are UKRAYINA MOLODA  introduction]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who headed  Ukraine's delegation to negotiations in Washington on the eve of  the Moscow meeting, has indeed become a hero of Ukraine's last  "nuclear" season.    For a while, the legislature has put aside discussion of the  "nuclear" agreement. If the Supreme Council does not support  the Moscow agreement, Ukraine will experience "hard days,"  claims Valeriy Shamarov. At the same time, Valeriy Shamarov  does not support illusions that Ukraine will receive weighty  credits and investments. However, he believes that even "small  sums are better than nothing."    Lisychna: This "nuclear" history still has many  white spots, and the issue of compensation for our tactical  nuclear weapons is of extreme interest.    Shmarov: Indeed, for quite a long time, Russia did  not agree to our demands for compensation. However, at the last  stage of the negotiations, Russia recognized our ownership of  the tactical nuclear weapons and we discussed, in general, forms  of holding our mutual accounts. We will cancel part of our  debts for energy resources by transferring these tactical  nuclear weapons to Russia. In the first place, in my opinion,  this is better than nothing. In the second place, Ukraine  cannot enjoy equal partnership because it has amassed enormous  debts to Russia.    Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what part of our  debt could be canceled?    Shmarov: The more the better. I estimate our 1993  debts to Russia at $1 billion, while 1992 debts -- at $2.5  billion. In my opinion, we could settle 50 percent of our 1993  debts.    Well, the issue of strategic nuclear weapons is also very  complicated. Economic calculations were based on data drawn  from the worldwide uranium trade. The U.S. side will be a  guarantor of the fulfillment of this agreement by the Russian  party. A tripartite commission will draft the contract on this  agreement in three-months time.    Lisychna: Who will pay for the processing of  uranium in Russia?    Shmarov: This expense is included in the costs of  Ukrainian deliveries to Russia. One more positive moment for  Russia: Russia will be paid by the United States for each  weapon dismantled on the territory of Ukraine.    Lisychna: Is this payment for work or a kind of  moral support?    Shmarov: This moral support means big money. In  general, the United States is deeply interested in the  dismantlement of nuclear weapons because the missiles are still  directed at the United States, despite the fact that the button  is in Moscow.    Lisychna: For how long can our nuclear power  plants work on the fuel which we are going to receive from  Russia as part of our compensation?    Shmarov: Yearly, we require 100 tonnes of nuclear  fuel. Currently, we are short of nuclear fuel. Our nuclear  power plants could work for five to seven years on the fuel  which will be delivered under the Moscow agreement.    Lisychna: Our legislature must adopt the START I  and START II Treaties and Ukraine should sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty before the Moscow agreements can start  being implemented....    Shmarov: If these agreements are not implemented,  Ukraine will experience hard times. We have held a series of  consultations in the Supreme Council. The deputies understand  the importance of these agreements. In addition, after the  Supreme Council says "yes" or "no," we will have to draft nine  agreements on compensation issues. I hope that the Supreme  Council's decision on the issue will be positive.    Lisychna: On 25 January, IZVESTIYA published this  report: "The second Chernobyl is under way. The dismantlement  of old missiles in Ukraine has been stopped for an indefinite  period due to the lack of military storage bases, transport, and  material assets." Is this report true?    Shmarov: These facts are partially true.  Currently, we lack containers and means of transport. However,  the Moscow agreements foresee that Russia will provide us with  equipment and means of transportation.... The Russian Defense  Ministry will deliver everything on time.... In general, our  agreement with Russia is based on mutual relations: We also  deal with servicing of nuclear-armed SS-24 rocket launchers in  Russia because they were produced in Ukraine.    Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what about the sum  of $2.8 billion? In late 1993, Ukraine demanded that this sum  be earmarked for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons.  However, it turned out that this figure was also false. So,  what sum does Ukraine currently require?    Shmarov: The figure of $2.8 billion is likely to  be too big. In my opinion, we require more than $175 million or  even $1.75 billion. Well, concerning the so-called U.S.  financial aid, I insisted (even during my stay in Washington)  that the United States should increase its aid within the  framework of the Nunn-Lugar program. The U.S. side has promised  this. It is more important for us to not receive consultations  (we have our own experts) or a system of satellite  communications, but modern equipment, diesel fuel, assets for  social protection of servicemen, etc.... Or, simply put, our  requirements are more practical.    Lisychna: Bill Clinton said at the Boryspil  airport that Ukraine can use funds from the Nunn-Lugar program  for purposes of conversion and defense....    Shmarov: These means are miserable. As for  conversion, we have signed an agreement between the Pentagon and  the Ukrainian Ministry of Machine Building on the issue of  cooperation in the sphere of conversion. This could be one more  source of financial resources because we could draft projects in  which Americans could become interested.    One more positive element of the Moscow agreement is the  extension of our relations. Currently, our government  delegation is working in the United States. Our economic  cooperation with the United States currently stands at $500  million.    Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, how can you  predict that investments and credits will flow to a  denuclearized Ukraine? Our economic reforms are at a standstill.    Shmarov: This is a difficult question. U.S.  business circles are dissatisfied with the course of reforms in  Ukraine. However, they consider our issue of denuclearization  to be of key importance, and the issue of economic reforms is of  secondary interest to them.    In my opinion, the United States will not force us with the  implementation of these reforms. Though, some people think this  way.</p>

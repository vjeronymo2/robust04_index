			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / What makes Paddy run When there is no obvious difference between parties, voters are moved by the personalities of the politicians who lead them. That at least is the theory. It is the great hope of the Liberal Democrats. Their leader knows how to get his name in the papers. Yes, I refer to Mr Paddy Ashdown. The Liberal Democrats would not have attracted nearly a fifth of the vote in April without him. He is the nearest thing contemporary British politics has to a character, a bit of a card, a likely lad. He obliges us to watch him, if only out of the corner of an eye. He has little choice. If he were to vanish, his party, which he hauled up from nowhere when he became leader, might vanish too. Much the same was said about most of his predecessors. Lord Grimond had an attractive, no-nonsense appearance, although it did not do the Liberals much good. We will pass over Mr Jeremy Thorpe. Sir David Steel understood how to make himself well-known. So did Lord Owen. The history of the latter pair makes my point. Their unwillingness to share the limelight was a principal cause of their failure to capitalise on their capture of it. As the Green party discovered last week, small parties cannot hope to prosper without leaders who can attract attention by the force of their individuality. You may say that this has always been true, but today it matters more than ever. The three national parties in Britain all favour broadly the same economic strategies. They support membership of the European Community and, if it ever comes into being, the European monetary union. All stand by the parity of the pound selected by Mr John Major when Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. Just at the moment all are uttering similar platitudes in response to the weekend devaluation of the lira and yesterday's reduction in German interest rates. All are impaled on the hook of waiting to see what the French voters do next weekend. As to ideology, all embrace capitalism, albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Not one of them proposes an extension of state ownership of industry. Labour leans mildly towards support of the dwindling working class, while the Conservatives lean the other way, but with every year that passes there is less in it. The Liberal Democrats, gathered in Harrogate this week, are seeking new, non-aligned voters. They are devoted to the process of non-aligning themselves. They are iron filings waiting for a magnet to attract them. Which party should the voters pick? The personality of the prime minister must have had a great deal to do with his election victory in April. The electorate rather likes the straightforward, unassuming Mr Major. He may be a raving fanatic about the exchange rate, but it hardly shows. The new leader of the Labour party, Mr John Smith, appears to have taken a vow of silence. We must give him time in which to work himself into his job - perhaps until the party conference at the end of the month or, possibly, until next year's conference. He will have to do something about Mr Brian Gould and other dissidents within his ranks, but the answer to the big question - what on earth is Labour for? - is not one he is going to hurry over. Yesterday's meeting of his party, at which a first-look paper on policy was to be debated, was but a beginning. Thus the stage has been left empty, and Mr Ashdown has characteristically seized the opportunity to prance about on it. His is an act that depends upon energy. He is like the music-hall performer who never stops buzzing. He sings, dances, plays musical instruments, turns cartwheels, juggles, tells jokes, performs magic tricks. During the summer he captured the headlines, over Bosnia, the recall of parliament, the state of the economy and much else. Over the next few months he will make forays into city centres and elsewhere, to live a few days at a time with 'ordinary people'. No press, no photo-opportunities, he says - but we all know that the experience will become part of his curriculum vitae. He will be able to speak of Sarajevo and Solihull with 'direct knowledge'. What he cannot bear to do is what he knows he must: sit and wait for Mr Smith. When Labour is ready it will be time to establish whether there is at last to be a pre-election Lib-Lab pact, or whether the two opposition parties will, once again, knock one another out. What is meant by 'ready' is the subject of constant debate behind the scenes in Harrogate. At the least Mr Smith is expected to favour proportional representation for election to the Commons; at the most joint positions on a wide range of policies would be demanded. Alternatively, Labour might start, albeit slowly, to fade away. The Liberal Democratic viewpoint is that there is still all to play for. Thus all Mr Ashdown wants this week is for his party to put itself 'in a state of grace,' under an unfettered leader, so that he may take such chances as crop up. He will have that. It is what makes him run so hard.</p>

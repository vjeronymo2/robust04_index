			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING AIM AT 'VIRILE FEMALES'  </P> <P> While you read this column, three Americans will die of smoking-related  illnesses. In 1986 the surgeon general reported that benzene concentrations in  cigarettes up to 2,000 times greater than the amounts that caused Perrier water  to be pulled from markets worldwide. What is surprising generations, is that  public policy is so flaccid regarding the nation's foremost cause of  preventable death.  </P> <P> Policy may become more muscular in the aftermath of an anomalous controversy,  one concerning a major corporation's attempts to market in a normal way a  legal, indeed subsidized, product. The product is addictive (80% of adults  using it want to quit; two-thirds have tried and failed), sickening and often  lethal when used as it is intended to be used.  </P> <P> Today's subject is cigarettes and the task, not exactly chivalric, is one of  protecting "virile females."  </P> <P> Virile females have various attributes, but the one most lovely to R.J.  Reynolds Tobacco Co. is that they are minimally educated. According to a  company marketing memo, virile females are 18 to 20 years old, have no  education beyond high school, work in entry-level service or factory jobs, wear  jeans and knit tops, watch "Roseanne," enjoy such events as motorcycle races,  tractor pulls, monster truck competitions. Virile females are the segment  targeted for the new brand "Dakota."  </P> <P> America pays $52 billion annually -- $221 per American -- in health care,  insurance costs and lost productivity because of tobacco, which every year  kills more Americans than World War II did. The toll from tobacco is far higher  than from cocaine, crack and heroin, combined. One thousand deaths a day.  </P> <P> Last week, Sen. Edward Kennedy chaired a spirited hearing that considered,  among other good ideas, Sen. Bill Bradley's proposal to deny tax deductions for  tobacco advertising -- $2.5 billion of it annually. The companies, spending  $6.9 million a day on advertising and promotions, cheekily claim it is all  aimed at winning market shares, and none of it is aimed at children.  </P> <P> But about half of all smokers start by the time they are 15; few start after  21. Only 10% of smokers switch brands in a year. Death and intelligence cost  the cigarette companies 6,000 customers a day. That many new smokers must be  found daily to keep the companies running in place.  </P> <P> Cigarette advertising plays upon teen-agers' desire for autonomy and anxiety  about social acceptance and sexual allure. If just 3% of cigarette sales are to  underage children, that market segment spends $1 billion, giving the companies  $150 million in profits.  </P> <P> New smokers are disproportionately women and minorities. Forty years ago, just  3% of women with cancer had lung cancer. Now 20% do.  </P> <P> You say cigarette advertising is off television? Look again. Cigarette signs  are in most of the key television camera sight lines in sports arenas and  stadiums. On NBC's 93-minute telecast of the 1989 Marlboro Grand Prix, there  were 4,997 images of Marlboro signs.  </P> <P> Targeted marketing, a common tactic, is now considered disgusting when the  targeted group is picked because it is badly educated and informed, and hence  manipulable, and the product being marketed is injurious. But senior executives  who set the tobacco companies' marketing strategies do not have daughters who  fit the "virile female" profile.  </P></p>

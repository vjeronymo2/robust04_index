			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Bayer to use ewes for rare protein supply BAYER, the German chemicals giant, has signed a multi-million pound deal to use a valuable substance produced by a genetically engineered Scottish super-sheep called Tracy. The deal in which Tracy will produce the chemical while grazing in a field near Edinburgh, is thought to be the first sizeable commercial venture in a controversial branch of genetic engineering. It could mark the first step in the commercial use of genetically engineered animals as biological factories. Tracy, the first sheep in what her Scottish inventors hope will be one of the most lucrative flocks in history, makes a substance that costs Dollars 100 a gramme. A litre of her milk could be worth up to Dollars 7,000. She was genetically engineered by the injection of a piece of human genetic material into a newly fertilised sheep egg. The human material instructs Tracy to produce alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a protein. Most humans make their own AAT, but one in every 2,000 people suffers from a lack of it. In about 10 per cent of cases, the shortage is severe enough to cause problems such as liver failure or emphysema. These people are either treated with a course of injections of AAT, which can cost up to Dollars 20,000 a year or they are treated for the side effects of AAT deficiency such as liver failure or lung disorders. There is a world shortage of the protein. The super-sheep could ease the shortage by augmenting or eventually replacing the traditional method of producing AAT by extracting it from human blood. Bayer has paid around Pounds 10m to secure exclusive delivery of the partly purified substance made by Tracy and her descendants. The AAT would be extracted from her milk. Bayer will conduct clinical trials and submit the AAT for approval by health regulatory bodies around the world. Not only does Tracy produce vast amounts of AAT by comparison with the laborious process of blood extraction, but has now doubled production capacity by giving birth to a daughter, Tracy Two. Using the sheep, Bayer intends to make two tonnes a year of AAT from 1997. It will take at least until then to complete clinical trials. A flock of around 3,000 Tracys should be enough to treat the 100,000 sufferers of AAT deficiency that Bayer estimates there are in Europe and North America. Both animals are owned by Pharmaceutical Proteins, a venture capital start-up based in Edinburgh which tried to interest two of the UK's largest drug companies in Tracy's AAT, but was turned down.</p>

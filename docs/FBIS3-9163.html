			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 22 (AFP) -- UN officials and Bosnian  Serb military leaders have agreed to settle amicably the  controversial discovery of heavy weapons inside the NATO-imposed  exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said Tuesday [22  March].    Major Simon MacDowall, spokesman for the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR), said the weapons -- tanks, anti-aircraft guns and  mortars -- were discovered Sunday by Canadian troops in the  village of Cifluk right at the edge of the 20-kilometre  (12-mile) exclusion zone set by NATO.    He said the weapons were placed under UN control even though  the Serbs consider Cifluk outside the exclusion zone.    The Serbs have defined the exclusion zone by using  Sarajevo's  cathedral as the central point from which to calculate the 20  kilometres while the UN defines the centre about a kilometre  further west from the cathedral.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR chief of  staff in Bosnia, Dutch General Adrian van Ball, held a meeting  in the Serb stronghold of Pale Monday and agreed to negotiate  the controversy. "Van Ball came back very satisfied with the  positive attitude of the Bosnian Serbs," MacDowell said. He said  the exclusion zone could not be entirely monitored by UN  peacekeepers because of a lack of manpower. He added, however,  that the situation had been relatively calm since NATO issued an  ultimatum February 9 threatening air strikes unless the Serbs  and Bosnian government troops withdrew their heavy weapons from  around the besieged capital. He said UN military observers had  noticed that troops on both sides appeared more relaxed on the  frontlines and there was "no more sniping in Sarajevo." "That  forward momentum is still going on," he said.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUGAR SEIZED AT HOUSE;  </P> <P> CUTE CUB CAN'T COUNT AS KITTY  </P> <P> Animal control officers Duncan Gill and Carl Pagano went to a house in Irvine  this week and found a cat sitting in the window.  </P> <P> But they knew immediately that it was no ordinary feline.  </P> <P> It was a 12-week-old mountain lion.  </P> <P> The officers had received an anonymous tip that a resident of the house on  Willowbrook in the Woodbridge area had bragged about keeping the female cub --  named Sheena -- as a pet.  </P> <P> State law, however, makes housing any "species of carnivore other than domestic  dogs and cats" a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and $1,000  in fines, according to Mary Jean Delong, a dispatcher for Irvine Animal  Services.  </P> <P> So, Gill and Pagano proceeded to seize the cat.  </P> <P> Soon after the officers arrived, another resident of the house -- not the cat's  owner -- drove up and let them in. The cub was playing in front of the window  and making a bird-like chirping sound, which the officers said is typical for  cats that age.  </P> <P> "Once we went inside, it took a few minutes to catch the cat," Gill said. "It  was loose throughout the house."  </P> <P> The cub, which is believed to have come from Florida, had been declawed and  isn't dangerous, Gill said, adding that he didn't know how the cub had been  obtained. A mountain lion can grow to weigh about 200 pounds and about 34  inches in height, he said.  </P> <P> State Fish and Game wardens will determine if charges are warranted against the  cat's owner, whose name Gill declined to release on Thursday.  </P> <P> He said the house appeared to be shared by four men, all in their 20s. They  probably had the mountain lion "for the novelty of it," Gill said.  </P> <P> The cub will stay at the Irvine Animal Care Center until Saturday, Gill said.  Then it will be taken to a zoo or wildlife facility in Riverside County.  </P></p>

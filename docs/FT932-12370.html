			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Aerospace takes 51% stake in Fokker DEUTSCHE Aerospace yest-day signed a contract giving it a 51 per cent stake in Dutch aeroplane builder Fokker, ending negotiations which lasted more than a year and touched off an industrial policy debate in the Netherlands. The only hurdle to German-Dutch co-operation in aircraft building is the European Commission, whose official reaction to the transaction is expected in mid-May. 'We are quite hopeful that it will be positive,' said Mr Jurgen Schrempp, president of Dasa. Dasa, part of the Daimler-Benz group, is taking a 51 per cent stake in a new holding company which will own Fokker's shares. This will be done through the purchase of new shares and the acquisition of most of the Dutch state's 32 per cent stake. The government, Dasa's main negotiating partner, will keep a small holding for a three-year transition.</p>

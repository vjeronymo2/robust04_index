Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BURBANK FIREFIGHTERS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE SUBSTANCE FROM CREEK  </P> <P> Burbank firefighters were attempting to identify and remove a chemical  substance discovered this morning in a Buena Vista Park drainage creek that  empties into the Los Angeles River flood channel, authorities said.  </P> <P> The spill in the 400 block of Bob Hope Drive was reported to police at 8 a.m.  Firefighters and Los Angeles County health authorities were attempting to pump  the chemical, believed to be a pesticide, out of the drainage creek before much  of it emptied into the river channel.  </P> <P> Authorities were also attempting to identify the chemical and its origin. No  one was hurt in the incident, and there were no evacuations in the area, near  St. Joseph Medical Center and the NBC studios.  </P> <P> Part of the drainage creek runs underground in the area. Authorities had no  estimate of how much of the material was in the creek or had emptied into the  river channel, but the milky white substance could be seen in the open creek  for more than 1 1/2 blocks.  </P></p>

The  agreement was initially presented as a triumph of U.S.  diplomacy, then it was used as confirmation that peace in Bosnia  was a fait accompli, and in the past few days the affair got an  unusual epilogue. The majority of analysts now see in the U.S.  plan for Bosnia a return to the old theme of division of spheres  of interest, while some even see it as a return to the Cold War.  The sequence of such different interpretations of one and the  same fact shows what the capital sum and what the interest rate  might be in this game.    The United States does not have a clear goal in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, because if it had one, it would already have  achieved it. The events surrounding the Washington agreement  only confirm the continuity of its inconsistency and  controversial actions. Clinton has come up with a winning  combination, yet he is now behaving like a chess player who has  overlooked an entire chess piece. The chess piece is called  Russia. That is why the U.S. President is sending Warren  Christopher to Vladivostok where an agreement on division of  work in Bosnia should be reached. The West wants the war to end  so that the two-year public pressure on its governments finally  stops. On the other hand, correspondents from Moscow report on  Russia's firm intention of actually reasserting its presence in  the Balkans through Bosnia. This is not yet proof that history  is repeating itself, but we should not forget that certain ideas  often outlive history itself.    The Balkan peoples cannot seem to be able to grow up. The  reason lies both in them and in those who are squabbling over  them and their countries. For over a hundred years three or  four superpowers have been regulating affairs in these areas,  but all of their experiments and creations have failed, and have  dragged them into catastrophe. It was always others who made  Bosnia's past tragic, regardless of whether they came from its  eastern or western borders. Nowadays we are witnessing an  attempt to end the tragedy caused by the Serbian aggression with  a plan that has probably never been implemented anywhere. The  Washington agreement will perhaps bring peace between the Croats  and the Muslims, but it in itself will not preserve the Bosnian  state within the existing borders. For Bosnia to survive,  someone needs to cool the nationalist blood in Belgrade and  Zagreb.    Agreement on certain theoretical principles was reached  swiftly and easily at the Vienna negotiations about the  Muslim-Croat federation. This was proclaimed to be a great  success, and was mathematically expressed with the claim that  only 5 percent of concurrence was still needed in order for it  to be a complete triumph. It became evident, however, that  precisely this "5 percent" represents the essence of things and  the essence of the conflict. Everything would probably be  different had this project originated in Bosnia and not in  Washington. Whenever others had designs on the Bosnians, the  Bosnians ended up being beheaded. According to this historical  experience, we must count on the temporary character of this  latest sartorial model.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten's approach supported CHINA'S ATTEMPTS to undermine the position of Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, were bluntly repudiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday. He affirmed Britain's readiness for further talks with China without preconditions, but told the Commons the government backed Mr Patten, who has proposed democratic elections in the colony. He said Mr Patten had acted 'sensitively, resolutely and correctly', and assured MPs that Britain would continue to make this clear to China, which is due to regain Hong Kong in 1997.</p>

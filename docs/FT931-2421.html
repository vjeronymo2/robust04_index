			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: SCA cushioned by hygiene side contribution SCA, Sweden's second largest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a SKr451m (Dollars 58m) profit after financial items for 1992. A strong performance from its Molnlycke hygiene division helped to cushion 'extremely unfavourable' conditions for traditional forest industry products. The result was 63 per cent down on 1991's SKr1.22bn profit but it stood in sharp contrast to the company's two leading domestic competitors, Stora and MoDo, both of which have disclosed deep losses for 1992. SCA is holding its dividend at SKr3.20 per share. SCA said it expected 1993 profits after financial items to rise to SKr1bn-SKr1.5bn, even though conditions remain very difficult and falling prices have eroded much of the benefit from the devaluation of the Swedish krona. Sales fell to SKr32.1bn from SKr32.7bn. reflecting price and volume pressures resulting from industry overcapacity. SCA benefits from having a more diversified range of products than other Swedish forestry groups and Molnlycke, in particular, has proved a recession strength. It boosted operating profits by 24 per cent to SKr901m as sales rose to SKr12.5bn from SKr11.6bn. The group's packaging business was hit by lower prices and volumes, with operating profits falling to SKr462m from SKr607m on a 5.5 per cent drop in sales to SKr8.98bn. Graphic paper plunged to a SKr313m loss from a SKr186m profit, on sales down to SKr5.07bn from SKr5.39bn. Forest and timber activities saw operating profits fall 20 per cent to SKr375m, as sales declined to SKr3.52bn from SKr3.69bn. Restructuring had a positive impact, with annual costs now SKr2bn lower than in 1990. Staff numbers fell 4,200 to 26,600 during the year as part of an overall plan to cut 6,500 jobs between 1990 and 1994. Net earnings after tax rose from SKr901m to SKr6.2bn, after taking in SKr5.86bn in extraordinary gains, mainly related to the sale of the group's energy business. The disposal has cut group debt from SKr17.6bn to SKr10.8bn.</p>

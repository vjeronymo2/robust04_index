			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Brain and business form industry club - In A Nutshell Durham University has launched an Industry and Commerce Club to encourage collaboration between its academics and companies in north-east England. The university has taken its lead from the much higher level of informal contact between universities and industry in the US and believes many businesses are unaware of the relevant expertise academics have in product, planning and management problems. Ninety companies, from small businesses to multinationals, attended the launch. The university hopes the club will enhance the performance of north-east industry. First-year membership is Pounds 200 plus VAT a representative or Pounds 500 for up to three representatives. Contact Prof. Bernard Smythe, Durham University, Old Shire Hall, Durham DH1 3HP.

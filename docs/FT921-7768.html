			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Observer: Lilley-livered There is no longer any need to ask who is up and who is down in John Major's cabinet. When John Smith yesterday launched Labour's full-scale Commons assault on the government's handling of the economy, Major's response was to field Michael Heseltine. No matter that the environment secretary has no responsibility for economic policy. The judgment of party managers was that the government needed a heavy hitter to counter Smith's powerful rhetoric. Norman Lamont's face was saved by a previous engagement with a Commons committee. There was no such consolation for Peter Lilley. The trade and industry secretary was busy in Newcastle giving a speech to businessmen, the sort of function which might easily have been handed to a junior. Heseltine duly turned in a virtuoso performance. No wonder some Tory MPs have started to refer to Heseltine as the deputy prime minister.</p>

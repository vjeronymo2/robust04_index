Du Qiugen, deputy director of the Department of Foreign  Relations and Trade of the Liaoning Provincial Government,  reports that the proportion of exported heavy industrial  products to total exports showed an increase of eight percent.  The export volume of motors and machinery alone reached one  billion U.S. dollars, up by 16 percent.    Du said that the province approved in 1993 the establishment  of over 4,000 overseas-funded enterprises, with a total  investment of 8.56 billion U.S. dollars. Both the figures  surpassed the total of the previous ten years.    By now there are nearly 8,000 overseas-funded enterprises,  with a total investment of 17 billion U.S. dollars, from  businessmen in 35 countries and regions.    More than 2,500 overseas-funded enterprises in the province  have gone into production. In 1993, their output value amounted  to 18.4 billion yuan (about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars),  accounting for 10 percent of the gross provincial product. The  export value of the 1993 total production rose to 1.14 billion  U.S. dollars, accounting for a quarter of the province's exports.    The province used over two billion U.S. dollars worth of  overseas funds to update technically 2,000 of its old  enterprises in 1993. It also signed 500 contracts on projects  and on exporting labor services.</p>

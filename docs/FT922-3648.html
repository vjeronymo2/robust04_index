			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Spain leads in top executives' pay league SPANIARDS have supplanted the Swiss as the best paid managing directors in Europe, with UK counterparts coming three-quarters of the way down a league table of 12 countries, a survey reports. Pay increases for executives, net of inflation, have declined across all the main European economies. Rises of 2 per cent and under in the first quarter of 1992 contrast with increases of over 5 per cent in the late 1980s. The survey of more than 39,000 executives in over 3,300 companies was carried out by a consortium of European management consultants. Countries covered are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, with some data from Italy. Gross annual pay for the managing director of a Spanish manufacturing company with annual sales of Pounds 75m is Pounds 125,000. The comparable Swiss figure is Pounds 123,000, UK Pounds 87,000 and, bottom of the league, Ireland Pounds 65,000. Jobs, Page 11</p>

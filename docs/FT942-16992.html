			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Leading Article: Bloodied but unbowed Yesterday's car bomb attack in the northern Israeli town of Afula is another reminder of the fearful symmetry of violence which threatens at every turn to obstruct the Middle East peace process. On one side are the Palestinian Islamic militants who claimed responsibility for yesterday's bombing, apparently in retaliation for the massacre of about 30 Arabs in a Hebron mosque in late February. On the other are Jewish extremists such as the fanatical settler, Baruch Goldstein, who carried out the Hebron shootings. Both sides, though sworn enemies, have a common goal: to ensure, by striking in the most horrific manner at the most sensitive possible moments, that the agreement between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation providing for Israeli withdrawal from and Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank does not succeed. Fortunately, the current evidence suggests it is they, not the agreement, that are failing. The anguished standoff between Israel and the PLO that followed the Hebron massacre has been replaced by an invigorated attempt to reach detailed agreement by April 13, the date set in the Declaration of Principles they signed on the White House lawn last September. Moreover, the Israeli army appears to be preparing the ground for an eventual accord by pulling equipment and forces out of Gaza and the Jericho area. For the first time, the negotiations of the past year can be said to be producing tangible change where it matters. Important concessions What recent events have underlined is that neither Israel nor the Palestinians have any option but to stick to the process on which they are embarked. Both sides made important concessions to restart negotiations - Israel by allowing an international observer force into Hebron; the PLO by shelving demands for the removal of Jewish settlers from the West Bank town. Moreover, by banning two Jewish extremist groups, the Israeli authorities have acknowledged for the first time that terrorists from their midst can pose as much of a threat as those from the other side. Resolve of this kind will be much in demand in the months to come, both in Israel and among those attempting to bring about Palestinian self-rule. For if there is one certainty about the fragile experiment in co-existence now under way, it is that there will be further violent attempts to throw it off course. The agreements struck thus far contain too many loose ends to instil confidence that such threats will be contained, and their implementation is surrounded by too many worrying uncertainties - not least concerning the capacity of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, to rule an embryonic Palestinian entity with authority, competence or even real democratic legitimacy. Jewish settlements The most ominous grey area concerns the Jewish settlements in the territories. These are supposedly unaffected by the interim agreement now being implemented. Even after Israeli soldiers have withdrawn from most of Gaza and the West Bank and handed over the security of their Arab inhabitants to Palestinian police, some will stay behind to protect the settlements. There is plenty of room for misunderstanding or worse between the Israeli military and Palestinian forces, especially in places like Hebron, where Jewish settlers live in the thick of Arab population centres. So far, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, has been understandably reluctant to broach the settlements issue. It is one of the difficult questions to be decided in 'final status' negotiations that are supposed to start up to two years into implementation of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles. It also represents a political minefield in Israel. Nevertheless, it is an issue which may have to be addressed sooner rather than later if the interim accord is to bring lasting peace to the occupied territories. Mr Rabin would be well advised to make a start now by vowing, without prejudice to the overall fate of the settlements, to shift the most politically inflammatory of them out of Arab towns. It is in Israel's interest, as well as that of regional stability, to remove such sources of friction from what in any case will be a fraught process.</p>

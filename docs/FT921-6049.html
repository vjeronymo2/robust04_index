			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Dow waits for reality to catch up with hopes - The prospects for US equities It may seem an odd statement to make after a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average twice reached record highs, but the recent rally in US stock markets appears to be running out of steam. In the month from December 20, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to their lowest levels for almost three decades, prompting a stampede into equities by yield-hungry investors, the Dow Jones gained 11 per cent, setting a number of new records. Since mid-January, however, the Dow has gained less than 1 per cent, oscillating uncomfortably in a 30-point trading range either side of 3,250. It showed signs of breaking above this range in early trading yesterday, following Wednesday's record high of 3,283.32. An all-time high for the Dow can always be relied on to catch the headlines. But the ability of blue-chip stocks to reach previously unscaled heights should not distract investors from warning signs that the market rally - which transformed 1991 from merely a good into an outstanding year for investors - is looking vulnerable. Mr Robert Doll, a senior investment manager at the New York-based fund group Oppenheimer, provides one theory: 'The first, monetary phase of the bull market, when it reacted to lower interest rates and ignored the real world, is behind us. We are now in the second phase, when the market becomes earnings-driven.' In other words, investors are waiting for reality to catch up with expectations. The surge in demand for equities late last year was fuelled by two factors: lower interest rates, which made short-term financial assets (such as bank certificates of deposit, money market funds and shorter-dated treasury securities) less attractive to investors; and hopes for a recovery in the economy and corporate profits by the summer. Those factors are no longer in play. The fuel from the first - lower interest rates - has probably run dry, although a distressing fall in January consumer confidence earlier this week did briefly revive speculation that the Fed would ease its monetary policy one more time. The consumer confidence shock aside, the more measured opinion among observers is that the authorities are satisfied with current policy, and that the chances of another reduction in short-term interest rates are less than 50 per cent. Regarding hopes of an imminent recovery in the economy, week ago when a string of statistics suggested that economic activity had picked up at the start of the year. Retail sales rose in January for the third month running, early February car sales showed a bigger-than-expected increase and money supply had grown at above-target rates since the new year. The figures were immediately seized upon by the Bush administration as evidence of a turnround in the country's economic fortunes. The stock market, however, was less convinced, especially after Thursday's news of a rise in weekly unemployment claims. It is clear that investors want proof, and hard proof at that, of an economic recovery before taking another big plunge into the market. Waiting for that proof could test the market's patience severely. Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the Fed, provided the best analysis of the current state of the economy this week when he told a group of business economists that while there were no signs of a further deterioration in the economy, there was also 'no convincing evidence of any self-reinforcing process of recovery'. The economy is thus stuck in a half-way house: beyond the bottom of the recession but not yet comfortably in the upswing. Until it moves on, investors are unlikely to regain their appetite for stocks. There are two possible saviours for the market's bulls: liquidity, and politics. The influence of liquidity on the market in the past few months cannot be understated. Both institutional and especially individual investors bought stocks in December and January because they had a lot of cash on their hands and nowhere particularly attractive to put it after yields on short-term assets had dropped to historically low levels. There may also be plenty more cash left outside the market. According to estimates compiled by the New York analytical firm Birinyi Associates, at least Dollars 150bn of individual investors' assets remain in short-term money market funds managed by securities houses. This is just the kind of money that is likely to switch into equities if interest rates remain low and, if just a fraction of that total went into the stock market, it would have a big impact. Finally, there is the political factor, which in this election year could be a significant influence on market sentiment. Conventional wisdom is that the market hates Democrats and likes Republicans. The early signs of President Bush's electoral vulnerability in the New Hampshire primary, when the television commentator Mr Patrick Buchanan picked up almost 40 per cent of the Republican vote, actually gave a boost to share prices. The thinking among investors was crafty: the more vulnerable Mr Bush looks, the more likely he is to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates and increase his efforts to ensure that a tax-cutting package passes through Congress. If either happened, the long-awaited recovery might be brought that much closer.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> UP FOR GRABS: A Trip Through Time and Space in the Sunshine State by John  Rothchild (Penguin: $7.95) John Rothchild tries to blend childhood memories of  Florida with an irreverent history of the state, but the mixture never quite  gels.  </P> <P> Florida's humid real estate has spawned nearly as many flamboyant scandals,  crooks and get-rich-quick schemes as California's, but Rothchild fails to  capture the baroque excesses of his subject. The narrative flashes backward and  forward awkwardly, scrambling any sense of continuity and confusing the reader.  Rothchild's straightforward style lacks devilish edge needed for this type of  wise-cracking memoir. Charles Solomon  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Fines Proposed in Tunnel Blast: The Labor Department proposed $1.15 million in  fines for two contractors cited for 115 safety violations in a methane gas  explosion last year that killed three sewer tunnel workers in Milwaukee. S. A.  Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines  of $680,000 and CH2M Hill Central Inc. of Corvallis, Ore., was cited for 47  willful violations carrying penalties of $470,000. An OSHA official said the  agency found that electrical power had not been turned off after workers were  evacuated from the tunnel Nov. 10 after dangerously high levels of methane were  detected.  </P></p>

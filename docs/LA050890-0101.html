			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> WORLD CUP OVERFLOWS FOR ITALIANS;  </P> <P> THE NATION GETS A $4-BILLION FACE LIFT FOR THE SOCCER EXTRAVAGANZA. BUT LABOR  UNREST, CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND SECURITY CONCERNS CLOUD THE EVENT.  </P> <P> The clock is running on the greatest Roman spectacle since the time of the  Caesars. The world is watching. And here is Italy, like a tempestuous diva  awaiting her cue, poised between triumph and disaster.  </P> <P> Luca di Montezemolo is in the catbird seat. Next month he will become  internationally famous as maestro of the 1990 World Cup. Right now, he's  queasy.  </P> <P> "I'm like a passenger on a plane in turbulence," he said from behind his desk,  where dreams jostle with big trouble. "I hope the pilot is in good shape, but I  can't do anything myself."  </P> <P> He has a red-green-and-white lapel button that proclaims, "Life's too short not  to be Italian." But is time too short for the Italians to make a success of  their prized role as host of the 1990 World Cup, a monthlong soccer  extravaganza that many people consider the world's premier sporting event?  </P> <P> With a month to go, Di Montezemolo says that organization of the matches  themselves is on track -- but hardly anything else is. The buck is passing  rapidly among local and national officials who understand perfectly why the  other guy's job is not finished.  </P> <P> Di Montezemolo, 42, a slick, fast-talking adman, is manager of Italia 90, a  tournament in which teams representing 24 countries will play 52 matches in 12  Italian cities between June 8 and July 8.  </P> <P> They will be watched in 170 countries by a television audience projected by  international soccer officials at 26 billion. That means that everybody in the  world could see five games -- unless Italian television technicians strike.  </P> <P> Will Italy embarrass itself before the world?  </P> <P> "I don't know," Di Montezemolo says.  </P> <P> As the days tick away, Italy primps madly for its gala with the world, but it  looks as though the kickoff will come before all the makeup is on.  </P> <P> Labor unrest by unions hoping to cash in on a national bonanza vexes planners.  Smooth operation of communications, transportation and hotels hangs in the  balance. Major-league security concerns persist despite broad international  cooperation and elaborate precautions against lager louts, those beer-swilling,  rampage-prone soccer hearties from England and Holland who are known  generically as "hooligans."  </P> <P> To prepare for the cup, the Italian government has embarked on an ambitious and  costly national face lift. At about $4 billion and rising, public works  spending is over budget and behind schedule in one city after another. A total  of 24 construction workers have died in accidents.  </P> <P> Construction delays contort major Italian cities that expect up to 500,000  additional tourists for the games. Urban anarchy is not what Italy had in mind  when it agreed four years ago to put on a festa intended to polish its  international image, and to celebrate its status as a first-rank economic  power.  </P> <P> Roman traffic, which moves tortuously in the best of times, now moves hardly at  all. "All this mess for nothing," scolded a Roman newspaper, counting 20  unfinished projects, traffic-clogging eyesores every one.  </P> <P> Much is promised for the Eternal City, where the final match will be played in  an overhauled stadium that has survived 50% cost overruns and a court challenge  from environmentalists but is still unfinished. For Rome, there are grand  promises of more trash cans, outdoor toilets, extra buses and 2,000 new guards  who will allow lengthened museum hours. Little has materialized.  </P> <P> "We will be ready to play in modern, comfortable and, most of all, safe  stadia," Di Montezemolo said. "In the other areas, like infrastructure, people  are working hard and, I am sure, well. But we are in their hands. Clearly, our  success is related to something we can't control."  </P> <P> For Italy, the World Cup is a celebration of traditional soccer passion and new  national prosperity. Italians are now better paid than the British and are  closing in on the French.  </P> <P> Soccer ignites 57 million Italians exactly the way it captivates entire  continents for which the game is, hands down, the ultimate athletic kick. From  Brazilian slums to Arabian palaces, it is a poor man's zeal and a rich man's  diversion.  </P> <P> By agreement, the assembly line will stop at Fiat, Italy's giant auto maker,  during important games. By custom, office and shop staffs on five continents  will evaporate when national teams take the field.  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II, a hometown goalie when he was wearing short pants in public,  will bless Rome's Olympic Stadium, ready or not, on May 31. One of the invited  VIPs, President Bush, is said by Italia 90 researchers to be the only current  world leader to have played soccer in college. Among 6,000 scrambling reporters  at the games, Henry A. Kissinger, employed as a cup columnist by The Times,  will add some tone.  </P> <P> This year's cup play may even generate modest enthusiasm in that wasteland  between Maine and Mexico where soccer's popularity normally hovers somewhere  between darts and curling. An American team will compete, for the first time in  40 years, in matches against so-so Czechoslovakia, not-bad Austria and, uh oh,  powerhouse Italy. The baseball equivalent of an Italy-USA soccer game would be  to schedule the Dodgers against Murmansk High.  </P> <P> The Americans are young and inexperienced, prime candidates for an 0-3  clobbering in a tournament that will be dominated, as usual, by West European  and South American soccer giants. However chastened, the Americans will be  back: The United States is to be host for the 1994 World Cup.  </P> <P> If there is one thing Americans can learn from this year's cup it is that Italy  will be a hard act to follow, and a good act to avoid following -- except on  the field, where the Azzurri (the Italian national team) are favorites to win  the 11-pound, solid-gold World Cup.  </P> <P> Constancy, thy name is not Italy. Since being named this year's host, Italy has  had five prime ministers. There have been four mayors amid great melodrama and  malfeasance in Rome; as many in Naples, hardly a clockwork town, and three in  Palermo, where street lights cost five times more to install than in Turin.  </P> <P> Italy built two new stadiums for the cup, in Turin and Bari, and overhauled the  rest. Now, unique in Europe where soccer fans are accustomed to standing, each  of the 2.6 million spectators at the 52 games will have an individually  numbered seat.  </P> <P> Inspectors from FIFA, the international soccer federation and father of the  cup, visited all 12 sites and reported serious problems in Milan, Naples and  Rome, which has been enlarged to seat 80,000 but, in the view of some critics,  not improved.  </P> <P> "With a little bit of foresight we could have avoided this monstrosity," said  Antonio Jannello, head of Italy's largest environmental organization. The  stadium in Florence, home field for the United States, was criticized by FIFA  for bad planning.  </P> <P> Milan's field was resodded only last week. Whether it will be ready for the  inaugural match between defending champion Argentina and Cameroon is now up to  the elements.  </P> <P> "As usual, all the city officials blame their failures on government red tape,"  the Rome newspaper La Repubblica noted tartly in a recent editorial.  </P> <P> Then, too, the newspaper observed, Di Montezemolo says his responsibility stops  at the stadium gates, the national minister of sport and tourism says he got  his job too late to be useful and his predecessor "was too busy campaigning for  mayor of Rome" to immerse himself in cup preparations.  </P> <P> Overall, stadium costs have soared to about $800 million, nearly double the  budget. Infrastructure projects -- a rail link between Fiumicino Airport and  Rome and a light-rail line from downtown Rome to the Olympic stadium are  examples -- have also mushroomed in cost. Neither is finished.  </P> <P> The Italian Communist Party, which has a reputation for probity in the cities  it governs, is demanding a parliamentary inquiry to account for the many  millions of lire that seem to have fallen off trucks on the way to the  ballpark.  </P> <P> Somewhere in the welter are billions of lire being spent to guard Italy against  the hooligans, those 20th-Century descendants of Northern European vandals who  have sacked Italy before.  </P> <P> Holland has been banished to Palermo for its matches, and England to Cagliari.  As riotous Dutch and British fans may have occasion to observe, Sicilians and  Sardinians are not among the sweetest-tempered Italians.  </P> <P> Fifty carabinieri have spent a month in Britain learning from the British  police how to deal with the rowdies. In all, 20,000 police officers, including  11,000 specially trained for the cup, will patrol training camps and stadiums  where a big-brotherly eye will monitor crowds for a police-only TV network.  Fans who survive checkpoints 100 yards away will be frisked again at stadium  entrances.  </P> <P> Sardinia has long been reckoned the No. 1 trouble spot, but lately it has  dawned on planners that Genoa may blindside them. The Scots will play in that  Mediterranean port, which is preparing for the 500th anniversary of the  discovery of the New World by its native son. And it is on Columbus' Genoa that  British, Dutch and Irish fans will converge to catch ferries for games in  Sardinia.  </P> <P> If, as expected, England advances to the second round, it could actually play  in Genoa, thereby offering a potential battleground for the Italian army.  </P> <P> The rowdies tend to be young, noxious and out of work, but the cup's charisma  also entices the elite. His Royal Highness Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan, ruler  of Abu Dhabi and the owner of the United Arab Emirates team, will have a  king-size hot tub with inlaid brackets big enough for champagne bottles in his  marbled hotel suite outside Bologna. In the hotel garden, Italian workers have  set up a tent for use as a mosque by the sheik and his entourage of 40.  </P> <P> The sheik has already had a setback. Miss UAE, Najah Hussein, finished as an  also-ran in the World Cup beauty contest. She paraded in slacks instead of a  bathing suit to avoid offending Islamic sensibilities.  </P> <P> Despite a pricey Brazilian coach, the Emirates are hardly better than the  Americans. They won't win the World Cup either. Beyond that, in an Italy  gridlocked and soccer-crazed for the next two months, anything at all is  possible.  </P></p>

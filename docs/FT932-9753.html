			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: EniChem sinks deeper into red Haig Simonian in Milan ENICHEM, the loss-making Italian chemicals group controlled by the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern, moved deeper into financial difficulties with a L1,560bn (Dollars 1.02bn) loss last year. The result, more than double the L742bn lost in 1991, reflected the recession, which has cut demand for primary petrochemical products, and continuing severe price competition. Sales, adjusted for disposals, fell by 8.2 per cent to L11,155bn EniChem said prices for primary petrochemicals products had fallen between 10 per cent and 20 per cent last year as a result of weak demand and overcapacity. The Italian market had been hit particularly hard owing to the slowdown in the auto, building and textile industries. EniChem's losses, which included L300bn in provisions for environmental protection measures, came in spite of indications last year that the group might be able to contain losses to within L1,000bn due to cost-savings and a big cash injection from the Eni parent company. However, the group's finances appear to have deteriorated steadily during the year. Operating losses deepened by L231bn to L308bn in spite of lower raw material prices and attempts to contain fixed costs. Meanwhile, interest costs, adjusted for disposals, rose by a further L131bn to L893bn in 1992. Total group debt rose to L7,391bn from L7,004bn, in spite of the cash injection. EniChem has been struggling to restructure to reduce costs. The workforce was cut by over 4,000 employees last year, contributing to a L80bn saving on the wage bill. In July, formal approval is due for a plan to merge 10 wholly-owned subsidiaries with the EniChem parent company, which is forecast to produce annual savings of about L200bn</p>

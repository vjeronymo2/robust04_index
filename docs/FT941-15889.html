			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Portugal talks up the role of EMI Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, yesterday said he hoped the newly-formed European monetary institute would help persuade Germany to cut interest rates more quickly to boost European economic growth. His comments are likely to increase German fears that the Frankfurt-based EMI could interfere with the statutory independence of the Bundesbank. In remarks plainly directed above all at Germany, Mr Cavaco Silva criticised 'national egoism' in economic policy. He said the EMI would require 'a commitment for everyone to pursue a community monetary policy'. He added: 'I have some expectations for the work of the EMI. Before, it was quite clear that monetary policy co-ordination was not strong. I hope from now on it will not just be a question of adapting to the decisions of the Bundesbank. The 12 members of the European Union - all of them - will have a say in monetary policy.' Decision-making power will remain formally in the hands of national central banks during stage two of the move to economic and monetary union, which began on January 1. However, Mr Cavaco Silva said the EMI, which had its first meeting on Tuesday, would have to play more than just an advisory role. 'Europe is more than just the Bundesbank,' he said. His remarks yesterday put Portugal firmly on the side of countries such as France, Italy, Spain and Belgium which want the EMI to play a more active role. Mr Cavaco Silva also said Europe needed a single currency to accompany the internal market. However, he admitted it was now unlikely that monetary union could take place before 1999, compared with the earliest date prescribed in the Maastricht treaty of 1997.</p>

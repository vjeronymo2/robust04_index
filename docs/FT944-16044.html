			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: King of the road keeps to the straight and narrow - A look at the pitfalls ahead for John Major as he maps out a future route for the Tory party Mr John Major's task was straightforward. As one of his senior ministers confided over dinner in Bournemouth this week, it was 'to keep the wheels on the coach'. The prime minister succeeded. The coach could yet career into a ditch called Europe. And its driver faces a Commons challenger who is busy installing a new engine in Labour's ancient charabanc. Next Tuesday Mr Major and Mr Tony Blair will face each other for the first of the confrontations across the despatch box which will set the mood of British politics in the run up to the next general election. There were noisy distractions in Bournemouth - allegations over the business dealings of Mr Mark Thatcher, Mr Norman Lamont's intervention over Europe, Mr Michael Portillo's emergence as the unchallenged torch-bearer of the right. As the right of the party started to erect its roadblocks to any further European integration there was a stark warning of the fragile state of the Tory coalition over which the prime minister presides. The same ministers who predicted with confidence from the platform that they would win a fifth general election victory were ready to concede over coffee that Europe, like the corn laws and tariff reform before it, is an issue that may tear the party apart. Some believe the split will happen only if the party is defeated at the general election. Others fear that if France and Germany force the pace then Mr Major's government will fracture over the terms of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of integration. But that is for next year, and the year after. This time the Conservative party left its annual conference in no worst shape than it arrived. It is 20 points or 25 points behind in the polls. It is grumpy, angry, but it is not in open revolt. Mr Major himself has looked more relaxed in Bournemouth than at any conference since the 1992 election. He decided back in May that he wanted and - more importantly, that he would be able - to stay in 10 Downing Street. Since then he has started to gather around him a group of ministers with whom he feels secure. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the education secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, are among those in the inner core. Mr David Hunt, the public services minister, is proving an effective trouble-shooter, Mr William Waldegrave at agriculture a useful thinker. Mr Douglas Hurd might well stay on at the Foreign Office until the general election. The new confidence showed itself during Mr Major's speech yesterday. It will not go down as one of the great orations of political history. He is not that sort of speaker. But it sounded as though it was his own. It started to show us the direction in which he intends to drive the coach. The rhetorical battle this week has been won by the right. The conference, in which year-by-year the envelope stuffers have been edged out by more committed activists, is more comfortable with the language of nationalism than with the harsher realities of the world. But the warm applause for Mr Portillo and his philosophical soulmates went unheeded by Mr Major. His message was one of caution and pragmatism. There will be no more shake-ups in the schools, no more cuts in the armed forces, no more change for the sake of dogma. The prime minister is promising quiet, conservative, competent government. Mr Michael Heseltine still thinks he can win his battle to privatise the Post Office. If he does - and it remains a big if - it will be the last new excursion to the ideological frontiers. Mr Major, confident that after 15 years the Conservatives have at last found the formula for steady growth and low inflation, is relying on two more years of economic recovery to revive the government's fortunes. He cannot take it for granted. The shock of adjustment to a low inflation economy has smothered the feelgood factor. Real personal disposable income, seen by the old hands in the cabinet as the unchallenged determinant of electoral success, is not about to take off. The prime minister is offering the security of a stable economy. The voters might easily prefer pocketfuls of ten-pound notes. As for Mr Blair, Mr Major has put himself on the side of those determined to keep the Tories on the centre ground, to cast the Labour leader as a counterfeit capitalist rather than as a closet communist. Others in the cabinet - Mr Heseltine among them - prefer a more robust style and do not worry about the apparent contradictions. But the important message from Mr Major was that there will be no lurch to the right. All this adds up to a plausible but precarious strategy. Mr Blair has more ideas for Labour. His strategy also is to address the electorate's sense of insecurity - as leader of a government that would manage change. If the government's opinion poll ratings do not improve quite soon, Mr Major's message of consolidation will not be enough for the Tory MPs in the party's marginal constituencies. But the biggest threat comes still from Europe. Mr Major said yesterday he wanted to keep his coach on a European road. The Tory right could yet force it into a ditch.</p>

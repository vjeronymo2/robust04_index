			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Apr. 28, IRNA -- The British Government  Thursday [28 April] launched a new campaign to discredit Iran by  making claims that Tehran was involved in "assisting and  encouraging terrorism" in Northern Ireland. At a meeting with  Iran's charge d'affaires to London, Gholamreza Ansari, Foreign  Office minister, Douglas Hogg, was said to have made accusations  that he was "convinced of contacts between Iranian intelligence  and the IRA" in its struggle against UK rule.    The charge d'affaires had been asked to have an advance  meeting with Hogg ahead of the Organization of Islamic  Conference (OIC) group on Bosnia pressing the British Government  to end its indifference to Serb aggression. But according to  the Foreign Office minister, Ansari was told that he had been  "summoned" to convey British concern about the supposed contacts  with the IRA, which he maintained should be "immediately and  conclusively severed."    A spokesman for the Foreign Office said he was unable to  comment on where the unspecified allegations came from other  than there had been no claims or reports made in the British  press. The only advance information came from a BBC  correspondent, presumably briefed by the Foreign Office, who  alleged that Iran was planning to assist the IRA with funds and  weapons.    Republican sources in Belfast were equally surprised by the  claims, suggesting that it was "black propaganda" used to cover  British intelligence involvement in helping to supply South  African weapons to loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland.    The UK Government has also been under pressure by its  failure  to press forward the peace process in Belfast and is seen  looking for a scapegoat. Other links have been made about  Britain's `Rushdie campaign' against Iran "running out-of-steam"  and was looking to for a fresh smear to support the U.S. policy  to isolate Tehran following this week's visit from Secretary of  State Warren Christopher.</p>

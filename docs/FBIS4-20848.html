			<p>CSO       [Editorial report] Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian  for 10 March 1994 publishes on page 8 a 200-word article by  Andrey Vaganov entitled "New Publications: Security From the  Point of View of Academicians," describing the first issue of a  new journal, GEOPOLITIKA I BEZOPASNOST [Geopolitics and  Security]. The journal is published by the Geopolitics and  Security Section of the Military History Division of the Russian  Federation Academy of Natural Sciences, and printed by the  Voyentekhizdat printing plant. Vaganov describes it as a  "200-page, large format academic journal," printed on good paper  with high-quality printing, with "something for the dilettante  to read as well as something for the specialist to analyze." He  quotes the journal's editors as describing it as an  "experimental journal-almanac." Among the articles in the first  issue are "Why Democracy Is Triumphing in Russia," by Cornell  University Profesor Richard Darlington, "Forecast of the State  and Tendencies for Change in the Geopolitical Map of the World  in Regions of the Far Abroad," "Ethnographic Factors of Military  Security," "Military Security and Defense," and "Military  Aspects of Ecological Security," as well as several articles on  military history.    Vaganov writes that the first issue contains no information  as to the size of the new journal's print run or its  periodicity. He speculates that in view of its high-quality  printing and paper, it will attract no more than 1,000 buyers.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (9): Book early for the very best - Eating out / A really good restaurant is one of the treats of a visit to Paris - but it can also be something of a trial THE FRENCH are appallingly snooty about everything to do with eating, from the choice of restaurant, to the meal itself. Any three-star restaurant worth its Michelin rosettes - such as Robuchon on rue de Longchamp, where the chef, Joel Robuchon is famous for his experimentation, or the more traditional Taillevent on rue Lamennais - is certain to be booked up for at least a month in advance, particularly for dinner. So you must plan ahead and make your reservation early. Some of the sniffier Parisian eateries, such as Brasserie Lipp on boulevard Saint-Germain, are so chauvinistic that they are wary of taking too may bookings from foreigners. When you finally arrive at the restaurant of your choice it is sure to be full of Parisians reminiscing about how the (apparently faultless) food is not quite so good as it used to be. There are, of course, lots of sources of advice as to where you might like to eat in Paris. As any London restaurateur will tell you, the Michelin tasters are rather more liberal about sprinkling their stars around France than Britain. But the Michelin is still a reasonably good guide to the Paris food scene. Gault Millau, the bible of the haut bourgeois and now available in an English version, offers a much more acerbic - and entertaining - analysis of where you should, or should not go, complete with marks out of 20 for each establishment. In any case it would silly to miss out on the opportunity to eat really well when in Paris. The food at the three-star restaurants is generally sensational and the locations - L'Ambroisie hidden among its 17th century arches in the heart of Le Marais, or Lucas-Carton with its Belle Epoque interior - are often equally impressive. There are also some jewels among the two-star places fighting for promotion. Le Grand Vefour in Palais Royal has been a restaurant since the 18th century  -Napoleon is said to have dined there with Josephine  - and has kept its exquisite interior intact. Le Grand Vefour already has two stars and is bidding for a third as is Guy Savoy on rue Troyon, which is run by one of the most innovative of the younger Parisian chefs. Any restaurant with two or three Michelin stars is sure to be suitable for even the most formal business lunch. But the atmosphere at the very grand Parisian restaurants often errs towards the staid, or stuffy. They do tend to be treated as epicurean temples where poe-faced Parisians can entertain their Japanese joint venture partners. They are also extremely expensive. The bill for dinner for two at any restaurant with two or three stars can be anything between FFr1,500 to FFr2,500 without wine. If you prefer a less formal atmosphere, and are less inclined to torture your bank balance, it is probably better to plump for a smaller, livelier Parisian restaurant. L'Ami Louis on the winding rue Vertbois is one of the oldest bistros in Paris with a delightful mottled mirrors and battered old wooden furniture. The menu is classic French and rarely stints on the cholesterol. The portions are huge, but generally delicious. The only hitch is the winelist - exasperatingly long and very expensive. Le Voltaire, on quai Voltaire in the heart of the Left Bank, is another must for the traditionalists, particularly for any literature-buff as it is set, as the name suggests, in the house where Voltaire lived and died. Chez Pauline, on rue Villedo at the back of Palais Royal, is a pretty bistro - always filled with flowers - where the chef produces contemporary versions of traditional Lyonnaise dishes. Benoit, a fin de siecle coaching inn at the Hotel de Ville end of rue Saint Martin, serves up traditional bistro fare. Chez Georges on rue du Mail by place des Victoires is another classic bistro, with hearty Lyonnaise fare. It is best for lunch, when the tables are packed with chattering Parisians. The atmosphere seems more antiseptic at dinner. L'Ami Louis, Le Voltaire, Chez Pauline, Benoit and Chez Georges are all far cheaper than their two and three-starred counterparts, but still cost between FFr300 and FFr500 per person just for food. If you want to taste classic Parisian cuisine, but are on a more limited budget, there are dozens of good, cheap brasseries and bistros to choose from although the atmosphere in these places is far less formal and they are not really appropriate for business eating. Aux Charpentiers on rue Mabillon is a good traditional bistro in Saint-Germain and is always bustling with customers. Polidor on rue Monsieur le Prince near Odeon serves tasty, traditional fare at student prices as does Chez Paul on the corner of rue de Lappe and rue de la Charonne in the Bastille district. The old-fashioned station restaurants - the newly renovated Le Train Bleu above Gare de Lyon and Terminus Nord at Gare du Nord - are still popular - although the memory of their fin de siecle interiors fades fast, particularly at night, when you walk out into the dirty, and potentially dangerous, railway stations. Paris is also full of restaurants with a more modern approach to cooking. The craze for nouvelle cuisine that swept through the city in the early 1980s, has faded. However there are still some survivors such as La Maison Blanche which offers a panoramic rooftop view through the huge windows of its perch at the top of the Theatre des Champs Elysees at the bottom of avenue Montaigne. Finally, if you feel you fancy something simpler you could try Guen Mai on rue de l'Abbaye by place Saint-Germain, one of the new wave of fashionable macro-biotic restaurants now opening in Paris, which is easier on the stomach - and the arteries. Addresses and telephone numbers for all these restaurants are available from the Paris telephone directory, Minitel, or the Michelin and Gault Millau guides.</p>

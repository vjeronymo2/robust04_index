			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> POST STORY ON CARMEN WAS INCORRECT  </P> <P> On July 11, The Times published a story from the Washington Post reporting that  Gerald Carmen, former head of the Federal Asset Disposition Assn., a unit of  the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, helped arrange a meeting with a bank board  official on behalf of a client who was seeking a contract to manage foreclosed  properties.  </P> <P> The Post said Tuesday that it subsequently learned that Carmen did not set up  the meeting, which was arranged by a person who works at Financial Institution  Services Corp., as does Carmen, and who attended the meeting with Carmen.  Carmen is president of FISC but is not the controlling shareholder, according  to a company spokesman.  </P> <P> The spokesman said that, contrary to unattributed statements in the Post's  article, Carmen had not profited from "contacts" at the Department of Housing  and Urban Development and FHLBB but rather had used his government "knowledge  and experience" to assist clients and pursue business interests.  </P> <P> The article also reported incorrectly that Carmen had been a Republican  fund-raiser in New Hampshire and was a former car dealer. He had been a  Republican Party official and was in the tire business, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told ITAR-TASS by  telephone on Monday morning that the terrorist was a certain  Abdulayev, who had been earlier convicted three times.    On February 4 he demanded that the republic's government  deliver US$500,000 and 500 million rubles or else he would set  off several explosions and commit several other acts of terror  in Yakutsk.    It was soon found out that Abdulayev had planted no bombs.  It was also established that no group Vozmezdie (Retribution)  existed: it was an invention of the hardened criminal who wanted  money to pay off major debts and "enjoy some good living," as he  put it himself. Aleksey Tomtosov said criminal proceedings had  been instituted. Specialists of the Federal Ministry of Internal  Affairs and Counter-Intelligence Service supposed from the very  beginning that the criminal was bluffing, but a large-scale  operation was launched to make sure that no danger threatens the  city and its residents.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the offer of Partnership for Peace made by the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, Finland is interested  not only in peacekeeping, but also in participation in  theoretical and practical training in and planning for search,  rescue, and humanitarian operations. Tomorrow the government's  Foreign Affairs Committee will discuss its attitude to  Partnership for Peace, but will not make any decisions yet.  Prime Minister Esko Aho, who addressed the Diet's Defense  Committee, said that the main content of the offer to Finland  concerns peacekeeping activities.    Aho's definition is broader than the stance presented by  Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn to the Defense Committee on  Tuesday [15 March], according to which Finland will limit itself  to offering peacekeeping training only.</p>

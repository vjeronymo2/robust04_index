The agreement was signed by  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Japanese  Ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa.    "This agreement defines specific areas of cooperation in the  elimination of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which is being  closely watched by the world community, Shoji Suezawa said.  Japan hopes very much that Ukraine will proceed confidently  along the path of denunciation of nuclear weapons and that, as a  non-nuclear state, it will join the Treaty on non-proliferation  of nuclear weapons."</p>

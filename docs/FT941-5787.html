The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 18.2m new shares, of which 2.18m will be retained by Algo's vendors. Deferred consideration of up to Pounds 1.2m is profit-related. Wills also plans to raise about Pounds 2.05m before expenses, through an institutional placing of 7.47m new shares at 27 1/2 p apiece through Greig Middleton. It is also placing, at the same price, 16m of the shares issued in connection with the Algo acquisition. At the same time Wills announced the acquisition of a 73 per cent stake in Comint, a Spanish representative for overseas makers of engineering products, for up to Pta210m (Pounds 1m).

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / PLO takes first steps in self-rule: Palestinian police tour Gaza Strip as Israel vows never to return An advance team of Palestinian policemen toured police stations in the Gaza Strip yesterday amid growing fears that the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) would not be able to implement swiftly the self-rule agreement signed with Israel in Cairo on Wednesday. Officials from the PLO yesterday denied that it was not ready to assume its new powers under the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as suggested by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister. But they said the full deployment of Palestinian police would take at least a week longer than expected. A party of 17 senior Palestinian police officers were escorted around the coastal Strip in a convoy of heavily-armed Israeli police and army jeeps. Israel also completed its evacuation of the Gaza central prison and continued releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The PLO said arrival of the first 1,000 police, who should have been in place today, had run into 'technical problems' and they would not arrive until next week. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, seeking to bolster Israeli support for the peace process, vowed that the Jewish state would never return to the Strip, packed with refugee camps and squalid townships which have been in open revolt against Israel for the past seven years. 'There is no going back. We won't go back to Gaza, Gaza won't come back to us,' he said. However, instead of euphoria the mood of most Palestinians was disappointment and suspicion of Israel's real motives. Three of the best-known Palestinian leaders from the West Bank and Gaza - Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi - expressed deep reservations. Mr Husseini, PLO boss in the West Bank, said the agreement should not have been signed until all remaining issues were finalised, and Mrs Ashrawi said the accord fell short of Palestinian demands. Israelis remained as sceptical as the Palestinians about the peace prospects. An opinion poll published in Yediot Ahronot, the tabloid Hebrew newspaper, showed that only 7 per cent of Israelis believed there was a very high chance for peace. Sixty-two per cent said the chances for peace were low or non-existent. Two radical PLO faction leaders and Syria attacked the agreement as an obstacle to Middle East peace. Mr George Habash, leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Mr Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said their fighters would step up attacks against Israel but would initially exclude areas under Palestinian self-rule.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan and Iran have agreed to make joint efforts  with technical and financial assistance from the United Nations  to check drug trafficking along their borders. A memorandum of  understanding to this effect was signed in Tehran by retired  Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, Pakistani interior  minister; 'Ali Mohammad Besharati-Jahromi, Iranian interior  minister; and Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the UN  International Narcotics Control Program. Under the agreement,  antinarcotics measures along the border between the two  countries will be made more effective, communications facilities  will be improved, and arrangements will be made for training  professionals of law-enforcement agencies. About $30 million  will be spent on the new antinarcotics measures, of which $21  million will be paid by Iran which will mostly be used for road  construction to facilitate the speedy movement of security  forces. Pakistan will provide $5.5 million, while the UN  International Narcotics Control Program will pay $3.6 million.</p>

Final  </P> <P> 31 MORE DIE ACROSS INDIA IN VIOLENCE LINKED TO MOSQUE  </P> <P> At least 31 more people died today across India in riots linked to an attempt  by Hindus to raze a mosque and erect a temple on the site, news agencies  reported.  </P> <P> In Ayodhya, about 300 miles southwest of New Delhi, more than 10,000 Hindu  pilgrims threatened further attempts to overrun the mosque, and a police  official promised to investigate reports that authorities dumped slain Hindu  protesters in a river.  </P> <P> The conflict has caused at least 210 deaths around the nation since Oct. 24 and  threatens to topple Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh's National Front  coalition government.  </P> <P> Most of today's deaths were in the states of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, where  the disputed site is located, police said. Uttar Pradesh, the nation's most  populous state with 120 million people, is about 30% Muslim.  </P> <P> Details of the fighting were not released by officials, fearing that it would  exacerbate tensions between majority Hindus and Muslims.  </P></p>

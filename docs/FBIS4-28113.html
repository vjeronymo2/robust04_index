			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- A study group composed of  representatives of the ruling coalition parties on Tuesday [7  June] submitted a report to the umbrella committee on tax system  reform calling for the boosting of indirect tax to realize a  fair funding structure, group officials said.    The group, studying the pension, medical and other social  welfare systems, said in the report that Japan should become a  welfare- oriented society funded by the expansion of indirect  tax.    The report said that, based on an impartial taxation system,  the government should provide quality welfare, realizing  long-term stable pensions, enhancing the efficiency of medical  services and strengthening nursing care, they said.    It suggested that the government raise the consumption tax  rate, currently at 3 percent, noting that taxpayers now bear too  great an income tax burden and the rate of direct taxation is  too high, creating unsteady tax revenues because of the close  mirroring of economic fluctuations.    However, the report avoided referring to the margin by which  the consumption tax rate should be raised.    The tax reform committee of the coalition parties will begin  full-scale discussion of reform of the nation's tax system after  Thursday when the results of two other study groups -- on  administrative reform and the fundamentals of taxation -- are to  be submitted.</p>

This regulation implements Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ), with regard to program accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The authority to grant a time extension is jointly delegated to both the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary for PIH. This authority is then retained and jointly redelegated to both the Director, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Division, and to either the Director, Public Housing Division (in the case of a Public Housing Agency) or the Administrator, Office of Native American Programs (in the case of an Indian Housing Authority), in the pertinent field offices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 15, 1994: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  William C.

Where the assessment demonstrates a need for additional accessible units, the HA must develop a transition plan to achieve the necessary structural changes. In accordance with this regulation, each HA is to have already made such assessment, and developed a transition plan, if required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR 8.25(c) provides that each HA must have completed the structural changes necessary to achieve accessibility as identified in the transition plan no later than July 11, 1992. However, the regulation also provides that an HA may obtain an extension of time in meeting this deadline under certain circumstances. Section 8.25(c) provides that the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary for PIH may extend the deadline to as late a date as July 11, 1994 ``on a case-by-case determination that compliance within that period would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the recipient's public housing and multi-family Indian housing program''. This regulation further provides that the Secretary or the Undersecretary may extend the time period for compliance from July 11, 1994, up until July 11, 1995, in ``extraordinary circumstances''. To facilitate the prompt review of each request, the Secretary is jointly delegating to the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH, and the Assistant Secretaries are jointly redelegating to certain officials in the field, the authority to grant an extension of time in ``extraordinary circumstances'' for an HA to complete these structural changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Secretary delegates, and the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH redelegate, authority as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPARE THE ROD AND SELF-ESTEEM, STUDY SAYS;  </P> <P> DISCIPLINE: IF YOU ARE TRYING TO INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN YOUR CHILDREN, PUT THE  HAIR BRUSH AWAY. PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT IS NOT THE WAY TO GO, ACCORDING TO A SAN  DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY STUDY.  </P> <P> Children who are disciplined with a slap or a spanking are generally less  competent -- and less confident -- than children who don't receive physical  punishment in the home, according to a San Diego State University study  released Monday.  </P> <P> The study, conducted this spring and summer in several San Diego County  elementary schools, examined the effect of physical punishment on a child's  self-esteem. According to Dr. Anthony J. Urquiza, the study's author, the  research focused on families that regularly use physical discipline as a  parenting technique, but it intentionally excluded abusive families.  </P> <P> After testing third-, fourth- and fifth-graders, ages 8 to 11 years old, for  scholastic abilities, social acceptance, athletic skills, physical appearance,  behavioral conduct and perceptions of self-worth, Urquiza concluded that the  harsher and more frequent a parent's punishment, the lower their child's  overall competence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Violence Begets Violence'  </P> <P> "How much should you hit your child? You shouldn't, ever. When is it OK? It's  not," Urquiza, an assistant professor in SDSU's Family Studies Department, said  Monday after he presented his findings to the Eighth National Conference on  Child Abuse and Neglect in Salt Lake City. "It is damaging to children to hurt  them. Violence begets violence."  </P> <P> According to Urquiza, recent studies show that 80% to 97% of all children are  physically punished at some time in their childhood. He said most parents who  raise a hand to their kids believe they are helping their children learn the  difference between right and wrong. According to his research, however, they  are mistaken.  </P> <P> "They slap or hit with a paddle or belt while thinking, 'I'm teaching you  something for your own good.' They think it is an effective means of dealing  with a child," he said. "But it only provides a short-term solution. It doesn't  help children in the long run learn what to do."  </P> <P> He offered an example. A parent sees her child in a fight with another  youngster. She intervenes, and slaps her child in order to let him know that  fighting is not acceptable. But Urquiza maintains that, instead of learning not  to fight, the child may interpret the slap this way: "If I am going to hit  somebody, I have to be the most powerful person around."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expression of Anger  </P> <P> According to Urquiza's results, families that use physical punishment are  generally less organized, more chaotic and more likely to have strict,  inflexible rules. Members of such families are more openly willing to express  anger and hostility, Urquiza said.  </P> <P> Parents in such families reported many more behavioral problems among their  youngsters, like fighting with siblings or an angry attitude, than parents who  did not hit their children. Children who are physically punished, meanwhile,  often have a distorted view of their own bodies and their physical abilities,  Urquiza found. "The kids may think of themselves as weaker or not as able to  play on sports teams," he said.  </P> <P> Urquiza said he believes the news of his research will not change most parents'  disciplinary methods. "This is not something that the public at large appears  to want to hear," he said. "A lot of parents will disbelieve it. They want to  continue to have the right to discipline their children as they see fit. But  many will be meeting only their needs, and not the needs of their children."  </P></p>

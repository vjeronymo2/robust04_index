			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Worries on France THERE WERE suggestions in French money markets yesterday that France's interest rates may have to stay high for some time, following the franc's poor performance inside the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. Several weeks ago, the outlook for French financial instruments was strong, and French 10-year bond yields moved close to their German counterparts amid fears over German inflation. Profit-taking led to new weakness in French bonds and the French currency on Friday, and this trend continued yesterday. But some dealers added that the right-wing government looked to be under increasing pressure to push interest rates well below German levels at any cost, and this was forcing dealers to rethink the outlook for French rates. Concern was raised over the extraordinarily high levels of French unemployment, a record 11.5 per cent in May, which may fuel the govern-ment's desire to ease monetary policy. However, this spec-ulation had a negative effect on the currency, possibly making it difficult for the Bank of France to ease policy. Three-month French cash therefore moved sharply higher on the day, rising nearly 20 basis points to close at 7.05 per cent on the bid side. The September French franc futures contract finished 9 basis points lower at 93.40, suggesting that French rates will come down by less than  1/2 percentage point over the next 2 1/2 months. German money markets saw little action, with the Bundesbank having already set a fixed rate repo at 7.30 per cent for this week. The September Euromark contract closed one basis point firmer at 93.16. Sterling markets were little moved, although futures dealers remained confident that  1/2 percentage point will come off base rates before the end of the year. The speedy removal of a Pounds 1.4bn shortage left three-month money unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent. The December short sterling contract was more or less unaltered at 94.44. Italy yesterday reduced its main interest rates by a full percentage point, with the discount rate coming down to 9 per cent and the Lombard rate to 10 per cent. This move was larger than the market had expected, but came after the signing of a key wages deal over the weekend.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Motoring: Volvo estate goes glam THE ANGULAR lines are softened only slightly and the 850 looks like a traditional Volvo estate car. But appearance deceives; it is a different animal. The ever-popular, rear-wheel driven 240, 740 and 940 estates can all be traced back to the original 144 of 1967. The 850 - front-wheel driven and powered by a silky, sideways-mounted, multi-valve, five-cylinder engine - is the load-carrying version of Volvo's latest (and best by far) sedan. It has just gone on sale in Britain at prices ranging from Pounds 17,795 for the two-litre 850 SE to Pounds 21,395 for a 2.5-litre 850 GLT. Volvo has pitched the 850 estate at younger owners with fewer encumbrances: in short, the kind of people who want a car that drives responsively but need the versatility of an estate. The company expects to sell around 3,000 in Britain this year and thinks many will go to fairly affluent family men in their late 30s; in other words, typical Audi or BMW drivers. Such drivers would not previously have considered a Volvo because they felt they were not old enough. The 850 estate will, I think, surprise and impress them. Like the BMW 5-Series Touring (this column, April 24) or an Audi 80 or 100 estate, it combines sporting verve with reasonable bulk-carrying capacity. Handling and road-holding are, of course, as safe and predictable as one expects of a Volvo. But there is no trace of the cart-horse about an 850 estate. It is a car in which long journeys on winding, hilly roads are to be enjoyed, not suffered. The acid test of an estate car's suspension, especially a big one, is how it performs with only the driver on board. Some feel rather bouncy when running light but improve as weight is added. The 850's ride is always relaxingly shock-absorbent, yet it corners with a sporty saloon's precision. A 33ft (10.2m) turning circle makes it as handy in confined spaces as a small hatchback. Volvo claims the 850 is 'probably the safest estate on the market.' Its body sides are single steel pressings laser-welded to the roof, and the force of a side-on impact is distributed over several elements to retain survival space. Anti-lock brakes are standard and a traction control system, using the same electronics, is an option. Front-seat airbags will be available later in the year. While the 850 is no match for a traditional, rear-wheel drive Volvo estate in sheer carrying capacity, it will be big enough for most buyers. (How often do you see a Volvo estate crammed absolutely full?). With the split-fold rear seat back-rest down, the load floor is a mere 64.5in (162cm) long compared with a 240's 77.6in (194in) or a 940's 74in (185cm). But the rear cushion folds forward to protect the front seat-backs, and converting the 850 into a load-carrier could not be easier. Meanwhile, if you have a Volvo 240 and use it as a bulk cargo-carrier, do not wait too long to order a replacement. This cheap (from under Pounds 14,000 list) and ultra-roomy veteran will not be available after October. It will be missed sadly.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Observer: Under review Poor John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, whose entrepreneurial approach to academia much impressed Mrs Thatcher. First he lost the battle to take over County Hall as a new seat for the LSE. Now his plan to charge undergraduates up to Pounds 1,000 to compensate for cuts in government funds has been thrown out by the LSE academic board. It leaves a big hole in the LSE budget, which will not be bridged by plans to raise fees for post-graduate students. That plan has been put on the back burner because of fears overseas students on masters' courses might kick up a fuss if they felt their higher fees were subsidising British undergraduates. The net result could be to put paid to the LSE's aspirations to become a world-class postgraduate university. Many of the dons who voted down the fee plan by 75 votes to 9 felt their director had tried to use the issue to start a national debate on higher education funding. Ashworth, away on a pre-arranged visit to Taiwan, desperately needs a victory soon if he is to sustain his authority at the school.</p>

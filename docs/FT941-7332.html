			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / TSB to shed 400 more jobs 160 by natural wastage and 240 redundancies. The bank said the job losses were 'partly due to a review of head-office functions and partly because of a continuing programme to improve efficiency and reduce costs'. The Bifu banking union said most job losses would be at the bank's head office in Birmingham, with other cuts at Andover, Edinburgh, Manchester, Brighton and Newport in South Wales. TSB warned in January that 1,000 jobs could go this year after reducing its workforce by 1,800 over the past year.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bayer declines on prices pressure BAYER, the German chemical company, yesterday announced a 9.8 per cent decline in its first half pre-tax profits to DM1.75bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and said it no longer expected the world economy to improve fundamentally in the second half. 'We are bracing ourselves for tougher competition in all areas,' it added. But it still expected to report a 'satisfactory' result, although this would be slightly lower than in 1991. Bayer made pre-tax profits of DM3.2bn last year, a fall of 5 per cent which was not as steep as those of its German rivals, BASF and Hoechst. The latest results from Bayer were better than the market expected and the share price dipped by only 10 pfennigs to DM256 on a day when the Frankfurt stock market was down sharply as the weak dollar highlighted problems for German exporting companies. Bayer said its first-half earnings drop was caused by continuing pressure on prices, especially in those sectors linked to manufacturing industry. Currency movements also hit profits. Turnover was down by 0.2 per cent to DM22.2bn. Volume sales rose 3 per cent. In Europe, turnover was 2 per cent lower at DM14.6bn, mainly because of the weaker German economy. Business was fairly stable in the rest of western Europe.</p>

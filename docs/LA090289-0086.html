			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC MESSAGE PAYS TRIBUTE TO LABOR UNION CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Labor unions, resented by totalitarian states and sometimes by corporate  managers, are regarded by most historic churches as buttressing the rights and  dignity of ordinary workers.  </P> <P> Their entitlement to organize and negotiate contractual standards also have  become protected by law in democratic countries.  </P> <P> That point was underlined in the 1989 Labor Day message of the U.S. Catholic  Conference. It cited a particularly dramatic modern example -- the  union-spawned turn to democracy in Poland.  </P> <P> Similar union-backed thrusts for democracy were noted in other long-oppressed  lands, sometimes meeting countermeasures. Some anti-union moves also were seen  in the United States.  </P> <P> Americans "can now see how trade unions in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia  unite and uplift the aspirations for freedom and solidarity of oppressed  peoples," the message said.  </P> <P> Called "Freedom, Justice and the Role of Unions," the statement pointed up the  union-energized dawn of fuller rights in Poland, long under communist  oppression, and said:  </P> <P> "All men and women of good will are heartened by the successful struggle of  Poland's workers, whose free, democratic trade union, 'Solidarnosc'  (Solidarity) has become the instrument of progress, and we hope, liberation. .  . .  </P> <P> "Working people in Hungary, in China, in South Africa and in Siberia and the  Ukraine are asserting the same social values of human dignity, freedom and  solidarity . . . as they work . . . to create the democratic trade unions. . .  ."  </P> <P> Christianity and Judaism have special grounds for concern with the labor  movement drawn from the Bible and its emphasis on mutual community  responsibility for all persons in it, including its lowliest workers.  </P> <P> "We are members one of another," the apostle Paul wrote, stressing the duty of  all to share the burdens and needs of fellow toilers, and also to uphold and  celebrate their well-being.  </P> <P> A tentmaker himself, as well as an evangelist, he saw work as honorable and  essential, a part of God's unfolding creation. "We are co-workers with God."  Sloth, termed by the church one of seven deadly sins, also drew Paul's scorn,  "Let him who won't work not eat."  </P> <P> Major churches in this century have voiced their support for union organization  and collective bargaining to set standards for workers.  </P></p>

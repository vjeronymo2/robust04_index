Only  this will open up prospects for breaking the international  isolation of Baghdad. The statement was made at a Tuesday  briefing in Moscow by the official spokesman for the Russian  Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin.    According to him, Moscow has taken notice of the report of  the UN Security Council Commission for the Disarmament of Iraq  saying that the destruction of the Iraqi arsenal of chemical  weapons is entering the final stage. The Commission Chairman  Ralph Ekeus said that by now the bulk of chemical weapons has  been scrapped and the necessary barriers have been built for the  prevention of their production in the future.    "On the whole, this can be considered as additional  confirmation of Baghdad's readiness to cooperate with the United  Nations in implementing Security Council resolutions on the  Persian Gulf. Such changes in the Iraqi approach should be  encouraged. The call was made by the Russian ambassador to the  United Nations during a recent Security Council debate on  anti-Iraqi sanctions," Karasin said.    In his opinion, to prevent the possibility of the  reconstruction of the Iraqi military potential, the mechanism of  long-term monitoring should be launched as soon as possible and  a trial period declared to check its efficiency.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ramus warns of further losses Ramus Holdings, the USM-traded building materials group, warned shareholders to anticipate further losses in the current year. In the annual report and accounts for the 12 months to June 30 1992, which showed a pre-tax deficit of pounds 2.95m on turnover of pounds 52.9m, Mr Lionel Ramus, the outgoing chairman, said that difficult trading conditions had initiated structural changes to reduce costs. These moves will result in an exceptional charge of approximately pounds 350,000 in the six months to end-December when losses before tax and the exceptional are expected to total about pounds 1m. Nevertheless, directors said benefits of the rationalisation and cost reduction programme were already being felt. They expressed 'cautious optimism' over the second six months.</p>

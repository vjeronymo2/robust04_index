			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA'S CATHOLIC BISHOPS CALL ON NORIEGA TO RESIGN  </P> <P> Thousands of Panamanians chanted, applauded, sang and wept Sunday in support of  the Roman Catholic Church's emergence as a leader in the struggle to force Gen.  Manuel A. Noriega from power.  </P> <P> In Masses throughout the country, priests and ordinary church-goers read a  pastoral letter signed by all 10 of Panama's bishops attacking Noriega for  trying to steal last week's presidential election -- first through massive  fraud, then by nullifying the vote -- and for violently assaulting his  political opposition.  </P> <P> In wealthy churches with organs and choirs and in modest chapels where a single  guitarist accompanied hymns, the clergy condemned Noriega for "violating the  popular will" by refusing to accept the apparent overwhelming election victory  of the Democratic Alliance for Civic Opposition.  </P> <P> "What moral justification can be made for firing bullets and beating men and  women whose only crime was to peacefully demand their rights?" the bishops'  letter asked. "What moral justification can be made for terrifying the hungry  masses with a hateful and false nationalism that neither respects nor  recognizes the rights and safety of the rest of the Panamanians?"  </P> <P> In demanding that Noriega turn over power to the opposition "in recognition of  the will of the people" as expressed in the elections, the bishops said that  "not to do so would be a sin of conscience."  </P> <P> The pastoral letter was especially critical of the Noriega regime for ordering  paramilitary and security forces to attack opposition leaders last Wednesday,  when Democratic Alliance leaders Guillermo Endara, Ricardo Arias Calderon and  Guillermo (Billy) Ford were beaten so badly they had to be hospitalized.  </P> <P> The strongly worded condemnation of the military regime marked a turning point  for the church in Panama, a country that is 94% Catholic.  </P> <P> Until this year, the church was largely noted for its caution and reluctance to  criticize Noriega, let alone call for his removal from power.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Priests Are Foreigners  </P> <P> Apart from a historical conservatism, reasons for the low profile include the  makeup of the clergy. About 75% of the country's estimated 330 priests are  foreigners. Required to renew their visas every two months, "priests feel  pressure and constant threat," according to Father Fernando Guardia, a leader  of the anti-Noriega clergy.  </P> <P> But this year, as official corruption and Noriega's abuse of power, including a  growing intimidation of the clergy, increased, the church began speaking and  acting against the military regime.  </P> <P> Priests spoke out against the government's failure to investigate crimes  allegedly committed by military officers and other government officials, and  then last month the church announced that because of concern over the honesty  of the presidential election, it planned to conduct its own independent count  of the votes.  </P> <P> Actually, it was that count that helped convince diplomats and international  observers that Noriega's candidate had been swamped in the election and that  his government's claim of victory was a fraud.  </P> <P> But with the emergence of the church as a power against the regime, some  priests are worried that the political leaders are not keeping up with the  dissatisfaction of the people nor applying enough pressure to force Noriega  out.  </P> <P> "The opposition has opted for a political solution," said one important priest,  "but what kind of solution can you get from a dictator?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Nerve  </P> <P> The comment mirrors assessments from many diplomats and observers that the  opposition and its followers have never shown the stomach or nerve to overturn  someone as determined to keep power as Noriega.  </P> <P> "As soon as Noriega made a threat of force, whether he used it or not, the  opposition generally folded," said one diplomat. "No one expects them to get  killed, but waving handkerchiefs, milling around and then going home as soon as  troops show up won't get them power."  </P> <P> Even with the singing, the chants and the cheers, Sunday's show of support for  the Democratic Alliance never really got out of the pews and into the streets.  </P> <P> With Endara, the opposition presidential candidate, still under medical  treatment, Ford and Arias Calderon, who were the opposition's vice presidential  candidates, attended several Masses separately but then got together at the  Church of Christ the King to hear Msgr. Javier Villanueva read the pastoral  letter.  </P> <P> The thousand or more people who filled the church to overflowing applauded  constantly, chanted "Justice! Justice!" and waved the white handkerchiefs that  have become the symbol of the opposition, then sang "The Battle Hymn of the  Republic" in Spanish.  </P> <P> After the noon Mass, Ford said the reading of the pastoral letter "gives me  faith that things will get better."  </P></p>

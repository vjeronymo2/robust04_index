			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Amec sells Engil shareholding Amec, the engineering and construction group, has sold its stake in Engil, the Portuguese construction group, for Es2.7bn (Pounds 10.8m). The UK group joins other international constructors, including Bouygues of France, pulling out of joint ventures in Portugal. Amec recently sold its 20 per cent stake in the French construction group Serete for Pounds 11.3m to the company's management. The sales are part of a reassessment by the UK group of its minority stakes in continental European countries. Minority stakes in domestic and cross-border rivals are popular in countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands. However, they are generally considered unattractive in the UK and Italy, where companies prefer to have majority control in subsidiary interests. Amec's acquisition of minority continental stakes, however, has made it an exception among UK companies. It also wholly-owns or has majority stakes in Kittelberger, the German group, Norsk Elektro, the Norwegian engineering company, and Amec Engineering in the Netherlands. In January 1989, it acquired 50 per cent of a holding company which owns 49.9 per cent of the Engil construction company, quoted on the Lisbon stock market. It bought the interest when Portugal was entering a boom era for construction, fuelled by European Union funds. The Engil group has now been restructured through an increase in the capital of the holding company. A private placement of shares raised Es6.8bn, of which Amec receives Es2.7bn for relinquishing its stake. Engil will spend an another Es3bn acquiring 100 per cent control of three associate companies. Portugal's Geril group now controls about 55 per cent of the Engil holding company.</p>

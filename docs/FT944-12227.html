			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Terms for Malaysian timber sale accepted The vendors of two large timber companies to be acquired by Malaysia's Berjaya Textiles have accepted the revised terms imposed by the Securities Commission on the proposed sale, a Berjaya Textiles statement said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. Berjaya Textiles is buying Sarawak-based Jaya Tiasa Plywood and Rimbunan Hijau Plywood with shares, which would result in a reverse takeover of Berjaya Textiles by Malaysian timber tycoon Mr Tiong Hiew King and his associates.

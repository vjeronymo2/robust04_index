			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Observer: Toned up Some unseemly crackle, it would appear, on the hot line twixt the Bank of England and the Treasury. The latter's feathers have been ruffled by advance copies of the Bank's latest quarterly bulletin which, although sporting technicolour graphics for the first time, contained some sombre thoughts about the imminence of recovery from the recession. While Treasury officials do not want to be accused of being economical with the truth, they feel a duty to back Norman Lamont's rosier view of the next few months. And with the election coming up, there's an even more pressing reason not to let spirits sag. This explains why the Treasury has been turning to its blue pencil even more assiduously than usual to suggest amendments to the part of the bulletin dealing with economic prospects. Bank officials always find irksome having to submit their finely honed words to the scrutiny of their colleagues on the other side of London. On this occasion, however, Observer understands sparks have flown. At least the Treasury has not so far objected to the Bank's plan to change the bulletin's publication day to Tuesday, instead of Thursday, because the Old Lady thinks this will lead to greater publicity for the contents.</p>

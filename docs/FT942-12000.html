			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Observer: Number one Persuading Yassir Arafat to break from the last detailed negotiations of the peace talks with Israel was no mean feat on the part of Daimler-Benz, which yesterday wooed the PLO leader to Stuttgart. The idea was to signal the support of Germany's biggest industrial empire for the peace process - though just how far there is still to go was obvious from the cavalcade of 17 heavily-armoured four-tonne Mercedes limousines accompanying the visitor. Seeing that Arafat is not quite a head of state yet, he misses out on the traditional Daimler gift of a Merc. Instead, he came away with the promise of funding for a kindergarten - for 'the future of Palestine' - as well as cash for a study on establishing the transport infrastructure of the future state. Gleaming new roads to carry all those future trucks and buses, no doubt. Even for Edzard Reuter, the socially-conscious boss of Daimler, the profit motive is never entirely absent.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MEPs clear way for farm reform THE EUROPEAN Parliament yesterday cleared the way for reform of the European Community's farm policy by approving a plan for the cereals sector, parliamentary officials said, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. Members of Parliament asked the European Commission to tone down its proposal. Mr Ray MacSharry, the European Farm Commissioner, has proposed a 35 per cent cut in cereals prices during three years, with full compensation conditional on land being set aside. The parliament agreed by a large majority to ask the commission to cut prices by only 20 per cent in the first year of reforms and rejected further cuts. It also asked for higher compensation than the commission has proposed, arguing that large-scale farmers would otherwise be disadvantaged. Mr MacSharry had proposed limits on the area of land eligible for set-aside compensation. The vote on cereals completes the parliament's work on the farm reform package. It gave its opinion on all other aspects of it at last month's meeting. The European Parliament is required to give an opinion on any planned legislation before the Council of Ministers can finally pass it. The commission has to consider parliament's amendments, but is not obliged to accept them.</p>

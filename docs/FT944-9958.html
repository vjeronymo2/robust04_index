			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Cutting rivals down to size - Skiing The Aspen leaves have been sent swirling into creeks and ditches by the first real storms of November. Another winter has begun in the Rockies. And with it comes the outbreak of ski wars - or possibly unlikely alliances. The US may have about 14m skiers, but since 1977 it has lost an estimated 413 ski areas. Although these were mainly small resorts with insufficient profit margins, no one is taking any chances. The American ski magazines give a taste of the cut and thrust. 'The folks up in Vail, the biggest of Colorado's mega-resorts, like to boast that their mountain can accommodate 41,200 skiers per hour. But who wants to ski with 41,199 other people?' This was an advertisement in the November issue of Snow Country magazine placed by Vail's rival, Crested Butte. Quoting America's National Ski Areas Association, Snow Country claims that one-third of the nation's ski areas can 'barely keep their heads above the snow financially'. Only those attracting more than 200,000 skier visits a season make sufficient profit - Dollars 11.47 per visit - to be able to purchase new lifts, lodges, grooming machines and afford to pay taxes, debt interest and some return to investors. Any opportunity to cut a ski area down to size is seized: 'For as long as anyone can remember, Aspen Highlands has claimed 3,800 vertical feet. Colorado's biggest vertical. But when the mountain was resurveyed for the installation of two new high-speed quad chairs, it turned out to be only 3,635ft. 'So, did the mountain shrink? According to an Aspen Highlands' official, the ski area's original developer (and measurer) was 'very optimistic'.' This is from November's Skiing Magazine. Aspen recently purchased Highlands and has been modernising its antiquated lift system. The maverick ski area had been a small but irritating thorn in its side for decades. It was Aspen which helped start the 'if you can't beat them join them' revolution as an alternative to ski wars. In recent seasons Vail, a far more deadly rival than Aspen Highlands ever was, has been marketing itself with Aspen as a twin-centre ski holiday - an unthinkable arrangement a decade ago. Now, even Jackson Hole - another Rockies giant, which has signed up Tommy Moe, the Olympic Downhill gold medallist as its 'ski ambassador' - is busy promoting two minor competitors: Grand Targhee (a powder trap across the Tetons) and Snow King, a small but steep resort in the town of Jackson. The new Jackson Hole 'multi area lift ticket' will be valid this winter at all three resorts. Resorts such as Crested Butte, however, seem determined to continue their David and Goliath campaigns. This advertisement is from Ski, another American ski magazine: 'The glitz and glamour of Aspen is only 20 miles away from Crested Butte. Fortunately there's a 14,000ft mountain range between us.' Crested Butte, alone among resorts in the Rockies, is offering free skiing before Christmas for the fourth year running. But this year the offer starts later than usual, on November 28 rather than at Thanksgiving. 'With 9,300 young people testing our mountain at Thanksgiving, we definitely had concerns about the impact on our towns, parking facilities, mountain operations and residents,' says Steve Scott, a senior vice president. In the event, Mammoth Mountain in California's Eastern Sierras unexpectedly fired the most effective opening salvo of the winter: the resort opened three trails, Broadway, Fascination and Far West on October 8 (with free skiing for the day), its earliest opening in history, robbing Killington, Vermont and Keystone, Colorado - who traditionally battle to be the first US ski resort to open - of their usual kudos. Killington opened and closed because it became too warm to make snow, and Keystone quickly regained the initiative by opening two quad lifts serving 2,200 vertical feet of excellent man-made snow. Neighbouring Copper Mountain's American Eagle lift opened early to allow members of the American ski team to get some pre-season training on Main Vein, a fast cruising run with a 1,420ft vertical drop. But however well organised and marketed the resort, and however superbly groomed the slopes and the lift queues, mountain food remains an issue in the US. Perhaps the Americans are finally realising that this is the one realm in which the European resorts knock spots off them. Although many American skiers are preoccupied with how much their precious lift-tickets have cost and often want nothing more than fast-food before resuming their attack on the slopes, others are envious of the Alpine institution of lunch and would appreciate something more than just a swift hamburger and a beer. Some ski resorts are now building a new generation of sophisticated mountain restaurants to cater for them. Sun Valley, Idaho, has opened Seattle Ridge Lodge, a vast, spacious and plushly carpeted restaurant run by a French Maitre d'. At Blackcomb in British Columbia, a 'fine dining' establishment has opened on the slopes at Glacier Creek. Both offer a wide variety of international cuisine. Keystone, Colorado, has something even more special: the Alpenglow Stube, which somehow manages to dish up splendid fare at 11,444ft. Your ski boots are deposited in a warming room and substituted by a pair of soft moccasin-style slippers supplied by the management. Once you have sat down to a luxurious four or five course meal served with fine wine, you can forget about doing any more skiing, at least in daylight. But one of the compensations for giving up half a day of much-needed exercise in the quest for sinful pleasures is that Keystone has outstanding night skiing with perhaps the most extensive floodlit terrain in the world.</p>

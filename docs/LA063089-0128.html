			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: IRVINE  </P> <P> Lower sewer rates: The Irvine Ranch Water District has adopted a 1989-90 budget  that includes a reduction in sewer rates and no change in water rates, district  officials announced this week. The sewer service charge for a residential  customer, now $8.95 a month, will be reduced to $8.35, effective Saturday. The  decrease is due to lower operating costs and greater revenue, water district  officials said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INDIGENT FEAR FOR THEIR HEALTH AS LOOMING BUDGET CUTBACKS THREATEN MEANS FOR  CARE  </P> <P> Poor people are plentiful in the 2000 block of West Walnut Street.  </P> <P> Those who are homeless come to Center Park to spend the night. And those who  are sick come to a nearby building that says "Community Clinic of Orange  County."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, some of the poor at the clinic said they fear what will happen to  them as a result of looming state and county budget cutbacks. The Indigent  Medical Services program faces a serious slash. IMS is the safety net for the  so-called "working poor," people not eligible for MediCal but who don't make  enough to pay medical bills.  </P> <P> Obdulia Acosta, 36, of Santa Ana is one such person. As she left the clinic  Tuesday afternoon, her eyes widened in fear when she heard people talking about  possible reductions in medical aid to the poor.  </P> <P> "Not long ago my son had an accident at school. He was taken to a hospital and  they sent us a bill for $75 and one for $95, and we are not able to pay," she  said. "So I know how expensive medical care is. We can't afford it. We rely on  this clinic. I hope it is not true that they're cutting benefits."  </P> <P> Reyna Gutierrez, 36, of Santa Ana said she had a special reason to be fearful  of losing medical care. A doctor inside the clinic had just confirmed that she  is pregnant, she said. It will be her fourth child. She relies on the clinic  for prenatal care.  </P> <P> "I'm worried," she said, speaking softly in Spanish. "I've been coming here  since 1986. This program helps a lot of people. I hope they don't take the  program away."  </P> <P> The poor who use IMS at the Santa Ana clinic, and at numerous other hospitals  and clinics in Orange County, are all legal residents of the United States.  They cannot get IMS eligibility cards unless they prove they are U.S. citizens  or legal immigrants, medical officials noted.  </P> <P> Health officials say that prompt medical checkups of new immigrants are  critical to everyone's health. Tests can find communicable diseases and care  can be given to prevent their spread. And immunization shots help keep the new  immigrants healthy and self-supporting, the doctors point out.  </P> <P> One family of new, legal immigrants came to the Community Clinic of Orange  County on Tuesday. They said they were able to be there for medical checkups  because of the IMS aid.  </P> <P> The Ly family -- father, mother and three young-adult daughters -- arrived in  Orange County only two weeks ago after a long journey from their native  Vietnam.  </P> <P> "Our home was near Saigon," said the oldest daughter, Diem Ly, 22, speaking in  fluent English. "We now live in Fullerton. We came here today for medical  checkups." She said she hopes the IMS program cuts do not affect her family as  it struggles to become self-supporting.  </P> <P> As the Vietnamese family left the clinic, a solitary man hobbled toward the  entrance. Stratford Leonard, 40, of Santa Ana said his leg had gone bad. He was  at the clinic for relief from the pain.  </P> <P> Leonard was philosophical about what would happen to him, and hundreds like  him, if IMS cutbacks this year make it impossible for him to get care.  </P> <P> "I guess I'd have to go the home remedy route," he said. "I guess I'd have to  try Ace bandages and things like that." Then, thinking a minute, Leonard added:  "Of course I couldn't operate on myself."  </P></p>

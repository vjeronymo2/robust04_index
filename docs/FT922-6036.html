			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Dowsing the grid Whatever the outcome of the latest government inquiry, a national grid for the UK water industry is likely to remain a distant prospect. Practical objections aside, it is perhaps worth recalling that the principal attraction of privatising water was to remove the industry's capital spending requirements from public sector finances. It is scarcely conceivable that the government would approve the huge increases in spending needed to build a national supply network. By way of example, the 50 miles of the London ring main is costing Thames Water around Pounds 250m. Granted, the issue of who would pay for the grid is clouded, but there is little chance of the companies stumping up. As the forthcoming results season will remind them, consumers already face steady real increases in water bills. The case for further rises is unlikely to appeal to politicians. Nor would investors in water shares have much to cheer about. In addition to capital costs, there would be ongoing operating expenses for pumping water around the country. Should UK rainfall return to historic levels, a large project might end in embarrassment. All the same, the politicians' surge of interest could have beneficial effects. If the regulator agreed, water companies' spending on improvements to their leaking underground pipes could be brought forward at the expense of other work. In time, that would ease the supply problem. A faster introduction of metering might have the same effect on consumption. Water company chairmen have long maintained that their biggest problem is consumers' wasteful attitude to the resource. Changing that is perhaps a sufficient long-term challenge for the industry. More immediately, the shares will doubtless be supported by a regulatory regime that still allows dividends to be increased at roughly twice the average market rate.</p>

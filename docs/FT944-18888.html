			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / 'Man from the Pru' could be endangered The insurance agent who collects regular cash payments from customers' homes  -the 'man from the Pru' - could become an endangered species under government proposals. Ideas for streamlining or abolishing the separate arrangements for industrial branch business - as this specific type of life insurance is known - will be discussed in a consultation paper due to be published around the turn of the year. Under legislation from the 1920s, an agent for this type of business must call at customers' homes to collect cash or cheques more often than every two months and must initial in a premium receipt book the amounts paid. The policies that agents can sell are also very limited and do not, for example, include pensions. Nor, even though the emphasis is on simple policies, are agents allowed to sell term assurance - policies which are directed at protection without any investment element. The costs of this labour-intensive system of collection are relatively high, reducing the returns which would otherwise be available to customers. Life companies specialising in this area acknowledge the expense involved, but say that by accepting small premiums, often from people without bank accounts, they are giving clients an opportunity to make provision for themselves which they would not otherwise have. As more people open bank accounts and life companies opt for less expensive means of collection, the amount of new industrial branch business has been slipping in recent years from 2.05m new policies in 1990 to 1.21m in 1993. But there are more than 45m policies still in force. Even though Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has become synonymous with industrial branch business, the organisation has been withdrawing from this area: in 1992 it raised its minimum premium from Pounds 12 to Pounds 20 a month. It does, however, still have a 'home service' sales force of agents who visit customers in their houses.</p>

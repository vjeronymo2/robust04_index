			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Caution urged over future cuts in taxes The government's chief economist gave a warning yesterday that it would be unwise to cut taxes in the future if the economy was running at or above full capacity or if such action threatened the health of the public finances. Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee in evidence on last week's Budget, however, that the economy still had spare capacity, although it was impossible to know precisely how much. He estimated that the economy's output gap - the difference between the actual level of gross domestic product and the level that would exist if it had grown at its long-term trend rate in recent years - was in a range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. Mr Budd said past evidence suggested that there was room for unemployment to fall further - to perhaps 2m compared with present levels of about 2.5m - before stimulating inflationary pressures. Mr Budd said he hoped that changes in the supply side of the British economy during the 1980s meant that the level of unemployment compatible with low inflation could go below 2m. He hoped that the changes, such as labour reforms and privatisation, had raised the annual rate of sustainable growth in Britain from the long-term average of 2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent. Although it was difficult to judge whether there had been a structural improvement to the economy, he said policymakers drew 'some comfort' from the combination of output growth and falling inflation since the UK had started its recovery from recession. The UK's present strong recovery will be one of the issues for discussion at today's monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. Although there is broad agreement in the Treasury and the Bank of England that the next move in UK bank base rates will have to be upwards from 5.75 per cent to keep control of inflation, it is unclear whether the chancellor will feel the need to act before Christmas. Yesterday, Mr Budd was careful to sidestep questions on the interest rate expectations underpinning the government's forecasts. He warned, however, that an injudicious tax cut in a future budget, that boosted the economy when it was running at or above capacity, would have to be offset by tighter monetary policies. Asked about sterling, Mr Budd said the present value of the pound seemed to be 'about right'. He said the fall in sterling's exchange rate since it left the European exchange rate mechanism had helped to produce a 'quite remarkable' boost to trade and that this seemed to be sustainable.</p>

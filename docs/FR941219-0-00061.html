			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD position.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If within the 60-day period the borrower has mistakenly mailed a payment to the transferor instead of the transferee, a late fee may not be imposed. However, if neither the transferor nor the transferee has received a regularly scheduled payment within the 60-day period, or any longer applicable grace period, late payment charges may be assessed in accordance with the servicer's established practices. Late charges due from the borrower before the effective date of transfer of servicing are not covered by RESPA or this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Questions Relating To Qualified Written Requests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Two comments addressed the type of information that HUD permits a borrower to include in a ``qualified written request.'' One commenter wished to limit the requirements to those inquiries asserting errors that have been caused by the transfer of servicing on a mortgage account. The other commenter wanted clarification on whether the requirements were limited to inquiries on payments and account balances. Another question concerned the length of time a servicer has to respond to qualified written requests after a loan is paid off or after servicing has been transferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute encompasses all information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan and does not restrict the subject matter to questions concerning the transfer of servicing, installment payments, or account balances. For example, a written inquiry concerning a collection for or disbursement from an escrow account would be a qualified written request if the correspondence contains the required identifying elements. In &sect;3500.21(f)(2), the Department establishes a 1-year period in which a qualified written request is valid after the date of loan pay-off or mortgage servicing transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Three commenters were concerned about how written requests were received. One said that the regulations should state that ``a qualified written request'' must be mailed to an address supplied by the servicer in the coupon book or written correspondence and not the address for the mortgage payment. Another wanted to disregard requests that lacked the account number or were attached to the borrower's check, as distinguished from being placed in the same envelope. The third suggested that the regulations should specifically disqualify written inquiries that the borrower includes with the loan payment. A commenter suggested that the Department require a servicer to provide to the borrower information identifying the name and telephone number of a representative or the office or department of the servicer through which the borrower will receive assistance after submitting a qualified written request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) This rule does not require that a servicer establish an office to handle borrowers' complaints. It does, however, allow the servicer to do so. In the event the servicer establishes such an office and complies with all the necessary notice provisions of this rule, then the borrower must deliver its request to that office in order for the inquiry to be a ``qualified written request'' (see the optional language in Appendix MS&hyph;2 to part 3500). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the servicer determines that a borrower's correspondence does not constitute a qualified written request (the most likely disqualification would be writing the inquiry on the payment coupon), the servicer should retain sufficient information to support its determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A commenter sought clarification of when the Department considers an inquiry to be resolved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An inquiry is resolved when the servicer supplies the requested information or corrects an error. See, for example, Regulation Z, 12 U.S.C. 226.13(e) and (f) for similar complaint resolution provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Eight commenters discussed the protection of the borrower's credit rating during a dispute. Most commenters asked whether a lender could provide payment information to a consumer reporting agency prior to the end of the 60-business day period if the dispute was resolved. Two commenters noted that a servicer would be in an unfair position if the servicer has previously reported a borrower's loan as past due and then is not allowed to report the payment. The commenters suggested that the servicer be permitted to advise the credit agency that the servicer is prohibited by law from providing additional information at that time. As a benefit to the borrower, one comment suggested that the servicer be allowed to report prior to the 60-business day period to clear a borrower's record. One commenter raised a question about whether a lender should assume that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent, or should require proof from the borrower of this delegation of authority. Furthermore, the commenter asked if the 20-business day time-frame, in which the borrower must receive a written acknowledgement from the servicer, is calculated from when the request is received or when the servicer confirms that the third party is the borrower's agent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD interprets the statute to mean that no adverse information relating to a borrower's overdue payment information may be provided to a credit reporting agency within the 60-day period after the servicing function is transferred, assigned, or sold or after the servicer receives a qualified written request for information. The statute is implemented by this rule in a manner that does not prohibit a servicer from reporting an improvement (such as a payment found or received) in the borrower's record within the 60 day period. It is the servicer's responsibility to determine whether it has sufficient information that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent or the borrower should verify the agent's representative capacity. When the servicer is in doubt as to the status of the third party, the written acknowledgement can also be mailed to the borrower to ask that the borrower verify the status of the third party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) One comment asked for clarification of whether the servicer was prohibited from reporting delinquencies unrelated to a dispute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

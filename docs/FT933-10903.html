			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Move amounts to suspension of system say dealers THE WIDENING of the bands in the exchange rate mechanism in effect amounts to a free float of European Community currencies, foreign exchange dealers in London believe. Early today some predicted further selling of the French franc, which weakened sharply in Far Eastern markets immediately after the decision in Brussels. Several analysts said that the move by Community finance ministers, announced in the early hours of this morning, was extraordinary because it allowed EC currencies to fluctuate against the D-Mark by such a large amount. However, some dealers suggested that the decision could bring a resolution of the key issue in the currency crisis, which is that France must be able to cut its interest rates to boost the economy. There was no announcement by the French authorities after the meeting, but some analysts expected France to ease monetary policy this week, possibly today. 'It would have been useful if Germany had cut rates,' said Mr Julian Simmonds head of foreign exchange at Citibank in London. 'But given the 15 per cent bands, countries have now got the room to cut their rates and allow their currencies to get weaker.' Other market participants were more critical of the move. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economic adviser at Bank of America, said that it would have been far better to announce the suspension of the ERM. 'It makes a mockery of the system,' he said. 'It effectively means that you have a 30 per cent trading range for the French franc against the D-Mark, and that is clearly absurd.' He did not rule out the possibility that the French franc would come under more selling pressure in European trading today. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at Union Bank of Switzerland in London, said that the weekend-long meeting showed that Germany was unwilling to save the ERM. 'This is obviously a clear message from the Germans that they are not prepared to do anything for the system,' he said. The news came amid growing tension in currency markets, with several London dealing rooms well staffed with dealers trading the French franc. In an unusual out-of-hours trading session in London and New York late last night, dealers pushed the French franc well below its previous floor in the exchange rate mechanism before the announcement from Brussels, in the belief that Europe's monetary system was in mortal danger. The Spanish peseta was also bought below its floor. After the announcement from Brussels came through, the D-Mark appreciated against most currencies, pushing the French franc down to about FFr3.4762 in early Far Eastern trading, some 4 1/2 centimes below its former ERM floor. The D-Mark also appreciated strongly against the dollar, as dealers in the Far East sold weaker European currencies in the belief that there was room for them to depreciate. In Tokyo, the dollar fell back to around DM1.7355, having been close to the DM1.75 level at one stage. Sterling fell back to DM2.575 from a previous London close of DM2.585.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 13 June, ALADI  [Latin American Integration Association] will formalize a  protocol that will permit Mexico to remain an ALADI member and  at the same time be a member of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA).    The Council of Foreign Ministers, which is ALADI's top  executive organ, will hold a special meeting to address the  subject during a session that the Committee of Representatives  has summoned to that effect.    The foreign ministers will formally approve the agreement  that high-ranking officials reached in Montevideo on 3 May. The  agreement provides for the granting of a special permit or  waiver [preceding word in English] for ALADI members to form  partnerships with developed countries.    The ALADI treaty sets forth that members must give other  members the same benefits that they grant to countries outside  ALADI, but Mexico, after joining the United States and Canada,  was unable to fulfill this condition. Consequently, an  interpretation document was drawn up permitting an exception for  the members that join developed countries, in return for  commercial compensations to the other ALADI members.    Cartagena de Indias was chosen as the place for holding the  meeting at the invitation of the Colombian Government.</p>

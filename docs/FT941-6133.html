			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / BCCI liquidators hit by file ban The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have been forbidden by a British Virgin Islands judge from using information gained from examining banking files in the country last year. The Honourable Mr Justice Ephraim Georges made the order last month against four liquidators to the bank and Mr Michael Holden, the inspector of banks and trust companies for British Virgin Islands. It follows Mr Holden's decision late last year to grant liquidators from Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, access to records about companies they believed were connected to Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz. The liquidators are suing National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid, its former chief operating officer. The records related to Connaught Place Investments, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands which is believed to own residential property in London.</p>

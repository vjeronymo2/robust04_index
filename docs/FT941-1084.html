			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Risks - but rewards, too - Avoid emerging markets and you will lose out The new Aztec fund is using shots of a nappy factory in Mexico City to plug the solid merits of Latin American investment. Indeed, Mexico is seen widely as one of the safest and most stable of the emerging stock markets. But even Wall Street was shaken by the assassination on Wednesday of the country's presidential candidate. Safety is a relative concept. This year has been proving tough already for investors in emerging markets. Most have jerked into reverse, with some spine-chilling individual movements. Turkey, for instance, is less than half its level at the beginning of the year. But while emerging markets are different and dangerous, they are likely to be a permanent feature on the investment scene. Anyone who avoids them entirely will lose out in the long term. What are emerging markets? No definitive list exists although there is a hard core of countries which most investors would agree warrants the label. Some people include all countries with economies that are relatively undeveloped but starting to sprint. Others allow only those with markets mature enough to absorb - and welcome - foreign investment. Most of the hard-core countries are in south-east Asia (the Pacific rim) and Latin America. India has just joined the list because political and economic change has opened it recently to direct and indirect investment. Hong Kong and Singapore, both relatively mature, are honorary members because international investors have been using them as a proxy for China. What is the background? Economic growth in the developed countries was slowing, even before they were pole-axed by the recession, and economists reckon the rapid expansion in the other parts of the world is more than a temporary phenomenon. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe, and China's lumbering re-birth, have altered dramatically the balance of the world economy. Both the economies and the stock markets of the developing countries are expected to have a much larger chunk of the world total by the end of this century. Investment managers in the developed countries, notably the US, are trying to ensure that the funds they run share in the explosive growth of some of these nascent economies. Stock markets in most of the countries are relatively immature, but western investors have been pouring in money as fast as the markets could absorb it. Our chart shows how the flow accelerated in 1993. Many of the markets rose almost vertically, and companies which had seemed bargains to western investors began to look much pricier. So, the investing institutions ranged ever wider. When many of the Pacific rim stock markets had doubled, the institutions switched their attentions to Latin America, long regarded as an also-ran in the economic stakes. Last year, it hardly mattered which market you bought or what individual stocks. This year, after a sharp setback in most markets, investors need to be more selective. Anxiety that China is overheating, despite endeavours to damp it down, overshadow the Pacific markets that depend on it. And countries linked to the dollar may have to pull in their own belts as US rates rise. But investors need also to weigh up factors as disparate as stock market liquidity and political stability. Emerging markets are not all equal. Buying the right stocks will be important. Is this a good time to buy? Probably not. Securities firm BZW suggested last year that its clients should have a relatively high investment in emerging markets. BZW is now 'neutral'. One worry is that the tide of US money could ebb as rapidly as it flowed if US interest rates become more attractive - or even in sheer funk. If this were to happen, the impact on some markets could be dramatic. Prices would tumble as rapidly as they rose, and investors might in many cases find it hard to get their money out. But that does not mean that anyone with money already in should get out. The higher risk/reward profile of emerging markets makes them an even longer-term investment than elsewhere. How to invest Your long-term strategy should depend on who you are. If you are an affluent, footloose expatriate with no local loyalties, you might have as much as 20 per cent of your equity portfolio in emerging markets. If you live in the UK, around 3 to 8 per cent is probably the most you should consider. Indeed, anyone nearing retirement and who cannot afford high risk should shun them altogether. Direct investment in shares in emerging markets is not for the amateur. It is, however, possible to buy shares in companies which do business with emerging countries and should benefit from their growth. Infrastructure, telecoms and power generation are a priority. So, buying shares in companies such as GEC or Cable &amp; Wireless is an indirect way of joining the boom without taking on the risks associated with the local stock market. If you are investing through unit or investment trusts, the vehicle you choose will affect the overall riskiness of your portfolio. Generally speaking, global funds, which can invest anywhere in the world, should be less risky than regional funds, and much less risky than single country funds. But what if you want to increase your risk/reward profile? A more closely-targeted fund is one way. Another is to choose an investment trust which uses borrowed money or to buy investment trust warrants. In both cases, the market price of the security exaggerates movements in the asset value of the underlying shares.</p>

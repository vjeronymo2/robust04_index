			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): A referee steps out of the ring - Dennis Boyd, Acas's chief conciliator ACAS, the government's conciliation and arbitration service, is an unfashionable institution steeped in the corporatism of the 1970s, the decade of its birth. It is therefore not surprising that the retirement yesterday of Mr Dennis Boyd, chief 'marriage guidance counsellor' to the two sides of industry since 1979, has passed almost unnoticed. Mr Boyd, officially known as the chief conciliation officer, has been literally the beer and sandwiches provider at Acas, involved in almost every big industrial dispute for more than a decade. One union official who has passed many long nights at the Acas offices recalls: 'When one side or the other was on the point of walking out, he was always persuading people to stay on for just one more round of sandwiches.' That extra round has often given Mr Boyd time to come up with a new formula that has edged the two sides closer to an agreement. He has many famous 'deals' to his name, most recently the agreement that ended the 1990 ambulance dispute. Many disappointments, too, particularly the 1983 Stockport Messenger dispute and the 1984 miners' strike, where agreements were tantalisingly close but never materialised. There is also a broader disappointment - not expressed publicly but shared by the rest of the Acas establishment - that the organisation's conciliatory values have gone out of fashion in the era of 'management's right to manage'. If the Conservatives win another election there must be a question mark over Acas's future. Nevertheless, the organisation is busier than ever before, with a 10 per cent increase in collective conciliation cases last year and a 15 per cent rise in individual unfair-dismissal and discrimination cases. At a price of less than Pounds 20m a year, it is highly cost-effective. Mr Boyd, 61 yesterday, rose through public-sector personnel management to the job that made him a familiar name during the big disputes. A name, but never a face: he has always been able to commute home to his wife Pat, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, incognito. He calls himself 'an old-fashioned voluntarist who believes that if the law does have a role in industrial relations it must command the respect of both sides of industry'. He does credit the legal changes of the past decade with exorcising 'the knee-jerk walk-out'. He also believes that some of the laws, especially strike ballots, have unintentionally strengthened unions, contributing to a spate of union 'victories' in recent years 'which have restored some of the unions' dignity'. Mr Boyd was universally respected as a patient, imaginative conciliator with the knack of making everyone believe he was on their side. He will be a hard act for Mr Derek Evans, previously head of Acas in Wales, to follow. The retired chief conciliator will now concentrate on turning his golf handicap from fantasy into reality. But we may not have seen the last of Dennis Boyd; some friends believe that a Labour government would find a place for his skills.</p>

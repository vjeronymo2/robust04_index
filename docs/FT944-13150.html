			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Newcrest Mining advances sharply Newcrest Mining, the mining group which was formed when Broken Hill Proprietary and Newmont Mining merged their Australian goldmining subsidiaries, yesterday announced profits after tax of ADollars 35.5m (USDollars 26.4m) for the first nine months of 1994. This represents a 22.3 per cent increase on the same period in 1993. Profit after tax for the third quarter alone, to end-September, was ADollars 11.7m, up 16.4 per cent on the previous year, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The group's equity gold production in the three months was 166,641oz, some 7,000oz less than in the second quarter. This reduction was due to lower grade production at its Telfer mine in Western Australia. The cost of production was Dollars 393 per oz, up from Dollars 374 - an increase also blamed on the temporary shortfall in the oxide grade. The company said it planned to spend ADollars 17.6m to develop the first stage of the Mariner project at Telfer, and that it had upgraded the resource at its Cadia Hill gold/copper project in New South Wales, to 4.6m oz of gold. Shares in Newcrest closed 20 cents higher at ADollars 7.20.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: MIRA COSTA CAN PROVE IT'S BEST EVER  </P> <P> Whenever the phrase best ever is used in connection with a high school team, it  is usually met with some skepticism.  </P> <P> But when comparisons are made with this season's Manhattan Beach Mira Costa  High boys' volleyball team, it is difficult to argue that this Mustang team is  not the best ever.  </P> <P> In a sport that has been dominated by Southern California teams over the years,  Mira Costa's 18-0 record speaks for itself as the Mustangs head into the  Southern Section playoffs, which will begin with wild-card play Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Mustangs are the top-rated team in the nation, after finishing 21-1 and  Southern Section 4-A Division runner-up last season.  </P> <P> They have five college Division I prospects on the team -- four seniors who  have committed to volleyball at major college powers next season and a junior  who most likely will do the same in two years.  </P> <P> Five of the six starting Mustangs are taller than 6 feet 3 inches, and the two  players who split time in the final starting position could star on most prep  teams.  </P> <P> Last summer, two of the Mustangs started on U.S. Olympic Festival teams, which  are composed mostly of college starters.  </P> <P> In its only tournament this season, Mira Costa breezed through a strong 29-team  field and won its own Redondo-Mira Costa Varsity Classic two weeks ago.  </P> <P> And, for the first time, this year's team defeated Mira Costa's alumni team,  which is made up of many established professional players.  </P> <P> "If we win it all, yes, this would have to be considered as one of the best  teams ever," Coach Mike Cook said.  </P> <P> In Cook's 10 years at the school, he has won either Ocean or Bay League  championships in all but one season. The Mustangs won the Southern Section 4-A  title in 1984, and finished second in 1987 and 1989.  </P> <P> "This is physically the most talented team I have ever had," Cook said.  </P> <P> Leading the way for Mira Costa is 6-4 senior setter Canyon Ceman, who will  attend Stanford next fall. Ceman, who also played basketball for Mira Costa,  has a 4.0 grade-point average and was a finalist for the state's  scholar-athlete award.  </P> <P> "He is very strong with great leg strength," Cook said of Ceman, who started on  the gold-medal winning West team in last summer's U.S. Olympic Festival. "He  has such a wonderful future and the funny thing is, the guy he beat out to  start in the Olympic Festival is Stanford's starting setter now."  </P> <P> Joining Ceman is 6-4 UCLA-bound David Swatik, who was a first-team All Southern  Section selection last season.  </P> <P> Swatik, a powerful outside hitter who started for the bronze-medal winning  North team in the Olympic Festival, was the most valuable player in the  Redondo-Mira Costa tournament with 50 kills in 12 games.  </P> <P> Senior Pat Ivie, a 6-5 middle blocker, is the vocal leader of the Mustangs. His  brother, Bryan, a 1987 Mira Costa graduate, was MVP of USC's recent NCAA  tournament championship victory last Saturday night.  </P> <P> "He is a very good competitive athlete," Cook said of the younger Ivie. "He is  just fundamentally sound."  </P> <P> Ivie, who will attend USC with his brother next season, may be the Mustangs'  best all-around player.  </P> <P> "I don't give out accolades easy, but all three could be on the '92 Olympic  team," Cook said of Ceman, Swatik and Ivie.  </P> <P> Adding to the Mustangs' list of talented players is senior Mike Ashenfelter, a  6-7 middle blocker and power server, who has also committed to USC.  </P> <P> Ashenfelter is the Mustangs' most improved player and best server despite his  size.  </P> <P> "Mike couldn't even spike as a freshman but he has gotten more and more  coordination each year," Cook said. "He has a great serve where he uses his  height to his advantage. He serves bullets, like a baseball pitcher's  curveball."  </P> <P> Mark Shoptaw, a 6-3 junior outside hitter, is the Mustangs' star for next  season.  </P> <P> "Colleges are already after him and rightfully so because he is a fine player,"  Cook said. Two seniors, 5-11 Brian Thurston and 5-10 Craig Beck, share the  Mustangs' final starting position.  </P> <P> "They both would be starters for anybody else," Cook said. "Thurston has a lot  of spring and Beck is our best defensive player."  </P> <P> Despite his team's rave reviews, Cook is concerned about upsets in the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "We are beatable," he said. "If we are out of sync and not playing well,  anything can happen."  </P> <P> Last season, the Mustangs lost to Corona del Mar in the Southern Sectional  final.  </P> <P> "But, they do have a chance to be 22-0 and become a very special team, like the  undefeated '84 team," Cook said of the Mustangs.  </P> <P> Pitcher Kym Weil of Newhall Hart broke the Southern Section record for softball  victories with her 82nd last week, a 1-0 eight-inning triumph over San Gabriel.  </P> <P> Weil, a senior who has a 21-1 record this season, broke the old mark of 81 set  last season by DeDe Weiman of Gahr.  </P> <P> After missing most of the outdoor track season with injuries, Hawthorne  sprinters Chris Alexander and Erik Allen made their comebacks in the Bay League  finals last week.  </P> <P> Alexander, who will attend UCLA on a football scholarship in the fall, won the  100 meters with a wind-aided time of 10.86 seconds and ran third in the 200  with a time of 22.2.  </P> <P> Allen, a junior, finished third in the 100 with a time of 11.10 and second in  the 200 in 22.1.  </P> <P> Both runners will be needed if Hawthorne is to successfully defend its boys'  state team title June 1-2.  </P> <P> In the Northern League meet, Napoleon Kaufman of Lompoc was impressive in  winning the 100 in a wind-aided 10.3 and the 100 in 21.1. He also had a winning  long jump of 22-6.  </P> <P> Andre Green of Long Beach Poly was almost as impressive in the Moore League  meet. A senior, he won the 100 in 10.6 and the 200 in 21.1.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] During a 29 March phone conversation with U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa made a  proposal for holding informal vice-ministerial talks, and it  seems that the United States has agreed to this proposal.    The government intends to hold such informal talks as early  as this week, and coordination is in progress on dispatching to  Washington either Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi or  Deputy Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI]. Since the United  States has indicated that "the door is still open" (as stated by  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor), the government  believes that "the United States will not negate resumption of  the framework talks" (as stated by a MITI source).    At the Japan-U.S. summits held last February, the framework  talks were suspended because of a failure to settle differences  in views between the two countries on the issue of objective  criteria. While the United States insisted on establishing  objectives for the future, Japan maintained that targets should  be limited to results achieved in the past. Therefore, the  government maintains: To resume the talks, "efforts should be  made to settle the issue of objective criteria through informal  talks," otherwise "the talks would end divisively again" (as  stated by a government source). The government has thus decided  on holding informal talks with the United States, focusing on  the objective criteria issue.    Objective criteria are supposed to be decided separately for  various priority areas brought up in the framework talks,  including telecommunications, government procurement of medical  equipment, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts. However,  the Japanese Government plans to conduct informal talks by  focusing on such fields as government procurement and insurance.  Since progress was made in these two fields at the recent  summits, and the two countries have almost reached an accord in  these two areas, the government intends to achieve a  breakthrough in these fields, thereby bringing the deadlock in  the framework talks to an end.    At the talks held last February, the United States made an  informal proposal for signing a compromise agreement, which  states that while Japan will not be asked to indicate numerical  figures as future targets, the United States will agree to the  statement that "Japan will respect the upward trends established  in the past." Based on this proposal, the government plans to  seek points of compromise. However, since Japan and the United  States have salient views on the subject of automobiles and auto  parts, the government actually intends to postpone talks on the  issue.    At the same time, the government intends to give a briefing  on details of its new package of external economic measures  agreed upon in late March, thereby stressing Japan's position on  tackling the market-opening issue. The government will then  inform the United States and seek its understanding that Japan  has postponed its conclusions on its macroeconomic policies, but  that it will work out the details by the end of June.    Moreover, the government also intends to point out the fact  that the "Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" issued in late March  by the U.S. Trade Representative lists "barriers" in 43 areas of  trade in Japan. Strong dissatisfaction has been voiced within  the government, maintaining that "the report claims to point out  barriers in areas which have virtually been resolved in the  package."</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Observer: French leave The dismissal of Chung Myung-whun as music director of Paris's Opera Bastille is causing a furore back in his home country of South Korea. His compatriots regard the sacking as an insult to their national honour, even though Chung is now a US citizen. One Seoul newspaper has suggested Korea retaliates by cancelling its contract to buy French high-speed trains, while the ministry of culture has lodged a protest with the French embassy. More cannily, the Korean government hopes to exploit the fracas by using it to get France to return ancient royal Korean documents, removed to Paris a century ago by a French military expedition. Chung's case will be sacrificed if the papers are returned; in which case his next performance will no doubt be The Miraculous Mandarin.</p>

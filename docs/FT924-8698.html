			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten defends schools bill BY April of next year 500 schools in England and Wales will have achieved grant maintained status and opted out of control by local education authorities, Mr John Patten, education secretary, predicted in the Commons last night. Moving the second reading of the Education Bill, he said the total would probably be 'getting on for' 1,500 by April 1994, as forecast in the white paper published in July. Mr Patten's claim that in taking account of this development the bill established a new framework for primary and secondary schools that would endure well into the next century was hotly disputed by Labour MPs. Mr Patten said the growing popularity of self-governing grant maintained schools was reflected in the inclusion in the bill of provisions establishing a new funding agency which would be responsible for authorising their capital and recurrent expenditure. As the number of grant-maintained schools grew, the funding agency would take on a parallel duty to ensure a sufficiency of school places, he said. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, called the bill a 'dangerous irrelevancy' which did not tackle the issues which most concerned parents - over-sized classes, short-age of books and a lack of resources. She warned that its emphasis on specialisation should be seen as a 'code word' for selection, and pledged it would be opposed by Labour MPs at every stage.</p>

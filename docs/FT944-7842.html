			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Lib Dems flesh out Bank reform plans Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, is to put forward detailed plans for a reform of the Bank of England, giving it greater independence from the government and the institutions of the City of London. Mr Bruce is to flesh out his party's commitment to giving the Bank greater control over the setting of interest rates. Presenting his party's alternative Budget tomorrow, Mr Bruce will call for the Bank's role to be modelled along the lines of the New Zealand Central Bank, with the government setting a broad inflation target and the Bank having total control over the setting of monetary policy. He will also call for the Bank to appoint executive directors from the regions to play a crucial role in the setting of monetary policy. These representatives will vote on monetary policy changes, enjoying powers similar to those of the regional governors of the US Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank. The Liberal Democrats will make clear that they are committed to widening the inflation target within which the UK monetary authorities are operating. The Bank implied in a recent Inflation Report that it was using a target range for inflation of 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent up to the next general election. Mr Bruce believes this target will require the government to raise interest rates too sharply. He is proposing a broader band of zero to 3 per cent for the coming years. The Liberal Democrats remain the only party committed to creating a completely independent central bank for the UK. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has given the Bank greater power in the setting of interest rates by publishing the minutes of the monthly meeting between himself and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England's governor. The Liberal Democrats say that the government can only pursue a credible counter-inflationary policy by abandoning political constraints and giving the Bank full control over monetary policy. They plan to publish a detailed policy document on the issue early next year. The party would want to ensure that local variations in inflation, wages and growth were taken into account when setting policy by appointing regional directors to the Bank. The Liberal Democrats say that the style of the Bank is too heavily influenced by movements in financial markets, especially bonds and currencies. They would create a 'policymaking executive', modelled on the Bundesbank council, in which central and regional directors would vote on policy changes.</p>

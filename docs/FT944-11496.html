			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: BAT awaits their judgment - The Bottom Line A ruthless octogenarian, Judge Milton Pollack, stands between BAT Industries and a higher rating of its shares. On December 5 in New York City he will open the trial sought by the US Federal Trade Commission to block BAT's Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco. After a near-trebling of BAT's third quarter US tobacco profits, reported this week, investors are in no doubt about the importance of cigarettes to BAT. The story was repeated around the world with a strong resurgence in Brazil and booming UK exports, particularly to eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the far east. Tobacco trading profits were up 13 per cent to Pounds 920m in the nine months ended September. In contrast, financial services contributed Pounds 674m, up 3 per cent, to group trading profits. This division has its own problems ranging from investigations by UK regulators of the personal pension industry, rising claims from last year's San Francisco earthquake and falling investment income at Eagle Star in the UK. 'We've scored a unique regulatory double,' Martin Broughton, group chief executive, said unveiling the results. Any expense from compensating individuals poorly advised to buy a pension from BAT's Allied Dunbar or Eagle Star subsidiaries is likely to be minor, analysts estimate. Greater investor concern is focused on Allied Dunbar's style. Although well run and growing its profits, it is still cold calling and paying only commissions to sales staff while many of its competitors are moving to salaried, less aggressive techniques. The tobacco hurdle is higher. Buying American Tobacco from American Brands would push BAT's US market share from 11 per cent to 18 per cent, third behind Philip Morris with some 46 per cent and RJR Nabisco with 28 per cent. The FTC argues that American Tobacco's loss of independence would remove a price 'maverick' from the market and make it easier for the remaining companies to collude on prices. BAT argues that the deal will make it a stronger number three and, anyway, the Supreme Court ruled several years ago that collusion was impossible and BAT competed keenly on price. Judge Pollack, the bane of lawyers in the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy and other high profile cases, will decide the issue. Observers say he is quick of mind and court action, crusty, independent and unlikely to take bureaucrats' arguments at face value. Moreover, the FTC has lost roughly half the anti-trust cases it has taken to court in the past 17 years. Losing American Tobacco would be a blow to BAT. It would forego the cost savings, added marketing clout and brand synergies the deal would bring. But its existing US business is performing well and abroad BAT is benefitting from a brands swap it agreed previously with American Tobacco. BAT is the most international of cigarette companies. Global consumption fell by 0.5 per cent a year between 1988 and 1993, according to Diana Temple of Salomon Brothers. But for every market declining, another beckons as it opens up to foreign cigarettes. The most enticing is China, accounting for one-third of the world's cigarettes. On one hand the government is trying to curb consumption but on the other it is opening the market. BAT has about half the imports which account for roughly 5 per cent of consumption. Its weakness, though, is it lacks a local venture unlike Philip Morris, RJR and Rothmans International. Encouraged by the third quarter results, analysts raised their full-year pre-tax forecasts a notch to around Pounds 2bn against last year's Pounds 1.8bn. But thanks to rising tax and minorities, they left earnings per share unchanged at around 40p versus 38.5p. The best part is the yield of around 6 per cent with a bigger payout to come at the year end. An all clear from the judge would remove a cloud over BAT's shares and let investors focus on the wider tobacco potential around the world. But for real value, the bulls say, the tobacco and financial services arms should be floated separately. That, however, is a judgment BAT seems reluctant to make.</p>

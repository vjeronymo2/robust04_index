			<p>CSO     [Text] Sanyo Electric announced on 19 April that it will  enter the lithium ion battery market on which attention has been  focused as a key device for multimedia data terminals on par  with liquid crystal. That is because it is anticipated that  demand will quickly expand in the future as a power source for  data terminals to handle portable telephones or multimedia.  There have been new entries by Matsushita Battery, Japan Storage  Battery, and others one after the other, and Sony and others in  the lead are preparing to counter them by augmenting facilities  capability. Currently, only Japanese manufacturers can supply  lithium ion batteries. Not only domestic, but foreign electrical  machinery manufacturer users have come into view, and they are  prepared to spur development and mass production competition  with lithium ion batteries as "the second liquid crystal."    Sanyo Electric began production of a cylindrical lithium  battery at their Sumoto plant (Hyogo Prefecture) in April. The  initial monthly production plan is 100,000 units, but they are  investing 5-6 billion yen, setting up two special lines, and  will additionally market a square battery. They aim for monthly  production of 1 million units during the year. In addition to  the nickel cadmium battery and nickel hydrogen battery which  have been the mainstream charging batteries up to now, the  company will make a strenuous effort in the future to supply  lithium ion batteries for multimedia terminal equipment.    The idea of the company is that "the respective special  characteristics are that the nickel cadmium battery is for  equipment where a large discharge is necessary, the nickel  hydrogen is large capacity, and the lithium ion battery is small  and lightweight. The special characteristics differ according to  equipment used, and we plan to segregate cultivation of demand  by the three kinds of batteries" (Kennosuke Matsumura, manager  Soft Energy Division).    Various companies, such as Matsushita Battery and Japan  Storage Battery, have entered the lithium ion battery market one  after the other. Yuasa also will begin shipment of a business  card-size film-type lithium ion battery sample beginning this  summer. Sharp also has already succeeded in development. With  the recent start of production by Sanyo Electric, the various  domestic entry manufacturing companies will be just about all  present.    Sony, which was the first to succeed in commercializing the  lithium ion battery, will up production capability 50 percent by  the end of fiscal 1994 at the Koriyama plant (Koriyama city) of  its production subsidiary Sony Energy Tech, and boost it from  the current monthly 1 million unit production system to 1.5  million units. That is because they have judged that OEM  [original equipment manufacturing] supply as a power source for  family videos, MD's (mini disks), portable telephones, and  personal computer backups will further expand. So far, they have  invested a little more than about 10 billion yen, but it is said  that they "will introduce new facilities" as they discern demand  trends (Shiro Takahashi, senior vice president, Energy Division,  Recording Media and Energy Company).    AD Battery (Chiyoda, Tokyo; president, Takashi Shimada), a  joint investment company of Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry,  which is a leading manufacturer on a par with Sony, is building  new facilities at their Horikawa-cho plant (Kawasaki city), and  will boost monthly production capability from 400,000 units to  1.6 million units all at once with this summer as the goal.  Investment during fiscal 1994 is anticipated to amount to a  total of 5 billion yen.    The company further increased capital from 1 billion yen to  3.5 billion yen at the end of March, aimed at strengthening  management. So far, investment has been 50-50 by Toshiba and  Asahi Chemical Industry, but Toshiba Battery (Shinagawa, Tokyo;  president, Jun Sasakura) has newly participated in  capitalization. The investment ratio is 40 percent each for  Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry, and 20 percent for Toshiba  Battery, and the plan is "to begin preparations for full-scale  supply," transferring the increase in capital to facilities  investment (President Takashi Shimada).</p>

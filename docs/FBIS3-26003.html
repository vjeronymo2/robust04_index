			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Whole Party Must Attach Importance to </F> Propaganda and Ideological Work"]    [Text] The national conference on propaganda and  ideological work has closed triumphantly. All localities are  now conveying and implementing the guidelines laid down by the  conference. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as  well as the guidance of the basic party line, the conference  studied and planned how to intensify and improve propaganda and  ideological work under the new situation, following the  guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and its  third plenary session, as well as the principle that we must be  firm in carrying out ideological and political work while  proceeding with economic construction and opening up to the  outside world. Thanks to the CPC Central Committee's kind  attention and its direct leadership as well as the efforts  exerted by comrades attending the conference, the conference  became a meeting that has enabled the participants to understand  the overall requirement, achieve a consensus of views, and  clearly understand their missions; it was a democratic, united,  efficient, and pragmatic meeting in which the participants  discussed issues harmoniously and freely; and it was a meeting  which has strengthened our confidence and encouraged us to press  forward with high fighting morale. The historic meeting  certainly will play a major role in ensuring and expediting the  victorious development of the cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji gave important  speeches at the conference. In his speech, Comrade Jiang Zemin  expounded on the important significance of propaganda and  ideological work during the new period and set the fundamental  guidance and major missions for propaganda and ideological work.  Pointing out that the party must intensify and improve its  leadership over propaganda and ideological work, he placed  earnest hopes on comrades working on the propaganda and  ideological front. The speech is a programmatic document with  important guiding significance for the party's propaganda and  ideological work during the new period. Party committees and  departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work at all  levels must earnestly study and understand the document, achieve  a greater concensus of views, obey the overall requirement,  emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, heighten their  morale, press forward, and earnestly carry out the guidelines  and assignments in accordance with the Central Committee's  requirements.    The propaganda and ideological front is an important front  during our socialist modernization drive. The CPC always  attaches great importance to propaganda and ideological work.  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again stressed:  "We must place ideological and political work in a very  important position and accomplish it earnestly, and we must not  slacken our efforts in this regard." He added: "All work on  the ideological front must be strengthened." During the past two  years, guided and encouraged by the important speeches which  Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave in southern China and by the  guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, China's reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization drive have entered a new  stage imbued with life and vitality. The recent Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made an overall and  systematic planning for building a socialist market economic  system, and the national economic conference has also provided  specific plans for achieving a sustained, fast, and healthy  national economic development. The overall requirement set for  the party is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open  wider to the outside world, expedite development, and maintain  stability. The new situation has presented a series of new  assignments, new issues, and new requirements for propaganda and  ideological work. Historical experiences tell us that the  deeper our reform and the faster our development, the more  necessary it is for us to intensify and improve propaganda and  ideological work and to intensify our socialist spiritual  construction. While the majority of comrades in our party are  attaching importance to propaganda and ideological work and are  quite firm in attending to this assignment, some comrades do not  have sufficient understanding of the importance of intensifying  propaganda and ideological work as well as spiritual  construction. The problem of "being tough on the one hand and  soft on the other" still exists in one way or the other when  they do their work. During the course of spiritual  construction, there are still noteworthy problems regarding  party conduct and the general mood of society. This situation  must be corrected immediately. To successfully accomplish their  propaganda and ideological work, our comrades must understand  the importance of propaganda and ideological work from the  overall strategic requirement of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, understand the urgency of propaganda and  ideological work from the historical assignment of deepening  reform and expediting development, and understand the  formidability of propaganda and ideological work from the real  need of socialist spiritual construction.    Doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work is not  just a task of propaganda and ideological departments and  workers of those departments, but is the task of the whole  party, especially the party's leading organs at various levels.  For a long time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has raised the call that  the party's leading organs, in addition to grasping principles  and policies and making decisions on the employment of important  cadres, should devote their main efforts in ideological and  political work. The principal responsible comrades of party  committees at various levels should strive to overcome the  thinking of considering propaganda and ideological work as a  "soft task." They should firmly implement the principle of  "grasping both material progress and ideological and cultural  progress and placing equal emphasis on both," put propaganda and  ideological work and the building of spiritual civilization on  the party committee's important daily agenda, and effectively  strengthen and improve their leadership over propaganda and  ideological work. It is necessary to pay attention to studying  and mastering the law of propaganda and ideological work, be  good at closely linking propaganda and ideological work with  economic work and other tasks, and use propaganda and  ideological work to promote and lead economic construction and  other work. We should constantly go into the midst of the  propaganda and ideological front to investigate and study, sum  up experiences, put forward methods, solve problems, show more  concern, and give more support and help to propaganda and  ideological work. From now on, in evaluating the work of  leading cadres and leading groups, we should consider whether  they attach importance to propaganda and ideological work and  whether they are good at leading propaganda and ideological work  as an important part of judging their political quality and  leadership level. We should consider the results of propaganda  and ideological work and of the building of spiritual  civilization as an important part in evaluating the work of an  area, a department, and a unit.    To strengthen propaganda and ideological work, we should  have  a contingent of workers armed with the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics -- Marxism in  contemporary China [dong dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yi 3981  0108 0022 0948 4104 7456 0344 1835 0031 5030] -- who are loyal  to the cause of the party and the people, and competent  politically and professionally with good workstyle. We now have  a several million-strong team consisting of theoretical, news,  publication, and literary and art workers, and grass-roots  propaganda and ideology workers, and this is a great army which  is extremely valuable in promoting the construction of the two  civilizations. The party and the people have great expectations  for this team. Propaganda and ideology work is a very important  and glorious job, but also a fairly arduous and rather  painstaking job. This then requires our propaganda and ideology  workers to have the spirit of making selfless contributions and  arduous struggle. Perhaps our work will not bring material  benefits to individuals, but it will bring benefit to the  motherland and people; perhaps our names will not be among the  list of names of heroes of the times, but our contributions will  be compiled into the splendid annals of the great undertakings  of hundreds of millions of people. Marx said: "If we choose a  profession which could provide the most material benefits to  mankind through our labor, then, the heavy burden will not  overwhelm us, because we are giving our life for the people;  what we feel then will not be pitiful, limited, and selfish  delight, for our happiness will belong to thousands of millions  of people....." This should become a motto for each of us  propaganda and ideology workers. Our party, government, and  people have always had great confidence in and lent vigorous  support to propaganda and ideology workers, and the propaganda  and ideology workers should be proud of that, increase their  sense of honor and responsibility, justify the great trust  placed in them by the party and people, and unceasingly create  new outstanding achievements.    In the glorious undertakings of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, propaganda and ideologicial work is the  scaffold for constructing the large building of the two  civilizations, the boost motor for the ship of reform and  opening up to cleave the waves and move forward, and the bugle  for advancing for the hundreds of millions in the construction  army to scale a new height. At the beginning of the new year,  the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core  convened a national propaganda and ideology work meeting, and  this greatly inspires and spurs on comrades of the whole party,  especially all comrades on the propaganda and ideology front.  We must seize opportunities, do solid work, and work hard to  bring propaganda and ideology work to a new level so as to arm  people with scientific theory, to guide people with correct  public opinion, to mould people with a lofty spirit, to inspire  people with works of excellence, and to make new contributions  that win us new victory in the undertaking of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics.</p>

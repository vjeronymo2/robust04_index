Following the attack, the leader of Pakistan's [Shiite] Ja'fari  movement issued a statement condemning the attack and declaring  three days of public mourning. Our colleague Khameneh reports  from Pakistan:    [Khameneh] As a result of an attack by armed men on a  gathering of Shiite Friday worshippers in Pakistan's Punjab  Province, at least 20 worshippers were martyred or injured. In  the course of the attack, four armed men, who were riding on two  motorcycles, threw a grenade at a crowd of worshippers in a  mosque in the Mozafargar region and opened fire using  Kalashnikovs. As a result, five of the worshippers were killed  and at least 15 severely injured.    Pakistan's Ja'fari movement issued a statement tonight,  condemning this crime and declaring three days of public  mourning to honor the memory of those martyred.    Allameh Seyyed Sajed Ali Naqavi, the leader of Pakistan's  Shiites, also issued a statement severely condemning the savage  attack and describing it as an act of terrorism perpetrated by  sectarian elements. In the statement, the leader of Pakistan's  Ja'fari movement described the Wahhabi association known as the  Sahabah Corps as the main element behind fanning sectarian  disputes in that country and warned that lack of due care and  the lack of a rapid response by the government to the elements  behind such crimes may evoke a strong reaction from Pakistan's  Shiite community.

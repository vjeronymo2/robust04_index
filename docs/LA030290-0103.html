			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPTIMISTS' RECYCLING PLANT NO LONGER IN THE DUMPS  </P> <P> An Escondido service club that was forced to close its nonprofit recycling  center earlier this year has turned its dark cloud into a silver lining.  </P> <P> The Noon Optimist Club announced Thursday that its recycling center on West  Washington Avenue -- operated by the club for 18 years to earn funds for youth  groups -- has been sold to the for-profit Escondido Sales Yard, situated about  a block and a half away.  </P> <P> Club president Stan Oleksy said the Escondido firm "is the best deal we could  hope for" in gaining continued funding for the many youth groups the club  sponsors.  </P> <P> Oleksy said the agreement with Escondido Sales Yard "will bring in more money  for our projects than we made from operating the recycling center." That  prediction is based on an expected increase in volume because of the yard's  larger recycling business.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, recycling equipment and vehicles used at the Optimists'  facility were purchased by the sales yard to be used at the new location.  </P> <P> Patrick Hubbard, manager of the Escondido Sales Yard, said the recycling  business generated by the club will be credited to an account opened for it.  </P> <P> In effect, Noon Optimist Club will be gaining more funds "without all the  hassle," Oleksy said.  </P> <P> An auditor hired by the Optimists is still trying to piece together the  financial history of the Optimist recycling operations, which went out of  business in January after several management changes failed to make the center  turn a profit. The audit was prompted after club officers raised questions  about thousands of dollars of recycling center funds unaccounted for in sketchy  records kept by a club member who operated the center.  </P> <P> The center was the chief source of money for the Optimists' many civic  projects, ranging from a youth fishing day to an anti-drug program, Oleksy  said. Sale of the Optimist recycling equipment and "good will" brought in  enough money to settle current debts of the defunct recycling center, he said.  He declined to reveal the sale price.  </P> <P> Hubbard said that Escondido Sales Yard has been operating in the city for about  25 years, dealing in new and used building materials. About a year ago, a  3.5-acre recycling center was added next to the sales yard at 1428 W. Mission  Ave.  </P> <P> Oleksy said that Hubbard had pledged to reopen recycling bins at all Escondido  schools where discards finance extracurricular activities and to credit the  Noon Optimist Club account for all new business members brought into the sales  yard recycling operation.  </P> <P> Several companies made offers to take over the club's recycling operations,  Oleksy said, "but this was by far the best for us, better than we could have  hoped for."  </P> <P> The joint recycling operations began Thursday, Oleksy said.  </P> <P> And, as a bonus, he said, Hubbard plans to become a member of the Noon Optimist  Club.  </P></p>

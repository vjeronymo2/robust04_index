			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / GEC Alsthom plant in N Ireland to shut GEC ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French engineering group, is to cut 900 jobs in the UK and close its power equipment plant at Larne, Northern Ireland, at the end of this year. The retrenchment is a result of the electricity industry's shift away from large steam turbines to smaller, more efficient combined-cycle plants. GEC Alsthom's Larne factory, which employs 500, produces large steam turbines and was particularly vulnerable to the change in philosophy. Its closure is a big blow to the Northern Ireland economy, and was attacked by trade union leaders. The remaining job cuts involve 200 workers at Stafford, 175 at Rugby and 28 at Manchester. GEC Alsthom, which is jointly owned by the General Electric Company of the UK and Alcatel Alsthom of France, employs 23,000 in the UK, excluding yesterday's reductions. Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom, said: 'After the privatisation of the generating companies contracts we had from the old CEGB were cancelled. We are also dependent on exports but a number of overseas contracts are taking longer to fix.' The closure at Larne comes just three years after the announcement of a Pounds 20m investment programme, supported by the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board, to modernise its production facilities. Mr Richard Needham, Ulster economy minister, said the announcement was a serious setback. The government would work closely with the company to try to minimise the long-term effects. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, called on GEC Alsthom to reverse its decision to close the Larne factory.</p>

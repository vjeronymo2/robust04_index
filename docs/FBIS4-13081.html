			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by N. Madhavan] </F>   [Text] The signing of the declaration for a new  multilateral trade regime at Marrakesh by 125 countries,  including India, marks the end of a long and arduous journey  that began at Punta Del Este in Uruguay across the Atlantic  nearly a decade ago, but there may still be some hurdles to go.  Even as the agreement for a new multilateral trade regime was  being signed, other indications signalled that some irritants  still remain. The United States and Japan have not quite ended  their trade dispute and the United States and the European Union  have not taken back the demand to link social issues like labor  standards out of the basic framework of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade. Nevertheless, the Marrakesh accord signed  last night is a historic step because it considerably reduces  the walls of protectionism which stood in the way of freer  trade. For one, tariff barriers are expected to come down by 40  percent in all member countries. Second, the accord clears the  way for the World Trade Organization -- WTO -- which will  replace the GATT from 1 January next year and police world trade  disputes. The final hurdle remains in the form of the national  level ratification of the agreement in the legislatures of  member countries, but it can be safely said that the ground has  been laid for a body which will act as the arbiter in trade  disputes. Further, the success of the Marrakesh accord will  depend upon the ability of member countries to stick to their  promises of functioning under the WTO and not resort to any act  which will undermine it pending its creation. In particular,  countries like the United States will have to stay away from  selective bilateral action such as the invocation of Super 301  Law which forbids investment in bilateral (?grounds).    For the developing countries, this opens up crucial avenues.  India particularly stands to gain by greater market access for  its exports in agriculture and textiles, but it will have to  ensure that the code is implemented in letter and spirit so that  in aspects like patenting of seeds and drug prices apprehensions  that India may be affected do not come true. India will also  have to guard against the misuse of social issues like human  rights, environmental safety norms, and labor standards for  trade purposes by powerful countries. India is committed to  these values itself, but both the timing and the manner in which  these issues have been smuggled into the context of the Uruguay  round shows that the WTO may be here, but a watchful eye is  needed all the same. However, India has once again shown that  it articulates and leads Third World's interests by raising the  issue of immigration barriers in developed countries which act  as a deterrent to the flow of labor which is an economic  service. In sum, it is clear that India and the world must  ensure that the gains from trade must go hand in hand with  concern for justice and equality.</p>

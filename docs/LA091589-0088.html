			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A parliamentary committee recommended that former Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou stand trial on charges stemming from his alleged involvement in a  multimillion-dollar bank embezzlement scandal. Parliament will vote on the  matter later this month. The committee, which investigated the scandal at the  privately owned Bank of Crete where more than $200 million is missing,  recommended that Papandreou, 70, be tried on three charges -- authorizing a  scheme to skim interest rates on state accounts at the bank, accepting bribes  and receiving part of the embezzled money.  </P></p>

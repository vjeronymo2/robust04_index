			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Sun sets on Pan Am building THE PAN AM Building, the 59-storey skyscraper which sits on top of New York's Grand Central station and has been an integral Manhattan landmark for nearly 30 years, is no more. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which owns the building, said yesterday it would remove the now-defunct airline's name - currently displayed in 15-foot lights - and replace it with 'MetLife'. The insurer said that the letters would be replaced over the 'next few months'. 'Since Pan Am is no longer a tenant in the building and virtually out of business, it makes sense to replace the sign with a familiar name that symbolises strength, stability and long-term commitment to New York City', Mr Robert Schwartz, MetLife's chairman, said in a statement. Rumours that the insurance company, second largest in the US, was thinking of removing the Pan Am name have circulated for some time. Earlier this year, MetLife advertised for rental space in the building. Photographs accompanying the ads had the Pan Am name airbrushed out. That prompted some lobbying to persuade MetLife to keep the Pan Am letters - originally demanded at 30 feet by the airline's founder, Juan Trippe, when Pan Am moved into the building designed by Walter Gropius. But MetLife claimed yesterday that letters were running five to one in favour of the change, with families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing  -causing a Pan Am 747 to crash - anxious to see the old name disappear.</p>

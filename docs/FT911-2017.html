			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The calling of leasing profits to account - Philip Coggan analyses the DTI's report on the 1988 collapse of Sound Diffusion THE COLLAPSE of Sound Diffusion in December 1988 may have come as a big surprise to its shareholders, but the company's problems, as yesterday's Department of Trade &amp; Industry report made clear, had been developing over several years. What had been one of the most successful stock market companies in the early 1980s finished up in such a bad state that the liquidators estimate that no funds will be available to general creditors or shareholders. The report criticises the two auditors of the company over this period - Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young (since merged as Ernst &amp; Young) - for failing to identify, or otherwise accepting, serious defects in the company's accounting practices. The business of the group - leasing electrical equipment to hotels and nursing homes - is a field where the accountancy issues are particularly arcane. The report weighs in at 255 pages and there is a 33-page chapter devoted entirely to the intricacies of lease accounting. In essence, the inspectors conclude that the company made over-optimistic assumptions on future leasing profits. When these profits failed to materialise, and the company's trading position deteriorated, the board's efforts to rescue the company came too late. 'In effect, the company was being squeezed from two directions,' say the inspectors. 'The supply of new customer leases was falling, which affected the ability to raise finance, and the cash strain arising from the existing lease book was increasing.' The last few years of the group's life were dogged by the question of how much profit the group should recognise, and how quickly. Sound Diffusion's founder, Mr Paul Stonor, left the group after a shareholder revolt caused by a dispute with the auditors and the announcement of poor results after a series of optimistic company profit forecasts. Mr David Macdonald, Mr Stonor's replacement as chairman, restated the accounts in several respects, but still, according to the inspectors, the figures were over-optimistic. Leasing appears simple enough on the surface. One company allows another to use equipment, in return for a stream of rental payments. But such a system, called an operating lease, requires the leasing company to make an upfront payment and then wait for several years to recoup its money. That is very bad for its cashflow. So Sound Diffusion, like many other companies, sold its leasing agreement to a finance company in return for an upfront payment. These so-called finance leases were better - at least initially - for the company's cashflow but were far more complex in accounting terms. Under the terms of SSAP 21, the accounting rule covering this field of operations, the profits should be spread over the whole of the lease period. However, as a manufacturer of some of the products, Sound Diffusion was entitled to recognise a 'selling profit' at the start of the lease. Given that the leases could last as long as 14 years, the more profit that could be reported early, the better for the company. Determining this 'selling profit' was thus the root of much of the accounting disputes, and a key element of the inspectors' criticisms of Sound Diffusion's accounts. They conclude that 'excessive selling profits were recognised in the accounts at the inception of finance leases'. SSAP 21 says that the selling profit should be restricted to the excess of the 'fair value' of the relevant asset over its cost, this 'fair value' being the price at which an asset could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction. However, Sound Diffusion claimed, under both Mr Stonor and the replacement board, that it was impossible that such a fair value could be established. Instead, the company, in essence, calculated the figure backwards. It calculated all the costs of the lease, added in an expected rate of return over the lease's lifetime, and subtracted it from the expected revenues. The result was the selling profit. Much of the inspectors' report consists of criticism of these calculations. For example, the company included in the lease an escalation clause, which increased lease payments in line with wage inflation. The effect of this was that the higher the assumed rate of wage inflation, the higher the selling profit. The inspectors criticise the assumed level of rental escalation and also say that the company did not allow sufficiently for the effect of cancelled leases. Nor did it adequately discount future rental income, or allow enough for funding costs. This not only meant that profits were recognised incorrectly but that the company's principal assets on the balance sheet - its finance leases - were inflated. 'We have concluded that the company's balance sheet at December 31 1987 was so materially overstated,' say the inspectors, 'that rather than the net assets shown of Pounds 17.8m, there were actually net liabilities.' These accounts were particularly important because they accompanied the documents for the company's Pounds 9.5m rights issue. By this time, the report says that, without additional capital, 'Sound Diffusion could not have operated for much longer within its existing bank facilities'. The inspectors say that 'had there been a proper analysis of the company's position in these documents, it is inconceivable that the rights issue would have proceeded'. The inspectors criticise Mr Macdonald, and his fellow director Mr Francis Howard, for their part in the rights issue documents saying that they 'failed to ensure that the reasons for the rights issue were stated sufficiently clearly', and that they 'should not have been party to the wording in the document to the effect that the problems of the past were behind the company when they should have known this was not the case'. Small shareholders were vociferous in their complaints about the wording of the rights issue document when the company collapsed. But Mr Macdonald and Mr Howard yesterday rejected the inspectors' criticisms, arguing that it is 'rather surprising' that it is they, rather than the experts, who are singled out for criticism over the rights issue. The inspectors did say that 'no single factor or person was responsible for the failure of Sound Diffusion', and Ernst &amp; Young reacted sharply to the report yesterday, saying that the accountancy issue in question was a matter of judgment and that it continued to believe the policies used were appropriate. The row is unlikely to end with the report. Tunstall Group, a major shareholder in Sound Diffusion, is suing Arthur Young, claiming damages for negligence and/or breach of duty in connection with the 1987 accounts and the rights issue document. The action has been set down for trial in July next year.</p>

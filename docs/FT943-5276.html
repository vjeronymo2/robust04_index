			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Metals After a summer lull, base metals prices have continued their upward path. Aluminium has already broken through its early summer peak to reach its highest level for three years. Copper is not far behind, which is good news for RTZ ahead of its interim results on Thursday. Summer weakness in base metals is usual, since the holiday season takes the edge off industrial demand. The rally may simply reflect the end of the doldrums. If it is to develop into another leg of the base metals bull market, though, the overhang of stocks will have to be reduced. While aluminium stocks have fallen modestly during the summer - thanks to production cuts agreed in January - copper stocks have risen over the past few weeks. The question is whether the seasonal increase in industrial demand during the autumn is enough to make inroads into stocks. Prices will fall back if there is no appreciable reduction in the overhang. Doubts about metal prices may explain the relatively poor performance of mining shares during the first half of the year. RTZ has outperformed a falling equity market by 13 per cent this year, for example, while the copper price has risen by a third. Since the average copper price in the first half of this year was not much different from last, the company's interim figures will not show much benefit. But if falling copper stocks underpin another rise in the metals price this autumn, the shares will have room to rise.</p>

The outline of the prime minister's  speech was worked out on 31 January. While keeping in mind the  passage of political reform bills through the Diet, the prime  minister will display his attitude toward tackling domestic  affairs from the viewpoint that "reform in domestic politics is  indispensable for promoting diplomacy." For example, he will  declare that the Hosokawa cabinet intends to continue to tackle  the task of "promoting reform" as the administration's top  priority. His speech can be described as a "Hosokawa vision"  which indicates what Japan ought to be like to prepare for the  21st century. In concrete terms, Prime Minister Hosokawa will  clearly state his intention to speed up the following tasks: 1)  securing transparency in procedures for deciding on government  policies; and 2) changing the current economic structure to a  consumer-oriented one. Moreover, the prime minister will call  for building "stable and strong relations between Japan and the  United States." He will also spell out his intention to  strengthen the cooperative relationship between the two  countries in view of building a new order in the Asia-Pacific  region in the post-Cold War era. The prime minister's speech  will last about 20 minutes. He will deliver the speech in  English as he did at the meeting of the UN General Assembly last  September.</p>

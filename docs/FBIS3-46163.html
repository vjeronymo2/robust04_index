			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today rebuked French Foreign Minister Alan Juppe's suggestion  that Washington press the Bosnian Muslims to accept a peace  settlement with the Serbs and Croats.    "In a sense, forcing a settlement on that aggrieved party  (the Bosnian Muslims) requires a very strange moral calculus,"  said Mike McCurry, U.S. State Department spokesman.    This was in response to Juppe's comments to the NEW YORK  TIMES late Monday that if Washington did not exert pressure on  the Muslims, it would be a catastrophe and the U.S. would be  responsible.    This latest exchange of recriminations marks a rising rift  between Washington and Paris on ending the two-year-long ethnic  fighting in the former Yugoslavia.    During a recent visit to Paris, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher brushed away suggestions for the imposition  of a peace settlement in Bosnia, saying Washington was unwilling  to commit the large number of troops required.    Forcing peace on unwilling parties "just doesn't logically  make much sense to the United States at this point," McCurry  said.    As the Balkan fighting drags on, the West is apparently  losing patience, as France, Canada, and Britain threatening to  pull out their troops stationed in Bosnia under the UN flag.    There are no U.S. ground troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  situation often criticized by the nations with forces deployed  there.    On a related matter, McCurry said it was "very doubtful"  that  a meeting of UN Security Council foreign ministers, as suggested  by Russia, would "have any greater success" than the European  Union's recent failed efforts.</p>

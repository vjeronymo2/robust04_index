			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chong Yon-chu from Washington] </F>   [Text] Almost at the same time that the United States  deployed Patriot missiles to the ROK, the U.S. Defense  Department made a final decision on 21 April to purchase the  great-sphere interceptor missile system (Erint), rather than the  Patriot missiles, as its missile weapon system for defense.  This was notified to Congress.    Since the U.S. Defense Department is the main customer for  weapons, this decision implies that the Defense Department does  not plan to purchase Patriot missiles. This is being considered  as a true death sentence for the Patriot missiles. Raytheon,  the company that produces Patriot missiles, is faced with a  difficult situation because of such a decision. It is expected  that this company will actively increase its activities to  promote overseas sales of Patriot missiles.    Before making a final decision on 21 April, the U.S. Defense  Department had decided in February to purchase the (Erint)  missile system rather than the Patriot missiles. However at that  time, senators and congressmen from Massachusetts, where the  Raytheon company is located, demanded an objective basis for the  Defense Department's choice. Therefore, the Defense Department  formed an independent team to continue to research on this  matter.    This research team concluded that the (Erint) missile is  more  effective and has a greater impact than the Patriot missiles in  intercepting ballistic missiles loaded with chemical and nuclear  weapons. John Deutch, under secretary of defense, revealed:  "In accordance with the result of the analysis made by the  research team and the operational demands, the Defense  Department concluded that the (Erint) is the best choice."    The Patriot missile which was treated like a "hero" during  the Gulf war received various criticisms on its performance  after the war. Thus, its myth was dispelled. Moshe Arens,  Israeli defense minister during the Gulf war said: "The rate of  hits was only 20 percent." The Massachusetts Institute of  Technology research team harshly criticized the Patriots by  saying: "The Patriot missile played almost no role at all  during the Gulf war."</p>

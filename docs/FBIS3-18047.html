			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Monday [28 February]  morning, massive trade union warning strikes caused considerable  problems in the areas of public transportation and the post in  some parts of Germany. Apart from North Rhine-Westphalia, the  job action has focused on Brandenburg, where according to the  Union of Public Services, Transportation, and Communications  Workers (OeTV), some 11,000 employees are planning to down tools  temporarily during the day.    Delays for commuters were mainly noticed in North  Rhine-Westphalia, where railroads and buses remained in their  garages in numerous cities. In southwestern Germany quite a few  people also arrived late at work because bus and train drivers  temporarily suspended work. Public transportation was also  affected in various parts of the Saarland. In Munich and  Augsburg, the OeTV strike not only affected public transport but  also the collection of garbage.    The Trade Union of Postal Workers (DPG) also appealed to its  members to stage token strikes. According to trade union  sources, several hundred postal workers downed tools in 10  telecommunication offices, including those of Berlin and  Hamburg. [passage omitted]    With their token strikes, which are scheduled to continue on  Tuesday, the trade unions want to protest against the "stubborn  and antisocial position" of the employers in the public sector.  While the OeTV has called for a 4-percent pay increase, the  employers presented a "list of cuts." Among other things, extra  benefits that have hitherto been granted as well as two free  days are to be cut. The wage talks were suspended without any  result last week and put off to 9 and 10 March.

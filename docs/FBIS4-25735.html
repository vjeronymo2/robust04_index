			<p>BFN     [Text] "It takes 10 years for a tree to grow up, but 100  years to train qualified personnel." This Chinese saying shows  how important training qualified personnel is. The key to  training qualified personnel lies in developing education. With  this issue in mind, this station reporter recently interviewed  provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang on what  measures Gansu will take to speed up the province's educational  development in the years ahead and what blueprints Gansu has  drawn up to this end.    [Reporter] Will you please tell me what Gansu has done with  respect to implementing "The PRC Education Reform and  Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" in recent years?    [Yan Haiwang] The provincial party committee and people's  government have all along attached great importance to and  vigorously implemented "The PRC Education Reform and Development  Program." Gansu Province held a provincial education work  conference in 1993, which drew up the province's "Opinions on  Implementing and Instituting `The PRC Education Reform and  Development Program'." The conference stated in no uncertain  terms that it is imperative to attach strategic priority to the  province's educational development and called for deepening  education system reform and rapidly training all sorts of  qualified personnel required by the province's economic growth.  As a result, we have further increased input into education.  We have also pledged to enable educational funds to account for  about 4 percent of the province's gross national product, keep  annual increase of the province's educational funds at and above  13 percent, and adopt practical measures to annually increase  education-related operational funds in the Nineth Five-Year  Plan. Thus we are confident that we will implement to the  letter "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program" and  "The PRC Teachers Law" thanks to such a correct guiding ideology  and the aforementioned policies and measures.    Since last year's conference, party committees, people's  governments, and education departments at all levels across the  province have conscientiously implemented "The PRC Education  Reform and Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" in  light of actual local conditions, actively pushed forward  educational reform and development with some initial successes,  and mainly attained the following two goals: First, we have  raised educational funds through a variety of channels despite a  flat budget. We raised educational input to a certain extent in  1993 in comparison with the previous year with the result that  the province's educational funds rose to 1.496 billion yuan, of  which budgeted educational funds accounted for 0.959 billion  yuan, up by 10 percent over the previous year. Moreover, the  province's per capita educational funds rose to 277.18 yuan, up  by 5.14 percent over the previous year. Second, we have raised  wages of primary and secondary schools teachers, repayed more  than 27.5 million yuan in wages owed to those teachers, and  basically guaranteed monthly wages for primary and secondary  schools teachers.    Implementation of "The PRC Education Reform and Development  Program," "The PRC Teachers Law," and Gansu's "Opinions on  Implementing and Instituting `The PRC Education Reform and  Development Program'" has given a powerful impetus to the  province's overall educational development. As a result, some  54 counties in the province have implemented compulsory primary  education for all school-age children while some 14 counties in  the province have implemented compulsory secondary education for  all school-age children. At present, some 95.8 percent of the  province's school-age children are going to schools. The  province's dropout rate has also declined. The ordinary college  and technical secondary education are now available to more  people in the province. The province's adult, vocational, and  in-service education and post-related training have also seen  rapid growth. A total of 45 counties in the province have  eradicated illiteracy. The illiteracy rate among the province's  young and middle-aged people has dropped to lower than 20  percent.    Nevertheless, the province's overall educational standard is  far below the country's average. The province's educational  development is still plagued by a series of problems, including  contradictions between educational development and economic  construction, and between educational scale and development  speed, on the one hand, and insufficient educational funds on  the other, and so on. These problems are unlikely to be solved  in the foreseeable future.    [Reporter] Will you please tell me what specific measures  Gansu will take to press ahead with educational reform and  development?    [Yan] In accordance with requirements spelled out by the  State Council, the Eighth Gansu Provincial CPC Congress held in  1993 put forth a basic train of thought and some basic tasks for  Gansu's educational reform and development. The basic train of  thought is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line, Gansu should comprehensively implement "The PRC Education  Reform and Development Program"; persistently attach strategic  priority to educational development; energetically develop  elementary education by implementing a nine-year compulsory  education system across the province; continually develop  vocational, technical, adult, and college education; further  develop the province's educational cause in terms of quantity  and quality; strive to raise the province's overall educational  standard onto a new stage in order to make, by the end of this  century, compulsory primary education basically available to all  school-age children and compulsory junior secondary education  available to about 70 percent of the province's rural  population; basically eradicate illiteracy among the majority of  young and middle-aged people in the province; by the end of this  century, enable all types of technical secondary schools to  enroll the same number of students as ordinary senior secondary  schools in the province do, and enable one or two higher  learning institutions and more than 10 specialities to meet  requirements laid down in the state "211 Project."    [Reporter] What specific steps will Gansu take to make  educational reform and development successful?    [Yan Haiwang] Generally speaking, we're going to take the  following four specific steps:    1. In order to attach strategic priority to educational  development, leaders at all levels across the province should  fully understand education's strategic position and role and  take education as a key link in the province's overall work. To  this end, principal leaders at all levels across the province  should personally take charge of educational development while  members of leading bodies at all levels across the province  should also show concern for educational development. We should  constantly study all major issues relating to educational reform  and development, attach great importance to and support  educational work, help overcome practical difficulties and  specific problems in the course of educational development, and  strive to successfully accomplish educational tasks.    2. We should make continued efforts to deepen education  system reform. To this end, we should mainly try to develop  elementary education by relying on local resources at the  moment. We should encourage various undertakings, enterprises,  and individuals to participate in running all types of  educational institutions. We should strive to develop college  education by relying on the government support and gradually  encourage people of all walks of life in the society to  contribute to college educational development. We should strive  to develop technical secondary and adult education by relying on  concerted efforts on the part of relevant trades, professions,  undertakings, and enterprises as well as the people of all walks  of life in the society. Moreover, we should make energetic  efforts to push ahead with school management and enrollment and  graduate job assignment system reform, thereby deepening the  province's overall educational reform.    3. We should strive to improve the province's educational  quality. To this end, we should step up basic knowledge,  theory, and skills training among students so they will be able  to ethically, intellectually, physically, and aesthetically  improve themselves, do more practical work, and become socialist  builders and successors with ideals, moral integrity, cultural  accomplishments, and a sense of discipline,    4. We should make every possible endeavor to provide  educational development with necessary assistance, further raise  educational input, secure a proper increase in educational funds  year in year out, allocate a certain amount of funds for  scientific research and educational development and for  improving housing conditions of teachers as well, and increase  wages of teachers. To this end, we should first increase wages  of primary and secondary schools teachers by 10 percent on the  basis of the newly promulgated professional and technical wages  scale, continue to pay seniority subsidies to teachers in charge  of individual classes, increase as of 1 October, 1993, monthly  wages of non-government schools teachers by 35 yuan, cultivate a  fine general mood of society in which teachers and education  will be respected and highly valued, as well as urge and  encourage social organizations and individuals to donate cash to  schools or raise funds for schools. In a nutshell, we should  make every effort to provide education with excellent conditions  and a favorable environment.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Oil distributors unveil record profits for year TWO of Japan's leading oil distributors, Mitsubishi Oil and Cosmos Oil, yesterday announced record profits for the year to end-March. Mitsubishi Oil said its 9.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y23.5bn (Dollars 182.1m) was due to lower interest rates and substantial foreign exchange gains. The company also saw increased sales of higher-valued petroleum products, which limited the effect of a 4.4 per cent decline in revenues to Y1,041bn, the result of lower crude oil prices and the appreciation of the yen. Net profit grew by 22.9 per cent to Y13.6bn. The dividend was raised to Y8 from Y7.50. Mitsubishi Oil expects higher sales, but lower pre-tax profits for the current fiscal year. Cosmos Oil had its best profits since its creation in 1986 as a result of the merger of Daiky Oil and Maruzen Oil. Pre-tax earnings climbed by 55.5 per cent to Y27.8bn, while net profits surged by 90.6 per cent to Y19.4bn. Sales fell by 7.7 per cent to Y1,581bn.</p>

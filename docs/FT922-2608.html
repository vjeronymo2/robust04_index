			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Last-ditch plan to save CIS trade THE BIS proposes a special clearing system as a last resort to prevent a breakdown in trade among the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States, It says the west needs to provide external finance while Russia and the other republics make the transition to market economies. The most valuable help, however, would be to allow the CIS free access to western markets. Although the CIS's struggle to adjust is the most striking new feature of the world economic landscape, the BIS says its debt does not seriously threaten the financial system. The rouble could be used to finance trade if it were stabilised and made convertible, but plans by some republics to introduce their own currencies risk eroding the rouble area.</p>

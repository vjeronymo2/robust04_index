For tests on mammals, the Agency requires a minimum submission of the following tests to characterize substitute risks: A range-finding study that considers the appropriate exposure pathway for the specific use (e.g., oral ingestion, inhalation, etc.), and a 90-day subchronic repeated dose study in an appropriate rodent species. For certain substitutes, a cardiotoxicity study is also required. Additional mammalian toxicity tests may be identified based on the substitute and application in question. To sufficiently characterize aquatic toxicity concerns, both acute and chronic toxicity data for a variety of species are required. For this purpose, the Agency requires a minimum data set as described in ``Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and their Uses,'' which is available through the National Technical Information Service ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PB 85&hyph;227049). Other relevant information and data summaries, such as the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), should also be submitted. To assist in locating any studies previously submitted to EPA and referred to, but not included in a SNAP submission, the submitter must provide citations for the date, type of submission, and EPA Office to which they were submitted, to help EPA locate these quickly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental Fate and Transport.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where available, information must be submitted on the environmental fate and transport of substitutes.

Specifically, the flash point and flammability limits are needed, as well as information on the procedures used for determining the flammability limits. Testing of blends should identify the compositions for which the blend itself is flammable and include fractionation data on changes in the composition of the blend during various leak scenarios. For substitutes that will be used in consumer applications, documentation of testing results conducted by independent laboratories should be submitted, where available. If a substitute is flammable, the submitter must analyze the risk of fire resulting from the use of such a substitute and assess the effectiveness of measures to minimize such risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exposure data.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Available modeling or monitoring data on exposures associated with the manufacture, formulation, transport, use and disposal of a substitute. Descriptive process information for each substitute application, as described above, will be used to develop exposure estimates where exposure data are not readily available.

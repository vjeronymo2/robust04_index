			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waverers 'relieved by result of election' CONFIDENTIAL opinion polling conducted for Labour after its election defeat showed that even voters who had once planned to vote for the party expressed 'surprise and relief' at the April 9 outcome, Ivo Dawnay writes. The findings of the surveys, held to sound out sample groups of potential floating voters, were a key reason that Labour's national executive committee avoided recriminations over detailed campaign tactics yesterday. The poll results were outlined by Mr Philip Gould, the head of the controversial Shadow Communications Agency, at the NEC meeting. They graphically demonstrated the alarming shallowness of Labour's support among those it thought were its supporters. The so-called qualitative opinion surveys do not give statistical data, but they indicate broad opinion voiced by men and women voters chosen before the election as potential waverers. Researchers found a new readiness to cite 'self-interest' as grounds to vote against Labour among groups of skilled and semi-skilled workers, aged 25 to 50, in Nottingham and Slough. They were all workers who had indicated their intention to vote Labour or Liberal Democrat. Opinions expressed showed uncertainty about what interests the Labour party now represents and the view that a vote for Labour was no longer a 'self-interested working class vote'. It was stated that voting for Labour was a vote 'for less fortunate people by more comfortable, conscientious people'. Among other reasons for opposition to Labour were negative and off-putting associations voiced about the party. They included perceptions of Labour as a party tied to the past, the winter of discontent, inflation and economic failure, heavy industry and the traditional working class.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EXPORTER PLEADS GUILTY IN NUCLEAR CASE  </P> <P> A Canadian who won a new trial on his conviction for trying to export metals  used in nuclear weapons to Pakistan in 1986 pleaded guilty to lesser charges  rather than face another trial.  </P> <P> Arshad Z. Pervez was released after being sentenced in the new case to 32  months in prison, time he has already served, Assistant U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Amy Kurland said Saturday.  </P> <P> Pervez pleaded guilty Wednesday to attempting to export beryllium, a material  crucial to nuclear weapons production. In return, prosecutors dropped charges  of conspiracy and making false statements to the government, she said.  </P> <P> Pervez, a native of Pakistan who became a Canadian citizen, was to be arraigned  Wednesday on a new indictment but surprised prosecutors with his plea, Kurland  said.  </P> <P> Kurland said Pervez contacted Carpenter Technology Corp. in late 1986 to ask  about purchasing a high-strength nickel-iron alloy that is used to build  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> A Carpenter official who knew that the import of the metal to Pakistan was  restricted contacted the government.  </P></p>

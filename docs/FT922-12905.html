			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Laird calls for Pounds 41m after 27% fall LAIRD GROUP yesterday reported profits down Pounds 10.5m after high start up costs in Germany and Spain. The automotive supplier also announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 220p to raise Pounds 41.4m for continued growth. The market took the rights issue in its stride and Laird's shares rose 1p to 275p. Laird said it had spent two years and Pounds 60m on investments in existing businesses, including the two new plants supplying car door seals for new Golf and Astra models and that further investment was planned. It also planned to expand the computer and building industry divisions in the UK and printing, packaging and plastics in the US. Broadly in line with expectations, pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent, from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 28.4m on sales ahead 7 per cent at Pounds 523.8m. The profits came after Pounds 3m of start up costs in Germany and Spain and Pounds 2.2m for redundancy in France and the UK. In sealing systems for cars, operating profits fell from Pounds 18m to Pounds 13.8m reflecting lower demand in France, pressure on margins on seals for older car models and some loss of sales as Volkswagen changed from the old Golf to its new model. Mr Ian Arnott, managing director, said Laird would this year enjoy the benefit of higher market share and higher margins on sales of its new seals from the new plants. Profits in the services division were almost unchanged at Pounds 10.2m, buoyed by continued rapid growth in the Fullarton Fabrication computer plant in Scotland. In the industrial products division, which includes the French auto supply companies, profits fell from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 12.9m partly as a result of the redundancies. Earnings per share fell from 24.4p to 17.5p and a final dividend of 6.2p gives a total of 10.2p (10p). Mr Arnott said the rights issue would reduce gearing from a year-end level of 44 per cent, up from a 40 per cent a year earlier, to the mid teens. COMMENT Laird's metamorphosis over 20 years from shipbuilding, through steel, to transport systems and now to high-tech rubber and plastics for the auto industry has been remarkable. Judging by the market's reaction to yesterday's call for Pounds 41m to do more of the same, shareholders like what they are getting. The company is increasing both market share and value added in the European car market and so long as the industry keeps demanding higher specification parts, shareholders will not be disappointed. Laird's problem, if it has one, is that its auto side is so strong that efforts to grow the 46 per cent of sales in non-auto to provide greater balance are constantly hindered. That is not, however, an immediate problem. This year the group is likely to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 39m, giving 21.3p of earnings and an undemanding multiple of 13.</p>

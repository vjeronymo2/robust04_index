			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: A distinctive formula for success - Andrew Bolger on expanding Motor World and plans for its market debut MOTOR WORLD, the UK's biggest independent chain of stores selling car parts and accessories, is to be launched on the stock market with a value of about Pounds 28m. The Bradford-based group will raise Pounds 12.5m by selling shares, at a price to be announced on Thursday, through a placing fully underwritten by Beeson Gregory, its stockbroker. Motor World has 178 outlets, mainly in the north of England, Wales and the Midlands, and plans to build a national network for its distinctive formula. Unlike Halfords, the market leader, Motor World eschews prime high street sites and large out-of-town 'sheds'. Its stores offer seven-day trading in cheaper locations away from the high street, usually on busy main roads with parking facilities. Each outlet carries about 4,000 items and also offers a 24-hour order service for parts and accessories not in stock. Staff are trained to advise customers on what to buy and the shops stock Haynes Manuals for 150 types of car, to encourage DIY maintenance. Mr Darrell Kershaw, managing director, believes the chain could expand to 300 outlets within two years, with depressed property prices and acquisition opportunities giving it an ideal chance to move into the south-east of England and Scotland. Motor World has lifted profits at an annual rate of 30 per cent over the past three years and made operating profits of Pounds 3.51m on turnover of Pounds 34.5m in the 12 months to November. The group has four divisions - retail, distribution, packaging and manufacturing - all aimed at the motor market. In 1988 Mr Kershaw led an Pounds 8m management buy-out, backed by Candover Investments, of Motor World from Mr Michael Stanford, who started the business in 1968 and steadily expanded it, augmented by acquisitions of small chains of shops from receivers. The MBO team acquired 101 Motor World outlets and Panther, a business established in 1982 which buys car parts and accessories in bulk to package and distribute, either under the Panther name or the brand label of retailing and wholesale customers. In 1989 Motor World decided to get into the fast-fit exhaust market. It paid Pounds 5m for Autogem Holdings, which had six exhaust-fitting service centres, and its two related manufacturing subsidiaries, Genex and KRC, which make metal pressing and rubber mouldings. Although the Autogem exhaust-fitting centres were profitable and remain so, Mr Kershaw said he quickly recognised that opening this type of outlet was much more expensive than the modest outlay required for a typical Motor World shop. Instead, Autogem has been developed as the UK's largest supplier of exhaust system supports to fast-fit retailers such as Kwik-Fit and Superdrive. A warehouse/distribution centre just off the M1/M62 carries 6,000 product lines, offers next-day delivery service throughout Britain, and serves many export markets. Autogem's products are sold to smaller garages and workshops through Motopax, a separate trading division. Motor World's main business is, however, the retail outlets, which in the year to November accounted for 72 per cent of sales and 64 per cent of group operating profit. Building a national chain is the group's key priority. Mr Kershaw, a hard-headed Yorkshireman who trained as a motor mechanic, said his warehouse at Bradford could service 300 shops, and had land adjoining if more space was needed. But all Motor World stores must make a profit. He said: 'I'm just as proud to close a shop, as to open one. We give every shop 12 to 18 months and then if, in spite of our best efforts, it is not making a profit, we close it.' Although Motor World has closed 30 outlets over the years, the group only has one unlet unit on its books. Mr Kershaw said that because of the modest size and convenience of the sites, the group had found it easy to sub-let premises to other shopkeepers when necessary. The group, which employs 877 people, believes that benefits of scale in buying and distribution will give it an advantage over small independent stores, which are its main competition. As well as expanding organically and by acquisition, Mr Kershaw aims to increase the amount spent by individual customer by stocking more expensive items, such as audio and security products. Last year the group paid Pounds 360,000 for Eurocar, a company with two outlets in West Yorkshire which supplies in-car entertainment and security systems. Once again, the canniness which has seen Motor World raise profits through recession is to the fore. Although 60 group stores now sell audio products, Mr Kershaw is still testing the economics of Eurocar's service of fitting systems at customers' homes and offices in West Yorkshire, before deciding whether to offer it across the chain.</p>

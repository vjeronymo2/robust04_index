			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Hamati from Washington] </F>   [Text] The joint Jordanian-U.S. committee held its first  meeting at the U.S. State Department earlier today.    Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, who chaired the  Jordanian side, said discussion revolved around the framework  for the committee's action. The Jordanian foreign debt,  particularly to the United States, is the most important topic  on the agenda.    Dr. al-'Anani said it has been agreed to reassess the debt  during the meetings that will be held within the context of the  Paris Club in the future.    It was also agreed during the meeting, which was attended on  the Jordanian side by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh and Fayiz  al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador in Washington, that the United  States will do all it can to reschedule the largest possible  amount of Jordanian debt for three years, taking into account an  easing of the terms of rescheduling in terms of the period and  the interest rate and to support Jordan's position on reducing  the debt.    Dr. al-'Anani said it was agreed to study increasing U.S.  aid  to Jordan and that Jordan has made many proposals in this regard  which the U.S. side promised to study in order to meet the  feasible ones.    As regards the trade links, the information minister and  head  of the Jordanian side to this committee meetings said final  arrangements have been set to lift the blockade of the Port of  al-'Aqabah. He said the meeting discussed the issue of  increasing Jordan's exports to the United States, supporting the  commercial centers, and the setting up of a joint chamber of  commerce.    It was also agreed that the two countries' ambassadors in  Amman and Washington will act as a liaison officers for the  joint Jordanian-U.S. committee and that the committee will meet  once every six months in Amman and Washington alternately.    The U.S. president stressed during his meeting with His  Majesty King Husayn his support to the Jordanian economic  reforms and his country's support for Jordan's efforts to reduce  its foreign debt.    The U.S. side to the joint committee meetings was chaired by  Robert Pelletreau, the assistant secretary of state for Near  Eastern affairs.

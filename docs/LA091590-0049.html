			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISSIDENT QUITS MEXICO'S RULING PARTY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE DEFECTION OF RODOLFO GONZALEZ GUEVARA IS LIKELY TO IGNITE  DIVISIVE DEBATES WITHIN THE PRI. HE CHARGES THE GROUP HAS BECOME UNDEMOCRATIC.  </P> <P> The Institutional Revolutionary Party's most outspoken dissident has resigned,  asserting that a national assembly held this month was "a masquerade" that  proved the ruling party is undemocratic and unwilling to separate from the  government.  </P> <P> Rodolfo Gonzalez Guevara's resignation is the biggest blow to the PRI, as the  party is called, since leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas quit in October,  1987, to run as an opposition candidate for the presidency.  </P> <P> A former secretary general of the PRI and member of the party for 44 years,  Gonzalez Guevara spearheaded the dissident faction known as Critical Current,  which has been pushing for an internal democratization, honest elections and a  separation of party and state.  </P> <P> Gonzalez Guevara's resignation is not likely to provoke a mass exodus from the  PRI, but it will produce painful and, most likely, divisive debates within the  party. Together with the departure of the "Cardenistas," it gives the  impression that there is no room for true dissent within the PRI.  </P> <P> Gonzalez Guevara's resignation also is a setback for President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari, who has vowed to bring about democratic reforms in Mexican politics  but who issued a scathing attack on his critics during the PRI's 14th party  convention, which ended Sept. 3.  </P> <P> Gonzalez Guevara has been critical of Salinas' neo-liberal economic program, a  radical departure from the original philosophy of the party that grew out of  the Mexican Revolution and has ruled for 61 years.  </P> <P> Salinas has pared down the Mexican state and sold off government companies. His  economic austerity program has eaten away at workers' salaries, and he has  allied his government closely with the United States.  </P> <P> In his resignation letter, made public Thursday, Gonzalez Guevara said he was  committed to "the ideas of the Mexican Revolution" and an independent party. He  had been pushing for the party to switch from an organization based on tightly  controlled sectors -- labor, farmers and bureaucrats -- to one based on  geographic representation with secret elections for party posts.  </P> <P> Most PRI leaders reacted to his resignation respectfully and with regret. But  Fidel Velazquez, the 90-year-old patriarch of the PRI's Mexican Workers'  Confederation, one of the three party sectors, lashed out at him.  </P> <P> "When you cut a dead branch from a tree, the tree is better off," Velazquez  said. Gonzalez Guevara responded in a radio interview that Velazquez has been  "the principal cause of anti-democracy in the party."  </P> <P> At the party convention, Velazquez's labor sector managed to stave off reforms  that would have reduced its power and the muscle of all sectors.  </P> <P> Gonzalez Guevara has been an undersecretary of interior; head of the ruling  party's think tank, the Center for Social, Political and Economic Studies, and  twice a member of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the National  Congress. As Mexico's ambassador to Spain from 1984 to 1987, he joined Cardenas  in forming the first dissident faction within the PRI, the Democratic Current.  </P> <P> During the party convention in February, 1987, then-PRI chief Jorge de la Vega  Dominguez announced that the party did not accept "internal currents," which he  likened to a fifth column. After that, Cardenas withdrew from all party duties,  and he resigned in October, when a tiny opposition party offered to back him  for the presidency.  </P> <P> Cardenas has since formed his own party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party.  </P> <P> Gonzalez Guevara, who chose not to leave the party with Cardenas in 1987,  formed the Critical Current soon thereafter. He wrote many controversial  articles in the Mexico City daily newspaper, Excelsior, accusing the government  of election fraud and pushing for change within the PRI.  </P> <P> Gonzalez Guevara does not rule out the possibility of joining forces with  Cardenas, but he said he would not enlist in any party right now. He also said  he was considering forming his own party for the 1994 presidential election, a  move that likely would hurt Cardenas as much as the PRI.  </P></p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / US and western allies fail to resolve their differences THE US and its western allies yesterday were still at odds over what action to take if the Bosnian Serb assembly failed to give clear endorsement to the Vance-Owen peace plan, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, admitted. While not ruling out some kind of military action such as air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines, Mr Hurd said that talks last weekend with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had not resolved which particular option should be chosen. Mr Hurd, who was answering questions by members of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, referred in particular to reservations by Britain and other countries about the preferred US option to lift the UN embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia. Such a step 'runs the risk of inflaming the fighting and spreading the war,' he said. Britain and France, main contributors of troops to the UN peacekeeping operation in the former Yugoslavia, have almost identical positions on the subject, as became clear in talks in London on Tuesday between their two prime ministers, Mr John Major and Mr Edouard Balladur. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said yesterday that, while military force might have to be used against the Bosnian Serbs if their parliament failed to give unequivocal approval to the peace plan, a decision to do so could only be taken by the UN Security Council after further consultations between the main powers concerned. Mr Juppe also told the weekly meeting of the French cabinet that US-French differences over the command of future peacekeeping forces and the possible lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia had surfaced during talks in Paris on Tuesday with Mr Christopher. The US had 'clearly indicated' it would ask for the lifting of the arms embargo if the peace agreement was not ratified by the Bosnian Serb assembly, a government spokesman quoted Mr Juppe as telling the cabinet. 'As far as this solution goes, France has its reservations.' Mr Hurd strongly denied reports that international forces might be sent into Bosnia to impose the peace plan as long as the fighting continued and the plan had not been endorsed by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We certainly would not be putting in troops to push Serb troops out of areas which they have to vacate under the Vance-Owen plan,' Mr Hurd said. This categorically contradicted a statement in Brussels yesterday by Lord Owen, one of the international mediators, that a peacekeeping force must be prepared to fight, if necessary, to make the warring parties withdraw their troops. Mr Hurd, however, said the UN - including British - troops would do no more than monitor the withdrawal of the warring parties' forces to their designated areas, but would not be deployed until it was clear that the withdrawal was under way. He emphasised the government had not yet made a decision on Britain's contribution and reports that a 60,000-strong UN peacekeeping force would include 10,000 British troops were no more than 'speculative.'</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS DEFEATS CUESTA TO MOVE CLOSER TO TITLE  </P> <P> Emotions grew a little heated when College of the Canyons played Cuesta  Saturday afternoon, but nothing has been hotter than the Cougars' bats.  </P> <P> Canyons rapped 13 hits in posting a 7-5 Western State Conference win in a game  that was played at the emotional pitch of a championship game.  </P> <P> Cuesta, which entered the day one game behind first-place Canyons, was pushing  to remain in contention for its first conference title; perennial champion  Canyons was trying to solidify its bid for another championship.  </P> <P> "We try to downplay (the game) a little bit," Cuesta Coach Larry Lee said.  "Baseball's not a game you can get too emotional about, but it was definitely  an emotional game."  </P> <P> Willie Shoemaker and Angel Cordero could have been in the dugouts there was so  much bench jockeying, and midway through the game, the home-plate umpire had to  admonish both benches for their hostile words.  </P> <P> There was no stopping the Canyons offense, though.  </P> <P> In winning three WSC games in the past four days, Canyons had a total of 44  hits. Canyons (23-10, 14-3), which has three WSC games remaining, now leads  Cuesta (20-13-2, 12-5) and Moorpark by two games.  </P> <P> All but one of Canyons' starters hit safely, and Gary Morgan, J. R. Trujillo,  Billy Horvat, Jon Beauchemin and Mike Kerber each had two hits.  </P> <P> However, Cuesta right-hander Paul Mayo kept Canyons off-balance in the early  going with his drop-off-the-tabletop curve, and the score was tied, 1-1, after  three innings.  </P> <P> "His breaking ball is as good a breaking ball as we've seen in a long time,"  Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "I think it was more his breaking ball than that  we were being unaggressive."  </P> <P> After twice striking out looking, shortstop Charlie Fowlks caught up with Mayo  in the fourth inning and hit his fourth home run, a three-run shot to left  center.  </P> <P> Cuesta battled back in the fifth with three runs off Canyons starter Roland  DeLaMaza to tie the score, 4-4.  </P> <P> Trujillo and Beauchemin made a winner of DeLaMaza (6-1) when they had  consecutive run-scoring singles in the bottom of the inning to put Canyons back  ahead, 6-4.  </P> <P> "He battled," Mohney said of DeLaMaza, who struck out four and allowed two solo  home runs in his five-inning stint. "He kept us in the game, but his  concentration was not very good for us today."  </P> <P> Jeff Adams relieved DeLaMaza in the sixth and held Cuesta to one unearned run  with four innings of two-hit pitching.  </P> <P> "Jeff Adams did a great job again," Mohney said. "We never had that big of a  lead. . . . I never felt good about it for some reason."  </P> <P> Canyons added an insurance run in the eighth when Kerber scored Morgan with a  single, and Adams retired the last seven men he faced to earn his fifth save.  </P> <P> Mayo (3-4) went the distance and struck out five for Cuesta, which has compiled  its highest total of WSC wins.  </P> <P> Canyons left 11 men on base, including three in the seventh inning.  </P></p>

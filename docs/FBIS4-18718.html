			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks denote recorded passages] </F>   [Text] Cavaco Silva has stated again today that he will not  be prime minister without an absolute majority at the next  elections. The prime minister went to the TSF radio station to  say that a government without an absolute majority would be a  mistake and a disaster:    [Correspondent] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva arrived in a  good  mood at the TSF studios for an interview in which he would be  willing to talk about everything:    [Cavaco Silva] "I got up very late because I went to bed  very  late last night, therefore I had very little time to think."    [Correspondent] Neverthless, he was very well prepared for  the debate. For over one hour, he did not hide his wish to have  stability when governing the country:    [Cavaco Silva] "Portugal does not have conditions at present  within Europe if it does not have political and government  stability. I think it would be a tremendous mistake for  Portugal to return to the time when, in 11 years, we had 16  governments each lasting nine months; I think that would be a  disaster."    [Correspondent] As far as a possible government reshuffle is  concerned, he admitted the future replacement of the minister of  agriculture, but rejected the idea of a substantial reshuffle in  his cabinet:    [Cavaco Silva] "It is not part of my intentions to have  substantial, profound cabinet reshuffles before the legislative  elections of October 1995."    [Correspondent] He went on further to debate the economy:  interest rates, the inflation, the escudo, and the opportunity  for it to enter the European Monetary System [EMS]. From Cavaco  Silva's comments on these topics, we have got two main messages:  One is on inflation:    [Cavaco Silva] "I believe that Portugal has conditions in  1994 to have the lowest interest rate in the past 23 to 24  years."    [Correspondent] The other relates to his decision about the  EMS:    [Cavaco Silva] "I believe that that decision about the EMS  will have been one of the most decisive and important decisions  I have taken as prime minister."    [Correspondent] He made a reference to the role of the  opposition toward the end of the interview and also made a  request:    [Cavaco Silva] "What I will be asking is for public opinion  to exert a certain pressure on the Socialist Party for it to be  a little more credible, for it to be a little more honest, a  little more sensible, and be little more moderate. Our country  needs that, our country needs that."</p>

(KNI) filed a Revised Tariff Filing. In this tariff filing, KNI has proposed revisions reflecting inadvertently omitted tariff language and typographical errors. In addition, after reviewing the effectiveness of the restructured tariff language since October 1, 1993, (KNI's restructuring implementation date), KNI realized that certain changes were necessary and, therefore, is proposing several substantive changes described more fully in the tariff filing. KNI states that copies of the revised tariff sheets were appended to KNI's application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KNI states that all interested parties have been served with this filing as well as affected public bodies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.21 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before September 23, 1994.

Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

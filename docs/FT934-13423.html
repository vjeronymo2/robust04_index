			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (2): Recession is too strong a term - Simon Gray follows the economic signposts LUXEMBOURG politicians and businessmen say anxiously that the Grand Duchy is teetering on the brink of recession. Indeed, every industry except the financial and media sectors claims to be facing recession, if not a crisis. But even if the pessimists are right, it does not look like the kind of recession other countries would worry about very much. According to the World Bank, Luxembourg had the world's second highest GDP per head (after Switzerland) last year: Dollars 35,260. The ministry of economic affairs estimates economic growth in 1992 at 2.8 per cent, and predicts rates of 1 per cent for this year and 1.6 per cent for 1994. To be sure, this is a reduction from Luxembourg's 1987-91 average of 5.1 per cent, but technically it is nothing like recession. Nevertheless, it would be hard to persuade Arbed of the truth of that. The Luxembourg-based steelmaker lost LFf3.3bn francs (Dollars 95m) in 1992 and expects the deficit to widen to LFf5bn (nearly Dollars 160m) this year. The workforce engaged in steel production in the Grand Duchy stood at 27,000 in the mid-1970s. It stands now 8,300 - and Arbed is planning to cut this to 6,000 by 1996. Steel is only the most conspicuous sign of slowdown in the economy. After nearly 10 years of success on the back of commercial property development, the construction sector has run out of steam - even if the industry's own forecast of 10,000 jobs at risk (out of some 21,000) looks like scaremongering. Overall, industrial production by volume (excluding construction and civil engineering) fell by 0.6 per cent last year and slipped by a further 2.9 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. Industry executives believe that, in general, production is now stabilising, but there is no sign of an improvement in prices. Consumer spending in supermarkets and chain stores declined by 1.4 per cent last year, although early figures indicate a resurgence in 1993. The number of new cars registered in the Grand Duchy in the first four months of the year fell by 25.2 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. Even residential property prices, which roughly doubled between 1986 and 1992, seem to have hit a ceiling. This year has seen a small but steady trickle of job cuts at companies such as Du Font de Nemours, Villeroy &amp; Boch, the ceramics manufacturer, and Electrolux. These have contributed to an unemployment figure of just under 3,400 at the end of August - a record low, although still barely two per cent of the working population. But this does not tell the whole story. At the same time that unemployment has been rising, so has total employment - by 3,400 in the year to February. The 'new' unemployed tend to be Luxembourg residents who were previously working in industry; in many cases, older people whom the Employment Administration tactfully describes as 'hard to place.' The the meantime, ever more commuter employees from Belgium, France and Germany are coming into the workforce. Frontaliers, as they are known, have long played an important role in the Luxembourg economy. But their numbers have shot up rapidly over the past few years: from 28,600 in 1989 to 45,400 in February 1993, in parallel with the growth of the financial sector. Precise figures are hard to come by, but the best guess is that about half of all jobs in Luxembourg are filled by foreigners, either commuters or residents. In the financial sector - where the Luxembourg Monetary Institute keeps exact figures - the proportion of foreigners at the end of June this year was 52.5 per cent. The banking industry and its constellation of financial services companies lead the other side of the Luxembourg economy - the side which has enjoyed surging growth, even as other sectors were running into difficulties. Last year the 213 banks based in the Grand Duchy (there are now 221) collectively improved their profits by 18.5 per cent, on top of a 24.1 per cent growth rate in 1991. Similar growth has occurred in the investment fund industry: its aggregate net assets more than doubled, from LFf4,157bn to LFf8,818bn, between December 1991 and June this year. Industry is by no means united in gloom. Sommer Allibert has decided to expand its new auto components factory near Clervaux; Goodyear is expanding tyre production at Colmar-Berg; Circuit Foil, the copper foil manufacturer, is investing LFf2,7bn (Dollars 78m) in its facility at Wiltz. And Arbed is pressing ahead with a LFf12.5bn (Dollars 360m) investment programme, including replacement of two blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces. The commercial property market, where rampant over-supply sent prices tumbling by more than 20 per cent between 1990 and the beginning of this year, is also showing hesitant signs of recovery. A new business park near Luxembourg airport struggled initially to find tenants but is now nearly full. Work started in July on a LFf2.5bn office and hotel complex south of the city. and the government's ambitious plans for development of the Kirchberg plateau have been rescued by Hochtief, the German developer, which has taken over a project dropped last year by Sweden's Skanska. The brightest performer, however, has been the media industry, where the Societe Europeenne des Satellites has consolidated the market dominance of its Astra TV satellite system. The Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion made record profits in 1992 as RTL-plus in Germany and RTL4 in the Netherlands led their markets in terms of both audience share and advertising revenue. Overall, while Luxembourg's economic outlook is relatively bright, questions remain. Can inflation be kept under control? Since 1987, when prices actually declined, inflation has risen to a steady 3.5 per cent, fuelled by a government budget deficit and a salary indexation mechanism which trade unions are reluctant to let go. This index is part of what the Luxembourg Industry Federation (Fedil) and other employers' groups see as an increasingly uncompetitive cost structure. They would prefer lower social security charges on employers and more flexibility in dealing with a workforce which, in general, is expensive to hire and difficult to fire. They are also concerned about the growing impact of environmental activists, who did well in the municipal elections. Environmental protests recently persuaded the Fulflex group to drop plans for a rubber factory in Kehlen - and may derail a planned industrial waste dump near the affluent dormitory town of Mamer. Longer term, there is concern that a return to prosperity in neighbouring areas of Belgium and France could cut off a source of manpower on which Luxembourg is increasingly dependent. The alternative would be more immigration - no easy political option in a country where, already, about a third of the population is foreign.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                          OFFICIAL PRICE LIST  ----------------------------------------------------------------                    1990     1991       1992        1992      1993                                    1st half              1st half  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds              7424     7488       7249        7048      6830 National            104      113        124 International      7320     7375       7125  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Stocks and shares   260      264        266         268       268 National             61       70         70          66        66 Foreign             199      194        196         202       202  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Investment Funds   1369     1589       1680        1783      1915 National           1339     1565       1657        1754      1889 Foreign              30       24         23          29        26  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Warrants &amp; others  1078     1163       1090        1064      1095  ---------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL             10131    10504      10285       10163     10108  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Luxembourg Stock Exchange  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

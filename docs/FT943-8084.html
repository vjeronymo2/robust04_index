			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Howard defends longer cautions Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday denied that the new form of words police must say when cautioning a suspect is long-winded after he announced a 60-word formula to replace the 22-word caution. The new caution reads: 'You do not have to say anything. But if you do not mention now something which you later use in your defence the court may decide that your failure to mention it now strengthens the case against you. A record will be made of anything you say and it may be given if you are brought to trial.' The present caution is: 'You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but what you say may be given in evidence.' Mr Howard said the new caution contained three sentences. 'I don't think that's very long-winded and use of a caution in very similar terms in Northern Ireland does not appear to have given rise to any problems.' Mr Alun Michael, Labour home affairs spokesman, said it meant the 'vulnerable and those of low ability' would be at risk. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mr Robert Maclennan said the new caution was 'an inelegant tongue-twister and a real mouthful which could be easily misunderstood in the heat of the moment.' The all-party law reform group Justice said the proposed caution would be difficult for suspects to understand and for police officers to remember. The Association of Chief Police Officers in England and Wales reserved judgment until it had studied the wording in detail.</p>

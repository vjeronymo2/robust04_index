			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: French equities falter in uncertain trading - Prospects for the Paris bourse Even Mr Edmond Alphandery, the ascetic economy minister, could scarcely conceal his glee yesterday when he announced that the public part of the FFr13bn sale of shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the second company to be sold in France's privatisation drive, had been heavily over-subscribed. The Economy Ministry is today expected to report that the institutional part of the Rhone-Poulenc sale has also been comfortably over-subscribed. The timing could scarcely be better. The successful sale of Rhone-Poulenc not only sets an encouraging precedent for the next round of privatisations, scheduled for next year, but comes at a propitious moment when the Paris stock market seems to be flagging. The CAC-40 index, which soared to record levels during the summer and early autumn, has faltered recently on concern about the outcome of the Gatt negotiations, the Balladur government's cautious approach to cutting interest rates and the recent spate of industrial unrest in France. 'There is a great deal of uncertainty about the prospects for the market,' said Mr David Harrington, of James Capel's Paris office. 'The fundamentals are still strong, but investors are likely to remain nervous until the Gatt issue has been resolved and there is clear evidence of further falls in interest rates'. Once these problems have been addressed, most analysts and economists expect the market to return to growth. Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director of Morgan Stanley in Paris, predicts that the CAC-40 will rise to a new record of 2,500 next year. 'We are rather optimistic,' he admitted. 'But the economic environment does look encouraging. If Germany comes out of recession, interest rates could fall steadily in France and Germany, and that would be a big boost to the stock market'. Other observers take a slightly less rosy view. But most are confident, barring a Gatt impasse, that the CAC-40 Index should reach a new record of around 2,400 in 1994. One reason for their confidence is the corporate sector's promising outlook. Companies have had a tough time in the early 1990s due to the impact of high interest rates and rising unemployment on domestic demand and, since the September 1992 currency crisis, the depressive effect of the strong franc on exports: CAC-40 companies are now approaching the end of their fourth successive year of earnings decline. Next year should mark the start of the recovery. Official figures show that consumer spending was slightly less sluggish during the summer. The strong franc is still affecting the competitiveness of French exports, but companies are now achieving significant productivity gains after years of low inflation and pay restraint. JP Morgan in Paris forecasts an inflation rate of just 2 per cent in 1994, thereby fuelling further improvements in cost competitiveness next year. James Capel expects to see a rebound in CAC-40 earnings of 35 per cent for 1994. But the eventual rate of growth will be heavily influenced by the progress of interest rate reduction and its impact on the economy. Salomon Brothers forecasts a fall in short-term interest rates from the present level of 6.45 per cent to between 4.5 and 5 per cent next year. The progress of the CAC-40 index will also be determined by the flow of funds into French equities. One of the main reasons for the recent slowdown in the Paris market is that US investors, who invested heavily during the summer bull run, have stopped pouring new money into France because of the appeal of high yields in the US. Most brokers expect to see a fresh influx of funds soon from domestic investors, thereby compensating for the US withdrawal. But the French have historically favoured cash over equity investments. Savings ratios are still rising suggesting that, in spite of the government's efforts to coax investors into equities through initiatives such as this summer's highly successful 'Balladur bond' issue, the French are still not ready to convert their cash into shares. Recent reductions in interest rates have already made equities seem more attractive against the dwindling returns on savings. This trend should continue as interest rates fall further next year, thereby providing a new pool of money to bolster the market. The other main influence will be the volume of new equity arriving on the market. Almost FFr100bn (Dollars 16bn) of new shares have already been added this year through the combination of the first two privatisations and a stream of private sector issues, from companies such as Schneider, Axa and Lafarge Coppee, thereby artificially depressing the index. 'So far, there has been no shortage of takers for these new issues and most have been healthily over-subscribed,' says Mr Harrington of James Capel. 'Unless there is a Gatt crisis there is no reason why next year's issues should not be as successful - unless, of course, the government is too greedy and privatises too many companies too quickly.'</p>

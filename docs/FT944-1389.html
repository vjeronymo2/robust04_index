			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Ben &amp; Jerry warns of loss in quarter Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the US ice-cream company famous for its oddball approach to business, yesterday surprised the stock market by warning that it expected to turn in a net loss of between Dollars 700,000 and Dollars 900,000 in the quarter to December because of a downturn in sales. Ben &amp; Jerry's shares, which traded at nearly Dollars 34 at the height of the company's growth in 1992, plunged Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 after the announce-ment. The company said it had maintained its 42 per cent share of the super premium ice-cream market, but the sector as a whole had shrunk because of exceptionally heavy promotional activity by companies in the premium sector. As a result, the company's sales were down by 5 per cent. In last year's fourth quarter Ben &amp; Jerry's made net profits of Dollars 1.1m.</p>

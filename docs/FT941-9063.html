			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum and palladium hit six-month highs US investment funds turned their attention to platinum and palladium yesterday, pushing their prices to the highest levels for six months. The potential for turmoil during April's elections in South Africa, the biggest producer of platinum and the second-largest of palladium, was cited by traders as one reason for the funds' interest. Traders also suggested the strength of the yen against the US dollar encouraged speculative Japanese buying. The platinum price was 'fixed' in London at Dollars 400.50 a troy ounce, up Dollars 6.75, while palladium's was up Dollars 2 at Dollars 135.50. Mr Michael Steel, market research director for Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, pointed out that the South African mines were a long way from potential trouble spots and said JM did not expect any major disruption. There had been no change in the fundamental situation: demand from carmakers for both metals (used in anti-pollution catalysts) was weak and industrial demand was poor. JM still believed platinum had been in surplus by 190,000 ounces last year. Palladium had been expected to show a 100,000-ounce deficit but Russia, the biggest producer, had sold heavily at the end of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["34th Anniversary of April 19 Uprising Marked" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Hyongyang citizens and  students held a meeting today to commemorate the 34th  anniversary of the April 19 uprising of the South Korean people.    The heroic popular uprising in South Korea on April 19,  1960,  was a massive anti-America, anti-fascist resistance against the  U.S. imperialists' colonial domination and their stooges'  fascist suppressive rule and for independent and democratic new  politics, new system and new life.    In his report Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central  Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea,  said the April popular uprising developed the anti-America,  anti-fascist struggle and national reunification movement of the  South Korean students and people to a new stage and fully  demonstrated worldwide their indomitable, patriotic spirit.    He said the desire of the uprisers had not yet been realised  in South Korea because the U.S. imperialists were still pursuing  the old policy of keeping hold on South Korea as their colony.    He said:    "The United States has not only failed to implement the  DPRK-U.S. joint statement but also reversed the simultaneous  action steps agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York,  made the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive under an  unreasonable pretext and egged some dishonest officials of the  International Atomic Energy Agency on to take `the nuclear  issue' of the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council in a  bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK by abusing the name of the  United Nations. The United States has brought nuclear war  equipment including Patriot missiles into South Korea and massed  nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and many warships in the  waters around the Korean peninsula. This indicates that the  United States is seeking a solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula with `strength.'    "The Kim Yong-sam group has engaged in flunkeyist and  treacherous acts, following outside forces, suppressed the  pro-reunification patriotic forces, acted a shock brigade in the  `nuclear' clamor against the DPRK, chiming in with the United  States in its strategy of a nuclear war, to extremely  deteriorate the North-South relations and bring the danger of  nuclear war to the Korean peninsula.    "All the compatriots in the North, South and overseas must  rise up as one in the nationwide struggle for national  reunification through confederacy and open a new phase for the  country's reunification this year, united closely under the  banner of `10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunification of the country,' irrespective of  idea, political view, religious belief, political grouping,  classes and strata and property status."</p>

After  Ukraine signs in Brussels a document about joining the NATO  programme, it intends "to put its possibilities into practice as  soon as possible", he noted.    Answering questions from journalists, Radetskyy flatly  dismissed assertions about increasing tensions between Russia  and Ukraine. "Quite the contrary, now we are solving the  problems which have long complicated relations between Kiev and  Moscow, at least military technical aspects of these problems",  the minister stressed.    When asked about the Crimean leaders' aspirations for a  greater autonomy, Radetskyy assessed the current situation on  the peninsula as "a normal and sound process". "The Crimea is  part of Ukraine, therefore one can speak only about an autonomy  stipulated by Ukraine's Constitution and laws and subordinate to  them... This issue should not give rise to any problems or  illusions", the minister emphasised.    Radetskyy also told reporters that during the talks with  Jeszenszky, the two ministers came to the conclusion that "all  existing problems should be solved by means of a calm and  well-considered dialogue". The Ukrainian defence minister  believes that all problems are eventually rooted in economic  conditions. It is the economy that determines a country's  policy, inter-state relations and public order on the whole,  Radetskyy noted.</p>

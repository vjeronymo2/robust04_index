			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Chin-su from Brussels] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu announced that the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] set the deadline for  North Korea's acceptance of additional nuclear inspections at  mid-May and that just in case North Korea exceeds the deadline,  the IAEA will soon report to the UN Security Council.    Foreign Minister Han, who is in Belgium, said: Although many  experts believe North Korea will accept the additional nuclear  inspections in late April, in early May, or in mid-May, the IAEA  has set the deadline for North Korea's acceptance at around  mid-May.    Foreign Minister Han said: The IAEA has not set a definite  date in mid-May as its deadline for North Korea to accept the  additional inspections, but it will report to the UN Security  Council when it is believed North Korea has exceeded the  deadline. As a result, the North Korean nuclear issue will  again be handled by the UN Security Council, as was the case in  the UN Security Council presidential statement.</p>

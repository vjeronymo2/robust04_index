			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'FUTURE III' REIGNS OVER PRESENT-DAY BOX-OFFICE  </P> <P> In the third installment of the adventures of time-traveling teen Marty McFly,  the pint-size hero -- played by Michael J. Fox -- winds up in the Old West  where he puts his sharp-shooting skills (honed on video games) to use against  villainous varmints.  </P> <P> At the weekend box office, the diminutive hombre also faced a square-off --  against an Apache attack helicopter.  </P> <P> When the dust had settled, McFly -- and Universal Pictures' "Back to the Future  III" -- was left standing.  </P> <P> With ticket sales of nearly $25 million over the four-day Memorial Day Weekend,  the sequel virtually blasted Touchstone Pictures' latest release, "Fire Birds,"  off the screen.  </P> <P> Starring Nicolas Cage, Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Young as chopper pilots hunting  a drug cartel, "Fire Birds" had receipts of about $6.7 million, for fifth place  at the box office.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, "Bird on a Wire" proved it had wings. In its second week, the Mel  Gibson-Goldie Hawn action comedy had ticket sales of an estimated $13 million,  for the No. 2 spot. The Universal Pictures' title, which was largely critically  lambasted, has now grossed about $28 million.  </P> <P> Third place went to Touchstone Pictures' still-formidable "Pretty Woman," which  had receipts of about $8 million. It has now grossed nearly $120 million.  </P> <P> In fourth, fueled by the star-power of Robin Williams, was the Orion Pictures'  comedy, "Cadillac Man," which had ticket sales of about $6.8 million.  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Deadlock on German public sector pay WESTERN GERMANY braced itself for widespread public sector strikes after the authorities yesterday refused to raise their pay offer and trade unions reported growing militancy at strike ballot centres. An indicator of the mood among the 3m public servants came with the announcement that 91 per cent of postal workers had voted to strike. The postal union urged the public not to send letters, warning that collections could not be guaranteed. It also threatened to cripple the network of savings banks controlled by the Bundespost. Rubbish clearance, kindergartens, motorway maintenance and local and regional public transport are also expected to be hit immediately. Emergency services will not be affected. Airport authorities prepared to mobilise staff formally classed as civil servants - and not entitled to strike - to ease expected traffic and passenger bottlenecks. Voting among the main public sector unions ends today and the results, expected to confirm forecasts of a big majority for action, should be known by tomorrow. Stoppages affecting all public services are expected on Monday. For months the authorities have been bombarding the population with charges that Germany is living beyond its means, and that spending cuts at all levels are necessary. In an unusual show of solidarity, the employers' leading negotiators - Mr Rudolf Seiters, the Christian Democrat interior minister, Ms Heide Simonis, an opposition Social Democrat minister from Schleswig-Holstein, and Mr Richard Klein, the SPD chief executive of the Duisburg local authority - called a press conference yesterday at which they flatly refused any advance on their last offer. 'Precisely because we want to avoid conflict, we have gone to the outermost justifiable limits,' Mr Seiters said. The unions had refused to recognise the economic realities of 1992. The 4.8 per cent package, parts of which have already been imposed in some areas, would add DM15bn (Pounds 5bn) to west German public sector spending, he added. The unions are insisting on implementation of a 5.4 per cent deal proposed by an arbitration council last week.</p>

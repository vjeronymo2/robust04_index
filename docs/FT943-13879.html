			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Chinese snub for UK minister over Hong Kong Prospects for a smooth transition to Chinese control of Hong Kong in 1997 dimmed at the weekend when the goodwill visit to Beijing of a UK Foreign Office minister, Mr Alistair Goodlad, ended in debacle. China refused to let Mr Goodlad visit the mainland's top official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Mr Lu Ping, in the third snub to Mr Goodlad during his visit. The visit to Mr Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, would have given the UK an opportunity to suggest new approaches to the long list of technical issues it wants sorted out before the handover - including financing of Hong Kong's new airport and Chinese ratification of a raft of treaties and laws on such matters as air safety and the validity of business contracts. Instead, Mr Goodlad tried to convince Hong Kong journalists that his visit had been 'most useful' and that relevant issues had been discussed thoroughly and courteously with other Chinese officials. After the press conference, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a terse statement suggesting that the meeting was 'not necessary' because of the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's programme of political reform.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer Lydia Mrazova] The parliamentary  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] held talks with the  nonparliamentary Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS] this  morning. [passage omitted]    At a news conference held at midday today, Peter Weiss and  Jaroslav Volf, the chairmen of the two parties, reported on new  elements in the relations between these two parties. Ludmila  Bulakova returned from the news briefing only a few minutes ago.  Good day to you.    [Bulakova] Good day.    [Mrazova] I presume that issues relating to parliamentary  elections and the solution of internal political crisis topped  the agenda, especially because, in the interview broadcast by  Bratislava radio yesterday, SDL Chairman Peter Weiss did not  rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. What do the social  democrats think of it?    [Bulakova] First of all, Jaroslav Volf said that forming a  temporary government would be a risky business. Replying to the  specific question as to what they would think if the SDL joined  Vladimir Meciar's government, Volf said, and I quote, this move  would not promote stabilization in Slovakia and would amount to  a denial of the idea of the government of broad coalition.  [passage omitted]    [Mrazova] According to Pavol Kanis [SDL deputy chairman],  the  SDL is prepared to discuss the date of early elections today.  At the same time, it is not against any date because it wants  the present situation to calm down. But, as is known, Jaroslav  Volf thinks that the elections should be a tool through which  political entities could acquire a definite shape. Because of  this, he thinks that the June date is very questionable. Was  this also discussed?    [Bulakova] As far as this disputed point is concerned, Mr.  Volf said that it was tabled at the talks with the SDL. The two  parties then discussed their positions and felt that a realistic  date for elections is the end of September or the beginning of  October. [passage omitted]    But, to wind it all up, the whole news conference and the  pronouncements made there ended with a statement made by SDL  Chairman Weiss, who said that the SDSS views would be taken into  consideration in the PDL's talks with the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. The SDL described the SDSS as its  strategic partner.    [Mrazova] Let us assume that the HZDS and the SDL will not  reach an agreement today. Will the SDL initiate a dismissal of  the government?    [Bulakova] Peter Weiss's answer to this was that the word  "never" does not exist in politics. One has to consider all of  the available options. One of the options is to form a  reconstituted coalition government of experts. He did not rule  out any of the options, however.</p>

In Pasca in the southeast and in Guasca in the northeast the  Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNGSB]  attacked toll booths, communications antennas, and police  stations. Just hours ago rebels from the 22d Front of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] launched  simultaneous attacks against police stations in Aguaditas and  Pasca and a toll booth in Alto de San Miguel, Cundinamarca. At  2130 [0330 GMT] 40 subversives from the Juan de La Cruz Front  took positions in houses. They shot rockets and hurled grenades  at the Aguaditas police station. For two hours four policemen  faced the attack.    [Begin unidentified policeman recording] They arrived in a  pickup truck and began shooting. Fortunately, my comrades and I  did not panic and were able to face the situation. As you can  see, we came through it without injuries. [end recording]    Meanwhile, another small group of the 22d FARC Front  dynamited the Alto de San Miguel toll booth.    [Begin unidentified employee recording] They arrived at  about 2100 and made us move our personnel away from the  building, where they were collecting the toll payments. Then  they blew up the installations. [end recording]    The authorities also reported that 60 rebels destroyed the  Pasca police station. Seven policemen held off the attackers  for eight hours.</p>

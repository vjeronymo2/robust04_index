They reflect to a certain extent the plans and intentions of the  ministry that I head.    First and most important: The federalization of Russia does  not mean a weakening of the state but the sole possible way of  preserving its unity and integrity. But lest the objective  processes of decentralization bring about the disintegration of  the state, they must be cast in civilized forms of federalism.  Federalism for Russia also means an opportunity to unite the  rich potential of all Russia's regions and the sole possible  form of the democratic organization of society.    Underlying the most essential contradiction of the state  arrangement of Russia is the approach whereby federalism was for  more than 70 years seen solely as a method of solution of the  nationality question. This was both the ideology and the  practice of constitutional development. Of course, it was not  realized in all things but it was this approach that guided our  former constitutional developers, and it was to these criteria  that the internal arrangement of the USSR and the RSFSR  corresponded.    Another form of state arrangement of the Russian Federation,  in which the economic and territorial aspects have emerged in  the "federalism" category, has arisen and has been developing in  the past four years. Federalism has "suddenly" become the mode  of distribution of economic and power authority within the  Russian Federation and also a factor actively influencing the  pace and forms of economic and political reform. Thus the  national model of arrangement of the state and the territorial  model of the arrangement of the state have found themselves in  contradiction.    There is just one way out of this contradiction: We are  condemned to a long transitional period, in the course of which  we will have to find the optimum forms of the interaction of  national aspects of state arrangement and the purely economic  and territorial forms.    It is the ostensibly incomprehensible argument between the  republics and oblasts about the equality of the components of  the Russian Federation that is behind this contradiction of the  two forms of state arrangement of Russia--national and  territorial--which exist simultaneously. The need for  recognition of a transitional period means that the republics,  as national states, will be preserved within the Russian  Federation. The krays and oblasts of the Russian Federation will  enjoy development also (the constitution has equalized in a  legal respect all components of the Russian Federation). We must  pay particular attention, however, to the formulation and  support of new fledgling forms of integration of the components  within the Federation itself.    The first experience in this respect is to hand--it is the  activity of the interregional economic associations. There are  eight of them today, and they encompass, as a whole, the entire  territory of the Russian Federation. Within the framework of  such associations different components of the Russian Federation  interact with one another and tackle specific economic,  transport, and other economic problems, regardless of their  status.    I proceed from the fact that equality does not mean  identity,  and no one, therefore, will succeed in "accommodating" the  entire diversity of the components of the Russian Federation to  some one format. If only because some regions are subsidized and  exist thanks to subventions of the federal budget. And this is  not their fault but a consequence of the location of the  productive forces and the development of the economy throughout  previous years. Other regions are profitable, and not only the  federal budget but also the subsidized regions live thanks to  them. This means that there may be and will be different  approaches in economic strategy and tactics in respect to  different components of the Russian Federation. The new  Constitution of Russia has laid down important principles of the  self-regulation and "self-adjustment" of the Federation. While  having preserved and strengthened the constitutional nature of  Russia, the constitution has at the same time recorded the  possibility of the regulation of processes of the delineation of  authority by the Federal and other treaties.    Part 3 of Article 11 of the constitution, which is devoted  to  these matters, is enshrined in the chapter "Fundamentals of the  Constitutional System" and thus takes precedence over other  provisions of the constitution. Article 78 enshrines the  possibility of the delegation of authority by the federal  structures of power to the level of the components and vice  versa. Articles 73 and 76 enshrine the fullness of power of  components of the Federation in respect to all matters other  than those pertaining to the competence of the Federation and  also the right to independently regulate matters referred to the  competence of the components. In aggregate, the said provisions  represent a basis for use of the mechanisms of "self-adjustment"  within the Russian Federation. It is on these articles that the  treaty that has just been signed with Tatarstan is based.    Debate of the status of the Republic of Tatarstan is not a  subject of the treaty. This is simply not in the treaty. Article  1 of the treaty talks about the format of the delineation of  terms of reference and authority, and then come articles on the  authority of the organs of state power. The treaty is called  "Delineation of the Terms of Reference and Mutual Delegation of  Authority Between Organs of State Power of the Russian  Federation and Organs of State Power of the Republic of  Tatarstan." This treaty was born over the course of three years,  and it contains certain conceptually new provisions which could  and, in my view, should be the subject of scientific analysis.    First, this treaty was born not of a political debate  between  the parties to the treaty but by way of the successive  conclusion of specific agreements. Eleven such agreements were  signed. They regulate individual economic matters, problems of  the delineation of state property, budget and tax relations, and  so forth. Thus the formulas of the main treaty were born of  specific agreements. And following the signing of such a treaty,  the Federation obtains a ready mechanism of its realization in  the form of these agreements. This is undoubtedly a new  approach, which could be applied in many other instances also.    And the second, fundamentally important, fact. The  Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, like the  constitutions of many other republics also, is today in formal  contradiction with the text of the Constitution of the Russian  Federation. According to the Constitution of Russia, no federal  body can abolish, fully or some part thereof, the constitution  of any republic. It might be expected that the republic  authorities would revise their constitution independently, but  this could prove to be an interminable process. The treaty on  the delineation of terms of reference and authority now  represents the sole possibility, therefore, of the removal of  the formal contradictions between the constitutions of the  republics and the federal constitution. Inasmuch as a provision  of the treaty in this case takes precedence over the rules of  law, the format of the delineation of terms of reference and  authority corresponding to the Constitution of the Russian  Federation will take effect.    I have dwelt on this in such detail for the added reason  that  this treaty has "closed" a long three-year period, when neither  the federal constitution nor federal laws in fact operated on  the territory of Tatarstan. None of the efforts of both the  former parliament or the positive efforts of the Constitutional  Court had any real effect in resolving these collisions.    A few words about the political aspects of federalism. They  lie in the plane of an improvement in state power in the Russian  Federation on the basis of the principles of federalism. It is a  question of realization of Article 77 of the Constitution of the  Russian Federation and the draft federal law on the common  principles of organization of representative and executive power  in the components of the Russian Federation. Guarantees of the  fundamentals of the constitutional system and the equality of  the citizens and, primarily, guarantees of their suffrage, the  model of delineation of powers between the executive and  representative authorities, the principle of the electivity of  the heads of administration and the local government  authorities, and certain principles of the delineation of terms  of reference and authority could and should be the subject of  such a law. This would be a considerable step forward in the  development of the political aspects of federalism in Russia.    The economic aspects of federalism are the next important  issue. We can talk for as long as you like about the fact that  Russia must be a full-fledged federation, but as long as the tax  and budget systems remain exclusively unitary, Russia will never  be a federation. The main thing, therefore, is to bring the  budget and tax systems into line with the federative nature of  the state. Each component of the Federation must have its own  sources of revenue in the form of tax receipts into its own  coffers. In addition, the federal fund for support of the  regions must finally begin to function. And the logic of tax  collection must necessarily be revised.    I do not believe that income tax should remain mainly in the  hands of a component of the Russian Federation or a local  government authority but should be a federal tax. Each citizen  should personally and directly do his bit for the cause of the  Federation. Taxes of the VAT type, profits tax, and others, on  the other hand, should be a subject of distribution. A specific  format is being worked up by our ministry. We calculate that it  will be possible to switch to an essentially federal tax and  budget format as of 1995.    Unfortunately, a mass of violations is being perpetrated at  this time on the part of the organs of state power of the  components of the Federation in the economic sphere: nonpayment  of federal taxes, the imposition of internal customs,  restrictions on the free movement of goods and services, and  other obstacles. This is prohibited by the constitution, and the  federal authorities should not only respond appropriately to  such violations but also formulate a new format ensuring the  unity of the economic space of Russia, the unrestricted movement  of goods, services, and people, and the equal legal protection  of citizens of the Russian Federation, wherever they may be on  the territory of Russia. The basis for the economic unity of the  Russian Federation should be such elements of a common  infrastructure as power engineering, transport, communications,  and information science. For the equalization of the regions,  which differ considerably in terms of level of economic  development, it will evidently be necessary to introduce  territorial rent also. There are no other effective sources of  the redistribution of budget and financial resources.    And, finally, national aspects of federalism in Russia. Two  circumstances are distinguished here.    Our paramount task is the prevention of conflicts in the  Russian Federation, which are national in form, and a settlement  of those that already exist. Without attempting a more detailed  analysis here, I shall cite the three main causes of such  conflicts: a recarving of power (the competition or struggle of  old and new political elites in the regions), a recarving of  ownership, and the activity of organized crime.    The national form of a conflict is chosen by their  organizers  as the most "suitable," the one that most disguises the true  aims of the political forces behind these conflicts.  Unfortunately, a new aspect of national conflicts could soon  appear. Conflicts could develop on not just a bilateral basis  (Ossetian-Ingush, Ossetian-Georgian, Georgian-Abkhaz, and so  forth). The Russian population could be involved in them, with  weapon in hand, what is more.    This circumstance would switch the conflicts to an entirely  different phase. In interaction with the authorities of the  regions in the Russian Federation the federal authorities must  avert this danger, therefore.    Further, on the right of nations to self-determination. The  right to self-determination can and should be guaranteed in the  Russian Federation, except merely for one form of such  self-determination, namely, detachment from the Russian  Federation. Formulation of the question of the rights of nations  to self-determination, up to and including the formation of an  independent state and its separation from Russia, would under  the conditions of the Russian state necessarily raise the  question of the form in which the Russian nation might  constitute itself.    If we take the path of a "Russian republic" (and there are  forces interested in this), it needs to be borne in mind that  whereas for Zhirinovskiy a Russian republic means the USSR in  its former dimensions, for other leaders a Russian republic  means the sum total of krays and oblasts of the Russian  Federation less the other autonomous formations.    An attempt to draw the borders of a new Russian republic  would end in these borders running not only across regions but  also across human souls, across our families. This would be an  absolutely hopeless and bloody path. It needs to be recognized  officially that the Russian Federation is the common form of  state self-determination of all peoples and national groups of  the country. In addition, the Russian Federation is the form of  the self-determination of all its citizens, regardless of the  nationality to which they belong. It is the common home within  which there is sufficient room for all forms of  self-organization.    Fundamental importance in the national aspects of federalism  is attached to a revival of the concept of national-cultural  autonomy. And not only and not so much even in the forms in  which they were developed by Bauer and other ideologists. In my  view, there is a possibility of the harmonious unification of  the concept of national-cultural autonomy and a well-developed  concept of local government. This would make it possible to  devise specific organizational forms and realize at local  government level the majority of the current national, economic,  and political rights of all peoples and nationalities of the  Russian Federation.    Concerning Chechnya. A situation where for a very long  period  of time 1.2 million Russian citizens have lived outside of the  protection of the Russian Constitution and legality and where  crime rages and thousands of families have been forced to leave  their homes cannot be tolerated. The federal authorities must  regard a settlement of relations with Chechnya as a priority  problem for preservation of the federative principles of the  Russian state and the development of the Russian Federation  itself.    The position should be, in my view, as follows.    The federal authorities can and should agree to a treaty  delineating terms of reference and authority with the organs of  state power of the Chechen Republic. It is necessary to proceed  here from the fact that the free, voluntary delegation and  distribution of authority is essentially the highest form of  manifestation of sovereignty and independence. But the condition  of the signing of such a treaty must be free elections to the  organs of power of Chechnya with the participation of the  opposition and the participation of the inhabitants of this  republic in elections to the federal parliament.    There is one further dimension to the problem of  federalism--"federalism and the multiparty system." I am  profoundly convinced that Russia can endure and strengthen as a  free state only if two or three major and truly nationwide  political parties, which would be the political pivot of the  federal state, arise in it. It will be very difficult to create  and retain a federative state in Russia by legal and economic  mechanisms alone. "Federalism and the multiparty system"--this  proposition echoes the proposition that the Federation is for  Russia the territorial form of democracy.    In conclusion I would like to emphasize once more that the  rescuing strategy for Russia should be one based on three  propositions--federalism, a socially oriented market economy,  and local government.</p>

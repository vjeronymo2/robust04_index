			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Radical shake-up at TUC agreed Sweeping reforms to the Trades Union Congress were agreed yesterday by the TUC's finance and general purposes committee. They mark the largest shake-up of internal structure for more than 70 years. All the main TUC policy committees are to be abolished from next March. These cover economic policy, European strategy, international affairs, health, education and equal rights. The finance and general purposes committee is to be transformed into a new executive which will meet once a month. The TUC general council is also to be reformed with a reduction in its number of meetings to five a year instead of 12. Outside speakers are to be invited to give presentations to the general council on policy issues.</p>

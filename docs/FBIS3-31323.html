We realize that a NATO  attack on our positions would be an attack by a stronger party  on a much weaker one, but the Serbs have no right to capitulate."    This statement was made yesterday for Radio Kragujevac by  Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of the republic of  Srpska. "Although the Muslims, who rejected the peace plan, are  responsible for the continuation of the war, the Serbs are being  threatened." The only reason for this is that the political  forces that support the Muslims are using the United Nations to  conduct their politics financed by Islamic countries.    On the subject of the continuation of the peace talks in  Geneva, Krajisnik pointed out that it is very difficult to  conduct negotiations under the conditions of threats and  blackmail. Peace should be established as soon as possible;  weapons should be laid down, and all controversial issues should  then be calmly resolved through political negotiations.</p>

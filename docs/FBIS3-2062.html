During its annual conference which ended last Friday, the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) decided to cut  unnecessary research, so as to concentrate on key studies that  "comply with the times.    CASS president Hu Sheng said that priority projects could  only be given the attention they deserved by scrapping some of  the other subjects. And if the cuts weren't made the academy  would find it impossible to break new ground and would lose its  lead in existing studies.    But the readjustment was not a passive move merely caused by  a lack of funds said CASS vice-president Ru Xin. The move was  more of a bid to adapt the academy to the changing demands of a  market economy he said.    The government allocated more than 90 million yuan ($10.3  million) to the 5 000-member academy last year.    And the academy listed more than 700 key research subjects  in  1993 while the 30 or so institutes under CASS listed another 700  said academy research chief He Bingmeng.    But with only 1,600 senior research fellows on the staff,  the  academy was overstretched. The fellows were being overworked,  often having to head several research groups at once.    And when new social and economic problems arose requiring  in-  depth study, the academy was finding it difficult to squeeze  them onto its research agenda.    Such an over-extended programme inevitably affected the  quality of academy studies, He said.    To ensure that the academy's research keeps up with the  times, projects that are outmoded or are relatively difficult to  complete will be dropped.    In addition, the academy will require regular update reports  from its long-term theoretical programmes.    And the humanities will have to look at reality, he said.    For example, the philosophy of history will this year be  replaced by the study of socialist morality and ethics. The  academy also hopes that the institute will strengthen its human  rights studies.    The Institute of Literature will initiate a programme on  contemporary humanism, while the Institute of Modern History is  embarking on a history of modern Chinese civilization in the  hope of cultivating patriotism, he said .  <H5>  Forecast </H5>   The director said the academy has decided to select 60 to 70  key subjects this year. These include annual analyses of  economic, social and international affairs, the impact of  foreign-funded businesses upon China, and Asia-Pacific regional  economic and political trends.    CASS has also established a Research Centre on Socialism  with  Chinese Characteristics headed by Wang Renzhi, former director  of the Party's Central Propaganda Department and now  vice-president of the academy.    In addition, the academy is experimenting with a bidding  system that will tender out some of the larger research projects.    Successful bidders will be granted a modicum of financial  autonomy: they will take responsibility for keeping within  budget and in return will receive bonuses if their research is  conducted well.    The research on modern Chinese humanism is likely to be  tendered out, he said.    And CASS will widen academic co-operation with its foreign  counterparts, according to the director. At the moment  Sino-foreign joint projects are relatively few and far between.    Last year, CASS published a record-breaking 464 books. It  also published 3,532 academic papers, 532 research reports, 157  translations of foreign publications and 144 dictionaries.    Two studies in particular won great acclaim from Chinese  leaders and fellow scholars. They were "The Macro Guidelines,  Principles and Framework of the Socialist Market Economy,"  edited by former CASS vice president Liu Guoguang, and  "Theoretical Research and Suggestions on Establishing a Legal  System for the Socialist Market Economy," written by the  Institute of Law.    Two other projects also were highly commended: The research  on contemporary capitalism, which was assigned to the academy by  Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and conducted by the  Institute of International Economics and Politics; and the  Institute of Economics study of the history of Chinese  capitalism.  <H5>  Invention </H5>   The Institute of Rural Development examined the developing  non- agricultural sector in the countryside--the share-based  co-operative businesses,which many agricultural experts consider  the third wave of Chinese rural development.    The Institute of Philosophy completed a project on human  rights last year.    Also, researchers from the Institute of Quantitative and  Technical Economics, headed by Liu Guoguang, last year wrapped  up an economic development strategy for the Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone (SEZ). This report, conducted at the request of  the Shenzhen government, outlines the future of the other four  SEZs in China.</p>

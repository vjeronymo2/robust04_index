			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Emphasis on Russian inflation misplaced Sir, As an economist and business analyst I spent a large proportion of 1992 and 1993 in Russia examining business opportunities. In April this year I was asked by a major international bank to return to Russia and undertake a detailed examination of a Russian regional bank. The Russian bank was a well-run commercial entity, but there were two significant problems in analysing its financial position and its general business operations. The first was inflation which had rendered much of the accounting information almost meaningless. The other was the bank's poor and doubtful debt position, partly inherited from its days as part of a larger state-owned bank, which was barely provisioned for. Of these two problems, inflation was by far the easiest to account for. In considering the future of this bank and its suitability for foreign equity investment, I was more concerned about the ability of the bank's clients to keep producing and selling goods and thus service the debt. The clients' position echoed my experience in 1993 when I investigated the possibility of investing in a Russian wool mill, supplying it with wool and selling the resultant fabric in Russia. Inflation made estimation of production costs and selling prices difficult. However, it was not inflation that ultimately prevented the project from going ahead, but the potential foreign investors' fears that the weakening economy would mean insufficient demand for the fabric. In my experience, the preoccupation of such institutions as the IMF and of many Russian officials with reducing inflation is misplaced. The inability of Russian enterprises to pay their debts and keep producing is the greatest risk to the economy, the reform process and foreign investment.

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EMBASSY'S WATER, POWER CUT OFF BY IRAQ;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: TROOPS KEEP PRESSURE ON KUWAIT COMPOUND. ALLIED SHIPS ARE PREPARED  TO USE FORCE TO CARRY OUT THE U.N. RESOLUTION ON EMBARGO.  </P> <P> Iraqi forces cut off power and water to the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait  Saturday as U.S. and allied navies in the region readied their guns to enforce  a new U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force to block all shipping to and  from Iraq.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the embassy's electricity was severed about 1:15 a.m. PDT  and water was shut off sometime later. Telephone service was sporadic, but  embassy officials continued to maintain some contact with the estimated 2,500  Americans trapped in Kuwait.  </P> <P> About a dozen armed Iraqi troops who took up positions around the U.S. Embassy  compound Friday were blocking entry and exit from the buildings but had not  attempted to enter the grounds, the State Department said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the embassy was operating on a single gasoline-powered  generator that provided only limited cooling power. "It leaves us hot and dry,"  one official said. The officials said they did not know how long the gasoline  would last or the extent of the embassy's water reserves.  </P> <P> A source involved in managing the crisis said the Iraqis had shut off only one  of two water mains that supply the building. But the remaining water main  spewed out dirty, sludge-filled water, and the Americans had to turn it off  themselves, the source said.  </P> <P> Despite Iraq's provocative actions at the embassy in Kuwait, the Bush  Administration appeared content with passage early Saturday of the historic  U.N. resolution for which the United States had lobbied heavily for a week.  Neither the White House nor the Pentagon indulged in the kind of belligerent  language that has marked Administration statements of recent days.  </P> <P> In the Persian Gulf, the northern Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, U.S. Navy  vessels and ships from several other nations continued to shadow about a dozen  Iraqi commercial ships, prepared to halt them by force if they attempt to  unload their cargo.  </P> <P> Pentagon sources said two Iraqi oil tankers were being watched particularly  closely because they were nearing ports but noted that no action to interdict  them was likely until late today at the earliest.  </P> <P> The warships were operating under a new mandate from the U.N. Security Council,  which overwhelmingly authorized the use of military force to back up a stiff  trade embargo levied on Iraq in the wake of its military takeover of Kuwait on  Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The resolution permits "measures commensurate to the specific circumstances . .  . to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping."  </P> <P> The resolution made no mention of air traffic. U.S. officials said Friday that  some military supplies and other goods continued to arrive in Iraq from Libya  and unspecified other nations, but that no military action would be taken to  interdict the air shipments.  </P> <P> U.S. military officials said no new orders had been issued to naval commanders  in the region as a result of the U.N. action. Rules of engagement for U.S.  warships issued earlier allow progressive enforcement measures, beginning with  radio warnings and ending with sinking a suspect ship if the U.N. embargo is  violated.  </P> <P> National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, in a television interview, declined  to detail rules governing the use of force to halt shipping. He said only that  American vessels will use "the minimum amount of interference with traffic in  order to make the sanctions effective."  </P> <P> The Security Council action provided further international justification for  measures the United States was prepared to take unilaterally, Administration  officials said.  </P> <P> Among those nations with military vessels in the region or on the way are  Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Australia, Spain and  several Persian Gulf states.  </P> <P> U.S. Navy officials are trying to establish cooperative relationships with the  other naval powers, both to avoid accidents and to give any enforcement action  a clear international cast.  </P> <P> "It's not a multinational force in the formal sense. There's no central command  structure," one senior Pentagon official said. "It's cooperative, but I can't  say now exactly how that will play out in practice."  </P> <P> Naval commanders in the region are working out informal zones of  responsibility, as they did during the tanker escort operation in the gulf in  1988, Navy officials said.  </P> <P> The Pentagon announced that planes from the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing were  being deployed to Saudi Arabia from their base at Lakenheath in Britain. The  wing flies F-111 aircraft, long-range bombers that were used in the 1986 U.S.  raid on Libya.  </P> <P> In Washington, Iraq 's ambassador said the wives and children of American  diplomats who fled Kuwait to Baghdad will be allowed to leave Iraq, but the  diplomats will be kept as hostages.  </P> <P> Administration officials protested the action as another example of Iraqi  duplicity. Baghdad had promised that the 100 U.S. Embassy personnel, Marine  guards and dependents who left the embassy in Kuwait on Thursday would be  allowed to leave Iraq through Jordan or Turkey.  </P> <P> Summoned to the State Department for another U.S. protest, Iraqi Ambassador  Mohammed Mashat told reporters, "We are on the brink of a catastrophe. . . .  American lives are being risked for no reason whatsoever."  </P> <P> The Iraqi diplomat said "we are not going to use force" against the U.S.  Embassy in Kuwait, where Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and a staff of about 10  defied Iraqi orders to shut down by Friday.  </P> <P> "We haven't touched any embassy there," the Iraqi said at an impromptu news  conference at the State Department after a brief session with David Mack, a  deputy assistant secretary of state who had called him in.  </P> <P> In his televised interview, Scowcroft said that seizing the U.S. and other  embassies was "very counterproductive." He warned Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein to "refrain from any action against" the Americans and other foreigners  held in Kuwait and Iraq.  </P> <P> Scowcroft added that while Bush is deeply concerned about the fate of the  estimated 3,000 Americans trapped in the two countries, the President would not  alter his policy solely to save their lives.  </P> <P> "That will not be the case," Scowcroft said. "The hostages are on the  President's mind constantly, and (in) everything we do, we will think about the  hostages. They will not divert us, however, from our strategy."  </P> <P> The Voice of America radio service advised the 2,500 Americans trapped in  Kuwait not to go near the embassy while the Iraqi soldiers remained, even  though there appeared to be no attempt to take over the compound.  </P> <P> The State Department broadcast on VOA said the embassy was "determined to  continue working for your release from Kuwait and your safe return to your  families."  </P> <P> In an apparent effort to flush out Americans and other foreign nationals who  may be in hiding, Iraq threatened to hang anyone caught providing shelter for  foreigners in either Iraq or Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Anyone who shelters a foreigner with the aim of hiding him from the  authorities will be committing a crime of espionage," the Iraqi government said  in a radio broadcast monitored by Reuters. "He will be hanged for such a  crime."  </P> <P> Following a marathon U.N. session that ended after 4 a.m., U.S. Ambassador  Thomas R. Pickering called the vote "one of the most important decisions in its  history."  </P> <P> "Iraq has evaded resolutions of the Security Council and thumbed its nose at  all humanity," Pickering said. "This is not an act of war, but an enforcement  of sanctions which have been flagrantly violated."  </P> <P> The five permanent Security Council members are the United States, the Soviet  Union, Britain, China, and France. The 10 other current members are Canada,  Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and  Zaire.  </P> <P> Yemen and Cuba were the only countries that abstained from the Security Council  vote. Yemen's ambassador, Abdallah Saleh Ashtal, warned that any military  action backing the sanctions might lead to war.  </P> <P> Yemen, meanwhile, said it was fully complying with the U.N. embargo and would  refuse to allow Iraqi tankers to unload oil at its terminal. At least one Iraqi  oil carrier, the Khanaqin, is anchored off the Yemeni port of Aden, having been  denied permission to discharge its cargo.  </P> <P> The White House said the Security Council vote "further strengthens the world  resolve to force Iraq out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "The resolve of the international community is strong. The vote exhibits the  commitment of the world to act effectively to achieve the complete, immediate  and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait," White House spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Anbari, immediately denounced the Security  Council vote and said it could lead to war.  </P> <P> "This use of force by the United States or any of its allies or puppets will  lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will burn all in their path,"  he said at the United Nations in New York.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Douglas Jehl contributed to this report.  </P> <P> Related STORIES: A6-15, A18, A20, A22-24  </P></p>

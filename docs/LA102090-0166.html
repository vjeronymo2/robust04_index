			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Judge Lets P.I.E. Use Cash: A federal bankruptcy judge in Jacksonville, Fla.,  said Olympia Holdings Inc. could use $24.4 million in cash from accounts  receivable to fund its P.I.E. International trucking unit. The cash infusion  won't prevent cutbacks at the unit, which plans to lay off 20% of its 7,500  workers and close 22% of its 230 terminals as a result of parent Olympia's  Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. P.I.E. also plans a 30% reduction in annual sales  to $350 million. P.I.E.'s sister company, Los Angeles-based Transcon Lines, is  in Chapter 7 liquidation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcement by Vyacheslav Chornovil, member of the </F> presidium of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, chairing a session  of the Supreme Council in Kiev -- live]    [Text] In connection with examining the credentials  commission's submission [concerning the powers of seven  parliamentary deputies] a certain change has taken place in  respect of the validity of decisions being made by us. As a  result, the Supreme Council is legally qualified to pass a  decision, if 224 deputies are present at the session, rather  than 226 as was the case previously. Then ...[pauses] but more  than half its constitutional list, which is 226. [sentence as  heard]    A decision is now passed by a majority of 169 out of the  number of people's deputies whose powers are recognized. It was  170 earlier. As for amendments to the Constitution, there  remains the same norm as before, which is 300.    Decisions on the inclusion of issues on the agenda are  passed  by a majority of one third of the number of people's deputies,  which now is 112. So these norms have been slightly reduced.</p>

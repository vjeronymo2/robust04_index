It may include, but is not limited to, data on costs of services furnished to individual enrollees, documenting the volume and intensity of services required by the Medicare enrollees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consequences of failure to provide required information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the HMO or CMP fails to submit the information requested by HCFA, the HMO or CMP forgoes the option of seeking additional payments, and is subject to the final adjustment procedures of &sect;417.576(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination and notice of determination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the HMO or CMP submits the information requested by HCFA, HCFA considers that information, determines whether the HMO or CMP meets the conditions for additional payments, and gives the HMO or CMP notice of that determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response to notice of adverse determination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) If HCFA's determination under paragraph (a)(7) of this section does not provide for additional payments, or provides for them in amounts that the HMO or CMP considers to be less than the special needs of its Medicare enrollees justify, the HMO or CMP may submit additional materials to support its position that its costs in excess of the presumptive limit are the result of one of the circumstances specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, or that the special needs specified in that paragraph justify larger additional payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The HMO or CMP must submit the additional materials within 60 days of receipt of the notice of adverse determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Verification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All information submitted by HMOs and CMPs seeking additional payments is subject to verification by HCFA or its authorized representatives. HCFA may seek verification from sources such as Medicare intermediaries or carriers and State and local agencies. For example, the local chapter of the American Red Cross might be able to confirm the impact of a natural disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination and notice of final overclaim.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA determines whether there is a final overclaim and gives the HMO or CMP written notice of that determination as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) After the notice of presumptive overclaim, if the HMO or CMP does not timely submit required information under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) After a notice of adverse determination under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, if the HMO or CMP does not submit additional justification under paragraph (b)(8) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

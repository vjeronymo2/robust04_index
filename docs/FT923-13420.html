			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Reservations over future of UK hotel group: Analysts are split over Forte's direction / Analysis of the on-and-off love affair Has the City fallen out of love with Forte? Until recently, whatever the economic circumstances and the hotel and restaurant group's performance, investors listened carefully to Forte's plans and held on to its shares. When, last April, the group announced 1991 pre-tax profits down 62 per cent to Pounds 73m, along with a maintained but uncovered dividend, the shares rose slightly. In the words of one institutional investor: 'No one ever got fired for buying Forte.' In the last few months, however, Forte's shares have dropped sharply relative to the market. After out-performing the FT-SE 100 index over the first four months of this year, Forte's relative share price has since fallen more than 25 per cent. It has shown a similar decline against the recession-hit leisure sector, which it had consistently outperformed over several years. Since the beginning of this month alone, the shares have fallen 29p to 170p, representing 15 per cent of their value. 'The market seems to have lost its patience,' says one analyst. Some doubted Forte's wisdom when it said in May that it had decided to sell its contract catering business to the Compass Group of the UK and ARA Services of the US. When the proposed sale fell through earlier this month, another question was asked. Did the failure of the transaction indicate that Mr Rocco Forte, the group's 47-year-old chief executive, could not act without the say-so of his father, Lord Forte, the company's octogenarian founder and current chairman? Mr Forte takes this suggestion calmly, dismissing it as 'a little bit of mischievous nonsense'. He can probably afford to do so. Discussion of the market's disenchantment with Forte should not be overdone. The shares have done no more than keep pace with analysts' revisions of Forte's prospects. A few months ago the City had been expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 140m for the current year. The group is now expected to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 90m. With 1992 earnings per share expected to be 7p, the company's prospective price-earnings ratio is still a hugely-expensive 24.3. 'It's still a blue-eyed stock,' says Mr Peter Joseph of Smith New Court. Several large institutional shareholders appear to be sticking with Forte and are unperturbed by the collapse of the contract catering sale. 'The fact that they can afford to walk away from the deal shows that they were not going to be messed around,' says a manager with one long-time holder of the shares. Forte says it still wants to sell its contract catering arm, allowing it to concentrate on running hotels and restaurants and expanding on the Continent. Some followers of the company believe this is a mistake. The contract catering business has withstood the recession better than any of Forte's other activities. While hotel trading profits fell 53 per cent to Pounds 75m last year and those from restaurants dropped 15 per cent to Pounds 63m, contract catering profits rose 18 per cent to Pounds 47m. Mr Forte argues that this is insufficient reason to hold on to the business. 'The idea that it has served us well in the recession is true, but it's such a small proportion of our total results that it doesn't have that big an impact,' he says. Contract catering, he argues, does not fit in well with the rest of Forte's activities. 'It has a very different customer base. In contract catering, we're actually not dealing directly with the consumers. We're dealing with a client. To a great degree we're in the hands of the client in terms of what we can deliver.' Mr Forte accepts that the failure of the deal is not good for the morale of the managers, staff and customers of the business. On the other hand, a sale to Compass and ARA would have meant splitting up the business between them to comply with UK monopoly requirements. Managers had objected to that. Mr Forte will now look for buyers who will keep the division together. He would like to find a buyer for Gardner Merchant, which provides canteen meals. He has different plans for Forte Airport Services, which provides in-flight catering for airlines. When market conditions improve, he would like to see this business floated, with Forte retaining a stake. The sale of Gardner Merchant would allow Forte to cut costs substantially. Mr Forte says the group last year reduced fixed and variable costs by Pounds 63m, but that the tenacity of the UK recession has encouraged it to go further. 'We're looking at costs from head office down to unit level. We're looking at whether there's a different way to run things. In our previous approach we maintained our existing structure,' he explains. He will not give details, but it is clear that the group is looking at the usefulness of having headquarters for each of its businesses. Reducing the role of divisional headquarters would inevitably focus greater attention on Forte's group leadership and on Mr Forte himself. It is not true, he says, as some newspaper reports have suggested, that the contract catering deal fell through because of his indecisiveness. Compass, he says, was not the ideal buyer because its existing UK catering interests meant the business would have had to be split up. But when Compass and ARA offered Pounds 560m, Forte felt duty bound to consider it. When Compass and ARA dropped their offer price, Forte felt it had to walk away. Company insiders say the decision to end negotiations was taken by the entire board. Lord Forte was not at the meeting because he had broken his ankle, and although Mr Rocco Forte asks his father for advice, insiders say Lord Forte is too old to play a dominant role. Because Mr Forte is the quietly-spoken son of a charismatic founder, the company realises the whispering about his competence will probably continue. There is little he can do except pursue his strategy of looking for expansion opportunities on the Continent. 'Poor old Rocco is trapped,' says one City analyst. 'If things go well, it's because of the company his father built up. If they go badly, it's because Rocco cocked it up.'</p>

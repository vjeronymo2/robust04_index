			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Securities houses get Taiwan's approval Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to announce final approval today on applications by eight foreign securities houses to establish branches on the island as part of a broader deregulation of the securities industry. The SEC yesterday said Japan's big four securities firms (Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko), Britain's Baring Securities and SG Warburg, WI Carr (the broking arm of Banque Indo-Suez of France), and Goldman Sachs of the US, were qualified to upgrade their representative offices to branches. Until now, Merrill Lynch has been the only foreign brokerage permitted to have a branch in Taiwan, allowing it to engage in a wider range of business activities than those houses limited to representative offices. The Taiwanese government, which has itself had a vested corporate interest in a closed market, now suggests it would like to develop the island as a regional financial centre. Liberalisation of the financial industry, long closed to foreign institutions, is also part of Taiwan's campaign to gain admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. SG Warburg said last night it was 'delighted' at the decision, which had followed its application for a branch office licence earlier this summer. Taiwan last year eased the capitalisation rules for foreign brokerages to set up a branch on the island, lowering the minimum capitalisation from TDollars 200m to TDollars 100m (Dollars 7.5m to Dollars 3.78m). However foreign brokers are still required to have operated a representative office for a year before they can apply to set up a branch. The government also said that, in the longer term, banks would be able to expand their activities by underwriting commercial paper. Banks are currently banned from underwriting commercial paper.</p>

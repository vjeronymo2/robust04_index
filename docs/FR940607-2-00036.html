The new designated method is identified as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> EQL&hyph;0694&hyph;096, ``Determination of Lead Concentration in Ambient Particulate Matter by Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Optical Emission spectrometry (State of West Virginia).'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant's request for an equivalent method determination for the above method was received on March 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This method has been tested by the applicant, the State of West Virginia, in accordance with the test procedures prescribed in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests, EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this method should be designated as an equivalent method. The information submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This method uses the sampling procedure specified in the reference method for the determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collected from ambient air (43 FR 46258). Lead in the particulate matter is solubilized by extraction with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, facilitated by heat and ultrasonication. The lead content of the sample is analyzed by a Thermo Jarrel Ash AtomScan 16 inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometer using the 220.3 nm lead emission line and instrument conditions optimized by the user laboratory. Technical questions concerning the method should be directed to the State of West Virginia, Department of Commerce, Labor and Environmental Resources, Division of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality, 1558 Washington Street East, Charleston, West Virginia 25311&hyph;2599. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use by states and other control agencies under requirements of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must be used in strict accordance with the procedures and specifications provided in the method description. States or other agencies using inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometric methods that employ procedures and specifications significantly different from those in this method must seek approval for their particular method under the provisions of &sect;2.8 of Appendix C to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modification of Methods by Users) or may seek designation of such methods as equivalent methods under the provisions of 40 CFR part 53. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information concerning this action may be obtained from Frank F.

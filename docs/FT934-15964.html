			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Peugeot slumps to FFr1.1bn loss PEUGEOT-CITROEN plunged into a net loss of FFr1.12bn (Dollars 193m) in the first half of this year, the French car group announced yesterday. It said there was no sign of a pick-up in demand. The first-half loss compared with a FFr2.3bn net profit in the first six months of 1992, and a total 3.37bn profit last year. The car group blamed the sharp deterioration on the 17.3 per cent drop in west European car demand in the first half of this year and the effects of currency devaluations in Britain, Italy and Spain. The adverse effect of currency variations between the first halves of last year and of this year amounted to FFr1.28bn, Without this factor, the results would have showed a slight profit, the group claimed. Forecasting an industry decline of 16 per cent in sales in Europe this year, Peugeot-Citroen said it would 'significantly' reduce output in the remaining months of this year by short-time working and more permanent redundancies 'which it is no longer possible to delay further'. The group. headed by Mr Jacques Calvet, has long criticised the European Commission for giving Japanese car makers too free a run in the European market. Yesterday's statement complained that the Japanese had increased by nearly one percentage point their share of the European market. However, the group noted it had maintained its 11.9 per cent portion of the overall west European market in the first half, gaining market share in the individual UK and German markets. It pinned hopes on the newly-launched Peugeot 306 and the Citroen Xantia. Group turnover fell by 11.4 per cent in the first half, less than the general industry decline. The company said the decline was only 7.1 per cent if the effects of currency devaluations, reducing the return in franc terms of UK, Italian and Spanish sales, were factored out. The downturn caused a deterioration in the group's cash flow to FFr5bn in the first half of this year from FFr7.8bn in the same period of 1992. But this enabled the group to cover 83 per cent of its FFr6bn investment in plant and equipment in the first six months of this year, with net financial debt standing at FFr17.5bn at June 30, 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dnevnik 2 editorial commentary] </F>   [Text] The railroad, Serbian Electricity Board, Kolubara  coal mines, and Belgrade Public Transport Company strikes came  and went. What they left behind is the enormous damage done to  the state and the citizens. They left behind the bitter  realization that the organizers of the strikes did not show the  least bit of solidarity with the citizens. The strikes took  place -- what a coincidence -- on the eve of the New Year  holidays, at a time when new threats by world powers started  coming in, at a time of terrible and criminal sanctions imposed  by order of the same world powers.    It is not a coincidence that the strikes were organized in  enterprises of vital significance to the state and nation. The  railroad, electricity board, coal mines, and public  transportation are all state and national property. Therefore,  they are not somebody's inheritance to be played with, even less  to be used to blackmail both the state and the citizens. The  members of the leaderships of the independent trade unions  should be aware of this. They bear the greatest share of  responsibility for the initiation and consequences of the  strikes. Their sponsors are fully aware of this.    Those who issued the orders have, for the time being,  remained behind the scenes. However, it is known that, for  example, the Soros Foundation is significantly aiding the  activities of some of the independent trade unions. This is  precisely the foundation whose founder put his signature on the  petition calling for the bombing of Belgrade. The strikes are  sponsored by those who wish to destroy the Serbian people.    At the same time, the West was gloating over these pre-New  Year events. Radio's Voice of America was ominously forecasting  chaos in Serbia. Certain West European newspapers and certain  domestic, so-called independent media were not far behind. They  did not meet with success. The state reacted, and what is most  important, the citizens -- although overwhelmed by great  dissatisfaction and anger -- knew what the real background to  the strikes was. The organizers also sensed this.    The County Public Prosecutor's Office qualified the strike  in  the Kolubara coal mines as attempted sabotage. However, we have  to say that some of the responsible authorities did not react  adequately, although there could be no doubt that someone was  trying to sabotage and paralyze public life in Serbia. For the  sake of truth it needs to be stated that the Kolubara miners --  and miners in other mines -- and the railroad and electricity  board employees are not in a favorable position. However, they  are in no worse a situation than the great majority of citizens.  On the contrary, they have the largest salaries, and what's  more, they do not hide this fact.    This is precisely the reason -- and responsibility -- that  those employed in public companies, particularly at a time of  crippling effects of sanctions imposed by the world powers,  should exhibit more, much more solidarity with the citizens, who  rightly expect them and the state to regularly supply them with  electricity and coal, and to secure regular and safe railroad  and bus transportation. The times call for solidarity, not  pig-headedness.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: Not so certain an impact on competitive tendering Sir, You concluded ('Court blow to contracting-out', March 25) that the recent decision that the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations apply to the contracting-out of prison education services is likely to have a major impact on the rest of the government's market testing and competitive tendering programme. Of course every case can be distinguished on its particular facts, but the nature of the transfer from the Home Office prison education service to South Manchester College, two separate parts of the public sector, is very much within the scope of the transfer regulations even within the terms of the government's guidance. It is easy to read too much from the European Court judgment in Rask, which you cite. This turned on the specific facts that the incoming contractor had bound himself to employ the same staff on the same terms and conditions, thus effectively making the regulations apply. It by no means implies that all cases of contracting out will be similarly decided; indeed, I would be surprised if this transpires. Our member companies are continuing to defend cases brought under the regulations. In general, UK industrial tribunals are continuing to rule that in simple contracting-out cases, where there is no agreement to transfer staff, premises or equipment, and where the contractor reorganises the service, Tupe does not apply.

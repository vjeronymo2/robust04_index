			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEFILE  </P> <P> Martin Landau plays a painter frustrated by his inability to create an inspired  work of art in Christara Pictures' "The Color of Evening." Tamara Lynn Roth and  Hesper Anderson's screenplay is based on a novel by Robert Nathan (whose  "Portrait of Jenny" and "The Bishop's Wife" were turned into films in the  '40s). Writer-producer Stephen Thomas Stafford rolls cameras in Southern  California July 16.  </P> <P> Apollonia will star opposite martial artist Larry Tatum as an undercover agent  in Red Rock Productions' "Thunder and Lightning," a spy thriller with a martial  arts setting. Debra Thornton and Audrey Meadows co-star for producer Jan  Leonard and director John Stewart. Production begins Sept. 20 in Baja  California, Mexico, and L.A.  </P> <P> Lisa Pelikan will play the only adult role in Columbia's "Return to the Blue  Lagoon," which is getting under way in Fiji. She plays a young mother, who is  put to sea with her infant daughter and the surviving male child from the  previous film when cholera breaks out on the rescue ship. Milla Jovovich, a  Russian-born model, and Brian Krause will play the two young people stranded on  an uncharted island in a film that sounds more like a remake than a sequel.  William A. Graham will direct the Leslie Stevens screenplay for Price  Entertainment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Christopher Atkins, who co-starred with Brooke Shields in the  original "Blue Lagoon," has written his first feature script, "Fire, Ice and My  Wife," which he'll star in for Florida-based Quest Studios. The film is  described as a light-hearted look at today's romantic relationships.  Producer-director Hugh Parks launches production in August in Florida.  </P> <P> Collin Bernsen, younger brother of Corbin and son of Jeanne Cooper, who has  appeared in the day-time soap "The Young and the Restless" for 17 years, joins  the cast of "Hangfire," currently filming in the L.A. area. The film, which  also stars Brad Davis, Kim Delaney, George Kennedy, Jan-Michael Vincent, Lyle  Alzado and Lou Ferrigno, is being directed by Peter Maris and produced by Brad  Krevoy and Steven Stabler for the Motion Picture Corp. of America.  </P> <P> David Rasche and Joseph Mahar join Sheryl Lee Ralph and Glenn Plummer in  Hollywood Pictures' "Randall &amp; Juliet" (expect a title change) as  back-stabbing corporate executives. However, Richard Dreyfuss left the picture  last week, citing "creative differences." His departure will force  writer-director Coline Serreau and producer Laurence Marks to postpone the July  9 start date for the Buena Vista release while they cast a new male lead. The  film will probably go in September.  </P> <P> Finally, honors for the best movie title of the week go to writer-director  Philippe Mora's "Pterodactyl Woman From Brentwood." Brion James and John Dennis  Johnston will star in this satire of Brentwood Yuppie life. The title role is  still uncast. Mora and his co-producer Michael Duffy will launch production in  late September for the Really Unbelievable Picture Co. in -- where else? --  Brentwood. KIRK HONEYCUTT  </P></p>

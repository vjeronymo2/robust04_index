			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen </F> at the Knesset -- live]    [Excerpt] [Announcer] Jacques Neriya, the prime  minister's political adviser, has leveled criticism at what he  terms picking on trivial details and at the government's being  swayed by the right wing. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el  Rosen is at the Knesset. Good evening 'Imanu'el. What is the  meaning of the Israeli threat to defer the negotiations? Is it  not a fact that the Gaza and Jericho autonomy are not going to  be deferred?    [Rosen] Since it is obvious to everyone that the Gaza and  Jericho agreement cannot be taken back to square one, Israel is  threatening with whatever it can. But since no date has been set  for the next stage of the negotiations, the so-called early  empowerment [preceding two words in English] in the West Bank,  the threat is not too critical or daunting.    Tonight we heard Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's  political adviser, utter some very intriguing criticism, which  can be interpreted as criticism of the prime minister himself.  Neriya told us tonight: They are picking on trivial things;  you cannot expect 'Arafat to reiterate his commitment every day;  everyone is aware of the importance of the spoken word in the  Arab world. Neriya further said: They are being swept by  public trends, perhaps even by the right wing. [passage omitted]</p>

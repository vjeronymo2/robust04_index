			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Zhirinovsky in dispute over 'Jewish' origins Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky emerged triumphant from a weekend congress of his ultra-nationalist, anti-Semitic Liberal Democratic party only to deny fresh evidence that he is concealing a Jewish background from his voters. Mr Zhirinovsky was officially appointed the presidential candidate of his party at the congress, attended by guests including General Vladimir Sterligov, a far-right former KGB general, and Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the former Soviet speaker accused of masterminding the 1991 coup but recently granted an amnesty by the Russian parliament. Their presence suggested that Mr Zhirinovsky is already preparing to enlist support in the 1996 presidential election from other ultra-nationalist parties and from the communists. However, just a few days after gaining blanket powers to run a party which is basically a one-man show and would collapse without him, Mr Zhirinovsky was engaged in damage control against new evidence that he is of part-Jewish ancestry, despite his assertions to the contrary. Film shot by CNN of his personal records in the archives of Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, the former Soviet republic where he was born, suggested he changed his name from Edelstein at the age of 18. The CNN report said his mother's first husband, whose surname was Zhirinovsky, died 20 months before he was born, while the marriage certificate to her second husband, Wolf Isakovich Edelstein, gave his nationality as Jewish. His mother's document show her nationality as Russian. CNN also filmed an archive official saying she had refused a Dollars 100 bribe to help unknown visitors take away the documents last month. If widely publicised and believed inside Russia, the news would deal a death-blow to Mr Zhirinovsky's presidential hopes given the anti-Semitism of much of his constituency and of Russia's political establishment in general. If he manages, however, to persuade the Russian public that the report is part of a plot against him, especially one prepared and delivered by foreigners, it could play to his advantage. Confronted with the records, Mr Zhirinovsky told CNN they were 'prepared by the Turkish secret service'.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Pakistan fends off militants THE Pakistan army yesterday stopped Moslem militants crossing the ceasefire line in the disputed state of Kashmir, averting a flare-up in which Indian and Pakistan defence forces could have been involved. Members of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) came as close as 1 km to some parts of the ceasefire line in their threatened attempt to cross it yesterday, but most were prevented from getting anywhere near. Observers from the Indian side of the line saw small groups of JKLF volunteers pushed back at many points, and officials in New Delhi reported no one had got across. There were reports that the JKLF would make another attempt today but Indian officials do not take these seriously. This is because Pakistan has conveyed to the Indian government that no crossing would be permitted. Commanders of the two armies were in constant touch with each other to ensure that any attempt at crossing the line did not escalate. Mr SB Chavan, Indian minister for home affairs, expressed his satisfaction at the turn of events, including Pakistan's 'positive approach' in preventing the militants crossing.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Royal Trust chief executive to quit MR Michael Cornelissen is stepping down after nine turbulent years as chief executive of Royal Trust, the Canadian financial institution controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family. The company, which is Canada's second biggest trust company with operations in Europe and the US, said yesterday that Mr Cornelissen, 49, will leave his post before its annual meeting next April. He plans to move from Toronto to Vancouver. A successor will be appointed later. Mr Cornelissen, a hard-driving South African-born accountant, has been chief executive since August 1983. After spectacular growth in Europe and the US under his stewardship during the 1980s, Royal Trust has recently suffered large loan losses and has been forced to pull in its horns. Its US subsidiary, Seattle-based Pacific First Bank, is being sold. The company yesterday heaped praise on Mr Cornelissen. He is widely credited with breathing new vigour into Royal Trust, which had a reputation for stodginess before it was taken over by the Bronfmans in the early 1980s. But questions have been raised in recent years about Mr Cornelissen's aggressive management style during a period of slower growth and retrenchment. His two major international acquisitions, of Dow Chemical's financial services arm in 1986, and of a string of US savings and loan institutions in 1989/90, have turned out to be costly mistakes.</p>

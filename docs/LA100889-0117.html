Just visit Scandinavia and see for  yourself, as this recent tourist can confirm. In Finland and Sweden, it's the  law to drive with lights on both day and night. In fact, new cars contain a  device that automatically turns on the lights when the engine starts up.  </P> <P> MIKE WELDS  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

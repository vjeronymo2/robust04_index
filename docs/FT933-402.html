			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / A walk on the wild side: What J P Morgan can gain from a tie-up with a controversial Spanish bank Two huddles are gathered outside the large, ornate office of Mr Mario Conde, chairman of Spain's fourth-largest bank. In one are the relaxed doormen employed by Mr Conde's Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto). In the other are the jet-lagged executives of J P Morgan, the US corporate bank. They have also been hired by Banesto to open doors - in their case, to international capital markets. They are working on a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue, planned for next month. J P Morgan and Banesto have virtually nothing in common apart from being banks. The former is an august corporate bank that alone among its US peers has retained the top AAA assessment of creditworthiness from rating agencies despite a 20-year squeeze on margins in its old lending business. The other is a 2,300-branch retail bank whose poorer credit rating has just been put down a notch because of bad lending in the 1980s. It remains enmeshed in a holding company with stakes in industries from cement-making to wine production. But Banesto's relationship with Morgan has transformed its image among investors. Money has poured into Mr Conde's bank since Morgan disclosed in February that Banesto would be the first investment to be made by Morgan's Dollars 1.1bn Corsair investment fund, set up in the US to buy stakes in undervalued banks. Banesto's shares have risen 50 per cent since the Morgan announcement, despite its decision not to pay a final dividend for 1992 - it may not pay one this year either. Mr Conde's critics in Madrid's financial community still harbour their doubts about Banesto, but it is difficult to dispute his assessment of the bank's new-found popularity. 'Was there ever such a capital increase in the history of the European banking system?' he asks. 'No] After that it is hard for me to believe the market is sceptical.' The Dollars 400m convertible bond issue will be the final part of an attempt to lift Banesto's capital to the levels of other Spanish banks. Banesto has already raised Pta94bn (Dollars 876m) capital by issuing new shares since May. Mr Conde's personal purchase of shares worth Pta6.4bn has helped to persuade thousands of first-time buyers to purchase shares worth Pta19.7bn through Banesto's branches. But he does not deny that the link with Morgan has attracted the solid US investors which own 90 per cent of the Corsair fund. 'Would there have been a capital issue without J P Morgan? The answer is no]' Mr Conde exclaims. Banesto's relationship with Morgan has brought it undoubted benefits. The unresolved question is whether Morgan will reap similar rewards. If Banesto fails to transform itself into the efficient retail bank with superior technology that Morgan believes it can be, Corsair's first venture will fail. Morgan's image as a talented investor of other people's capital in equities that are undervalued by world markets would also be tarnished. Damage to its reputation could set back Morgan's own effort to change from a lending bank into one modelled on British merchant banks of the past - with relatively few blue-chip corporate clients, but offering a wide range of services from advice to risk management and securities underwriting. Such operations are less risky than lending, but alone may not provide high enough returns on Morgan's capital base. So Morgan has also taken to investing capital in equities. Responsibility for the Banesto venture falls on Mr Roberto Mendoza, a quietly spoken Cuban. Mr Mendoza, who is a Morgan vice-chairman and Corsair's representative on Banesto's board, formerly headed its mergers and acquisitions side. Morgan has only Dollars 17.5m of Corsair's total Dollars 175m capital at stake in Banesto. But he acknowledges the potential risk to Morgan's standing. 'We must get it right because we are investing our reputation. That is the biggest kind of risk we can take,' he says. Morgan first encountered Banesto in November 1989 when it was hired to advise Mr Conde. Its advisers, led by Ms Violy de Harper, a managing director of its corporate advisory arm, set to work to untangle the run-down, family-controlled bank taken over by Mr Conde two years before. It had been founded to channel money into railways, construction and mining, and remained half bank and half industrial conglomerate. Mr Conde and a former friend, Mr Juan Abello, flush with the profits from the sale of a Spanish pharmaceuticals company to Montedison, the Italian chemicals group, bought a 4 per cent stake in Banesto just as its ageing and fractious family owners had been shaken by the near success of a takeover bid for Banesto by Banco de Bilbao, then one of Spain's big three commercial banks. His arrival upset Spain's cosy banking fraternity and triggered the collapse of the cartel within which Spanish banks determined interest rates on investments and loans. Banesto's management and organisation were in a mess. Little had been invested in its branches since 1975. Its employees were poorly paid, and many had second jobs. It had absorbed smaller troubled banks on the suggestion of the Bank of Spain, the central bank, and in early 1988 was told to set aside money against Pta100bn of poor loans. Mr Conde's first two years were spent in a flurry of activity. 'There were few accounts. It was impossible to tell where the losses were coming from,' he says. He chose not to disclose the whole truth about Banesto's plight to shareholders. 'I could have gone to a shareholders' meeting and told them: 'Gentlemen, I told you the accounts said the 1987 profit of the bank was this, but that is not true. And we have to invest this amount . . . ' What would have been their reaction? They would have left the bank,' he says. Instead, he started to invest Dollars 600m in new technology, branch refurbishment and improved wages. In 1990, he created a holding company to control the bank's various industrial interests. Morgan came to believe that Banesto's tangled history obscured its true worth. Its shares were trading at a discount to the value of its assets in 1989; Morgan thought this value could be unlocked by stripping out the bank from the holding company. This would also focus the management on its core business. But the move was partly making a virtue of necessity; the Bank of Spain told banks last year that they would have to reduce industrial holdings not consolidated in their accounts to 20 per cent of capital by 1998. Banesto currently has 39 per cent of capital in such holdings and so is forced to offload some of its industrial interests. 'It was not a matter of yelling 'Eureka' in the bathtub, but the more we delved into it, the more we came to the view that Banesto had a very large unexploited franchise value in the pure retail bank,' says Mr Mendoza. Morgan believed Banesto had to do two things to realise this value. One was to sell a significant proportion of the industrial assets. The second was to raise capital in order to relaunch itself with the strength to deal comfortably with its bad debts. The need to raise capital has been questioned by observers. Banesto had less capital than its Spanish peers, but its ratios of capital to assets were already comfortably in excess of international standards. This has led some analysts to ask whether it really wants the money to spend on as yet undisclosed problems with loans or industrial assets. Mr Mendoza says the capital partly provides comfort - stopping it from being rushed into selling assets - but mainly allows a break with the past. 'If you are the least-well-capitalised retail bank among your peers, and there have been controversies, it is clear that you derive competitive advantage from putting the issue to rest once and for all,' he says. 'You become the master of your own destiny.' Banesto's attempts to change its destiny have opened up opportunities for Morgan. The Spanish bank has provided a target for Corsair. The fund - named after J P Morgan's yacht, bought in 1882 - operates at the boundary drawn by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act between banks and investment banks. J P Morgan chose then to stay a bank, but has increasingly tested the divide as corporate lending has lost its allure. Although Morgan has a Dollars 1.3bn equities portfolio, Corsair is its first equity fund since 1933. The idea is to acquire partners in equity investments, since Morgan is barred by US regulators from holding more than 4.9 per cent of a company. Corsair now holds 7.9 per cent of Banesto. J P Morgan believed that by combining its advisory expertise with what Mr Mendoza calls the 'sponsorship value' of its name, it could spot undervalued companies and realise annual returns of 30 per cent for investors. Morgan is now considering funds similar to Corsair for insurance and real estate investment, but banking was an obvious place to start. When Morgan had the idea two years ago, there were many ripe targets in the US among banks which had suffered asset quality problems in the 1980s and whose share prices were low. But it hit regulatory obstacles from the Federal Reserve, and bank shares had rallied by the time the deadline for investing in Corsair passed in February. Morgan was forced to look elsewhere for undervalued bank shares instead. Despite the problems of poor loans common to most banks in the 1980s, Morgan believed retail banks in particular were good long-term investments. There is a wistful tone in Mr Mendoza's voice as he describes their attractions. Spanish banks have an average margin between interest they pay on deposits and charge on loans of about 3.8 per cent. This compares with a fraction of 1 per cent on big corporate loans. 'High-street banking may not appear very glamorous, but it can produce glamorous returns. They say corporate banking is more glamorous but anyone in it would wonder why,' he says. Banesto was particularly attractive because its shares were trading at a fifth of the price of Banco Popular, Spain's most profitable bank. Banesto had also avoided any overlap between its branches because it was not the product of a merger, like some rivals such as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. But these qualities had not attracted investors before it was given Corsair's stamp of approval. This raises the question of whether there was a conflict of interest in Morgan investing money in the shares of a Morgan client, though there has been no regulatory disapproval. Mr Mendoza seems hurt at the suggestion of conflict. 'I sincerely hope not. That would be terrible,' he says. He argues that Banesto was simply the best available investment, and Corsair is now considering other banks with which Morgan has no relationship. Mr Mendoza is more concerned that Banesto will not produce the returns that Corsair requires. Corsair is committed to remaining as a Banesto shareholder, and 'intends' to stay for five years. But the sharp rise in Banesto's shares will have to continue past the initial burst of enthusiasm to meet its overall 30 per cent annual investment return target. A possible bone of contention is the degree to which Mr Conde shares the vision of Banesto as a 'cleanly focused retail bank' that Morgan presents to investors. Mr Conde says Banesto will be primarily a retail bank in Spain, but will hold equity investments. 'We have the opportunity to use part of our equity to invest in non-financials, and make capital gains. Let's do it,' he says. Mr Mendoza downplays the possibility of tension. He says that Corsair is 'in the business of picking managements to back, not second-guessing them'. He argues that Mr Conde's abrasive tactics may have upset traditionalists in the Spanish banking sector, but a strong character is needed to revitalise Banesto. 'This is a turnround, and a successful turnround needs decisiveness and leadership,' he says. Morgan is also barred by US law from exercising a 'controlling influence' on Banesto. So Corsair may simply have to wait patiently to see if its first bet pays off. 'My own sense is that this is very low risk, although you can argue as to how good the returns will be,' says Mr Mendoza. But a safe, mediocre return carries its own risk. If Banesto does not transform itself as Morgan has predicted, investors will not have the same faith in Corsair's next choice. It has already earned big fees for bringing investors to Mr Conde's door; it remains to be seen whether its reward will be large enough.</p>

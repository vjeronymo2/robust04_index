			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major flies flag of threat to Union - Philip Stephens on how 'gut' instincts prompted a campaign switch THE journalists who trooped into Conservative Central Office yesterday morning were not alone in voicing surprise at Mr John Major's choice of the constitution as the topic for the start of the final phase of the Tory campaign. Some of his senior colleagues were equally perplexed that the prime minister, faced with a 2-point Labour lead in the opinion polls, had not chosen to shift the election debate to the more resonant ground of the economy. In fact, the sudden change of tack provided another sign of how Mr Major has come to prefer his 'gut' instincts to the advice of the party's professionals. It offered a glimpse also of the tensions that have arisen between Downing Street and Tory Central Office as the Conservative campaign has stumbled through the past three weeks. Instead of focusing his attack on Labour's policies on mortgage rates and its programme for economic recovery, Mr Major chose to dwell for the second successive day on the threat it would pose to the integrity of the constitution. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was summoned at short notice from his Oxfordshire constituency to lend his weight to the presentation. The launch of the last-minute campaign to warn voters that a Labour victory would turn economic recovery into slump was postoned until today. Miffed campaign strategists at Central Office said it was not the first time that Downing Street had upset their plans. Mr Major warned that the Scottish assembly proposed by Labour and by the Liberal Democrats would foreshadow the break-up of the union. The opposition parties' enthusiasm for a federal Europe would surrender the independence of Westminster to Brussels. The proportional voting system advocated by Mr Paddy Ashdown and flirted with by Mr Neil Kinnock would be a recipe for weak and indecisive government in which backroom deals prevailed over the will of the people. With a passion he has displayed rarely throughout the campaign, Mr Major concluded that, taken together, the policies would represent a real threat to the future of the United Kingdom - so the choice on Thursday was one that transcended normal party political differences. Close colleagues said that apocalyptic vision was not something conjured up by the party's image-makers. Just as Mr Major had decided that a soapbox provided a better medium than the orchestrated events that dominated the start of his campaign, so now he believed he had found a message to articulate the importance of the election. One aide said last night: 'He feels immensely strongly about the constitution and the authority of Westminster and is determined to put that across to the voters.' Many of his colleagues, however, are less than convinced that it is a strategy that can pull the Conservatives back from the verge of defeat on Thursday. They agree that it might persuade some disaffected Conservatives to switch their support back from the Liberal Democrats. A parallel warning from Mr Hurd that a hung parliament would let Mr Kinnock into Downing Street was directed at the same group of waverers. There is also a chance that waving the flag might also reinforce working-class support in the south-east. As they contemplate the prospect of the end of 13 years of office, the general view among ministers is that Scotland, electoral reform and Europe are not the issues to set voters rushing to the Conservative cause. If Mr Major is to defy the polls and return to Downing Street on Friday morning, it will be because the electorate fears Labour's economic policies more than it resents the Conservatives' recession. So his colleagues will be relieved when Mr Major returns this morning to concentrating on tax, mortgage rates and the promise of economic recovery.</p>

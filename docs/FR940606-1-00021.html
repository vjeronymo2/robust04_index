			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be shown on a monthly basis for compliant coatings, and on a daily basis for coatings complying by averaging. Compliance for control devices other than carbon adsorbers would be shown on a continuous basis based on a specific operating parameter or parameters, such as temperature for incinerators. When a carbon adsorber is used to comply with the proposed standard, compliance with the 81 percent overall control efficiency requirement must be demonstrated for each rolling material balance period. The length of the rolling period will vary from source to source and is determined by the procedure specified in proposed Method 309 in the proposed rule. The minimum rolling period is one day, and the maximum rolling period is 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is also proposing an equipment standard for the application of primers and topcoats. The proposed standard would require the use of flow coat, roll coat, brush coat, dip coat, electrostatic attraction, or high volume low pressure (HVLP) spray guns other than for the exemptions listed below. All application equipment would be required to be operated and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications at all times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing to allow other application equipment that is demonstrated to achieve emission levels equivalent to HVLP or electrostatic spray guns. Compliance must be demonstrated by comparing the emissions generated by the alternative application method to the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic application methods under actual production conditions. The alternative method must generate emissions less than or equal to that generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the alternative application method test period, the owner or operator must ensure that the coating dried film thickness is equivalent to that applied during the initial 90-day test period. This is required to ensure that the owner or operator does not bias the test results by applying an excessive amount of coating during the initial 90-day period and applying a minimal amount of coating during the alternative application method test period. The EPA is requesting comments on whether the requirements of the proposed standards are sufficient to ensure that this situation does not occur. Specifically, comments should address whether detailed recordkeeping should also be required in order to determine that equivalent dried film thicknesses were applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing to exempt the following situations and operations from the proposed equipment standards for the application of primers and topcoats, although whatever application equipment is used would still be required to be operated and maintained according to manufacturers specifications at all times: (1) Any situation that normally requires the use of an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces, (2) the application of coatings that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns and cannot be applied by any of the specified application techniques, (3) the application of coatings that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0005 inch and cannot be applied by any of the specified application techniques, (4) the use of airbrush application methods for stenciling, lettering, and other identification markings, and (5) touchup and repair operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inorganic HAP emissions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The standards being proposed for inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would apply to those operations that spray apply coatings that contain inorganic HAP (usually chromium, cadmium, and selenium). Such operations would be required to be performed in a booth or hangar in which the air flow is directed across the part or assembly being coated and exhausted through one or more outlets. This air stream would be required to pass through either dry particulate filters or a waterwash system to remove the particulates before exhausting to the atmosphere. In addition, the pressure drop across the filter or waterwash would have to be continuously monitored. If the pressure drop moves outside of the limits specified by the manufacturer to maintain proper performance of the dry particulate filters or waterwash system, then the operation must be shut down immediately and corrective action taken. The process cannot resume until the pressure drop is returned to the limits specified by the manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is requesting comments on whether pressure drop is an appropriate parameter on which to make continuous compliance determinations with the inorganic HAP emission standards. The possibility exists that different filter or waterwash manufacturers may specify different pressure drop limits for products with essentially the same performance. Since the proposed standards rely on pressure drop as the basis for making compliance determinations, such a difference would result in different requirements from one facility to another. Thus, the EPA is requesting comments specifically on whether a standardized pressure drop limit can be established, or if another operating parameter exists on which to make compliance determinations that would be consistent and enforceable for all types and brands of filters and waterwash systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

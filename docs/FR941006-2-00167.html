The Institute, a private, nonprofit corporation established by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to improve the administration and quality of justice in the State courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grants may be awarded to State and local courts and their agencies; national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and national nonprofit organizations for the education and training of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments. The Institute may also award grants to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration; institutions of higher education; individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencies with expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the funded program can be better served by such an entity. Funds may be awarded, as well, to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services that cannot be provided adequately through nongovernmental arrangements. In addition, the Institute may provide financial assistance in the form of interagency agreements with other grantors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institute will consider applications for funding support that address any of the areas specified in its enabling legislation as amended. However, the Board of Directors of the Institute has designated certain program categories as being of special interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1995 funds.

Concept papers proposing projects that follow up on the November 1994 National Conference on the Management of Mass Tort Cases must be mailed by March 10, 1995. Concept papers to implement the plans developed at the March 1995 National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts must be mailed by October 6, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that between $11 million and $11.5 million will be available for award.

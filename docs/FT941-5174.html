			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Arts: 'No Man's Land' on Broadway - New York Theatre The appearance on Broadway of a play by Harold Pinter is a rare enough occurrence to be worthy of mention; the current revival of No Man's Land, now playing at the Roundabout Theater, deserves little more than that. Meaning and menace burble beneath the elusive surface of this, and indeed all, of Pinter's works, but surface, in this production directed by David Jones, is just about all we get - save a remarkable performance by Christopher Plummer. It is little wonder that No Man's Land was, until recently, one of the least-produced of Pinter's plays. Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud's performances in its 1975 London premiere (which then played New York) were reportedly so memorable as to be called consummate, and other actors have been reticent to step into their shoes. No Man's Land did not receive another London production until 1992, when Pinter himself appeared as Hirst, the ageing, alcoholic writer who lives in a Hampstead manse with two thuggish minders, with Paul Eddington as Spooner, the bedraggled and equally aged poet who weasels into Hirst's house - and, perhaps, his consciousness. This production features Jason Robards as Hirst and Plummer in the showman's role of Spooner - which he digs into with considerable skill and aplomb. His Spooner is pathetic, but strangely dear, a faded dandy in a grimy grey suit and silly, narrow wool scarf that he tucks compulsively into his lapels. Quick - desperate - to please, he has a nervous giggle and a bizarre gait somewhere between a mince and a shuffle. Plummer's characterisation hints at an intriguing layer of homoeroticism in the text - let us not forget that Hirst met Spooner on the Heath and brought him to the house where he lives with two men who exist to please him - that is, sadly, not further exploited. While Pinter's play is surely about (at least in part) the unbreachable gulf between people, that 'no man's land . . . which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and silent,' Jones' production takes this idea too literally and too far - the almost total lack of connection between Hirst and Spooner keeps the audience from engaging in their wordplay. Robards, though physically commanding, seems mentally and emotionally absent. His declamatory Hirst is oblivious to Spooner from the start, and when, at the end of the first act, he does let down his guard ('Tonight . . . my friend . . . you find me in the last lap of a race I had long forgotten to run') his confidences seem to come, if not from nowhere, then probably from alcohol - certainly not from any growing relationship between himself and Spooner. The onstage atmosphere becomes even less charged with the entry of Hirst's servants. Fresh-faced Tom Wood plays Foster as an immature braggart, while the role seems to call for a darker-hued approach. The usually reliable John Seitz as Briggs has the right bulky, hooded-eyed look for the role, but his throwaway demeanour and lazily executed Cockney accent bring with them not a touch of danger. No Man's Land is full of mysteries about these men and their relation to one another, which will probably never be solved. It is a musing on the tenuousness of memory and the delicacy of human relations, and its pleasures lie in the ever-shifting suggestions of meaning and counter-meaning that accumulate as it unfolds. But performed as it is here, sans texture or mood, it seems less potent ambiguity than wilful obscurity.</p>

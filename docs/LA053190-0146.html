			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS NEAR AIRPORT LOSE BID TO SUE ON  NOISE  </P> <P> A state Court of Appeal ruled in a decision released Wednesday that owners of  homes near Burbank Airport have no right to sue for emotional distress or  property damage caused by aircraft noise -- all but ending more than seven  years of litigation on the issue.  </P> <P> The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel in Los Angeles leaves the 600  plaintiffs from Burbank, North Hollywood and Sunland only one avenue for their  case -- petitioning the state Supreme Court for a hearing, lawyers said.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs' attorney, John J. Schimmenti, estimated chances that the state  high court would agree to hear the case as "about one out of a hundred," but  said he did plan to petition the court.  </P> <P> "The effect of this ruling is that we have lost everything," said Tom Paterson  of North Hollywood, one of the plaintiffs.  </P> <P> "This is a very strong victory," said Erich Luschei, attorney for the airport  authority. "We got all we could have wanted."  </P></p>

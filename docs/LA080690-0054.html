			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA TO JOIN IRAQ ARMS EMBARGO  </P> <P> China announced Sunday that it will join Western nations in an international  arms embargo against Iraq in response to that nation's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Beijing's action came after two days of talks between Chinese officials and  visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, who flew here  Saturday to discuss the Iraqi invasion, Cambodia and other issues.  </P> <P> Solomon met with Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Assistant Foreign  Minister Xu Dunxin before flying on to Tokyo on Sunday, according to a Western  diplomat who spoke on condition that he not be further identified.  </P> <P> Shortly before Solomon's departure, the official New China News Agency quoted a  Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that "since China had voted for the U.N.  Security Council Resolution 660 against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it will,  naturally, not sell arms to Iraq under such circumstances."  </P> <P> China was a major supplier of arms to both Iraq and Iran during their long war  in the 1980s. It has been the third-largest supplier of arms to Iraq after the  Soviet Union and France.  </P> <P> Beijing has refused, however, to officially acknowledge its sales to Iraq and  Iran, which were sometimes routed through North Korea. For years, Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesmen routinely denied making sales that Western  governments said had indisputably taken place.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, China's announcement Sunday apparently is being accepted as  sincere. The Western diplomat who discussed Solomon's visit described the  announcement as China's "answer" to the American request.  </P> <P> Talks between Solomon and Chinese officials were "constructive, frank and  cordial," the diplomat said.  </P> <P> It is "very important," he said, that China and the United States be able to  "make progress" on issues such as this one, which he described as "a life and  death" matter. He said the Chinese response Sunday "plays constructively into  the domestic (American) support for the (U.S.-China) relationship, (or) it  should."  </P> <P> Solomon and Chinese officials discussed bilateral U.S.-China relations  primarily in "generalities," the diplomat said. Cambodia was discussed at some  length, but he did not reveal details of those talks.  </P> <P> No request was made to Beijing to join in economic sanctions against Iraq, he  said. It is difficult for the United States to press for Chinese economic  sanctions against a third country when the United States still has economic  sanctions in place against China, he said. Those sanctions were imposed in  response to Beijing's violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations last  year.  </P> <P> During Solomon's visit, the Chinese side again raised a request for U.S.  sanctions against Beijing to be lifted, the diplomat said.  </P></p>

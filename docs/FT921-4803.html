			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Leading Article: What to do with tax cuts HOW SHOULD canny FT readers respond to whatever tax cuts may be offered by Mr Norman Lamont in Tuesday's budget? Should they spend the money, in anticipation, or should they remain in a frugal state of mind? Frugality would be much the wiser course, for three reasons. Mr Lamont's budget will be one of two fiscal manifestos on offer, each of which has, on recent polling data, an equal chance of being enacted; the Labour version of the budget will be bad news for many FT readers; and even the Conservative version may offer less than meets the eye. The figures for next year will drown in red ink. Worse, that red ink will stretch far into the future, even if the Treasury dares not say so. Both sides will try either to explain or to forecast the prospective deficits away. When presenting a forecast for the public sector borrowing requirement in 1992-93 of perhaps as much as Pounds 30bn (5 per cent of gross domestic product), before deducting privatisation receipts of Pounds 8bn, Mr Lamont will point to the state of the economic cycle. Meanwhile, John Smith will claim that Labour will 'borrow to build'. Treasury forecasts will, no doubt, show declining public sector borrowing requirements for subsequent years. Such forecasts should be viewed with suspicion. The Treasury's forecasting record has been poor over the past few years. Continued poor fiscal performance in the medium term must be deemed quite likely. Accept, for the moment, that the starting point will turn out to be a deficit next year within spitting distance of 5 per cent of GDP. What are the chances that the deficit will subsequently decline, without discretionary tax increases? Real growth The government forecasts for the real growth of general government spending between 1991-92 and 1994-45 were slightly over 3 per cent a year in real terms. Everything suggests that this is likely to be an underestimate. Since economic growth has been worse than expected, unemployment will be higher. Public sector pay is being treated generously. Public spending plans also always overshoot. Moreover, having permitted a Pounds 5.6bn increase in the planning total for 1992-93 and a Pounds 13bn increase for 1993-94, by comparison with plans presented a year earlier, Mr Major's government has already shown itself to represent Thatcherism, minus tight control over public spending. Meanwhile, Mr Smith represents a party that believes passionately in public spending. He is unlikely to do better. More fundamentally, pressures for more public spending are becoming intense. Hospitals, schools, roads, public amenities, public sector pay, pensions, childcare, child benefit, all clamour for attention. It took a torrid economic expansion and the personality of Mrs Thatcher to stem the tide. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Kinnock looks likely to do as well. Revenue figures Turn, then, to revenue. Here all depends on the prospective rate of economic growth. If the UK economy is in a recession, with economic growth at faster than trend rates in prospect, then there will be no problem. Revenue normally grows faster than real GDP. The effect on the budget deficit is particularly marked when growth exceeds trend, since unemployment-related spending then falls. Should the economy grow at, say, 3 per cent a year from now, then growth in revenue is likely to exceed the likely growth in public spending. Things are unlikely to turn out that well. The still deflated state of the US economy, despite a discount rate of 3.5 per cent, holds a warning for the debt-deflated UK economy where short-term interest rates are 10.5 per cent. German short-term interest rates are likely to fall over the next year, but a decline of more than a percentage point seems unlikely. Finally, the interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany is already at an historic low. Should the trade deficit deteriorate and the credibility of the ERM commitment be questioned, then the interest rate differential might rise once more. One city economist, Mr Bill Martin of Phillips and Drew, has estimated what no economic growth in 1992, followed by growth of 1 3/4 per cent a year between 1993 and 1996, might mean for the public finances. The conclusions are sobering. Without adjustment of either taxation or spending, the PSBR reaches 7-8 per cent of GDP by 1994 and stays at that level thereafter. Gross public debt would exceed 60 per cent of GDP by 1996. Labour might claim that the red ink was caused by increased investment. The Conservatives might point to cyclical factors. Neither argument would wash. A PSBR on anything like this scale would demand retrenchment. Tax cuts might be on offer next week. A prudent tax-payer should view them as temporary, whether advertised as such or not.</p>

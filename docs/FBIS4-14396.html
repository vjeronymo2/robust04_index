			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent in Tehran on 29 April] </F>   [Text] On his arrival at the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran,  the deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina said: The  Muslim nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina continues to appreciate the  support and assistance by their brothers and sisters in Iran and  will never forget this affection. We believe that Iran is our  best friend and supporter in today's sorrowful crisis.    Referring to the condition in his country, Edib Bukvic  stressed: After 20 days of aggression and the massacre of  thousands of our compatriots, the war in Gorazde has relatively  subsided. He warned: We believe that the Serbs are preparing  for renewed attacks in northern and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The world today is amazed and saddened at the silence and  indifference of the West and of Europe, who continue to profess  the defense of freedom and human rights.    The Bosnian deputy prime minister asserted: Of course we  rely on God, our people, and the support of friendly and  fraternal countries such as Iran, but we insist upon the lifting  of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina, so we can resist this  unjust aggression and war, and defend our homeland and beliefs.</p>

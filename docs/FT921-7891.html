			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Yamaha names new president YAMAHA, the Japanese musical instrument maker, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Seisuke Ueshima as its new president. Mr Ueshima succeeds Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, who was forced to resign during a row over the company's internal restructuring programme. Yamaha said Mr Ueshima had taken responsibility for the company's earnings slump. Yamaha posted a record pre-tax profit of Y15.9bn (Dollars 124.2m) for the year to end-March 1990. However, a slowdown in the sales of pianos, its main product, hit revenues. Piano sales peaked in 1990 at 240,000 units and have fallen sharply, hitting 170,000 units last year. For the year ended last March, pre-tax profits slumped 10.7 per cent to Y10.8bn from the previous year. The com - pany's attempt to diversify into new business has also shown disappointing results. Mr Ueshima, 57, joined Yamaha in 1958.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OVERBY'S 52-YARD RUN PACES SUNNY HILLS' VICTORY OVER LOARA  </P> <P> With one quick burst up the middle, Sunny Hills High School running back Kenny  Overby ended four weeks of frustration Thursday night at Spaulding Field.  </P> <P> Overby raced 52 yards for a touchdown on an inside trap with 5 minutes 3  seconds remaining in the game to break a tie and Sunny Hills went on to a 21-7  victory over Loara. Both teams are 2-2.  </P> <P> Overby had the luxury of running behind one of the county's best offensive  lines as a junior last season but he has found the pathways clogged with a new  group of linemen in 1990. He finished with a season-high 125 yards in 22  carries against a strong Loara defense. He later praised his blockers.  </P> <P> "It's just going to take some time," Overby said. "I thought our line did a  good job of opening up some holes. It was the best game the line has played  this season. They're good, they're just young."  </P> <P> Another youngster, quarterback Hakiem McKenzie, also showed some promise in the  victory. McKenzie completed five of nine pass attempts for 117 yards and a  touchdown in the first half. McKenzie completed consecutive 32-yard pass plays,  his second connecting with wide receiver Stephen Choe for Sunny Hills' first  touchdown in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Loara relied primarily on the running of tailback Luiji Gagow to generate its  offense. Gagow gained 97 yards in 23 carries as the Saxons rushed for 144  yards. But Loara's inability to produce a passing attack, in addition to four  turnovers, spelled its second defeat in four games.  </P> <P> Quarterback Charles Gipson threw three interceptions and Gagow had the ball  stripped at his own 40-yard line by Sunny Hills' defensive end Jeff Hicks that  teammate Clayton Lau turned into a 40-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Bobby Sunderland, Joey Montgomery and Choe each had an interception, and  afterward, Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney praised his defense and the emergence  of Overby and McKenzie.  </P> <P> "Our defense played great again," Devaney said. "That was a good team we beat  tonight. I'm very pleased. I think McKenzie is starting to come into his own  and assuming the job of leadership.  </P> <P> "Kenny has been frustrated this year and has a tendency to get down. I was glad  to see him get that long run. He can do that at any time."  </P> <P> Loara (2-2) had limited three previous opponents to only 23 points, but the  Saxons' tendency to self-destruct offensively was the difference.  </P> <P> Loara's only touchdown was set up by Shawn Easter's 35-yard punt return in the  third quarter. Easter was starting his first game after gaining his eligibility  this week. Easter is a transfer from Servite.  </P> <P> Gipson, a converted wide receiver, completed nine of 20 pass attempts for 86  yards and had 34 yards rushing in 11 carries. Loara has a final nonleague  tuneup against El Modena next week, while Sunny Hills meets Esperanza.  </P></p>

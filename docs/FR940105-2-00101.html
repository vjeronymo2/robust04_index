The License was most recently amended on September 15, 1993. The License authorizes the Licensee to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with radioactive material as well as research in accordance with the conditions specified therein. This is a broad scope license. The License was most recently renewed on August 13, 1985, and was due to expire on August 31, 1990 but was extended by the NRC pending staff action on the Licensee's renewal request. Based on the Licensee's application to renew the License dated June 17, 1990, and pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37(b), the existing License has not expired and continues in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Between December 3, 1992, and January 27, 1993, the NRC performed two inspections of licensed activities at the Licensee's facility. The inspections were conducted to review two incidents involving therapeutic misadministrations and a failure to control licensed material that occurred between November 30 and December 1, 1992, and on January 21, 1993. During the inspections, five violations of NRC requirements were identified. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated April 26, 1993. The Notice states the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalties proposed for the violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Licensee responded to the Notice on June 10, 1993. In its response, the Licensee denies Violations II.A and II.B set forth in the Notice; questions the Severity Level classification for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C; and requests reduction of the civil penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for mitigation contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the violations did occur, the Severity Level classifications were appropriate, and the penalties proposed for the violations designated in the Notice should be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the foregoing and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is hereby ordered that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The Licensee pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft, money order, or electronic transfer, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Salamah Ni'mat in Amman] </F>   [Excerpt] Official Jordanian sources yesterday said that in  case a Jordanian-Israeli agreement is reached in the absence of  coordination between Jordan and the PLO, the Jordanian  Government would resort to establishing crossing points between  the East and West Bank other than the known traditional  crossings.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that the government would reuse  the  Damiya Bridge which links Jordan with the Nabulus region, which  is not part of the limited autonomous self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho, or would establish a crossing point in the city of  al-'Aqabah on the Red Sea "to facilitate the passage of  Palestinian and Jordanian citizens and to link between the two  wings of the Arab world in North Africa and Asia."    It is known that travelers between the East and West Bank  currently use the King Husayn (Allenby) Bridge and the Prince  Muhammad Bridge over the River Jordan in the Jordan Valley. It  is clear that any such Jordanian measure will render useless any  Palestinian-Israeli agreement on crossings from and to the  Jericho region.    The Jordanian sources stressed that any such step "will  facilitate traffic between the two banks, especially since most  West Bank Palestinians hold Jordanian passports." One of the  sources criticized Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat due to "his  disinclination to coordinate with Jordan" on the issue of  crossings, "without taking into consideration that any  arrangements on any side of the border must take place through  coordination with the other side."    The source stressed that Jordan "desires to ease the immense  pressure" on the Palestinian citizens in the occupied  territories "as much as it can." [passage omitted]</p>

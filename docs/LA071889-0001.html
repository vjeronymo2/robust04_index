			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A suspected Irish Republican Army bomb squad apparently preparing to attack  British targets in West Germany has been arrested in France, police said. Two  men and one woman, who were not identified, were seized at a toll booth on the  highway east of Paris on Friday, while British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher, President Bush and other world leaders were visiting the French  capital for the economic summit. Police said the three, at least two of whom  were of British nationality, were carrying detonators and false identity  papers. IRA guerrilla units have carried out a number of recent attacks on  British military bases in West Germany.  </P></p>

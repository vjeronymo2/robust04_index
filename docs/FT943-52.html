			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (19): Choice between more jobs and good jobs - Unemployment / Economic recovery will not on its own provide the answers This has been the year for the jobless, not so much for helping them as for talking about them. This is not surprising, since the level of measured unemployment stands at 35m (8 1/2 per cent) in the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and 24m in the group of seven leading industrial countries alone. The concern is also appropriate, despite the fact that economic recovery has spread to most industrial countries. Recovery will reduce unemployment. But it will not, on its own, lower it to levels once deemed socially essential, especially in Europe. In fact, the year of the jobless started last December with the release of the European Commission's White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment. This was followed, in March, by President Clinton's jobs summit in Detroit. Then, in June, there appeared the OECD's long-awaited jobs study. Finally, at the G7 summit in Naples, the leaders endorsed a seven-point plan to tackle this scourge. The plan called for: improved skills, through better education and training; reduced labour rigidities, through lower indirect employment costs and fewer regulations; active labour market policies, to enhance incentives for the unemployed to seek work; assistance to promote innovation and the spread of new technology, including an integrated infrastructure for global communications; job creation in the leisure and environmental protection industries, which are regarded as potential high-growth areas; increased competition, through elimination of unnecessary regulations; and programmes to enrol employers and trade unions in the search for new jobs. The approach is highly eclectic, for two reasons: first, because of divergent views within the G7 about the relative weights to be given to market forces and government intervention; and, second, because there is not one employment problem, but the two distinct ones of jobs and pay. On jobs, the North Americans have triumphed over the Europeans. During the past 35 years, employment in North America has risen 80 per cent, while in the European Union it has risen only 10 per cent. The unemployment rate has shown little upward trend in North America, while in the EU it has risen, cycle-by-cycle, from around 2 per cent in the mid-1960s to some 12 per cent today. Moreover, since 1973, more than four-fifths of the employment growth in North America has been in the private sector, while in the EU more than half has been in the public sector. The European failure has, as the OECD report shows, a host of unpleasant ramifications: The EU's male participation rate - the proportion of the working age population in work - fell from more than 95 per cent in 1960 to below 80 per cent in 1991, while in the US it declined from just over 90 per cent to about 85 per cent. The female participation rate in the EU, at 55 per cent in 1991, is far below that in North America, where it is close to 70 per cent. The EU rate has also risen by much less than the North American one since 1960, when the two were much the same. At 20.6 per cent in 1993, the EU's youth unemployment rate, was well above the 13.8 per cent in North America. And the long-term unemployed - those out of work for more than a year - made up 42.2 per cent of total EU unemployment in 1992, compared with only 11.2 per cent in North America. The performance of the EU does look dreadful - and so, indeed, it is. But relative North American success came at a heavy price: poor performance of real wages, along with greatly increased pay inequality. Between 1978 and 1993 average US real wages stagnated. But over the same period, German real wages rose by 18 per cent, French ones rose by 26 per cent (between 1978 and 1992) and British ones rose by 31 per cent. Not only have average real wages stagnated in the US, but inequality has considerably increased. In fact, during the 1980s pay-differentials widened in all the English-speaking industrial countries, while there was no comparable rise in inequality within continental Europe. Behind these contrasting developments lies a mixture - one whose precise composition remains controversial - of two underlying causes: technological change is the more important; international trade is the more controversial. The latter consists of shifts in comparative advantage, as the growing outward-orientation of developing countries generates a significant increase in the global supply of labour-intensive manufactured products. These two forces have generated a significant shift in demand from unskilled labour and towards relatively skilled labour. The OECD comments in its jobs study that, 'in most countries where relative wages have been flexible (the United States, Canada, Australia), both the relative employment and unemployment rates of the unskilled changed little during the 1980s. In comparatively inflexible Europe, on the other hand, both relative employment and unemployment rates deteriorated.' But in the English-speaking countries, where employment has held up fairly well, the price has been paid in declining relative wages of the unskilled. The question then is not whether jobs can be created. Obviously, they can. The challenge is to provide what President Clinton has promised the American electorate, namely many more 'good jobs'. Can that be done? Or are the citizens of advanced economies condemned to choose between more jobs, which may pay less and less, or fewer, but 'better' jobs? Robert Reich, President Clinton's labour secretary, argued at Detroit, that 'there is a third choice, and that third choice may be to combine the kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship that we find in Europe, with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we find in the US, all encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth and jobs'. How far does such eclecticism - further elaborated (apart from the emphasis on macro-economic expansion) in the Naples communique - provide the solution? Improvements in the quality of labour must be important, although high-quality basic education probably matters quite as much as training. Improved economic dynamism must matter, too. Yet that depends not just on deregulation and increased competition, but also on achieving far higher rates of capital accumulation. The most attractive example has, in fact, been provided by Japan, which has historically come closest to secretary Reich's ideal. Japan's unemployment rate, even after a recession, is only 3 per cent. Between 1978 and 1993, Japanese real wages rose by 49 per cent. The question for the future is whether the other industrial countries can manage to replicate some of the Japanese labour market success - or whether Japan, already afflicted by a long recession, catches the employment maladies of North America, of Europe, or even of both.</p>

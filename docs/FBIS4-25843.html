			<p>BFN     [Text] Conducting investigations and study in Shuangyashan  city, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee,  pointed out: A prominent task that lies ahead for all people of  the province is to rapidly turn the advantages of having natural  resources into those of having commodities. The leaders at  various levels and the masses should emancipate their mind,  change ideas, and smash the bonds of the planned economy.    On 12 June, accompanied by Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of  the provincial party committee; and Wang Xianming, secretary  general of the provincial party committee, Yue Qifeng, secretary  of the provincial party committee, went to Shuangyashan city to  conduct investigations and study. He respectively inspected the  country fair trade town of Jixian County and several  enterprises, including a marble plant.    Yue Qifeng said: Shuangyashan city is an industrial city  with rich coal resources. So, it is very important for the city  to grasp coal production. However, an economically strained  situation will certainly emerge if this city only lays an  emphasis on coal production at the expense of neglecting the  development of other industries and diversification of the  economy. Therefore, we should attach importance to the  development of the county-level economy but must not simply  regard the rural areas as an accessory to urban areas. As long  as the rural economy is well developed, essential changes will  take place in the overall economic pattern.    Yue Qifeng maintained: Up to now, our province has been  subject to the pattern of a planned economy because although we  stand by a gold mountain, we live a poor life. Our province's  wasteland, lakes, and coal fields are important resources. But,  we do not make good use of them. Our province still fails to  turn its special products, such as aquatic products and mountain  products, into advantages of appropriate scale. Therefore, we  should give free rein to vigorously developing town and township  enterprises, and mobilize the masses to develop the natural  resources in stages and then process natural resources  intensively and precisely. So, the governments at various  levels should create a favorable environment for town and  township enterprises, and [words indistinct].    Yue Qifeng said: Town and township enterprises are important  sources for secondary financial resources. So far, it has been  necessary to change the current situation so that now 80 percent  of the province's financial resources are from state-owned large  enterprises. Heilongjiang will become hopeless if it does not  develop secondary financial resources.    Yue Qifeng stressed: Emancipating the mind, changing ideas,  straightening out the strategic ideology of economic  development, being inspired with enthusiasm, making concerted  efforts, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all fronts is a major  task ahead of the whole province. Only when we strive to grasp  and fulfill this task can an overall economic development  situation possibly emerge in Heilongjiang.</p>

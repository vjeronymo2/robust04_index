South Pacific correspondent, Erina  Reddan, reports that the ballot which requires the two-thirds  majority is a crucial test for the government.    [Begin Reddan recording] Chief Justice Charles d'Imecourts  rescheduled the vote to Wednesday. Justice d'Imecourts said he  would hold the absent electorate in contempt of court if they  did not explain. However, the two opposition members, who were  present, said the opposition had received no writs. Although  the chief justice accepted this as an explanation, he said they  would have known about the vote through the media, and that  there was no political advantage from their action.    Meanwhile, the government's chance of having the two third  majority it needs to elect the president is uncertain. The  various opposition groups say they are about to sign a  memorandum of understanding, bringing opposition numbers in the  parliament up to 22, and they have hope of attracting defectors  from the government ranks.    The government currently has 24 members. The opposition says  it will renew its notice of no confidence vote in the prime  minister. [end recording]</p>

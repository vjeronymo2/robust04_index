			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lazar Tomov commentary: "Eliminating Shoulder Straps"] </F>   [Text] In all probability the massive "shock" dismissal of  officers and sergeants will afflict the depleted ranks of the  Bulgarian Army. This became clear after the second meeting of  the Consultative Council on National Security. At the meeting  Defense Minister Aleksandrov reportedly declared his Ministry's  inability to feed the Army. Therefore, in the near future we  could be relying on a 55,000-man Army. The food will suffice  only for such a size.    Everyone understands that even the present armed forces  personnel cannot guarantee the country's national security and  integrity. This is also well known to our benevolent (for the  time being) neighbors in the Balkans. In addition, no one  doubts that the results of the "reform" in the army in the last  four years have amounted to dismissing 2,000 officers.    The new element now is that the 3,000 officers and almost  1,000 sergeants who have been marked (in the best case) for  "gradual" dismissal will be requalified according to a U.S.  model. Thus, after comprehensively using the Soviet leading  experience, now we are advancing toward using the U.S.  experience. The minister reportedly proposed other novelties:  As consolation, the officers and sergeants dismissed will  receive securities rather than the 12-months of wages that they  are entitled to. Perhaps he wants to turn them into stock  market dealers?    The methodology of a British military institute has also  been  used for the envisaged cuts. However, we do not know whether  this methodology also recommends cuts in the drastically  inflated payroll of the high-ranking officers on the General  Staff and in the Defense Ministry. And another thing, is our  army not turning into a producer of young pensioners?    Is is not more appropriate to adopt first the national  security concept and pass the Law on Defense and the Armed  Forces? Otherwise all this resembles cutting off the head of  the army. It also reminds us of the experiments of the "father  of all nations" [Stalin], who from 1937 until the beginning of  the war against Germany "purged" his army of its talented and  able officers. We know the results of this purge. Let us hope  that we will not have to experience those results in our country.</p>

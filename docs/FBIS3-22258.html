			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover, environment editor: ``Ministers </F> Fight Uphill Battle on Car Fumes'']    [Text] A leaked draft of Britain's environmental strategy  for the next 20 years shows that traffic growth will have a  steadily worsening effect on the quality of life.    Traffic emissions are ``major challenges'' to the  Government's attempts to reduce climate change and to improve  air quality in cities. An increase in vehicles will damage  nature sites and create unacceptable noise levels.    The draft transport chapter of the UK Strategy for  Sustainable Development is frank about the negative effects of  the projected doubling of traffic growth over the next 25 years.  But it is likely to disappoint environmentalists because it  contains no new transport policies to curb road traffic or  promote public transport.    The document, drawn up as Britain's contribution to carrying  forward the aims of the Rio Earth summit, warns that travel  costs ``may have to rise further to reflect environmental costs  and to affect the future demand for transport.'' But it says  there will be public resistance to this.    The near-final draft of the report, to be launched by the  Prime Minister next week, shows that Mr. MacGregor, Transport  Secretary, and Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, disagreed over  the need to accommodate traffic growth.    Amendments and deletions by Mr. MacGregor show the Transport  Department at pains to excuse and justify its policy of building  roads to meet demand.    There remain some strong statements, such as: ``It is clear  that traffic growth in certain parts of the country, and on  certain assumptions, would produce unacceptable economic and  environmental consequences.''    It is the lack of any conclusions which measure up to this  striking analysis of the problems posed by traffic growth that  is likely to invite criticism on Tuesday when the strategy --  which covers every area of Government from energy to agriculture  -- is launched.    The strategy points out that technical innovations in  engines, catalysts and fuels will not be enough to temper the  increase in pollution. It says the benefits of catalytic  converters will be short-lived as traffic growth overcomes  initial gains in air quality.    It says the Government is also likely to have to take action  to limit carcinogenic substances in petrol such as benzene.    It also points out that transport creates water pollution, a  mountain of 20-30 million used tyres each year and that road  building, even at present rates, accounts for 32 percent of the  sand and gravel quarried.    The document's conclusion is a call for more public  information, further research and for local authorities to  develop clear environmental targets and criteria.    Environmentalists said the emerging evidence of what the  environmental strategy contains showed a chance to change  policies into the next century had been thrown away.    Miss Fiona Weir, of Friends of the Earth, said: ``The  Government has admitted that traffic growth is a massive problem  but then they throw their hands up in the air when it comes to  doing anything about it.''</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RUSH TO CAPITALIZE ON GLASNOST;  </P> <P> THE MAJOR U.S. PLAYERS ARE VYING INTENSELY TO IMPORT SOVIET PERFORMERS -- AND,  SUDDENLY, ARTISTIC FAMINE BECOMES MARKETING GLUT  </P> <P> They know each other quite well for all three are rivals in the same field --  doing their best to capitalize on the new, open Soviet Union by importing music  and dance performers into the United States. They conduct business in that  tight little enclave of mid-town Manhattan that's virtually a baton's throw  from Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, and these days might just as easily bump  into each other on Moscow's Gorky Street as on Manhattan's West 57th Street.  </P> <P> Of course Lee Lamont, 58, president of ICM Artists Ltd.; Charles Dillingham  III, 47, president of the Entertainment Corp. U.S.A., and R. Douglas Sheldon,  48, a vice president and division head at Columbia Artists Management Inc.,  knew each other before glasnost. Only now their agencies' rivalry has  intensified.  </P> <P> "We don't lunch," Sheldon says.  </P> <P> During the rush to import Russian and other Soviet artists in the 4 1/2 years  since former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev  renewed cultural ties, these three agencies have moved to the top in snapping  up the best of classical and traditional Soviet artists.  </P> <P> If there is a downside in all this, it is excess. After a virtual six-year  absence, there was such a rush for Soviet performing artists in music, dance  and theater that agencies now face the problem of glut. Agencies can control  what they bring but not what their rivals bring. Already in dance there have  been conflicts. And notes Sheldon: "You face the possibility that three  different orchestras could come in the same concert season. I don't think  there's any agency in New York who believes the market could handle all of  that."  </P> <P> Cultural exchange had essentially shut down with the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan at the end of 1979, and that coincided with the expiration of a  cultural treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. So, when things  opened up again, a lot of people saw -- or thought they saw -- a golden  opportunity.  </P> <P> "Suddenly the United States got Russian fever," Lamont said. "Everybody --  whether it was a manufacturer of goods or a promoter of rock troupes -- decided  they were going to become very wealthy by going to the Soviet Union, getting a  contract and presenting attractions. . . ."  </P> <P> Soviet authorities happily cooperated, and still do. In their rush for hard  foreign currency, Sheldon noted, "they'll sell absolutely anything to  absolutely anybody . . . . I don't even know the names of the (buyers here)  because they come out of nowhere. Any organization that would put up hard cash.  Or who they thought could put up hard cash. . . ."  </P> <P> Giving the rivalry an edge is the fact that like American and other Western  artists, the Soviets have gotten into the habit of defecting from one American  management to another. A significant change under perestroika, or  restructuring, is that increasingly Soviet artists and companies have a say as  to who their Western managers will be.  </P> <P> While money is always a motivator, there are other forces in this particular  market.  </P> <P> "Direct From the U.S.S.R." on the bill brings a certain amount of prestige and  visibility. And then there is always the emotional factor. "This is a country  that has been shut off in many cases," says Dillingham, "and their artists  deserve to perform in the West and be seen."  </P> <P> But primarily it is the art.  </P> <P> "Traditionally they have produced fantastic artists -- artists of the highest  international standard," explains Sheldon. "The history is full of these people  whether it's (cellist Mstislav) Rostropovich or (violinist David) Oistrakh or  (pianists Emil) Gilels or (Sviatoslav) Richter. And no dance companies in the  world had the renown (of) the Kirov and the Bolshoi . . . . Of course, the  Russian culture is one that is to most Americans a little mysterious."  </P> <P> And for American audiences getting over the Cold War, there is something heady  in hearing a Soviet company, having learned the words phonetically, singing  "America, the Beautiful," as did a folk dance troupe from Soviet Georgia.  </P> <P> For nine years -- longer than its rivals -- Columbia was treated, Sheldon said,  as if it was "persona non grata" with the Soviet Union, having been blamed for  the 1979 defections of a number of Bolshoi Ballet members including principal  Alexander Godunov. Allowed back in early last year after some quiet  negotiating, the 60-year-old agency is fast becoming a major player once more.  </P> <P> The largest classical artist management agency in the world, with nearly 800  clients and 14 divisions, Columbia carries considerable clout. As Sheldon, who  does most of Columbia's negotiations with the Soviets likes to note: "My  division is larger than some artist agencies -- 77 clients or something like  that."  </P> <P> Columbia has already signed the U.S.S.R. State Symphony and its chief conductor  Yevgeny Svetlanov (formerly with ICM) for a major national tour in early 1991,  and the Soviet Philharmonic Orchestra and its chief conductor Gennady  Rozhdestvensky (formerly with Entertainment Corp.) for a tour in early 1992.  The agency now lists the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra and the Leningrad Kirov  Orchestra and is looking to add ethnic dance companies, balalaika orchestras,  chamber orchestras, vocalists and instrumentalists. "You have to work at this  all the time," Sheldon says.  </P> <P> Since glasnost, ICM Artists, with about 200 clients, has been in the forefront  of the Soviet market with nine company tours. ICM got back in during the summer  of 1986 with the Kirov Ballet (now with Entertainment Corp.). The 14-year-old  agency is a direct descendant of the company founded by impresario Sol Hurok,  who in the 1950s and '60s essentially had the Soviet show to himself.  </P> <P> Probably ICM's best-known Soviet client is the Moiseyev Dance Company, which,  in 1958 under Hurok, became the first Soviet troupe in decades to break the  cultural ice. The Moiseyev returns for its third trip since glasnost in the  fall of 1991.  </P> <P> Besides about 15 soloists, ICM has toured the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra, the  Moscow Philharmonic and next season brings in the Leningrad Philharmonic, the  Lezginka Folk Dance Company, the Moscow Soloists and the 101-year-old Andreyev  Balalaika Orchestra -- the old Royal Court Orchestra. "I really had no  intentions of bringing a balalaika orchestra. Balalaikas are native instruments  that look like moons . . . ," Lamont said. "But then I heard them. They invited  me to a recording session when I was in Leningrad."  </P> <P> Entertainment Corp., the fast sprinter in the field, has brought in seven  Soviet companies and 15 Soviet soloists starting with conductor Yuri Temirkanov  and pianist Nikolai Petrov -- the first under the new exchange treaty in  January, 1986.  </P> <P> The agency -- formerly known as Classical Artists International -- makes a  major splash this summer co-presenting (with James M. Nederlander) the Bolshoi  Ballet in a 7-city, 11-week tour -- which is on a somewhat grander scale than  the 1987 Bolshoi tour brought by Metropolitan Opera. Entertainment Corp., with  50 clients overall, is also sponsoring for return visits for the Kirov Ballet  (mainly in the Midwest) and the Georgian State Dancers.  </P> <P> Bolstering its prestige and perhaps its coffers, the parent London-based  Entertainment Corp. Group has signed separate six-year exclusive agreements  with the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow, the Kirov Theatre of Leningrad, and  Gosconcert -- the state artists agency -- to develop marketing and promotional  opportunities, including jewelry, perfume, a line of clothing, books and  videos.  </P> <P> The arrangement is 60% for the theaters -- which could use hard foreign  currency -- and 40% for the agency. If this seems larger than what might be  considered a normal 20% commission, company co-chairman Peter Brightman and  Victoria Charlton explained at a press conference that they're responsible for  all investments including start-up costs, so far amounting to over $750,000.  </P> <P> The British husband-and wife team have been dealing with the Soviets since they  founded their agency in London in 1982. According to Dillingham, the Soviets  suggested that Brightman and Charlton open an office in the United States. "And  you can do some business," he quoted the Soviets as saying. "Not all of our  business but some business because we trust you and enjoy doing business with  you."  </P> <P> "It's a business relationship," Dillingham explained. "Once you have a business  relationship, it's just like where you get your cleaning done. You keep going  until you have a problem."  </P> <P> The Bolshoi and the Kirov did not become clients in this country until last  summer -- about the time that Dillingham, who had been general manager and  executive director of American Ballet Theatre for eight years, joined  Entertainment Corp. The agency, Dillingham said, had to build "a relationship  with the Bolshoi and the Kirov companies first of all, and with Gosconcert and  the Ministry of Culture . . . . We had to convince all these people. It didn't  just fall in our lap."  </P> <P> Is there big money to be made in capitalizing on glasnost?  </P> <P> Lamont, who began working for Hurok in 1957, notes that overall "your (profit)  margin is very small compared to what it was in the '50s and '60s, and the  costs are going up. It used to be relatively inexpensive to tour a group. Never  mind hotels. . . . Union costs eat away most of your profits. Travel -- you  have to fly somebody. We have a very large country. You can't bus tours around  the United States. . . ."  </P> <P> Sheldon explained that normally in the West, managers make all the arrangements  for booking an artist or orchestra with presenters of classical music events  and take a 20% commission. "The normal arrangement is an orchestra receives all  fees minus the commission and pays all bills. The Soviet arrangement is a  buy-sell. . . . They always wanted to sell for a given fee and make you pay all  the expenses possible."  </P> <P> He added: "In the early days, or part of the early days when Hurok did it, he'd  have to pay to Gosconcert $1,000 for Rostropovich, and he'd sell for $5,000,  and he was able to make some money. And, when he brought the Bolshoi tour, he  was able to buy it very inexpensively and make tons of money. (Then) the  Soviets became more sophisticated, the costs kept going up and it became really  impossible to do that . . . . What you hope to do is perhaps create a scenario  where perhaps you make the same 20%."  </P> <P> "But it's not fail-safe," he noted. Touring a major Soviet orchestra costs  $55,000 per concert -- including the fee and all expenses. He figures a likely  profit is 15%.  </P> <P> Lamont says that costs can be three times as much as the basic fee and she's  satisfied "if I can pull 8-12% on an attraction -- an orchestra or a dance  ensemble -- because of the costs. The margins are small but that's OK, this is  fine. . . . I also represent some major artists and I get commissions out of  them. I'm not just making my money out of the Soviets."  </P> <P> As manager/producers or co-producers on many tours, Entertainment Corp. -- and  sometimes ICM -- assumes other financial risks including rental of the hall,  local advertising, local production costs, and myriad details. "It's  financially riskier," Dillingham said, "but if you're successful at it the  rewards are greater."  </P> <P> On individual artists, the agency executives say they sometimes reach the  standard 20% profit.  </P> <P> On the negative side, there is the problem of market glut, particularly in  dance. This year at least 10 companies have come in or are scheduled to come.  They are: the Bolshoi, the Kirov, the Georgian State Dance Company, the Rustavi  Company (also from Soviet Georgia), the Don Cossack Song and Dance Company,  Lezginka from Daghestan in the Caucuses north of Georgia, the Koslov Youth  Ensemble, the Moscow Chamber Ballet, Leningrad Ballet -- and the Leningrad  State Music Hall Dance Company, currently performing at City Center Theater in  New York. That last troupe was brought here by Leon Zemshman, a car-leasing  company executive in Queens, and an emigre from the Soviet republic of  Moldavia.  </P> <P> ICM's Lamont, who said she was having a problem "properly booking" Lezginka  this fall because the Georgian State Dance Company is also coming this fall,  discussed her recent tour of the Don Cossacks. "They did, in some places, very,  very well and in other places very, very poorly. It did not do well in Chicago  (in March). There was an article in the Tribune which said basically it's a  good company, they kick as high as all the other folk dance companies, but do  we need another Russian attraction?"  </P> <P> At Entertainment Corp., Dillingham said "the people here who have been booking  the Georgian State Dance Company have heard from some people (who) feel there  have been too many, or enough, Russian ethnic dance companies in (certain)  cities . . . . There is, either in some cities or in some art forms, a glut.  But the market will rectify that . . . if you look at it over a five-year  spectrum. And there probably are some areas that haven't seen the Georgian  State dancers. But, instead of going to the old circuit everybody knows about,  you've got to find new places to go."  </P> <P> John Ballard, president of Space Agency Inc. in Salt Lake City, who brought  Soviet jazz groups in the early years of glasnost, co-sponsored the Red Army  Chorus tour last year with Atlanta entertainment promoter Alex Cooley and  Canadian John Cripton. Neither Ballard nor Cooley has any immediate plans to  bring more Soviets.  </P> <P> In fact Ballard said he recently canceled a prospective tour by the Krasnoyarsk  dance troupe from Siberia because it's simply "too much." He also said he  turned down an offer to bring a folk ensemble from Ukraine.  </P> <P> Don Hughes, president of International Attractions Inc. in La Jolla, who has  brought a number of Soviet dance and acrobatic troupes since last summer,  estimates that he will lose several hundred thousand dollars on the Rustavi's  recent massive 26-city, 12-week tour. The tour, which he produced, ended April  27.  </P> <P> Hughes blames the glut. "Theatrically, they were an enormous success; we didn't  have a bad review anywhere. Financially, I think we were up against too many  folk dance companies coming through at the same time."  </P> <P> But Hughes, who is bringing the Koslov this fall, says he has done well on  other attractions like the Soviet Acrobatic Revue. He was back in the Soviet  Union earlier this month to finalize arrangements for the Obraztsov Puppet  Theatre, his enthusiasm undiminished. "There's not been a glut of puppets."  </P> <P> It's "a mess, a total mess" dealing over there, says Sheldon.  </P> <P> It's "confusing . . . unsettled," notes Lamont.  </P> <P> And Dillingham points out that "the rules are changing, the laws are changing,  the regulators are changing . . . (but) once you are attuned to that, business  can be conducted."  </P> <P> For the Soviet artist, the agents agree, it's better. Gosconcert, a division of  the Ministry of Culture -- gos standing for government or state -- no longer  holds the monopoly on who can perform abroad and for how much.  </P> <P> "It's not just a question of (us) making money," Lamont said. "These are people  who have been locked up or limited in their touring . . . . I have to tell you  I really feel for these people. I see the lines they stand on. I see the way  they live. I know the way they've been paid in the past. Gosconcert may have  received $3,000; that artist might have gotten $250 . . . . We're talking about  people coming out, sharing their arts, and there's some very great art in the  Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Gosconcert's monopoly ended 13 months ago. Artists can go through other  government agencies such as the cultural ministries in the various republics,  through certain unions, through an organization called Sovinart run by a former  top official at Gosconcert and through the state record company Melodia.  </P> <P> Artists can also have exit permits arranged through certain cooperatives --  government-licensed private businesses -- such as Unex, an export/import  company whose business is recycling paper goods or trash. In La Jolla, Hughes  flashes a business card from the Moscow-based cooperative. Through Unex, he  pays his representative in Moscow -- Galena Bokareva who worked at Gosconcert  -- who will help bring the Koslov Youth Ensemble.  </P> <P> Anthony Phillips, director of international operations for Entertainment  Corp.'s parent company, said he believed "(conductor Gennady) Rozhdestvensky  was instrumental in getting the legislation changed."  </P> <P> In the summer of 1988, after reported mistakes in scheduling and repertory, the  conductor canceled several U.S. appearances claiming that he did not have to  abide by the contractual arrangements made by Gosconcert. There had also been  an apparent dispute over his fee. Brightman later revealed that after the  dispute was resolved, Rozhdestvensky's share was "more like 50-50" -- as  opposed to his previous share of only 20%. And he got an open visa.  </P> <P> The conductor's current contractual relationships in the Soviet Union are  unclear. Asked whether he still has the 50-50 arrangement, Columbia Artists  President Ronald Wilford -- who now handles the account -- allowed: "I don't  know that he pays Gosconcert. I don't even know if he's with Gosconcert."  </P> <P> Increasingly Soviet artists and companies consult with their Western managers,  though the actual contracts are drawn up by Gosconcert or some other agency.  "Now they mostly all have a say," notes Lamont. " 'We only want to do four  concerts a week, we won't travel more than four hours on the day of a concert'  -- that's getting closer to the European/American level of working, where at  least the artists have some control over what they do."  </P> <P> Meanwhile there has been a change at the top of the Ministry of Culture. The  new minister is Nikolai Gubenko, an actor at Moscow's Taganka Theater who was  playing the title role in "Boris Godunov" at the time of his appointment last  November. The year before, Gosconcert -- an arm of the ministry -- also got a  new chief: Vladimir Panchenko, a top official of the Composers Union.  </P> <P> "He speaks very good English," Dillingham said of Gubenko. "Very quiet -- not  shy, but reserved. And he's very serious about continuing the perestroika,  restructuring the whole arts infrastructure in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Dillingham disclosed that at Gubenko's request, his agency prepared two  reports. "He asked us to give him a comprehensive report on the contractual  relationships between performing artists and their employers and unions in this  country, and secondly on social welfare programs as they impact performing  artists -- unemployment insurance, health insurance, disability . . . ."  </P> <P> The reports were sent to Moscow in January.  </P> <P> In late March, Lamont was in Moscow for a seminar at the Ministry of Culture.  "I had suggested to USIA (United States Information Agency) and the Soviet  Embassy that we carry on something like this," she said. "With the co-opting  and privatization of enterprises in the Soviet Union, there are suddenly a lot  of people who are getting into touring or presentation of the performing arts  who've never had to go through the mechanics before and truly don't know the  steps that have to be taken . . . .  </P> <P> "We dealt with the crowded market, we dealt with contracts, we dealt with  negotiations," Lamont said. "Basically the Russians have always felt that we in  the United States are there to cheat them out of money . . . just a suspicion  that exists that 'you're trying to take advantage of us,' that 'you're really  making all of this money and it should be coming to us' without understanding  or ever having had to deal with expenses."  </P> <P> And Sheldon explained that "it's almost impossible to find someone who speaks  with real authority. Previously if you spoke to Gosconcert, if you made a deal,  that was it" -- though he also pointed out that there have been times when an  artist was promised and failed to show when the plane landed at Kennedy  Airport. "Now they're in an era where they can't be authoritative. They have to  go and get the artist's consent just like we've had to do for decades . . . .  </P> <P> "They don't trust the West," Sheldon continued, "so they always think if  somebody offers them something, there's a reason they didn't offer them more .  . . . And when you say, 'Do we have an agreement?' and they say, 'Yes,' you  really have to find out if that means anything.  </P> <P> "What's hard is that their need and their drive for hard currency make the  negotiations a little difficult," he added. "And they have had 70 years, maybe  more, of distrust. Of themselves as well . . . . You never know who is the  informer, you never knew who was your friend, so there is a psychology of  mistrust."  </P> <P> With the street-smart scrappiness of someone who rose from a secretary to the  head of her company, ICM's Lamont laces her conversation with little needles at  her major agency rivals. She's hardly alone. Going from one agency to the  other, you hear bits of sniping on all sides.  </P> <P> Puffing away at a cigarillo, talking about her tour with Yevgeny Svetlanov and  the U.S.S.R. State Symphony (billed then as the Moscow State Symphony), she  whispered: "He's now with CAMI (Columbia Artists). For a long time, Gosconcert  would not work with Columbia, and then they started to work with them." And she  said the "logical thing" for Gosconcert to say to Columbia was, " 'Moscow  State, you can have that . . . .' "  </P> <P> "I didn't bid for the Bolshoi or the Kirov," she said, "although it was put up  on the block. 'You can have it if you pay X dollars.' . . . (The amount) I'm  not going to quote. I can tell you it was above the logical market value. . .  ."  </P> <P> Of the Bolshoi, she adds: "There aren't the big stars there used to be . . . ."  </P> <P> Over at Columbia, using a cigarette for emphasis, Sheldon had already raised  the matter of the Svetlanov acquisition. "Svetlanov, who had toured with ICM,  wouldn't do it anymore for reasons I don't know. He just wouldn't do it," he  said with lawyerly deliberation. "He wanted to be in Columbia. He made his  decision before I ever went to Moscow. . . . So it was incumbent on Gosconcert  to get him with another tour manager for the future, so literally that was the  first thing they presented . . . ."  </P> <P> The same applied to violinist Vladimir Spivakov and his 28-ensemble Moscow  Virtuosi chamber orchestra, which had been with Entertainment Corp. "Once the  Soviets would deal with Columbia," noted Sheldon, "he wanted to be back. His  mind had never been different."  </P> <P> Sheldon quickly moves onto a tour in early 1989 handled by Entertainment Corp.  "The Osipov Balalaika Orchestra should have been a success. We brought it a  couple of times in the '70s with a lot of success . . . . I have been told by  different people, including some from Classical Artists, that the tour lost  $300,000."  </P> <P> Dillingham says that the Osipov tour happened before he went to the company  last summer. On the Bolshoi he dismisses the notion that the company went to  the highest bidder as well as the devaluation of its company. "Look at the  those (star) names on our press release."  </P> <P> "We're going to be very professional," he says. "We're not going to run down  other people's tours or tell you that this company or that company's been doing  lousy business. . . . It's an insult to the artist and may not have been his  fault . . . . You're not going to get ICM to tell you, 'Oh yeah, we took a bath  on that.' "  </P> <P> And about their "active" competition, Dillingham laughed. "Competition is  competition. That's what perestroika is all about. We're an embodiment of  Western capitalistic competition."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A waning of the panic which set in on local currency  markets yesterday saw the financial rand [finrand] recouping  part of its heavy losses to close at 5 rands 34 cents to the  dollar this afternoon. This is a 25-cent improvement on  yesterday's close. It is reported that one huge finrand sell  order triggered yesterday morning's selling spree. The  commercial rand hit yet another new low today, closing at just  over 3 rands 60 cents to the dollar. The depreciation of the  rand is in line with a sharp rise in the dollar against the  German Mark since yesterday.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Observer: Greek to me No surprise that ubiquitous Tony O'Reilly - top bean at Heinz, balked bidder for Fairfax, rugby legend etc etc - should be spreading his ample self yet thinner, this time as chairman of a new 'European advisory board' at Bankers Trust. However, also on the list of Bankers' luminous European experts is 'a private investor with interests in shipping, real estate and insurance'. That is Greek-born Chryss O'Reilly, the Goulandris shipping heiress, who also happened to emerge last year as the second Mrs O'Reilly. 'What kind of question is that?', the bank's mouthpiece snapped when asked why it sought her wisdom on European strategy. The multi- millionairess had been invited on to the board in her own right in advance of tying the knot with the gifted Irishman. Yet according to one of her acquaintances, a fellow Greek, the expert horsewoman never showed much interest in business before.</p>

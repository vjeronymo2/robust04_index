			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China is speeding up  drafting of its first law on negotiable instruments, in a bid to  ensure their safe and smooth circulation.    An official from the Bureau of Legislative Affairs under the  State Council said here today that the legislation on negotiable  instruments in China has become increasingly imperative as the  market economy is developing rapidly.    Speaking at a seminar on negotiable instruments held by the  Chinese Chamber of International Commerce (CCIC) and the Chamber  of International Commerce, the official said that the National  People's Congress and the State Council have attached great  importance to the work on such a law.    The legislative branch has already put the draft and viewing  of the law on its top agenda.    China began its work on drafting the law in 1990 and the  initial draft has taken shape.    The official said that the drafting group did research not  only on the use and circulation of domestic negotiable  instruments but made studies on the relevant laws abroad.    Xu Dayou, vice president of CCIC, said that the seminar was  aimed at better understanding foreign laws on negotiable  instruments and international experiences in the area by Chinese  lawyers, financiers and industrialists, in order to standardize  Chinese actions of negotiable instruments in international trade  and investment fields and ensure the normal use and circulation  of negotiable instruments.    During the two-day meeting, experts on checks and bills from  the Chamber of International Commerce and Britain will exchange  views with Chinese legislators and financiers on international  norms on rules, structures, sorts and actions of negotiable  instruments as well as the current situation of the use of  negotiable instruments in China.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South African Police Union [SAPU] has called off  a strike planned for tomorrow, but there are renewed threats of  disruptions during the election by SAPU, pending the outcome of  salary negotiations. Anne-Marie Coetzee reports:    [Begin recording] [Coetzee] The strike was averted following  a decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to grant  policemen on active duty daily allowances of 61 rands 50 cents,  the same as received by members of the National Peacekeeping  Force. The question of disparity between the basic salaries of  the two forces has not been solved as yet. The police union  says if the TEC does not react positively to their salary  demands within 2 weeks, they will consider action.    [SAPU spokesman Pieter-Don Brandt] One of the disruptive  actions that are coming from grassroots is to say that we are  not going to guard election posts. We will keep on addressing  crime problems in the community, but certain actions around the  elections, around the election stations, we will disrupt.    [Coetzee] In its reaction to the threat the police pointed  out that SAPU, with its official membership of 7,000,  constitutes less than 10 percent of the police force. Police  say any member of the force taking part in a strike can be  dismissed on the spot. [end recording]</p>

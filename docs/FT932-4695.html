			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Thatcher reopens Tory wounds over Maastricht: Lords speech presses fresh case for referendum BARONESS Thatcher reopened deep Tory party wounds over Europe yesterday by launching in the House of Lords a fresh campaign to force a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The former prime minister said she would never have signed the treaty, and told Mr John Major that Britain had more to lose than any other European Community country under it. Without a referendum on the treaty, the government would 'betray' the people's trust in the UK's parliamentary system. Lady Thatcher warned that Maastricht would turn the British and other EC parliaments into 'little more than an agency' of the European Commission and Council because of the 'massive extension' of powers to Brus-sels. Her calculated remarks will serve as a rallying point for Euro-sceptic lords, adding further to the sense of disarray in Mr Major's Conservative party. Lady Thatcher's outburst revived tensions that precipitated her downfall as prime minister. Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary - standing just behind her - warned that Euro-sceptics had moved 'into a position which now, alas, is approaching deep hostility to the essence of the Community itself.' Most Euro-sceptic MPs still believe the Lords' overwhelming pro-European slant will allow the Maastricht bill a relatively smooth passage. The Lords will sit three hours earlier than normal today because of the record 130 peers wanting to speak in the second reading debate. No votes are expected this week. Lady Thatcher, heard in near-silence in a crowded chamber, said Maastricht was intended explicitly to pave the way to a European union. She added: 'I suggest we don't want to go any further on that train.' For the government, Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, took a swipe at the former prime minister, saying that Maastricht was 'less far-reaching' than the Single European Act - signed by Lady Thatcher. Lady Thatcher said Maastricht went 'much, much wider' than the Single European Act, extending the powers of the Commission from 11 to 20 areas of government and providing 111 new occasions when decisions can be by qualified majority voting. She attacked the Commission for reneging on assurances that the extension of qualified majority voting needed to create a single market would not interfere with nation states' freedom over fiscal policy, the free movement of people and employees' rights and interests. Those assurances had been given by Lord Howe, she said, but the commission had 'piled on' extra regulations. She welcomed the government's decision to refer the working time directive to the European Court on the ground that it had been enacted wrongly - and against Britain's wishes - under a qualified majority voting. But she said the Court's judges were biased towards an integrated European Community and threatened to undermine the principle of the rule of law on which British democracy was based.

A ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked  Yevgeniy Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian Federation  government apparatus, to comment.    [Ignatyev] Yevgeniy Parfiryevich, on first acquaintance with  the edict the impression is that minor changes have been made to  the structure of government, the number of ministries is little  reduced, and there has been practically no reduction in cabinet  numbers. The question is: Was this restructuring necessary?    [Arefyev] Yes, the media are currently claiming that there  have been no significant changes in the structure of the  government. That is not so. First of all I want to say that  the reorganization of federal organs of executive authority was  necessary in view of the adoption of the Russian Federation  Constitution, since there were many elements in the old  structure that did not correspond to the country's main law.  For instance, we have 22 ministries and 15 state committees.  The latter's chairmen were members of the government, together  with the ministers. Article 110 of the Constitution makes no  provision for that. Point 2 says: "The Government of the  Russian Federation comprises the chairman of the Russian  Federation Government, the deputy chairmen of the Russian  Federation Government, and federal ministers." That is why some  state committees were turned into federal ministries. For  instance, the Russian Federation State Committee for Economic  Cooperation With Commonwealth States was turned into the Russian  Federation Ministry for Cooperation With CIS States. The word  "economic" was deliberately removed from the old name. So the  functions of the new structure have been expanded.    [Ignatyev] So it was decided, as it were, to adapt the new  government structure to the Constitution?    [Arefyev] No. The entire restructuring of the federal  organs of executive authority was a response to the command of  the times, to the new economic and social transformations that  are currently taking place in our country. We are not just  changing nameplates. Indeed, some ministries were created by  combining state committees with other departments with related  functions and activities. For example, the Russian Federation  Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and for Eliminating the  Aftermath of Natural Disasters was the successor to the state  committee of the same name. But it incorporated the functions  of the former Russian Federation State Committee for the Social  Protection of Citizens and Rehabilitation of Territories  Affected by the Chernobyl and Other Radiation Disasters, the  Committee on Special Underwater Work, and the Russian Federation  Air and Space Search and Rescue Service.    [Ignatyev] So there was practically no reduction and some  departments acquired higher status by being revamped or  combined, while others joined other government structures?    [Arefyev] All state committees left the government. Some of  them did become ministries; others were absorbed into new  structures, while nine of the 15 remained autonomous. They are  performing the same functions as before, but they are operating  within the framework of the law. I think this is the right  decision. Irrespective of any change of government, the  leadership of these committees will not now be replaced. As a  rule, they are structures with very specific functions. Their  work requires stability above all else. But some departments,  such as the Russian Federation State Committee for the  Management of State Property, could be turned into ministries,  if necessary. It would require the Federal Assembly's adoption  of a number of amendments to existing laws. Whereupon, the  president would be able to issue an edict transforming the  department. So of the 37 former members of the government who  were heads of ministries or state committees, only 23 remain.  Don't you call that a significant reduction?! We are nearly  matching world standards now.    The world average for cabinet members is between 12 and 25.  We now have a total of 29 instead of 45.    [Ignatyev] Is it possible to say at this point who will be  the top people in the new cabinet? The press has already  suggested the names of Gaydar, Soskovets...    [Arefyev] First of all I want to say that for the moment all  the members of government are performing their duties as before.  None has been dismissed. It is too early to talk about a new  leadership. But if consultations have taken place in this  matter, only two people -- Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Viktor  Stepanovich Chernomyrdin -- can put specific names to the deputy  prime ministers. And the press is misinforming you by  publishing the names of candidates. We will get precise  information in the very near future and we will certainly tell  you.</p>

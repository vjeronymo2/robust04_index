			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Premier's fast fiscal footwork likely to be welcomed by Japan and US: The reforms that follow a year of wrangling Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, yesterday showed himself to be just as unencumbered by ideology as his new partners in the Liberal Democratic party. The fiscal reform package his cabinet approved includes a rise in consumption tax, opposed by Mr Murayama's own Social Democratic party until he ditched its fiscal dogma yesterday, in the interests of keeping the government together and staying in power. Needless to say, the other part of the scheme, cuts in income taxes, will bolster the coalition's recently rising popularity. It will also win some applause from the US government, eager for Japanese consumers to spend more on imports and reduce the politically troublesome trade surplus. The US, never sympathetic to the Japanese finance ministry's attempts to increase the tax base, will be less happy about the rise in the sales levy. Japan's Socialists have thrown out their old policies at high speed, since taking office at the end of June in a three party coalition dominated by their former enemies, the conservative LDP. Opposition to the military and to Japan's security treaty with the US were the first to go; consumption tax is the latest. As a result, what started out only three months ago as one of the oddest political marriages in the world, has grown into an effective working alliance. Yesterday's decision opens the way to ending more than a year of wrangling on tax policy, assuming the SDP can maintain unity on the tax change. It suggests Japan may be less of a political mess than it looks. Mr Murayama's fast fiscal footwork is equalled only by the LDP itself, which took 10 years of painful internal wrangling to get consumption tax introduced in 1989, under pressure from the finance ministry. Late the same year, the LDP nearly scrapped sales tax after losing its majority in the upper house of parliament because of popular resentment of the new levy. Ever since, the finance ministry has been patiently working to bring a rise in Japan's internationally low 3 per cent sales tax. It argues that the government needs to raise more revenue from indirect taxes to make up for an erosion of the income tax base caused by a the rising proportion of pensioners and falling number of wage earners. But the ministry's strategy of adjusting Japan's lop-sided tax base last year became muddled up with the need to cut income taxes to stimulate private spending. Soon after taking office in August 1993, the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, former prime minister, started to plan an income tax cut, under pressure from the US. The finance ministry saw its chance to capitalise on the confusion and achieve that increase in consumption tax, by making it a condition of Mr Hosokawa's income tax cut. The aim was for the tax change to be revenue neutral; that is to say the rise in private income was to be wiped out by the rise in consumption tax, due to take effect in three years' time. Yesterday's package suggests a rise in consumption tax from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, rather than Mr Hosokawa's original scheme for a 7 per cent sales tax, but the broad economic impact will be about the same because the income tax cut is smaller than that proposed by the former leader. Mr Hosokawa went for the ministry's trade-off, but made the mistake of announcing a combined income tax cut and consumption tax rise - last February - without consulting the SDP, the largest partner in his coalition. The ensuing row contributed to the downfall of Mr Hosokawa's government last April and made it impossible for the SDP to trust his main adviser, Mr Ichiro Ozawa. The ensuing government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, also based on Mr Ozawa's influence, managed to struggle on for only two months until the end of June, when a disgruntled SDP threw in its lot with the main opposition party of the time, the LDP. Mr Murayama, a novice in the Japanese cabinet, had little choice but to take the cue from his finance ministry advisers and promised a sceptical Group of Seven meeting, in early July, just days after taking office, that he would produce a tax reform by the end of the year. Ironically, a cut in Japan's official interest rates would have been a faster way to stimulate demand, believes Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities. Japanese direct and indirect tax rates are already low by international standards, while corporation tax rates are higher than average. But an interest rate cut would have weakened the yen, harming US hopes for a smaller trade surplus. That is why the spotlight has been kept on fiscal, rather than monetary policy in US-Japan economic discussions. Washington's fiscal message was driven home again earlier this week in a discreet meeting between Mr Laurence Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs and Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former LDP prime minister who is now the government's behind-the-scenes dealmaker. It has left Japanese bureaucrats with an uncomfortable feeling that the US had succumbed to the temptation to intervene in domestic politics. But for better or worse, that political decision clears the way for a tax package to be presented to parliament at the next session, opening on September 30. If Mr Murayama's Socialist followers prove as fast on their feet as he, Japan's surprising new government will surprise its critics and deliver on tax, where two previous administrations failed.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / HK warning on China investors FOREIGN investment in China will be affected if the current Sino-British dispute about the political development of Hong Kong drags on for months, Mr Willie Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, one of the largest business groups in Hong Kong, said yesterday. He said the decision by Standard &amp; Poors, a US credit rating agency, to put Hong Kong on its 'watch' list last Monday was not itself serious. However if S&amp;P decided to downgrade Hong Kong in the New Year then investors in the US and Europe would note it. Hong Kong's senior foreign currency is rated A and its local currency is rated A+. 'If (the row) drags on it will reduce the trend of strong investment flows into China,' Mr Purves said in an interview. 'Businessmen do not like uncertainty.' Mr Purves, who is also a member of Governor Chris Patten's Executive Council, would not give his personal view on the political row. However, Mr Li Ka-shing, a former director of the bank and one of Hong Kong's richest men, has come out against the governor's proposals. Mr Li, one of the colony's most astute entrepreneurs, has been drawing closer to Beijing over the past year as China's embrace of the market economy has gathered pace. Mr Li was yesterday reported in Wen Wei Pao, a pro-Beijing daily, as saying the Hong Kong people wanted prosperity, stability and a smooth transition of sovereignty in 1997. He said the Basic Law - the colony's post-1997 mini-constitution - was a good document. Mr Purves said he had not detected any significant change in the business climate in Hong Kong that could be related to the current political row. There had been a slowdown in applications for residential mortgages, 'but I think it is unrelated - and was happening anyway - to the political dispute.' He did, however, foresee difficulties for Hong Kong if the row continued.</p>

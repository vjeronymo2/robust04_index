			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROADS: PROJECT;  </P> <P> ROAD PROJECT TO TIE UP TRAFFIC NEAR AIRPORT  </P> <P> On an average day, more than 27,000 vehicles use Campus Drive near John Wayne  Airport.  </P> <P> But starting Monday, airport officials predicted, traffic there will be  anything but average. Officials foresee major rush-hour tie-ups.  </P> <P> That's the day that extensive road widening work will begin, adding two lanes  to the four-lane thoroughfare between MacArthur Boulevard and Bristol Street.  The new lanes will cover a strip of what is now Airport Way South and the  median between Airport Way and Campus Drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Route Recommended  </P> <P> In addition, the northbound entrance to the airport from Campus Drive will be  closed, as drivers will not be able to turn left there from Campus. However,  drivers traveling south will still be able to turn right at that entrance.  </P> <P> For two to four months, then, officials said, the only other entrance to the  airport will be from MacArthur Boulevard.  </P> <P> Officials recommend that drivers use Birch Street as an alternative route.  </P> <P> Because Campus Drive serves many airport-area businesses, airport officials  earlier this year met with local business owners to discuss the project's  effect on them and ways to notify the public that their businesses would remain  accessible.  </P> <P> Aviation firms on Airport Way South alongside Campus Drive will remain open;  access will be available on driveways through the construction area, officials  said.  </P> <P> The southbound exit from the existing passenger terminal to Campus Drive will  also remain open.  </P> <P> Work on the $3.5-million project actually began with the relocation of utility  lines in May. The project is expected to be completed in March, 1990.  </P> <P> The project also includes widening the Campus Drive bridge over the Corona del  Mar Freeway. Work to widen Campus Drive at the MacArthur Boulevard intersection  is scheduled to begin in mid to late 1990, officials said.  </P> <P> The road-widening is part of the airport expansion program, the total cost of  which is estimated at $310 million. That figure includes $50 million for a new  passenger terminal and for new roadways, taxiways, aircraft aprons and parking  garages.  </P></p>

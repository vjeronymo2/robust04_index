			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Coalition likely to cut subsidies JAPAN'S new government is to scale back plans for public subsidies for political parties by half, to heal a potentially embarrassing rift with its largest coalition member. The seven coalition groups expect today to agree draft proposals for a Y300bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year public political subsidy, said officials. This would replace corporate donations and is equivalent to Y250 per taxpayer each year. Last month, the coalition partners provisionally agreed a Y600bn annual subsidy, only to be embarrassed when the defeated LDP counter-proposed Y300bn. This jeopardised the popular new government's image as the bringer of a change in political style from the LDP, whose downfall came partly due to public disgust at its dependence on large corporate donations. Ministers hurriedly explained that the Y600bn figure was only tentative, after objections from the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, whose chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana, happens to be minister for political reform. The subsidy is part of a package of political reforms, including a new single-seat constituency electoral system.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANEL SEES THREAT TO 30,000 JOBS HERE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD LEAVE  RATHER THAN IMPLEMENT COSTLY NEW CLEAR AIR RULES.  </P> <P> Tough clean air rules could cost 30,000 jobs if Southern California companies  leave the region rather than implement costly anti-smog regulations, a  coalition of business and labor leaders said Monday.  </P> <P> The Southern California Coalition for Jobs and a Clean Environment delivered a  simple message to the South Coast Air Quality Management District: Let's talk.  </P> <P> "We want clean air. We want clean water. But at the same time, the quality of  life is dependent on having a job," said William Campbell, president of the  California Manufacturers Assn.  </P> <P> The coalition said 106 companies in the region estimated they would lose  between 24,000 and 30,000 jobs during the next decade because of the new clean  air rules.  </P> <P> With an existing 6.7% unemployment rate in California, the area can ill afford  to lose the jobs, industry leaders told reporters at a Greater Los Angeles  Press Club news conference.  </P> <P> The survey was taken in reaction to rules imposed by the AQMD, the regional  agency assigned to battle the country's worst smog. Its regulations are so  far-reaching that critics say they will stifle the regional economy.  </P> <P> District spokesman Bill Kelly estimated costs for complying with the rules  adopted in March, 1989, would vary widely. A large power plant might pay  roughly $8 million per smokestack, while a dry cleaning operation might pay  several thousand dollars for new equipment.  </P> <P> Campbell said business leaders are concerned about environmental issues, and  that fewer jobs would be lost if they could sit down and discuss "creative"  ideas with district officials.  </P> <P> Campbell cited Unocal's recent program under which gas-guzzling older model  cars were purchased and snatched from roadways as being better than sweeping  directives which simply indicate what a business cannot do.  </P> <P> The year-old coalition includes the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, the  Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the California Manufacturers Assn. and  the Ethnic Coalition of Southern California.  </P> <P> Coalition members asked to meet with district Chairman Norton Younglove to  discuss its recommendations.  </P> <P> Those include providing job retraining and turning the AQMD's public advisory  office into an ombudsman to help small businesses deal with the regulations.  </P> <P> District spokesman Tom Eichhorn said he was surprised by the appeal for  discussions.  </P> <P> "I thought we had been talking," he said. "We're willing to meet with them any  time they want. We want dialogue. However, we still have a bottom line of  emissions reduction we have to meet."  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Murray Johnstone slashes entry charge for unit trusts MURRAY JOHNSTONE, the Glasgow-based fund management group, is cutting the initial charge on its unit trusts from about 5 per cent to 1 per cent in a move which could spark competition in the retail investment industry, Phillip Coggan writes. The unitholder pays the initial charge as part of a spread between the offer price (at which the investor buys) and the bid price (at which the investor sells). The greater the spread, the more the fund will have to rise in value before the investor makes a profit. By cutting the initial charge the spreads on Murray Johnstone's funds will average about 2.6 per cent, compared with an average of about 6 per cent for the sector. In other words, investors backing these funds will have a 'head start' of more than 3 per cent. Murray Johnstone is raising its annual charge from 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. But this higher level is not unusual. In the US many mutual funds (the equivalent of unit trusts) have small or non-existent initial charges. These 'no-load funds' have cornered a big share of the market. The problem in establishing such funds in the UK has been distribution. Most unit trusts are sold through independent financial advisers, who receive a 3 per cent commission which is deducted from the initial charge. Although Murray Johnstone is offering a renewal commission of 0.5 per cent to advisers who keep their clients in the trusts for a year, the group may find they will lack sufficient incentive to recommend its trusts. Murray may have to rely on direct telephone sales or on fee-charging advisers. In the last financial year unit trusts have been hard-pushed to compete with investment trusts, their publicly quoted rivals, and this move may be a sign of competitive pressures in the industry. Mr Graeme Farquharson, investment director of Hill Martin, the financial adviser group, said: 'It is an interesting move and I would not be surprised if it doesn't prompt other unit trust managers to do it.'</p>

			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Not good advice Sir, Michael Dixon's relaying of advice from a marketing consultant working from New York (Recruitment, June 3) that the way round the secretary barrier is to misplace the word 'not' can only result in increasing isolation for top UK managers now that their secretaries will rigorously filter out all calls from 'we've met before' claimants. Perhaps the marketing consultant, who advises on the packaging of ideas and products, should champion a telephonic lie-detector, the US market for which, on this evidence, should be quite large.

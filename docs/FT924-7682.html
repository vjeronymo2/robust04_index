			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: A DIY fund that pays double dividends - Planning Your Pension SMALL family businesses struggling to survive the UK recession could be forgiven for ignoring their pension planning in the light of more pressing financial needs. However, under a small self-administered scheme (SSAS), it is possible to provide for directors' pensions while simultaneously using the fund to develop the business. In particular, the fund can be used to purchase business premises and to provide a sizeable loan to the company. SSASs are extremely tax efficient and offer considerable investment scope. The directors of the company, as trustees of the scheme, can select and control the investment portfolio themselves or appoint a stockbroker to manage it. These schemes are complex and require expert help to ensure the company complies with Inland Revenue and Department of Social Security (DSS) regulations. Non-compliance could lead to the loss of tax approval. The schemes became popular in the late 1970s; today more than 30,000 small businesses use an SSAS as their main pension arrangement. Membership, which normally is restricted to a maximum of 12, can be extended to any employee but generally is limited to directors of the company. This makes sense if the fund will be used for commercial purposes, since the agreement of all members is essential, particularly where self-investment is concerned. As an occupational scheme, the employer's contributions are tax deductible and the employee's contributions, if applicable, attract tax relief at the highest marginal rate. Advisers usually recommend that the scheme is funded solely through employer contributions since this reduces the National Insurance bill. Other attractions include tax-free growth of the fund, a tax-free sum of up to four times annual salary on death before retirement, and a tax-free cash sum at retirement worth up to 1 1/2 times annual salary. Spouse and dependants' benefits are automatically included and the scheme can also provide a tax-free lump sum on death during retirement. The pension, worth up to two-thirds of final salary, is taxed as income. For SSASs established after March 1987, a maximum pension can be built up after 20 years. Although the pension is linked to final salary, the SSAS fund grows on a money purchase basis and therefore its value will depend on the success of the investments. At retirement, the SSAS fund is used to purchase an annuity which provides income for life. One attraction of the SSAS is that you can choose to buy the annuity at the most advantageous time during the five-year period after retirement. Where the employee does pay contributions, these are limited to a maximum of 15 per cent of salary. Some higher earners may be caught by the 'earnings cap' which was introduced in the 1989 Budget. For the current tax year, the cap restricts to Pounds 75,000 the salary that can be taken into account for contributions and the pension itself. This limits maximum employee contributions for 1992/93 to Pounds 11,250 and the maximum pension to Pounds 50,000. It affects those who joined a new occupational scheme set up after March 14 1989, and new members who joined an existing scheme after June 1 1989. The Revenue does not impose a limit, as such, on employer contributions to the SSAS. Instead, the contribution is based on the projected final salary at retirement. This flexibility is useful during years of profit when high pension contributions can be paid to offset corporation tax. However, there is a concern that the threatened Revenue clampdown on executive pension plan (EPP) contributions might also affect SSASs. EPPs are similar to SSASs but the entire contribution must be invested in insured funds. At present, under an EPP and SSAS it is possible to justify employer contributions of over 100 per cent of salary for employees in their twenties. This would be cut to about 25 per cent of salary if the proposed EPP rule change extends to SSASs. Under Revenue rules, you can only run one SSAS at a time which makes the choice of provider extremely important. There are two options. Fully self-administered schemes are generally offered on a fee basis and are available from about 60 firms of solicitors, actuarial consultants and life offices. These provide all the administration and legal requirements including audited annual accounts, three-yearly actuarial valuations and a 'pensioneer' trustee service. A pensioneer trustee is a professional trustee approved by the Revenue, whose chief function is to oversee the winding up of the scheme if it is terminated. If the trustees appoint a stockbroker as manager there will be an extra fee. The second option is a 'hybrid' SSAS offered by about 30 insurance companies. Under this, a significant annual contribution - usually about Pounds 5,000 in total - must be paid into an insurance fund, while contributions in excess of this can be self-administered. The insurance companies deduct a percentage of contributions and may also have other fixed charges. As a rule of thumb, hybrid SSASs which charge on a percentage basis are thought more cost-effective for annual premiums of less than Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 12,000. Where contributions exceed this amount, the flat rate fees charged on fully self-administered SSASs look attractive. The decision to go the wholly self-administered route is not just a matter of cost but also depends on the extent to which the directors of the company want to have control over their investments. SSASs can invest in quoted stocks and shares, pooled investments such as unit and investment trusts, cash funds, and commercial property. Occasionally it may be possible to invest in mixed commercial / residential properties. It is also possible to invest in unquoted shares but strict guidelines must be followed. In fact, most SSASs are predominantly invested in cash and property. Trustees cannot buy an investment from, or sell an investment to, a scheme member. In August 1991, the Revenue issued new investment rules for SSASs. In particular, companies must report and submit documentation to the Revenue within 90 days if there is any investment or sale of property and unquoted shares. Reportable transactions also include any loans to connected companies and borrowing. Adrian Waddingham, partner with actuarial consultants Barnet Waddingham, warned: 'It is essential that directors are aware of the investment transactions that must be reported, and the time limits, otherwise they could inadvertently lose Revenue approval.' Also in 1991, the Revenue limited loanbacks from the pension fund to 25 per cent of the fund value during the first two years of the scheme, and 50 per cent thereafter. Previously, the limit had been 50 per cent from the outset. Apart from the loanback facility, it is also possible for trustees to borrow against the scheme's assets provided Revenue rules are followed. Property is important to small companies, many of which use their SSAS fund to purchase business premises. This must be done on an arms-length basis and a commercial rent must be charged. In March this year, the DSS introduced regulations that restrict self investment to 5 per cent for most pension schemes. SSAS funds are exempt from the rules, provided: All members of the scheme are trustees All members agree in writing before the self-investment is transacted. This includes property let to the company. Finally, Schedule D taxpayers such as professional partnerships and practices cannot set up an SSAS but similar facilities are available through a self-administered personal pension (SAPP), run by several life offices and stockbrokers and through 'private funds', only run by a few life offices.</p>

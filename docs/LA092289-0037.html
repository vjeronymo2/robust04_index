			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: IN THE GROOVE  </P> <P> Cross Michael Jackson's greatest-hits album off your Christmas wish list. The  release has been pushed back to next year. A source at Epic Records, Jackson's  label, says the performer has written a lot of new songs and wants to finish  recording them all before choosing several to include in the package. There is  a possibility that more than two or three new songs will be included in the  multi-record set, but there are no official plans for an entire new album at  this time.

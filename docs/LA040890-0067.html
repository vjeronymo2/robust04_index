			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSTALLMENT SALES BENEFIT BUYERS AND SELLERS;  </P> <P> TAXES: ADVANTAGES ARE AVAILABLE TO BOTH PARTIES WHEN THE SELLER HELPS TO  FINANCE THE TRANSACTION.  </P> <P> Smart real estate buyers and sellers understand the tax benefits of deferred  payment sales, also known as installment sales. The major advantages for  property sellers include a quick easy sale for top dollar, interest income  higher than can be earned with safety elsewhere, and profit tax deferral until  the buyer makes principal payments to the seller.  </P> <P> Advantages for realty buyers include easy financing, no red tape obtaining a  new mortgage and an affordable, often below-market interest rate.  </P> <P> Effective Jan. 1, 1988, Congress changed the installment sale rules applicable  to realty sales up to $5 million. When the seller helps finance the sale, such  as by carrying back a first or second mortgage for the buyer, the seller pays  tax on the sale profit as principal payments are received over future years  from the buyer.  </P> <P> A minimum interest rate, usually at least 9%, must be charged on the unpaid  balance. Interest, of course, is fully taxable income in the tax year received.  </P> <P> The installment sale election is automatic. However, a deferred payment seller  can "unelect" and report the entire sale profit in the year of sale. If the  seller has offsetting losses, reporting all the sale profit in one year can be  advantageous. However, such an election cannot be revoked without IRS  approval.After the sale, if the property seller pledges or sells the  installment sale note, such as borrowing against it at a bank, the loan  proceeds become taxable as a payment received on the installment sale  obligation. This hypothecation rule applies to installment loans created after  Dec. 17, 1987.  </P> <P> When an installment sale of real estate is made to a related party, defined as  spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister, controlled corporation  and related partnership or family trust, if the buyer disposes of the property  within two years, the sale profit will be taxed back to the original  installment sale seller.  </P> <P> This rule prevents shifting profits to taxpayers who may be in more favorable  income tax situations. However, installment sales incident to divorce or legal  separation are not subject to this provision.  </P> <P> In special situations where the ultimate price of the property is contingent on  a future event, such as a land seller sharing in subdivision resale profits,  the seller can use an installment sale even though total profit is indefinite.  This arrangement allows the buyer to conserve down payment cash while  developing the property and enhancing its future value.  </P> <P> Installment sales also are allowed even when the buyer wants to make full  payment for the property, but the seller wants to avoid receipt of all the  sales price in one tax year. An escrow agreement can authorize installment sale  proceeds to be held in an escrow trust beyond the property seller's control.  The advantage for the seller is tax deferral, even though the buyer gets full  use of the property without a mortgage encumbrance to the seller. For further  installment sale details, please consult your tax adviser.  </P> <P> Reprints of this entire series of "1990 Realty Tax Tips -- 12 Chapters of Tax  Saving Ideas" by Robert J.

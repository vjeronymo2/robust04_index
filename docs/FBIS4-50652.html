			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Red Cross Society  of the People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today repeated its  demand that Seoul return two soldiers detained since the Korean  War.    In a telephone message, the acting chairman of the Central  Committee of DPRK's Red Cross Society, Yi Song-ho, told South  Korean Red Cross President Kang Yong-hun that Seoul should  return the two Korean People's Army soldiers, Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan.    DPRK's red cross has sent messages to its South Korean  counterpart on April 26 and 27, demanding the return of the two  prisoners of war.    However, the South Korean Red Cross has made no response.    "This cannot be deemed righteous behavior on the part of the  Red Cross officials whose essential mission is to show noble  humanitarianism by saving human beings from misfortunes and  helping them," Yi said.    The two soldiers were taken prisoners by the U.S. Forces  while engaging in guerrilla activities in the South Korean area  during the Korean war, he noted.    "They are obviously prisoners of war taking in account  international law, and your side is obliged to send them back to  our side," read the message.    Yi urged the South Korean Red Cross not to follow the south  side's authorities pursuing north-south confrontation, but to  remain faithful to its duty as a Red Cross organization.    Meanwhile, Yi also asked the south to allow Kim Chi-hyon,  daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, who was an unconverted prisoner, to  return to DPRK for medical treatment.    Kim Chi-hyon, who was born in the north, was suffering from  "a serious illness," according to the message.</p>

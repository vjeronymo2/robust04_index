			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Strike 'fails to halt many pits' BRITISH COAL said that half its 40 operational pits were producing coal yesterday in spite of a 24-hour strike called by the National Union of Mineworkers in protest at pit closures. British Coal said this was twice the number of collieries that produced coal on the first one-day stoppage on April 2. But it would not specify how many miners reported for work. The corporation suggested that pits were operating far beyond the moderate Nottinghamshire coalfield, which as a stronghold of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers did not strike. But it would not specify which areas these were. It added that many miners were also reporting for work at other collieries where they were carrying out installation and salvaging work. Mr Kevan Hunt, employee relations director, said: 'An increasing number of NUM members have recognised the futility of staying away from work in a protest to save their jobs. 'Mineworkers at pits producing today are giving a clear message that industrial action is not the answer to the changes facing the coal industry at this time,' he added. Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire area of the NUM, accused the corporation of 'propaganda'. He said the only jobs being undertaken were concerned with safety and maintenance. Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM president, said that all the collieries were shut down by the strike. Yesterday British Coal announced the end of production at two more mines, Clipstone and Bevercote on the Nottinghamshire coalfield. From this weekend all development work will end and production will cease on April 30. For the time being the two pits will be placed on a care and maintenance basis. It added there would be no compulsory redundancies with redeployment of men to other pits.</p>

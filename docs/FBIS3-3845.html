			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Geng Jun (5105 6511) and Xiao Rui (5135 3843)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Shandong is  called the "black horse" of China's economic development. What  is its attitude toward the tax-sharing system? Shandong  Governor Zhao Zhihao, who is also a deputy to the National  People's Congress, said: We are all for it!    When asked by these reporters about the tax-sharing system,  Zhao Zhihao replied by raising a hypothetic question: "If the  State lacks financial resources and a competent national defense  and is confronted with disasters, which localities will be able  to solve their problems by themselves? Without a sense of  overall situation, it will be difficult for the state to achieve  development. If the state runs into difficulties and pressure  is coming from the outside, which localities can solve problems  in lieu of the state?"    Zhao Zhihao continued his response by making a comparison:  "It is an long-acknowledged fact that Shandong has rich  resources and good natural conditions. Prior to reform and  opening up, however, Shandong was always associated with the  word `poverty,' and people always called us "poor Shandong men."  The total economic volume of Shandong is now ranked second  among other provinces in the country. What do we rely on? It  is all due to the positive state policies of reform and opening  up, and Shandong has benefited from these good policies!"    After pondering the matter for a while, Zhao Zhihao made  some  weighty remarks: "If the state runs into financial  difficulties, we should keep the cardinal principles in mind,  take the overall situation into account, and help the state get  over the difficulties. In wartime, 220,000 martyrs from  Shandong Province sacrificed their lives, and today, it is our  duty to make some contributions. Shandong will only be one of  30 provinces in China, even when it becomes richer. A single  flower cannot blossom, but hundreds of flowers can."    Zhao Zhihao told these reporters that, as a governor who was  also in charge of financial work, he started conveying the  importance of financial work to financial officials at all  levels throughout the province: We cannot collect less money  than we should; nor can we collect more. We must turn in the  required funds to the central authorities and never can we be  vague in this respect.    Some localities widened the tax base and made too many  levies  in order to receive more repaid funds after tax from the central  authorities, but Zhao Zhihao opposed this practice. He said:  "This is not only a serious violation of discipline but is also  an irresponsible act toward the enterprises. If enterprise  circulating funds are all considered the base figure, how can  enterprises develop their production, and what can they do in  the future?"    Zhao Zhihao made his final remarks: "Taking the overall  situation into account precisely means taking long-term  interests into account. Our enthusiasm should be used to seize  the opportunity for development offered by the current reform in  taxation and readjust and optimize the economic structure so as  to tap new financial resources.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Burundi PM emerges MS SYLVIE Kinigi, prime minister of Burundi, the East African country's top official since President Melchior Ndadaye was killed in a coup, emerged from 12 days of hiding at the French embassy yesterday to hold talks with army chiefs, Reuter reports from Bujumbura. 'She came out of the embassy guarded by about 20 French soldiers,' a witness said. Ms Kinigi has asked the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity to send in about 1,000 foreign troops to help protect her and government members. The army opposed this and UN undersecretary general James Jonah last night rejected the idea. But the UN appealed for Dollars 17m (Pounds 11.2m) to provide urgent food and shelter to 675,000 Burundi refugees who have fled to three neighbouring states.</p>

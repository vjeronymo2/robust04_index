			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro acquires 20% of Asian broker ABN Amro, the Dutch bank which is attempting to build a large international investment banking business, yesterday said it had acquired a 20 per cent interest in an Asian stockbroker with the intention of acquiring majority control. The bank hopes to build up its stake in HG Asia Group, a leading broker in Asian markets, to majority control within the next year. The HG Asia network was formerly part of Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which ABN Amro acquired two years ago, but was then bought out by its management. Mr Louis de Bievre, the ABN Amro board member responsible for investment banking, said the bank had had 'a rather limited' presence in Asian equities. He said ABN Amro had employed a consultant to look for acquisitions but the HG Asia chance had arisen through past connections. It would not have bought the stake unless it was confident of acquiring majority control. The two other large shareholders in HG Asia are the Guoco Group listed in Hong Kong and HG Asia's management. The Guoco Group is part of the Malaysian Hong Leong Group, a conglomerate headed by Mr Quek Leng Chan. Mr de Bievre said ABN Amro saw Mr Quek's involvement in HG Asia as an important aspect of the purchase because of his contacts in local markets. He said Mr Quek wanted to remain a shareholder, which ABN Amro also wanted.</p>

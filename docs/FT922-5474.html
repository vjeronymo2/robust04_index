			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Cookery Courses: So you want to become a professional chef?  -All over Europe, FT writers have been slaving over hot stoves to pick some of THE ONLY time a professional chef in Europe is likely to participate in a cookery course is when he - or she - is famous enough to run one. From expansive - and expensive - kitchens, Michel Roux discourses on the art of patisserie at the Waterside Inn, Bray, Berkshire. Not far away, Raymond Blanc holds forth at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire. Those with spacious kitchens and rooms have used cookery courses to stimulate takings in the quieter months and preach their vision of cooking. At Ballymaloe House in Cork, Ireland, Darina Allen passes on the cooking she learnt from her mother, Myrtle Allen. At Chateau de Montreuil, in northern France, top chef Christian Germain runs cookery courses in November, December, February and March (tel: 21.81.53.04.) Even those top chefs without their own permanent kitchens have been able to find somewhere to teach. You could stir fry with Ken Hom in the top hotel kitchens of Hong Kong; buy fish at the Venice fish market with Marcella Hazan; or eat, drink and learn with Sacramento wine merchant Darrell Corti in Chianti. The only two conditions arean interest in food and enough money to afford the cost. It is this last condition which has precluded most professional cooks from learning that way. Low wages in the catering trade - at least until you reach head chef status, when you take on administrative duties as well - mean that professional chefs have, devised their own method of further education. Once chef de partie status - a minimum four years' work experience after a college course - has been reached, the chef may be introduced into the stagiere system. The chef will need to be lucky, have an impressive curriculum vitae, and a concerned and well-connected employer. Knives packed, the chef will spend an unpaid week, fortnight (or possibly longer) in one of the Europe's top kitchens. The stagiere network began in the early 1970s when the kitchens and dishes of France's leading chefs - Bocuse, Chapel, Verge and Troisgros, among others - became internationally famous. It started as an informal arrangement: word of mouth recommendations were good enough and no money was involved. The chef gained valuable experience and the kitchen got a free pair of hands. Such has been the success of this system that demand has far outstripped supply. Already this year, Shaun Hill, the popular chef at Gidleigh Park in Devon, has taken six chefs on week-long stages and has received many more applicants. He has, in turn, sent members of his own brigade to work with Raymond Blanc, John Burton-Race at L'Ortolan, in Berkshire, and Andre Jaeger at the Fischerzunft, in Switzerland, and watched them return full of enthusiasm and new ideas. The best chefs today receive hundreds of applications from would-be stagieres from all over the world. Although the practice of taking on young chefs via personal recommendation still persists, top restaurants are beginning to charge handsomely for the privilege of working an unpaid stage. When I asked Christian Germain if he thought this was against the original principles of the system, he scoffed. He said the sums in question, rumoured to vary from Pounds 600 to Pounds 1,000 a person per week, were scant compensation for the sources of supply, recipes and menu ideas which were so promptly borrowed but never acknowledged or returned. The Academy of Culinary Arts based in Brighton, Sussex, planned to run courses for professionals but failed because of lack of support. This contrasts markedly with the situation in the US where the increased demand for professional training has been met by new courses. There are 86 professional programmes and a growing feeling that the culinary world is one suitable for serious academic study. Boston University now offers a 'master of liberal arts: culture and cuisine course.' America has been fortunate in that it has been able to call for funding on another domestic industry with an interest in training professional cooks. For the past decade, a number of leading wineries have brought over chefs to teach and spread the gospel of good food and wine. In 1989, Beringer vineyards set up a culinary arts centre for professional chefs in the grounds of its California winery under the renowned Madeleine Kamman. Each gruelling two-week course takes four chefs from differing standards of restaurants and puts them through their paces. With more than 300 applicants for each course, the hardest decision for senior lecturer Tim Hanni is selecting the chefs (tel: 707-963-7115).</p>

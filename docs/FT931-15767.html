			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Trafalgar House wins Pounds 100m US contract TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the construction, engineering and shipping group, has won a contract worth more than Pounds 100m to build a new coking plant for Bethlehem Steel in the US. The deal, won against stiff competition from US and German rivals, is the second biggest contract won by Trafalgar House since its takeover of Davy, the process plant contractor, in 1991. It comes five weeks after Trafalgar House reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 30.3m for the year ended September 30 after exceptional property write-downs. Trafalgar House, which holds its annual meeting today, has stressed the benefits of acquiring a new 'leg' through Davy's metals and minerals plant contracting expertise. Early last year, it won a Pounds 140m contract for an aluminium strip plant in Egypt. The latest deal, won by Davy International, is a turnkey contract to rebuild Bethlehem's number two coke oven battery at its Burns Harbor, Indiana works. Mr Ian Robinson, chairman of Trafalgar House engineering division, said Bethlehem's investment showed its commitment to maintain its position as one of the leading integrated steel producers in the US. The outlook for steel plant contractors in the US was beginning to improve after a period where clients had been cutting back or delaying investments, he said. The plant is due for completion in early 1995, and will comply with the 1991 US Clean Air Act. Coking, where coal is turned into metallurgical coke for use in the blast furnace, is one of the most environmentally sensitive stages of the steelmaking process.</p>

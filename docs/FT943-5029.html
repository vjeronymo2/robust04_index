			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Airbus Transporting tanks and guns is not so different from carrying passengers and freight, so there is logic in bringing the European Future Large Aircraft project within the Airbus consortium. The move may also bring British Aerospace some advantage in its campaign to persuade the UK government to buy the FLA rather than Lockheed's rival Hercules transport aircraft. Airbus has a track record of delivering aircraft on time and budget, which cannot be said of most military aircraft programmes. If BAe can persuade the government Airbus's good practices can be transferred to the FLA, that could nudge the procurement decision in its favour. Even so, Airbus's consortium structure is only a second-best option compared with an integrated corporation on the lines of Boeing or the soon-to-be-created Lockheed Martin. Airbus is still too wedded to work-sharing arrangements under which many contracts are awarded in proportion to the stakes held by its partners, so blunting its ability to cut costs through competitive tendering. The FLA will follow a similar model. Not only will BAe be cut out of the project if the UK fails to buy the aircraft. It could even lose its position as supplier of Airbus wings to Deutsche Aerospace. Plans to turn Airbus into a more straightforward company have in the past foundered because of political sensitivities. But, with competition in both military and civilian markets stepping up, its cumbersome structure is looking increasingly like an expensive luxury.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Mixed message from mayors of new generation TUESDAY'S elections have brought in a new generation of mayors in many of the largest US cities and mixed up some of the traditional maxims about racial and ethnic divisions in urban politics. Although only a handful of incumbents lost at the polls, in cities like Detroit, Boston and Minneapolis the voting brought down the curtain on an era with the retirement of long-time mayors. In Detroit, Mr Dennis Archer, a former judge running on a low-key platform of good management, defeated Ms Sharon McPhail, the preferred candidate of Mr Coleman Young, who retired after 20 years as mayor of the city. In Boston, Mr Thomas Menino, who became acting mayor when Mr Ray Flynn, the long-time incumbent, was appointed US ambassador to the Vatican, won the office in his own right, breaking a 60-year stranglehold by politicians of Irish descent. In Minneapolis, Ms Sharon Sayles Belton became the city's first woman mayor, after the retirement of Mr Donald Fraser, 14 years in office. In Atlanta, Mr Bill Campbell won 49 per cent of the vote and appeared strongly positioned to win a run-off on November 23 against Mr Michael Lomax. Whatever the outcome Atlanta's new mayor will represent a changing of the guard from Mr Maynard Jackson and Mr Andrew Young, the civil rights era leaders who dominated city politics for the past 20 years. New York was one of the few cities to stage a straightforward battle between a Republican and a Democrat. In many US cities, clean government reforms instituted in the 1920s ban party labels from mayoral elections, while in others - such as Pittsburgh, where Mr Tom Murphy, the Democratic candidate, will succeed the retiring Mayor Sophie Masloff - one party dominates so completely that the race is effectively over once its candidate has been chosen. Although Mr Dinkins lost in New York to Mr Rudolph Giuliani, and an outsider defeated Ms Carrie Saxon Perry, mayor of Hartford, Connecticut, for the last three terms, other incumbents were re-elected. Mr Bob Lanier in Houston, Mr Norm Rice in Seattle and Mr Mike White in Cleveland all proved that incumbency was not a fatal handicap in this year in which many voters seemed ready for a change. Mr Dinkins's defeat, following the retirement earlier this year of Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, means for the first time in two decades, none of the five largest cities in the US will have a black mayor. The messages sent by this election about the importance of race and ethnicity in urban politics are, however, blurred. Ms Belton in Minneapolis and Mr Bill Johnson in Rochester proved, like Mr Rice in Seattle before them, that black candidates could win in cities with mostly white populations. Similarly, Mr Menino proved you no longer had to be Irish-American to win in Boston, while in Tuesday's run-off in Miami there is a chance a non-Cuban, Mr Steve Clark, may win.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Truong Cong Hoa on the 13 </F> June proceedings of the current Ninth National Assembly's fifth  session in Hanoi -- portion recorded]    [Summary] "Dear friends: The Ninth National Assembly's  fifth session entered its 16th work day today with a plenary  meeting under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman  Nguyen Ha Phan."    In the morning session, Minister of Energy Thai Phung Ne  reported on the construction of the North-South 500-kilovolt  power line, stressing the construction process and its  significant role.    Following the energy minister's report, National Assembly  Chairman Nong Duc Manh delivered a speech and highly appraised  the completion of the power line, a major project of our nation.  He said:    [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] "Today, we are very pleased  to hear Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne's report on the  construction and completion of the North-South 500-kilovolt  power line, a major and significant project of our nation. We  welcome the government's close guidance and the uniform and  urgent construction work carried out by various sectors,  echelons, and localities. We highly commend the spirit of  diligence, intelligence, creativity, and boldness shown by all  cadres, workers, and the people to overcome numerous  difficulties and acute ordeals during the building process. They  have, indeed, contributed great efforts and energy to and made  sacrifices for the completion of this important project. We  would like also to thank our friends from around the world for  their assistance to this project.    "Through the construction of this power line, we have not  only built a competent contingent of scientific-technological  cadres for the Vietnam electric sector, but we have also  asserted new progress and our maturity in this field. This  proves that we are able to build and manage major and modern  projects. Also, through this project we have drawn valuable  lessons in mobilizing workers, integrating the combined  strengths of our nation, and attracting international  cooperation in the new situation for the renovation undertaking.    "The North-South power line is the backbone grid of our  national electric network. It is one of the most significant  infrastructure projects built with an aim to attain national  industrialization and modernization. Henceforth, our history  records another route linking the North with the South, that is  the 500-kilovolt power line. This is another manifestation of  our unity and the unification of our fatherland.    "The successful construction of the project is very  significant, yet effective and safe operation of the power line  is much more important. I hope that the electric sector, while  bringing its achievements into full play, will closely  coordinate with various echelons, sectors, and localities to  strictly protect this power line. All responsible agencies must  strive to effectively use this project while ensuring its  optimal safety.    "On this occasion, through the Minister of Energy, we would  like to extend our kind regard and best wishes to cadres and  workers of the electric sector and those who participated in the  construction of this project. We wish all of you a good health  and ever greater achievements so as to positively contribute,  together with people throughout the country, to attaining the  objectives of making our people prosperous, our nation powerful,  and our society just and civilized." [End recording]    Dear friends, also at this morning session, National  Assembly  deputies debated the implementation of the socioeconomic  development program during the first half of this year. All  deputies expressed their unanimous views of the government's  report appraising the situation in four major domains namely the  economy, society, international cooperation, and state  management.    Regarding our legal system, many deputies held that we still  are in need of more laws. They noted, however, that although  many laws were promulgated, their enforcement was not effective  because of the lack of proper guiding documents.</p>

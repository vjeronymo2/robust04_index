			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: Prudential lightens up - A simple software rethink that is saving Pounds 13.5m a year and giving customers a friendlier service From next month, customers of the Prudential, Britain's biggest life insurance company, should notice an improvement in their annual statements. Gone will be bulky standard documents and booklets. In their place will be prettier, slimmer forms, each one containing only information that affects the addressee. It is the realisation of an 18-month marketing project to simplify what customers receive. But behind the marketing revamp lies a simple software rethink that will save the company more than Pounds 13.5m a year in staff and printing costs. The Pru's marketing department began research on Operation Facelift in 1991. The aim was to make friendlier the notoriously complicated forms it sent out to existing customers. At the same time, it wanted to change the way such forms were produced. Traditionally, the Pru sends out its 3m annual statements on 49 different kinds of pre-printed form. It overprints on to each form a statement on the customer's pension plan or life policy. It wanted to be able to produce both pre-printed and statement information simultaneously. Statements would then be printed only when needed. 'We wanted a kind of just-in-time delivery in the financial services market,' says Keith Hicks, brand communications manager. By last spring, the marketing department had decided on specifications for the new product. But the computer department baulked at the prospect of rewriting the software. 'Our software is like an archaeological dig, with 17 or 18 layers that we have built up since the late 1960s,' says Andrew Pinder, director of systems and business operations. Worse than that, he says, each category of product - such as pension plans or life policies - has its own software, written in different languages, some now obsolete. 'If we want to change anything, it's very laborious. It made a lot of sense to try to find something to overlay the archaeological dig.' The task then was to find a single program to fit between all the financial programs and the printing machines. The company began to hunt for an off-the-shelf document processing package that could be bolted on to its IBM mainframe. By the summer of 1992, the Pru had narrowed the search down to two packages: Documerge, from Texan company Image Sciences, and Custom Statement Formatter (CSF) from M&amp;I Data Services of Wisconsin. The Pru ran an in-house evaluation looking at, among other things, ease of amending documents, consumption of computer time, how well each package created the documents, ease of slotting in the new software and cost of maintenance. The final choice was CSF, which, at roughly Pounds 100,000, was several tens of thousands of pounds cheaper than its rival. The design point of the software is that the size of the horizontal divisions is determined by the amount of information that needs to go into the space. But the change also produced savings in two main areas. The Pru's annual printing bill was Pounds 30m. Half of that was on contracted-out lithographic printing for booklets and pre-printed forms. All the litho work has now been transferred on to in-house laser printers. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the in-house printing has improved. Previously, printing machines had to be stopped frequently to switch the paper feed between any of the 49 preprinted forms. There is now only one type of pre-printed sheet. Even though the litho print work is now done in-house, the result of the change is that eight laser printers on two sites have been reduced to six on one. There is also no need now to keep large stocks of each of the different types of form, saving on delivery time, storage and handling. Paper consumption itself is being cut by between half and two-thirds. The pre-printed forms were designed to be overprinted with statement information for any customer, however large. This meant that the forms needed large spaces under each heading. With the new software, the space under each heading varies to fit each customer's information (see graphic). The second area of savings was staff. For example, the laser printers include a barcode on each statement sheet to tell letter stuffing machines which extra leaflets should be included for any customer. Previously much of this work was done manually. The new set-up also needs fewer computer programmers. The software allows changes to documents across the range of products, so there is no need for specialist print program writers working separately on each product. And time and money are saved in the introduction of any new designs. Before, each new design meant a new contract with outside printers and the dumping of obsolete stocks. The new program is still far from perfect. The marketing department has to take its designs to the computer department for re-programming. There are plans to improve this by installing a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (wysiwyg) screen so that new designs can be plugged straight into the printing software. Nor is printer technology yet being properly exploited. The Pru's printers still use 'line mode' whereas the latest lasers have a 'page mode' which allows entire pages to be printed at once. Finally, the Pru is planning to move from IBM's mainframe operating system MVS, which manages the working of the computer, to the rival Unix system which works with computers from many manufacturers, not just IBM. CSF does not yet work with Unix. The Pru is the first insurance company in Europe to install the software, although the European distributor, Geneva-based Lasercom, has sold it to some private Swiss banks. According to Pinder, the Pru is earning 'a very good rate of return in a sensitive part of the industry' on its software investment. Hicks is blunter: 'I'm trying to persuade LaserCom not to sell it to our competitors.'</p>

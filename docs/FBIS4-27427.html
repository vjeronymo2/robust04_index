			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on North Korea's plans to test-fire a  missile, a government source said on 31 May that the DPRK will  test- fire the missile on 7 May at the earliest. The Defense  Agency [DA], which has placed itself on alert, is trying to  collect information.    The United States has provided the DA with information  compiled on the basis of photographs taken by U.S.  reconnaissance satellites. According to that data, trucks loaded  with fuel and cranes are assembling at a launch site in  northeastern North Korea, and the missile's test-launching  process is under way. The DPRK was expected to test-fire the  missile in early June, but the prevailing view is that North  Korea will test-fire it on 7 June because of information  indicating that North Korea needs a few more days to make final  preparations for the launch.    The missile to be test-fired is believed to be the Nodong-1,  which has a range of 1,000 km and which was test-fired last May.    The DA has put Maritime Self-Defense Force P3-C  antisubmarine  aircraft on a state of alert to ready them for patrols over the  Sea of Japan. The Air Defense-Self Force also has placed YS-11E  electronics reconnaissance aircraft and E2-C airborne warning  and control aircraft on standby status. In this way, DA is  making preparations to collect a variety of information on North  Korea's test-firing of the missile.</p>

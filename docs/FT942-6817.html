			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets tumble on inflation fears: Upward revision of US growth estimates to 3% provokes sharp reaction in Europe European financial markets fell sharply yesterday as an upward revision of growth estimates for the US economy in the first-quarter rekindled fears of inflation and further rises in interest rates. The Commerce Department in Washington lifted its growth estimate for the period to an annual rate of 3 per cent from 2.6 per cent, well above expectations and prompting fears that the Federal Reserve may reassess its holding stance on monetary policy. The US news, coupled with concerns that German interest rates had bottomed out, provoked a wave of heavy selling across Europe, hitting stock and bond markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and London, where the FT-SE 100 index closed 53.3 lower at 2,966.4. This was the first time that London had closed below 3,000 since September 1993, and it brought the total fall this week to more than 5 per cent. The US growth figures were released as Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, came under attack on Capitol Hill for tightening US monetary policy too aggressively recently. The Fed has increased short-term rates from 3 per cent to 4.25 per cent since early February. On Wall Street, shares finished marginally higher and bonds recovered from early sharp selling after Mr Greenspan used his testimony to the Senate banking committee to defend past rate increases rather than to prepare the ground for further tightening of policy in the near term. However, he left open the possibility of increases later. The revised growth figures reflected stronger US consumer and government spending than previously thought. That more than offset a downward revision to corporate inventories. The US economy is expected to grow faster again in the second quarter, with estimates of annualised growth ranging from 3.5 per cent to as much as 6 per cent. Senior Democrat members of the committee warned that Fed action would have a 'withering effect' on growth and challenged Mr Greenspan to produce evidence inflation was accelerating. Rate increases announced so far 'would not impede satisfactory economic growth', Mr Greenspan said. The Fed had acted 'in advance of the potential emergence of inflationary pressures, so as to forestall their actual occurrence'. Mr Greenspan said the dollar's recent weakness had been a 'source of some concern' and drew attention to a sharp acceleration in credit growth. Business loans grew at an annual rate of 9.5 per cent in the first four months after declining between 1990 and 1993. Industrial capacity utilisation, at 83.5 per cent, was at its highest since the late 1980s. Mr Greenspan gave the fullest account to date of the Fed's strategy since early February. The Fed had begun to tighten policy partly because it had been worried by a sharp rise in financial asset prices, driven in part by huge investments in stock and bond mutual funds - Dollars 281bn (Pounds 187.3bn) in 1993 alone. The prolonged period of low short-term rates had created a 'false sense of security and certainty' and 'investor complacency'. The Fed chose to raise rates cautiously at first - in quarter-point steps - for fear that a larger move 'would create too big a dose of uncertainty which could destabilise the financial system, indirectly affecting the real economy'. Given the sharp rise in bond yields, 'our worries would appear to have been justified', Mr Greenspan said. He said most of the adjustment in bond and stock prices had occurred by the Fed's policy meeting on May 17. The half-point rate increase announced last week did not produce an adverse market reaction. The overall picture of rising US inflationary pressures and the potential for further Fed tightening left long-dated UK government bonds almost a point lower at the close, driving the yield on benchmark 10-year gilts up to 8.39 per cent from 8.26 per cent. Elsewhere, Paris was hit by substantial US selling orders, pushing the CAC-40 index down 41.22 to 2050.67. French 10-year bonds fell  3/4 of a point and Italian 10-year bonds lost a full point. In Germany, the Dax index closed 10.74 up at 2,140.99. Currencies, Page 15 London stocks, Page 17 World stocks, Page 22 Lex, Page 26 Markets, Weekend II</p>

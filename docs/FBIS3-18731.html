			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 8 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe on Tuesday [8 March] insisted on the need to bring  the Serbs back into the Bosnian peace process, following talks  here with visiting Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.    "There will be no stable and durable solution if the Serb  community is not reinvolved" in the peace process, Juppe said,  adding that France wanted to help in the move.    Silajdzic said he would next visit Moscow and hoped the  Serbs  would rejoin the negotiations. "They are not excluded unless  they exclude themselves," he said.    The Bosnian prime minister said he hoped the Russians would  work for a settlement involving the Serbs.    Juppe meanwhile appeared to rule out the idea of French  reinforcements for UN peacekeepers in Bosnia. "All French  authorities consider that we cannot go beyond our present  commitment. We are the first contributors. We have done our  duty."    French military sources said Monday Paris was considering  strengthening its 2,300 soldiers in Sarajevo with a battalion of  800 men to help enforce a Security Council resolution that calls  for restoration of basic services such as water and electricity  in the Bosnian capital.    France has a total of 6,000 peacekeepers in former  Yugoslavia.</p>

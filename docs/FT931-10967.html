			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Clinton seeks further defence cuts THE CLINTON administration is looking for further cuts in US defence spending, despite warnings that it may prove difficult even to achieve the savings already projected by the Bush administration. Defence Department officials have been asked to find savings of about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.93bn) from the Dollars 280.5bn national defence budget for the 1994 fiscal year, submitted by President George Bush shortly before he left office last month. Press reports said the army, navy and air force would each be asked for Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn in savings on the Bush budget which, although Dollars 6bn higher than last year's defence budget, represented a drop in inflation-adjusted terms. These cuts are expected to require troop reductions beyond levels planned by Mr Bush. Additional savings were expected from the strategic defence initiative, which the administration is expected to strip of the ambitious, space-based components favoured by the Bush and Reagan administrations. President Bill Clinton has promised to cut Dollars 60bn from the defence budget over five years, but Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, has warned that the Bush budget base-lines already assume substantial savings that may be difficult to achieve and include plans for big weapons systems that have not had adequate funds allocated to them over the long term. Mr Aspin is also expected to add funds for some programmes in his budget, especially in the field of helping defence industries convert to civil operations. Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, has sounded even more ominous, cautioning that the department may have overstated the savings from a review of its management practices by as much as Dollars 50bn, and that the Bush plans for a 450-ship navy are unworkable on the money currently budgeted. Congressman John Murtha, chairman of the House sub-committee that approves the details of the defence budget, has also warned that defence savings may prove hard to find unless the US scales down overseas operations such as its present involvement in Somalia.</p>

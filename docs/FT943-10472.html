			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Shanghai A index adds 20% Cautious trading around the 20,600 level limited activity and the Nikkei 225 average lost moderate ground after fluctuating within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 27.40 easier at 20,632.73 after a day's low of 20,592.22 in the morning session and a high of 20,729.25 in the afternoon. Profit-taking orders around the 20,800 mark discouraged active buying, although some individual investors, encouraged by the dollar's rise above Y100 since June 28, bought speculative favourites. Volume rose from 259m shares to 308m. Foreign investors, sellers during the past few weeks, were net buyers but domestic institutions were seen on the selling side. In spite of the decline in the Nikkei 225, the Topix index of all first section stocks put on 0.71 at 1,653.31 and the Nikkei 300 was 0.19 firmer at 300.35. Rises led falls by 523 to 452, with 195 issues unchanged. In London, later, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.46 at 1,343.71. Overseas investors joined in the buying in Mitsubishi Oil shares, which have been actively traded recently by speculative individuals on the company's discovery of two oil wells off the coast of Vietnam. The issue was the day's most active and rose Y30 to Y1,200. Nippon Steel also gained on foreign buying, adding Y8 at Y353. Other steels were also firm, with Sumitomo Metal Industries rising Y7 to Y310 and NKK Y5 to Y266. Profit-taking depressed some high-technology and export-orientated stocks which saw bargain hunting earlier in the week. Fujitsu slipped Y10 to Y1,060 and Sony Y60 to Y5,940, while Toyota Motor lost Y10 at Y2,140. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone ended Y1,000 down at Y861,000 on profit-taking. The issue rose earlier in the day on reports that the government would create a task force on high-technology and telecommunications infrastructure. East Japan Railway moved ahead on hopes of higher profits due to the reported listing of Japan Telecom, in which it has a leading stake, but met profit-taking later. It finished a net Y2,000 lower at Y525,000 after peaking at Y533,000, a high for the year. In Osaka, the OSE average added 81.88 at 22,993.18 in volume of 70m shares. Export-orientated issues rose on the higher dollar against the yen. Roundup Profit-taking was a theme common to many regional markets. SHANGHAI's A share index, however, resumed its advance, adding 20.2 per cent and prompting expectations of further strong rises in coming days. The index, which had paused on Tuesday after Monday's 36.1 per cent jump, broke through the psychological 500-point barrier to close 96.39 higher at 529.80. The Shenzhen A index rose 20.61, or 16.4 per cent, to 146.41. China's B shares, available to foreigners, also benefited from the improved sentiment. Shanghai's B index gained 0.47 at 73.83 and its Shenzhen counterpart rose 1.17 to 101.31. SEOUL remained concerned about the central bank's tight monetary policy, and institutional inactivity left share prices lower in extremely thin trade. The composite index ended 4.08 off at 923.47. HONG KONG extended losses during an afternoon of profit-taking after prices encountered strong technical resistance around the 9,750 Hang Seng index level. It lost 109.14, or 1.1 per cent, at 9,585.89. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.3bn, against HKDollars 5.6bn on Tuesday. SYDNEY's three-day rally came to an end on a fall in the price of bullion. The All Ordinaries index shed 14.6 to 2,072.3. Turnover was ADollars 327m. Brokers remarked that a Dollars 4 fall in the gold bullion price had coincided with a correction on the bourse after its 45-point gain over the past three trading days. In the golds sector, Poseidon Gold dipped 10 cents to ADollars 3.35 and Plutonic stood at a three-week low, down 25 cents at ADollars 6.15. SINGAPORE was higher, although some late profit-taking had emerged to take prices off their best levels. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.83 up at 2,267.13 in volume of 198.3m shares. BOMBAY ended lower, though above the day's worst levels, which were triggered by political uncertainty following reports that the finance minister had threatened to resign. The BSE 30-share index closed 28.29 down at 4,281.64, having recovered from a midsession low of 4,265. KUALA LUMPUR saw buyers return after an early bout of profit-taking, and the composite index finished 3.87 points up at 1,079.06. TAIPEI was sharply lower on a bout of heavy profit-taking. However, many brokers remained optimistic about the market's short-term direction, although they agreed that it could enter a consolidation phase. The weighted index lost 156.00, or 2.3 per cent, at 6,723.56, after touching 6,711.93. Turnover was TDollars 129.7bn. MANILA recovered from an early fall to close higher, helped by strong buying of blue chips and second-line issues. The composite index added 17.75 at 2,884.28 in turnover of 1.7bn pesos.</p>

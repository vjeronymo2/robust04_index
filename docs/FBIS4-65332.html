			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- The European Union and  Ukraine will sign a wide-ranging trade, cooperation and  partnership agreement next month, an EU spokesman said during a  meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday [16 May].    The meeting also gave general support for proposals that the  EU and other western countries should help pay for new nuclear  power stations in Ukraine so that the dangerous Chernobyl  nuclear power plant can be closed down.    The spokesman said Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk was  expected to sign the partnership accord at the next meeting of  the EU's foreign affairs council in Luxembourg in mid-June.    The accord, initialled by the two sides in March, will give  Ukraine greater access to western European markets for its  exports, and a high-level political dialogue with Brussels.    It stipulates that Ukraine might be able to join a free  trade  area with the EU sometime after 1997 if it makes sufficient  progress towards a free market.    The EU ministers agreed that the accord should be signed  without delay, and not used as a lever to make sure that Kiev  meets its commitments to get rid of all nuclear weapons  inherited from the old Soviet Union.    The EU has acknowledged that Ukraine, a country roughly the  size of France and formerly known as Russia's breadbasket, is in  desperate need of help to prop up a sharply-declining economy  and avoid social breakdown.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the partnership  accord could still be used as pressure on Kiev to dismantle all  the nuclear weapons, even after it was signed.    The European Commission outlined its proposal for helping  finance the building of new nuclear power stations in Ukraine to  replace the Chernobyl plant, where the world's worst civilian  nuclear accident occurred in 1986.    The proposal is to be discussed at the G-7 summit of  industrialised countries in Naples in July.    The Ukrainian authorities are still using two of Chernobyl's  four nuclear units, on the grounds that Kiev is dependent on the  plant for energy. They say they need three billion dollars to  close it down and replace it.    The commission also won general support for a 100 million  ECU  (120 billion dollar) plan to send food to the Ukraine, so that  it can be sold and the proceeds used to bolster the Ukrainian  economy.</p>

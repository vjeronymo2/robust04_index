			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BNS report: "World Bank Trusts Lithuanian Government"] </F>   [Text] VILNIUS, 23 Mar (BNS) -- "The World Bank trusts the  Lithuanian Government and its policy, even though not everything  is well there," stated L. (Jeurling), World Bank representative  in the Baltic states. According to him, the World Bank is  determined to extend new credits, the first of which will be for  the restructuring of the banking and finance system.    At a press conference on Wednesday [23 March], L. Jeurling  denied the rumor that the World Bank had ceased the preparation  of a new loan for the finance sector. According to him, the key  goal of the bank is to prepare the environment for all foreign  credits coming into the country. The reorganization of the  central and commercial banks is a long process, and the World  Bank has decided not to wait until the entire system changes.  The World Bank will select a few, in his opinion, most suitable  commercial banks and participate in lending World Bank finances  to enterprises.    L. Jeurling maintained that the activities of the World Bank  in Lithuania were the most dynamic among all former USSR  countries. Currently, the World Bank is actively working on five  or six new credit projects to finance important efforts in  agriculture, energy, finance, and environmental protection (a  water and waste treatment plant in Klaipeda), as well as in  construction.</p>

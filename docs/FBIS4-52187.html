			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Foolish Dream"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet  defence minister, Yi Pyong-tae, during his recent trip to Japan  discussed a military "joint countermove" of South Korea and  Japan with the director general of the Japan Defence Agency for  "regional security", once again taking issue with the "nuclear  issue" of the North. And, later, the traitor Kim Yong-sam in a  "telephone conversation" with the new Japanese prime minister,  Tsutomu Hata, pressed home the necessity for "close cooperation"  between Japan, South Korea and the United States for a solution  of the "nuclear issue" of the North.    Commenting on this, an analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says:    The reckless military adventures committed by the traitor  Kim  Yong-sam against the North up until now surpass those of the  successive South Korean military rulers.    The South Korean puppets this time begged their Japanese  master for "joint countermeasure" to harm and stifle the North  under the pretext of its "nuclear issue". This is motivated by  their intention to keep the U.S. imperialist aggression forces  in South Korea and persist in their confrontation with the North  under their military support and in league with the Japanese  aggression forces.    "Cooperation" on the lips of the puppets means subordinate  relations of tieup between the master and the South Korean  traitorous forces.    "Assistance" and "cooperation" "promised" by the U.S. and  Japanese masters to the traitor Kim Yong-sam are all prompted by  their sinister design to gratify their military strategical  purpose in Asia-pacific without difficulty by putting them up as  a shock force of aggression.    The sycophant moves of such traitors as Kim Yong-sam who  overshadows the "five traitors of 1905" now make it possible for  the Japanese reactionaries to stretch their tentacles of  reinvasion deeply into South Korea.    The attempt of the South Korean puppets to overpower us with  the help of outside forces is nothing but a foolish dream.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Estonians vote to exclude ethnic Russians from voting The Estonians voted by 53 per cent to 47 per cent to exclude ethnic Russians living in Estonia from voting in the country's forthcoming presidential and general elections, a decision bound to enflame ethnic tensions, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. Only Estonians were allowed to vote in the referendum although an estimated 600,000 people, or 40 per cent of the 1.5m population, are of Russian origin. The Russians were first settled in Estonia after the Soviet annexation in 1940.</p>

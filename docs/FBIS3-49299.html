Our special  correspondent Miroslav Konvalina was at the airport. He managed  brief interviews with them:    [Begin recording] [Konvalina] Shortly after 1700, a Boeing  landed at Ruzyne airport after a flight from Bratislava,  carrying members of the U.S. Government team responsible for the  preparation of the coming visit by Bill Clinton to Prague. The  delegation, which previously had talks in Poland, Hungary, and  the Slovak Republic, is headed by Madeleine Albright, special  envoy of the United States for the preparation of the coming  NATO summit in Brussels, and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the  U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff. They were met by Adrian  Basora, U.S. ambassador to the Czech republic, Alexandr Vondra,  Czech first deputy foreign minister, and Michael Zantovsky,  Czech ambassador to the United States.    Ambassador Albright then answered only two questions, both  for Czech Radio. First she said she was expecting from the  Prague visit agreement on what is necessary for a good summit in  Brussels and then she said, answering the second question, that  she did not anticipatate any open questions between the Czech  Republic and the United States.    Before his departure from the airport, General John  Shalikashvili replied to a question by Czech Radio as to what he  was expecting from tomorrow's meeting. He said: I look forward  to it and I expect a lot from it.    I asked the general if there were still open questions  between the Visegrad countries and NATO concerning the  "Partnership for Peace" initiative. Gen. Shalikashvili replied:  I am coming with three tasks. First, we want to assure our  colleagues in Prague that the United States is interested in the  security of the Czech Republic and its stability. Further, we  want to hear the views of the hosts and their apprehensions.  Third, we want to reply to all questions concerning the  Partership for Peace initiative, which will be discussed at the  coming summit in Brussels tomorrow.    Madeleine Albright and John Shalikashvili have a private  program tonight. Tomorrow they will meet the Czech prime  minister, the defense minister, and the foreign minister and  will leave for Brussels in the afternoon to attend the NATO  summit, where Madeleine Albright will play a lead role in the  U.S. presidential delegation. On Tuesday, the two U.S. guests  will again return to Prague, accompanied by Bill Clinton.</p>

A 45-year-old economist and first deputy  prime minister in the former USSR cabinet, Shcherbakov has  lately been favored as the possible new finance minister.    According to unconfirmed reports, the two men agreed that  since the financial situation in the country "is extremely  tense," a finance minister should also be a first deputy prime  minister.    Shcherbakov is reported to have been trying to persuade  Fedorov to drop his tough demands on the cabinet's makeup and  stay in the government.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Argentina does debt deal with banks THE ARGENTINE government and its leading bank creditors yesterday announced they had reached a detailed agreement on a debt restructuring under the Brady plan. An outline agreement on Argentina's Dollars 23bn of medium-term international bank debt and Dollars 8bn of interest arrears was reached in April, and the detailed accord comes after two weeks of intense negotiations in New York. The final term sheet will be sent to all creditor banks shortly. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which heads the bank advisory committee, said he expected the deal to be signed by September and completed by year-end. However, there is no incentive payment, unlike in other Brady deals, to encourage banks to sign early. The menu available to banks is more limited than in any prior deal under the Brady plan, the debt reduction initiative launched three years ago by Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary. Argentina has resisted allowing banks the option of making new loans, available for example in the Venezuelan and Mexican Brady deals. Banks have only two choices: exchange their old loans for new 30-year bonds with a discount to face value of 35 per cent, or exchange for 'par' bonds which carry pre-set concessional interest rates. These bonds may be denominated in dollars or D-Marks. Bankers expressed concern last night that the freedom of choice of banks to choose might be further restricted by multilateral agencies - the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which support Brady deals with special financing. The agencies have indicated their support for the deal is dependent on the right mix of reduction in debt service and in debt principal. Interest arrears will be treated separately, and Argentina has agreed to pay interest on the past due interest.</p>

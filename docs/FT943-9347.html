			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally after challenging support level - Market Report London traders continued to watch the US closely yesterday, and both gilt-edged securities and shares again staged a cautious rally towards the close as the dollar improved following first reports from the Congressional appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board. However, London traders went home still waiting for the outcome of the auction of Dollars 12bn Federal bonds. An early loss of 16.4 points on the FT-SE 100 Index was cut to a mere 1.6 at the final reading of 3,167. The low of the day saw a challenge to the Footsie 3,152 area, which is regarded as an important support level. But trading volume was very low in the early part of the session and a later improvement reflected in part the completion of Monday's trading programme, which is now thought to have been close to Pounds 200m worth of equities across the range of the market. The market continued to focus on prospects for US markets as they take aboard Mr Greenspan's testimony and this week's heavy funding programme which continues tomorrow, and will be preceded by important statistics on US retail sales, producer prices and unemployment claims. On the domestic front, equities were also subdued at first by release of the minutes of last month's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The governor's comment that base rates should be raised 'sooner rather than later' reinforced market views that base rates will be lifted from their present 5 1/4 per cent level well before the end of the year, and perhaps as soon as next month. However, many analysts believe that a quarter point, or even half point rise in base rates might be taken in its stride by a market still responding to a steady flow of good company profits and higher dividends. UK government bonds staged a good recovery to close firmer on the day, and this buttressed the rally in equities. The second line stocks were less responsive than the blue chips and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 9.5 off at 3,716.9. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 57 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 593m shares. On Tuesday, 669.9m shares in UK companies were traded, bringing a strong retail total by value of Pounds 1.52bn. The London market appears to have continued to attract investors from Europe and the US throughout its recent sluggish trading period. Strength in the pharmaceutical and oil sectors, both well supported from the US, helped to rally the market as well as to offset weakness among far eastern banks despite good half time figures from Standard Chartered. The insurance sector was subdued, the exception being Commercial Union as the half-time results and the details of the bid for Groupe Victoire of France were absorbed by the market. UK banks turned in a mixed performance, with Barclays giving back a few pence of the gain which greeted the half time profits announced in the previous session. Company trading reports brought a number of features elsewhere in a generally subdued market. Market strategists were beginning to focus on next week's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee which will be discussing interest rate policy against a background of the latest data on inflation and economic growth in the US. At home, similar factors apply, and yesterday's publication of the early July meeting of the chancellor and the governor of the Bank has turned the market's attention to next week's heavy list of UK data on domestic inflation and unemployment.</p>

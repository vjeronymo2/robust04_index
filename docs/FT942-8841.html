			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finnish mill project gets green light - A Pounds 365m chlorine-free pulp project After five years of planning and two years of difficult financing talks, a project to build the world's largest chlorine-free pulp mill was finally given the go-ahead last week. The FM3bn (Pounds 365m) facility, to be built at Rauma in western Finland, will be capable of producing 500,000 tonnes of softwood pulp a year and is scheduled for start-up in 1996. Even six months ago a decision to proceed with the plan would have looked reckless. Softwood pulp prices had plunged to just Dollars 380 a tonne from a peak of Dollars 840 in 1989, and there was little sign of the long-awaited recovery in the pulp and paper sector. Since then pulp prices have risen to Dollars 560 a tonne and the broader paper industry cycle appears to have turned. In spite of the improved climate, however, United Paper Mills, the biggest shareholder in the project with a stake of 45.6 per cent, only came on board at the last minute. It also appears that the financing problems were only resolved through a FM1.2bn state guarantee for a large proportion of the loans. A persistent difficulty has been risk concentration, with many of the leading Finnish banks already heavily exposed to the companies behind the project. Most analysts, though, believe that the fundamentals favour construction of the mill. They note that it will come on stream at a time when pulp prices are expected to be at or near their next cyclical peak. This explains the determination of Metsa - Rauma, the operating company, to stick to the 1996 start-up target. Excavation work began last autumn, well before the project was finally approved, and impetus has been maintained with the immediate placing of FM600m worth of contracts. At least half of the mill's output will be consumed by UPM and Metsa - Serla, the second largest investor in the project with 27.8 per cent. UPM will supply its Rauma paper mill and Metsa - Serla its Kirkniemi magazine paper plant. Metsa - Botnia, which previously supplied much of this pulp, will offer more of the commodity on the open market. Much of the new mill's remaining output is expected to go to western Europe, primarily for use as a reinforcing agent in the production of recycled paper. This is an attractive market, with forecasts suggesting that recycled paper demand will grow at 4.5 per cent a year over the next decade, compared with overall growth in pulp demand of only 1.6 per cent a year. In tapping this outlet, Metsa - Rauma believes its environmentally-friendly totally chlorine-free (TCF) pulp will give it a considerable marketing advantage. It notes that its production costs for TCF will be no higher than for conventional pulp because it is installing the required equipment from scratch. The mill's cost structure is also favoured by the 35 per cent fall in Finnish wood prices over the past three years. Although prices have started to rise again, mirroring the pulp industry's improved fortunes, the prospect of increased wood imports from neighbouring Russia in the next few years should ensure that Finnish wood suppliers moderate their price demands. Developments in the broader market could also favour the mill. Analysts say several Canadian pulp mills may be forced to close on environmental and financial grounds. They also believe there will be sales opportunities in the Far East, where paper demand is growing rapidly and long-fibre softwood pulp is expected to be in short supply. Most of the pulp capacity coming on stream in countries like Indonesia is of the short-fibre hardwood variety. Not everyone is convinced, however, that the pulp market recovery is fully established. Many commentators say short-term factors, such as restocking and disruptions to hard wood supplies from Russia, have driven the price up further than supply and demand factors warrant. They believe pulp prices could easily fall later this year. But the mill's backers are undeterred. They point to the mill's economies of scale and the technical advantages it will enjoy from utilising the very latest equipment. They also stress that their financial calculations are relatively conservative. The mill is expected to break-even after depreciation and interest with a pulp price of below Dollars 500 a tonne. At Dollars 550 a tonne the return on capital will be 10 per cent - much higher than the pulp industry has managed traditionally.</p>

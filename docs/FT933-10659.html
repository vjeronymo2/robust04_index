			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: Glimpses of another world - Lynn MacRitchie admires the work of aboriginal artists at the Hayward The resurgence of aboriginal art throughout Australia over the past 20 years is nothing short of a triumph for a people who until as late as the 1960s were believed to have been driven to the verge of extinction. The surviving Koori, Murri, Nyungar, Nunga, Yolngu and Anangu people with their 300 languages and culture rooted in the religious significance of the land, are now making considerable progress in their political and cultural endeavours. The survival of aboriginal art, and, most importantly, the development by the artists and their communities of ways of making it available to a non-aboriginal audience both inside and increasingly beyond Australia, have been crucial in this regeneration. Aratjara, now at the Hayward Gallery, is the largest exhibition of aboriginal art ever to be seen in Europe. Approaching such unfamiliar work always presents difficulties. Does one read lots of books beforehand and go in armed with theory or just plunge ahead and hope for the best? I opted for the latter, making my first circuit guided only by my own eyes. Just looking, several features were immediately obvious - the stylistic differences between various regions, and a much wider range of subjects and styles than expected. It also ensured that initial 'judgment' of the work was, as in any other gallery context, made on the basis of contemplating its form, composition and colour. There were surprises - the large, brightly coloured canvas 'My Country', 1992, by Ginger Riley Munduwalawala outstanding in a room full of ochre and brown cross hatched bark paintings by his fellow artists from Arnhem land, or the politically charged paintings, screen prints and photographs from the urban south east, stylistically familiar icons of an unfamiliar struggle. In the rooms devoted to the art of the central and western desert, stylistic progression began to become evident, as images obviously still based on religious or ceremonial markings were painted first on composition board and then on canvas. The last room is filled with enormous paintings which although composed of signs and symbols 'readable' to those who know their language also operate as superb examples of what we would term abstract art. Although study is needed to appreciate the full meaning of the images or the techniques used to create them, works such as the superb 'Jardiwarnpa Jukurrpa' or 'Fire Dreaming' make a powerful impact even before the full significance of the various elements of their composition is elucidated. 'Fire Dreaming', a communal work created by 21 women and seven men of the Yuendumu community, was specially commissioned for the exhibition,and presents a 'picture' of the community and its location, including its sacred sites, painted in the brightly coloured dotted patterns now identified as 'western desert art'. By its use of carefully selected images from the traditional ground or body paintings presented as a wall hung canvas, the piece demonstrates the developments aboriginal artists have made both formally in their work and in its mediation to the rest of the world. What is most striking about the 'Fire Dreaming,' or about the work of Ginger Riley or that of Rover Thomas Julama, one of two aboriginal artists who represented Australia at the Venice Biennale of 1990, is the confidence and strength of purpose of the artists. Using the expanded palette that acrylic paints have made available to them, they have reinterpreted their traditional themes specifically in order that they may be seen by non-aboriginal eyes; the concept of 'outsiders' seeing the paintings is thus inherent in their composition and execution. Those who worry about 'authenticity' or that the artists somehow lose out by showing in western style galleries or selling in the western style art market which flourishes in Australia should calm their fears. It is just for that market that these works have been adapted and created. And this is a good thing; it means that the aboriginal artists are in control. The images which they trade have been created for that purpose, passed by their elders and ritual guardians as appropriate for strangers' eyes. Other, secret, images continue to be used for traditional religious purposes. These works designed for us still offer a glimpse into another world, where artists and their communities share a dynamic relation to their creation myths, the representation and observance of which gives purpose and meaning to their lives, and now also provides a useful tool to help redress the balance against the incoming society which has been dominant for 200 years. The creation of 'Fire Dreaming' was accompanied by 'Big dancing ceremony, men, women, girls . . . really big business,' according to Dolly Daniels, one of the artists who worked on it. These remarkable pictures command respect, both for their beauty and sophisticated combination of the assumptions of our opposing cultures, permitting a glimpse of an ancient way of life our own ancestors tried so hard, but thankfully so unsuccessfully, to destroy.

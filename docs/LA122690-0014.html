			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T BLAME COASTAL COMMISSION;  </P> <P> IT HAD TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON HOPE DEAL; THE LAW MADE IT DO IT  </P> <P> For a time, the Santa Monica Mountains stood to get 5,700 new acres of parkland  through a complicated property swap among developers, a state agency and Bob  Hope. It still could happen, but the California Coastal Commission has rightly  ruled that the law would have to be broken, not just bent, to accommodate the  deal in its original form.  </P> <P> The commission rejected a proposal in mid-December to build 26 luxury houses in  Malibu's Corral Canyon. That would have been the triggering deal for a plan  under which Hope could have developed his Jordan Ranch property in Ventura  County and then deeded the new park property to the Santa Mountain Mountains  Conservancy.  </P> <P> Its decision has led to some grumbling over the practice of coastal  parochialism, protecting the beach at the expense of the forest. In fact, the  commission had no choice.  </P> <P> The development would have required remodeling the canyon itself. To make way  for the houses, bulldozers would have graded 2.2 million cubic yards of earth,  covering over what an advisory group agreed was an "environmentally sensitive  habitat." The 1976 law under which the commission operates specifically shields  such areas from any disturbance, let alone being buried alive, except when it  cannot be avoided.  </P> <P> Another part of the law directs the commission to minimize the alteration of  "land form" when it issues permits for development in the coastal zone. There  was nothing minimal about the Corral Canyon proposal.  </P> <P> Finally, it seemed clear, at least to its staff, that even if the commission  approved the canyon development, the rest of the swap could fall apart. Malibu  would be stuck with a precedent that allowed 84,000 cubic yards of dirt to be  moved per house instead of the existing average 5,000 yards, and there would  not be a single new acre of parkland.  </P> <P> The lawyers will get together after the holidays to try to patch the swap back  together. The deal surely can work without anyone's losing a bundle. The  lawyers should focus on how, not whether.  </P></p>

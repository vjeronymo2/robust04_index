			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Clash of the cans Ecotop, an all-steel fizzy drinks can with a novel push-button opening system, is launched today, Neil Buckley writes. J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, is the first UK company to use the can, developed by British Steel Tinplate, Hoogovens of the Netherlands, and Germany's Rasselstein. It has chosen it as packaging for Gio, a new own-brand lemon and lime drink. To open the cans, consumers press two buttons - a smaller one to release the pressure inside the can, then a larger one to reveal a hole for pouring. The launch marks a new phase in the battle for supremacy between steel and aluminium. Aluminium has come to dominate the beverage market since the introduction of the ring-pull can in 1963.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Senator Bola Tinubu told AFP this morning that the  government has arrested more opposition figures, among whom was  Chief Olusegun Osoba, the former civilian governor of Ogun State  in the Southwest of Nigeria. Several other persons were  arrested in the eastern and southwestern parts of the country  and "we are currently trying to discover their names and  numbers," he added.    Senator Bola Tinubu is one of the founding members of the  opposition National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which called  on Nigerians to take their destiny into their own hands by  restoring democracy to the country. Senate Chairman Ameh Ebute  was arrested on 2 June by security forces, following similar  calls.    Senator Tinubu took part in a Senate meeting after which its  president published a communique calling for the formation of a  government of national unity and reconciliation, led by the  "president-elect" Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of  the 12 June 1993 presidential election, which was canceled by  the military.    Yesterday, members from the dissolved House of  Representatives also published a communique, which called for  Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha to relinquish power  "at the latest by 11 June," in order to enable the winner of the  12 June 1993 elections to form a "broad-based" national  government on the first anniversary of that election.    General Oladipo Diya, the reegime's number two man,  yesterday  stated that the Senate president's call was "illegal," and  constituted a "violation of the law." "What responsible  government would sit with its arms folded in the face of  individuals flouting the laws with impunity? (...) To do so  would be tantamount to encouraging chaos," the press quoted Gen.  Diya as saying. According to the pro-government DAILY TIMES,  Ameh Ebute is expected to be arraigned before a court on 6 June,  and could be charged with treason.    Moshood Abiola also claimed to have learned with "shock" the  arrest of the Senate president. The billionaire Yoruba Muslim,  whose statement was reported by the press, said: "To arrest the  country's legitimate, elected representatives, simply because  they called for respecting the people's aspirations for  (democracy) is a criminal act." Mr. Abiola added: "The (ruling)  junta, which continues to subjugate our people and denigrate the  expression of their sovereign will through diversions, cannot  escape the imminent judgment of history."    A former head of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo,  (1976-1979), who is widely respected in Nigeria, said he had  known Abiola "since being in school with him, and I am not in  favor of his taking power. I do not think Abiola is the Messiah  we are expecting," declared Gen. Obasanjo, whose statement was  reported by the press.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Mauled in the market - The Professionals / UK equities have election nerves, but the five see value elsewhere in Europe This feature is not a competition, but an allocation exercise, the purpose of which is to see how five professional fund managers manage a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice. In each case, the client is assumed to be either a wealthy individual or a small self-administered pension fund. All the fund managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up as at the end of December, and will be reviewed again at the end of March. OUR PROFESSIONALS have, perhaps inevitably, been mauled along with the majority by the equity market reversals of the past quarter. Worst hit were Gartmore, where Paul Myners' 5 per cent holding in Japanese warrants languishes at 60 per cent of its October value. Gartmore face an approximate loss for the quarter of 7 per cent. At Mercury, Simon Toynbee concedes that he jumped the gun by raising his UK equity exposure in October to 60 per cent of the portfolio. With the UK market falling by almost 9 per cent on the quarter, his portfolio slipped by nearly 6 per cent. David Poole, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, also had 61 per cent of his portfolio invested in the UK, and so lost about 6 per cent on the quarter. Damage limitation was achieved most effectively by Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford. He had a smaller exposure to the UK market, and was helped by a 15 per cent holding in the south-east Asian markets, and excellent performance by French bonds, also 15 per cent of the portfolio. The fall in his portfolio was probably no more than 4 1/2 per cent. Howard Beaufort, at Newton, also earned a late reward for having remained consistently more bearish than his counterparts. Like Baillie Gifford, Newton's portfolio had limited exposure to the UK, and saw benefit from a 12 per cent holding in French bonds. He might have limited losses even more effectively than Baillie Gifford, had it not been for a large US stake and a drab performance in Europe, in particular Sweden. In view of Mr Beaufort's past bearishness, it is worth noting a change in his tone concerning the UK: 'For the first time in 15 months, I have taken my bullish hat and coat out of the wardrobe and am giving them a brushing down,' he notes. 'The next few weeks will almost certainly prove to be a rough ride, but opportunities will therefore present themselves in the first quarter.' Looking into 1992, most are now agreed that the UK will remain nervous ahead of a general election, and vulnerable to a possible reversal in the US. They see good value elsewhere in Europe, though views divide strongly over prospects for Germany. No one foresees fresh blood on the Tokyo markets, but nor do any yet see good enough values to justify buying interest. They also agree that Hong Kong and south-east Asia offer the brightest short-term market prospects. Loyalty to bonds remains strong, particularly the French bonds that have served them so well so far this year. Yields average 8.8 per cent at present, which is attractive when inflation there is below 3 per cent. Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, plans no changes in the balance of his portfolio. The imminent general election in the UK makes him nervous about raising exposure to the market, even though it is 'fairly valued'. Remaining optimistic about prospects for Germany, where he sees the east beginning to recover, and interest rates likely to be cut before July, he stands behind his 25 per cent European holding. Paul Myners, at Gartmore, proposes to sell his remaining Yen cash to buy equities in Europe, where he sees his 'favourite markets after Asia'. His European market holding rises to 15 per cent, with emphasis on the Netherlands and France. The Pacific Rim holdings stay at 12.5 per cent. In the UK, which will continue to account for half of the portfolio, he favours growth and smaller stocks. Japanese warrants are to be held, 'despite poor performance', in the hope of capturing leveraged recovery when the Tokyo market turns upward. The US offers 'dubious value' at present, but may offer buying opportunities as pundits over-react to bad news. Simon Toynbee, at Mercury Asset Management, plans to trim cash holdings from 9 per cent to 7 per cent, using the funds to lift holdings in Europe. The portfolio otherwise remains unchanged. Having paid a price for increasing his UK holdings 'prematurely' in October, he does not plan to dilute the holding. In spite of uncertainty until Wall Street rallies, he sees UK corporate earnings recovering sharply late in 1992. With one third of the portfolio outside the UK market, he feels hedged against falls which might occur if the Labour party wins the general election. Howard Beaufort, at Newton Investment Management, plans to cut his US holding from 12 per cent to 8 per cent of the portfolio, and to lift UK holdings by 4 per cent to 44 per cent. The portfolio otherwise remains unchanged. Mr Beaufort is gloomy about the US, where renewed weakness 'is a strong near-term possibility'. The UK will also be fragile, but he feels that it will be 'far more justifiable for markets to adopt a bullish stance' in the opening months of 1992. Elsewhere in Europe, he sees Germany 'likely to remain under a cloud', but feels more bullish about the French markets. He remains nervous about Japan, but sees support at present depressed levels. David Poole, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, plans to trim US holdings still further, while adding to European bonds and buying some sterling cash. In the UK, 'significant weakness in oversold stocks has been used to buy'. Seeing the markets of continental Europe impeded by Germany's high interest rates, he foresees a recovery as rates fall in spring. He nevertheless warns that Russian unrest and German wage demands 'remain the caveat to recovery'. Sentiment is negative on the US, where high equity prices are 'discounting a considerable recovery which does not appear to be happening'. By contrast, he believes that Japan now offers 'fundamental value', and predicts 'outperformance in 1992'. Rueing his limited exposure to the rest of Asia, Mr Poole pinpoints Hong Kong as 'an attractive and undervalued market' in spite of the shadow cast by 1997.  -------------------------------- HOW THEY ALLOCATE THEIR ASSETS  -------------------------------- BG  --------------------------------                             %  -------------------------------- 1 UK Equities              40 2 Europe Equities          25 3 SE Asia Equities         15 4 Japanese Equities         5 5 Long French Bonds        15  -------------------------------- Last time: UK Equties (40%), Europe Equities (25), SE Asia Equities (15), Long French Bonds (15)  -------------------------------- Gartmore  --------------------------------                             %  -------------------------------- 1 UK Equities              50 2 European Equities        15 3 Pacific Rim Equities     12.5 4 US Equities               5 5 Jap.

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Group opposing Sugar's bid for Amstrad claims growing support THE Pounds 113m bid by Mr Alan Sugar for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does not already own faces growing opposition from small shareholders. Mr Gideon Fiegel, founder of the Amstrad Shareholders Club - an informal committee of disgruntled shareholders who believe the 30p a share offer price for the UK electronics group is inadequate - claimed yesterday that the club already speaks for 'more than 25m shares', or about 4.3 per cent of Amstrad's outstanding equity. Mr Fiegel said he is hopeful that the club will be able to muster the 93.9m shares - a quarter of the shares Mr Sugar does not already own - required to block the bid to take Amstrad private again. On the basis of Amstrad's share register, he estimates that about 31,000 small shareholders control roughly 230m Amstrad shares. Institutional investors, each with less than a 3 per cent stake, are thought to control about 146m shares. The shareholders' committee, which met earlier this week, has also appealed for institutional investors' support. The Amstrad board and Kleinwort Benson, its financial advisers, are preparing for what promises to be a stormy annual meeting in London on Tuesday and an extraordinary general meeting called for December 10 to discuss the bid. The board, which is precluded by takeover rules from advising shareholders on the bid because it has no non-executive directors, is expected to issue a letter to shareholders after the AGM in an attempt to clarify what are seen as 'certain misunderstandings'.</p>

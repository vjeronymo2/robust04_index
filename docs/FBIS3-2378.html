"No progress was made on the KLM file", the Netherlands  national airline's bid to open an air link between Beijing and  Amsterdam, they added.    Kooijmans, who left Beijing Wednesday, had talks with Prime  Minister Li Peng, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Justice  Minister Xiao Yang. "The human rights issue was discussed more  in detail with Qian Qichen," a diplomatic source said. It was  during this meeting that Kooijmans submitted his list of  political prisoners and asked China to "pay attention to these  cases," the diplomat added.    Kooijmans, a professor of international law, is a former  United Nations rapporteur on human rights in China. His visit  coincided with the arrests and detention of several dissidents,  including democracy movement leader Wei Jingsheng, in a  crackdown on opposition circles.    China responded harshly Tuesday to U.S. attacks on its  human rights record.    "No foreign country, organisation or individual has the  right  to make irresponsible remarks or interfere," a Foreign Ministry  spokesman said.    The diplomatic sources signalled no progress on the air  links  dispute. KLM is banned from landing in China because it runs  flights to Taiwan, China's Nationalist rival.    KLM is the only European airline to operate daily flights to  Taipei, and China has insisted that it suspend these flights as  a condition of opening up links with Beijing.    The Taipei route is one of KLM's most profitable and it is  loath to abandon it because Taiwan has warned that unlike other  European airlines which operate the route through subsidiaries,  it will not allow a subsidiary for the Dutch company to land in  Taiwan.</p>

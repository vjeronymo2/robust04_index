			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by 'Aqiva Eldar: "Longing for Carter"] </F>   [Text] It looks as though speaking untruthfully or -- to  put it more bluntly -- lying has become a plague among  politicians. This phenomenon has spread far beyond Israel and  has also affected the U.S. secretary of state and President.  Before his meeting with King Husayn, Warren Christopher came up  with an excellent explanation for delaying his Middle East  visit: He could not have postponed his visit as he never  planned to visit the region in June to begin with.    If the secretary of state was telling the truth, it must be  stated that all his peace advisers intentionally misled the  Israeli Embassy in Washington. Even worse, is it conceivable  that a politician who has committed himself to energetic  mediation between Israel and Syria should take such a long break  without planning his next trip to these countries?    Some maintained that the eminent politician was forced to  delay his trip to our region at the last moment because of the  North Korean crisis. President Clinton said that Jimmy Carter  visited Pyongyang as a tourist rather than as an official White  House emissary. A day later, the former president said on  television, however, that he routinely discusses sensitive  issues, such as the invitation to visit North Korea, with the  President. In fact, when President Bush asked Carter not to go  there, he acquiesced, so it stands to reason that had Clinton  asked nicely, the former Democratic president would not have  turned him down.    Whom are we to believe: Carter, who promised Kim Il-song and  CNN that the sanctions have been frozen; or Clinton, who  announced that the diplomatic effort to consolidate the  sanctions will continue until President Kim translates his words  into action?    Meanwhile, Kim has won several more weeks to smuggle  additional quantities of fuel waste for implementing his plan of  turning North Korea into a nuclear bomb supermarket. Last  month, Clinton warned that destroying any evidence regarding the  removal of fuel from the reactor would destroy all chances of  opening a third round of talks between the United States and  North Korea. The evidence was destroyed, and Western  intelligence can only guess the number of nuclear bombs hidden  in the cellars of one of the most dangerous regimes in the world.    Now, after Carter has returned triumphantly from the Korean  peninsula, Clinton is talking about encouraging signs and hope  for a new beginning in relations with North Korea. The tension  regarding the sanctions has evaporated, and Clinton found the  time to deal with his health reform and the Whitewater and Paula  Jones affairs.    Washington policymakers have been busy explaining that the  only superpower in the world cannot be expected to solve all the  world's problems. Strategists carefully explicated the nature  of regional-ethnic conflicts, such as those in Bosnia, Somalia,  Haiti, and Rwanda. Regretting the bloodshed in all these  places, they nevertheless maintain that the United States must  conserve its strength for the real tests, such as threats to  world peace. It so happens, however, that precisely during this  trial period -- and what is more dangerous than the  proliferation of nuclear weapons among mad leaders and extremist  regimes -- this U.S. Administration is being exposed in all its  weakness.    It started with the difficulties in getting Japanese and  Chinese support for the sanctions against North Korea after Kim  mocked the United States and the International Atomic Energy  Agency. After securing most favored nation status, Beijing  threatened to veto sanctions against its communist neighbor.  Japan announced it is bound by law to exhaust all diplomatic  efforts. Even in South Korea, there is a growing opposition to  escalation with the north.    The alliance with the United States has always been one of  Israel's most important strategic assets. An ally with the  prestige of a paper tiger, however, does not contribute anything  to its security. The Jordanian newspaper AL-RA'Y, for example,  wrote this week that "North Korea has proven that a proud  country can challenge the United States. Rational neighbors  such as Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo can curb U.S. arrogance." If  this is what the wimps in Amman are saying, what do people in  Baghdad, Tehran, and Tripoli think?    The entire world is following Clinton's pathetic maneuvers  on  the North Korean track. The loss of control over its nuclear  armament efforts and the unsuccessful attempt to implement  effective sanctions could harm the embargo against Israel's most  dangerous enemies.    It is to be hoped that Hafiz al-Asad will not question the  reasons for continuing to pin his hopes on these people.  Incidentally, during the Reagan administration's tenure, Jimmy  Carter brought a message to Rabin from Damascus regarding  al-Asad's desire for an arrangement. Rabin, who was defense  minister at the time, shrugged off Carter's initiative.    If it nevertheless transpires that Carter has managed to  move  Kim, it is advisable to send him instead of Christopher on the  "unplanned" visit to Damascus. Even Carter, however, will find  it hard to have an impact there.</p>

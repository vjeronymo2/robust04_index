			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX the Crimean  president's military adviser Valeryy Kuznetsov declared that  Ukraine "has substantially increased its military presence in  the Crimea," thus unilaterally violating Crimea's Constitution  and decree on the division of authorities between Ukraine and  Crimea. These stipulate that all changes in the stationing and  strength of military units should be coordinated with the  corresponding Crimean structures.    He reported that at present two mechanized brigades had been  formed within the 32d Army corps. One of them, about 2000 in  number, is deployed in the village of Perevalnoe, the second  brigade is in Kerch and Feodosiya. In addition air mobile  forces to be stationed in the city of Saki are being formed,  said Kuznetsov.    "This is being done without the knowledge of the Supreme  Soviet and Crimean president. We have sent a request to  Ukraine's Defense Minister and commander of the 32d Army corps  and are waiting for an answer," said Kuznetsov.    He also expressed perplexity due to the fact that the  Ukrainian Army had taken control of several military  installations, some of them crucial to the country's defenses.  These are deteriorating due to the absence of appropriate funds  in Ukraine. As an example he reported that the training base  for the pilots of the aircraft carrier aviation is located in  the disposition of Ukrainian servicemen. Meanwhile, Ukraine has  no aircraft carriers.</p>

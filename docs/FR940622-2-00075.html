Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from May 27, 1994, through June 10, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 8, 1994 (59 FR 29623). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (Project Director) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> April 26, 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to change the Table 3.5-1 High Containment Pressure ( Hi Level), Safety Injection Setting Limit from less than or equal to 2.0 psig to less than or equal to 5.0 psig. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the High Containment Pressure (Hi Level) actuation setting of [less than or equal to] 2.0 psig be revised to [less than or equal to] 5.0 psig. This additional operating flexibility will decrease the frequency of Containment venting necessary to relieve containment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-condensible gases which build up during normal operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon a statistical analysis of the containment pressure channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle, a margin must be allowed between the Technical Specification limit (plant setting) and the Safety Analysis limit so that the Safety Analysis limit(s) will not be exceeded under the worst circumstances. For a Technical Specification value of [less than or equal to] 5.0 psig, the corresponding Safety Analysis limit must be increased to 10 psig to provide margin for the channel statistical allowance. A safety evaluation performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 is on file which supports a change in the Safety Analysis limit from 7.3 psig (current value) to 10.0 psig. Key conclusions of the Safety Evaluation are that neither the probability nor the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the Safety Analysis report would be increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, assurance is provided that appropriate protective actions in accordance with the Technical Specifications will be taken so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in the Technical Specification limit together with the change in the Safety Analysis limit provides adequate margin to accommodate instrument channel uncertainty over a 30 month operating cycle. Plant equipment, which would be set at the Technical Specification limit, will therefore provide protective functions to assure that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This would prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from that previously evaluated from occurring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to the Technical Specification limit would decrease the frequency of containment purges necessary to vent the build up of non-condensible gases during normal operation. This would result in a decrease in the amount of radioactivity discharged to the environment (due to decay), decrease the potential for high Containment pressure alarms and increase the margin for an ESF trip. The change to the Safety Analysis limits, justified by a safety Evaluation performed in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, assures sufficient margin exists to accommodate channel instrument uncertainty over the maximum operating cycle length. This margin is necessary so that safety functions will occur and Safety Analysis limits will be preserved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.

All proposed STI and AOT changes are in accordance with General Electric Company Licensing Topical Reports (LTRs) which have been previously reviewed and approved by the NRC staff. Also, AOTs are clarified in accordance with the most recently approved BWR Owners' Group letters which were used in the development of NUREG-1433 ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' The Technical Specification changes will permit specified Channel Tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly. The amendment will enhance operational safety by reducing 1) the potential for inadvertent plant scrams, 2) excessive test cycles on equipment, and 3) the diversion of plant personnel and resources on unnecessary testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two additional technical changes are proposed. The first change involves extending the Channel Calibration interval for average power range monitor (APRM) scram instrumentation from weekly to quarterly. GPUN has evaluated the effect of drift on the setpoint over the longer interval for this instrumentation and found it to be acceptable. The second change would add a quarterly Channel Calibration requirement for High Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) and Turbine Trip Scram instrumentation. This would be a new requirement not currently incorporated in the Technical Specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nineteen editorial changes have been incorporated in Instrumentation Sections 3.1 and 4.1 to provide clarity and consistency. These items are editorial only and do not alter the meaning or intent of any requirements. Examples of editorial changes are: 1) capitalize definitions where used, 2) punctuation and grammatical corrections, 3) ensuring consistency in STI nomenclature, and 4) reformat of tables.

The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The generic analysis contained in LTR NEDC-30851P-A assessed the impact of changing RPS [reactor protection system] STIs and adding AOTs on RPS failure frequency, scram frequency and equipment cycling. Specifically, Section 5.7.4, ``Significant Hazards Assessment,'' of NEDC-30851P-A states that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fewer challenges to the safeguards system, due to less frequent testing of the RPS, conservatively results in a decrease of approximately one percent in core damage frequency. This decrease is based upon the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the plant-specific experience presented in Appendix J, the estimated reduction in scram frequency (0.3 scrams/yr) represents a 1 to 2 percent decrease in core damage frequency based on the BWR plant-specific Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRAs) listed in Table 5-8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The increase in core damage frequency due to less frequent testing is less than one percent. This increase is even lower (less than 0.01 percent) when the changes resulting from the implementation of the Anticipated Transients Without Scram (ATWS) rule are considered. Therefore, this increase is more than offset by the decrease in CDF [core damage frequency] due to fewer scrams. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of reducing unnecessary cycles on RPS equipment, although not easily quantifiable also results in a decrease in core damage frequency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The overall impact on core damage frequency of the changes in allowable out-of-service times is negligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of a scram failure due to RPS unavailability is insignificant. The overall probability of an accident is decreased as the time RPS logic operates as designed is increased resulting in less inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The plant-specific evaluation performed by GPUN and GE demonstrates that while the Oyster Creek RPS differs from the generic model analyzed in the RPS LTR (NEDC-30851P-A), the net effect of the differences do not alter the generic conclusions. The AOTs proposed for RPS instrumentation are based on improved wording developed for use in NUREG 1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4,'' which ensures a loss of function does not occur. In addition, the change to the APRM Scram Channel Calibration surveillance interval from weekly to quarterly has been evaluated by GPUN to determine the effect on setpoint drift. The results of the evaluation show acceptable performance of this scram parameter ensuring that the safety analysis remains valid. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram instrumentation is appropriate since this trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches which are fixed in position and adjusted, as necessary, during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve [MSIV] Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only a Channel Test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LTR NEDC-30936P-A (Parts 1 and 2) contains an assessment of the impact of changing STIs and AOTs for BWR ECCS Actuation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Technical Assessment of Changes,'' of NEDC-30963P-A (Part 2) states that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results indicate an insignificant (less than 5E-7 per year) increase in water injection function failure frequency when STIs are increased from 31 days to 92 days, AOTs for repair of the ECCS actuation instrumentation are increased from one hour to 24 hours, and AOTs for surveillance testing are increased from two to six hours. For all four BWR models the increase represents less than 4% increase in failure frequency. However, when other factors which influence the overall plant safety are considered, the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of a water injection failure due to ECCS instrumentation unavailability is insignificant and the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety. The plant-specific evaluation performed by GPUN and GE demonstrates that while the Oyster Creek ECCS differs from the generic model analyzed in LTR NEDC-30936P-A, the net effect of the plant-specific differences do not alter the generic conclusions. The addition of a quarterly Channel Calibration STI for the High Drywell Pressure ECCS initiation parameter is consistent with the calibration interval requirement for other similar instrumentation at Oyster Creek and ensures the regular performance of calibrations. This is a new requirement not currently contained in the Technical Specifications and experience performing the High Drywell Pressure (Core Cooling) instrument calibration at a quarterly interval has proven adequate for instrument performance monitoring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LTRs NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 and NEDC-31677P-A contain generic analyses assessing the impact of changing STIs and AOTs for BWR Isolation Actuation Instrumentation which are common or not common to RPS and ECCS instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Summary of Results,'' of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 states that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results indicated that the effects on probability of failure to initiate isolation are very small and the effects on probability or frequency of failure to isolate are negligible in nearly every case. In addition, the results indicated that increasing the AOT to 24 hours for tests and repairs has a negligible effect on the probability of failure of the isolation function. These combined with changes to the testing intervals and allowed out-of-service times for RPS and ECCS instrumentation provide a net improvement to plant safety and operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Section 5.6, ``Assessment of Net Effect of Changes,'' of NEDC-31677P-A states that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A reduction in core damage frequency (CDF) of at least as much as estimated in the ECCS instrumentation analysis can be expected when the isolation actuation instrumentation STIs are changed from one month to three months. The chief contributor to this reduction is the channel functional tests for the MSIVs. Inadvertent closure of the MSIVs will cause an unnecessary plant scram. This reduction in CDF more than compensates for any small incremental increase (10% or 1.0E-07/year) in calculated isolation function failure frequency when the STI is extended to three months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of an isolation failure due to isolation instrumentation unavailability is insignificant. The proposed wording of the AOTs is based on the clarifications used in the development of NUREG 1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4,'' which ensures a loss of function does not occur where applied to isolation actuation instrumentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LTR NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 contains a generic analysis assessing the impact of changing control rod block STIs on Rod Block failure frequency. Section 5 (Brookhaven National Laboratory Technical Evaluation Report - Attachment 2 to the NRC SER) of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 states that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BWROG proposed changes to the Technical Specifications concerning the test requirements for BWR control rod block instrumentation. The changes consist of increasing the surveillance test intervals form one to three months. These test interval extensions are consistent with the already approved changes to STIs for the reactor protection system. The technical analysis reviewed and verified as documented herein indicates that there will be no significant changes in the availability of the control rod block function if these changes are implemented. In addition, there will be a negligible impact on the plant core melt frequency due to the decreased testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bases contained in GE Topical Report GENE-770-1-A assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on failure frequency for selected systems. Section 2.0, ``Summary,'' of GENE-770-06-1-A states that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical bases are provided for selected proposed changes to the instrumentation STIs and AOTs that were identified in the BWROG Improved BWR Technical Specification activity. These STI and AOT changes are consistent with approved changes to the RPS, ECCS, and isolation actuation instrumentation. These proposed changes do not result in a degradation to overall plant safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BWR Owners' Group concluded from the generic analysis in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 and the bases in GENE-770-06-1-A that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. GPUN's utilization of GENE-770-06-1-A is limited to the identified AOTs for Control Rod Block instrumentation analyzed in NEDC-30851P-A since the Control Rod Block LTR did not explicitly address AOTs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of allowable out-of-service times (AOTs) consistent with wording developed for use in Improved Standard Technical Specifications to ensure no loss of function and the revision of surveillance test intervals (STIs) does not alter the function of RPS, ECCS, Isolation or Rod Block instrumentation nor involve any type of plant modification. No new modes of plant operation are involved with the changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adding a quarterly Channel Calibration STI for High Drywell Pressure instrumentation (for Core Cooling) establishes a requirement in the Technical Specifications which is not currently incorporated. This is an additional requirement beyond that already in place for this instrumentation and will not alter its operation since by their nature STIs ensure proper instrument performance. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram instrumentation is appropriate since this trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches which are fixed in position and adjusted during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only a Channel Test. Revising the Channel Calibration STI for APRM Scram instruments from weekly to quarterly allows these instruments to benefit from the Channel Test STI change provided by the generic analysis in the RPS LTR. The benefits include a significant reduction in the number of half-scram states the plant will undergo reducing the potential for inadvertent plant trips. The effect of setpoint drift over the longer interval has been evaluated and found acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes will not alter the physical characteristics of any plant systems or components and all safety-related systems and components remain within their applicable design limits. Thus, system and component performance is not adversely affected by these changes, thereby assuring that the design capabilities of those systems and components are not challenged in a manner not previously assessed so as to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic studies contained in the GE Licensing Topical Reports and has concurred with the BWR Owners' Group that the proposed changes do not significantly affect the availability of RPS, ECCS Actuation, Isolation Actuation and Control Rod Block instrumentation. The proposed addition of allowable out-of-service times for instruments addressed by the LTRs provides reasonable times for making repairs and performing tests. The lack of sufficient out-of-service time provided in current Technical Specifications, increases the potential for an inadvertent scram or equipment actuation. The proposed AOTs provide realistic times to complete required actions without increasing overall instrument failure frequency and ensure that no loss of function occurs, therefore, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The LTRs demonstrate that extending surveillance test intervals does not result in significant changes in the probability of instrument failure. Where Channel Calibration frequency has not changed, assurance exists that setpoints will not be affected by drift. In the case of the APRM Scram Channel Calibration, the proposed change to quarterly from weekly has been evaluated and found acceptable. Expected instrument performance over the extended interval will assure that applicable safety analyses will continue to be met. In addition, other instrumentation was evaluated for drift effects of setpoints and was found acceptable. The addition of a quarterly Channel Calibration interval for High Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) is consistent with Channel Calibration STIs for most other instrumentation at Oyster Creek and has been the interval used to achieve an adequate level of instrument performance monitoring. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram instrumentation ensures consistency in the establishment of surveillance requirements. This trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches which are fixed in position and adjusted during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only a Channel Test. These proposed changes, when coupled with the reduced probability of test-induced plant transients and equipment failures, do not result in a reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No Significant Hazards Consideration Evaluation For Editorial Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above nineteen proposed changes are editorial in nature and are typical example I.c.2.e.i in 51FR7744.

The proposed amendment serves to assure that an EDG is always available to perform on demand and the lower number of demands for performance reduce the probability of equipment failure. The required action no longer requires a ``test'' be performed. Therefore, the word ``test'' has been deleted from TS 3.7.2.c. The change is administrative. Since the proposed amendment does not affect the design or performance of the diesel generators or their ability to perform their design function, the change will not result in an increase in the consequences or probability of an accident previously analyzed. The proposed change will increase diesel generator reliability, thereby increasing overall plant safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change does not result in a reduction in the margin of safety since there is no margin of safety associated with the supplemental immediate and daily testing of the operable EDG. If a margin of safety were presumed to exist, no reduction would result because of the proposed amendment: no physical modification to the plant or change to procedurally prescribed operator actions resulted from the proposed amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's analysis is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containment air lock hatch entry, surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, and preventive maintenance of control room ventilation are of short duration and do not alter any associated remedial action completion times, or the requirements of Technical Specification 3.0.A. If necessary, prompt operator action to restore containment integrity, excess flow check valve position, or control room ventilation is assured by plant operators, or individual(s) procedurally dedicated to perform such restoration. The subject containment boundary valves are manual containment isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without compensatory measures to isolate the penetration. The boundary valves to be added remain closed during power operation, and are opened only after the reactor is shut down and cooldown has begun. The boundary valves to be deleted are open only during plant heatup.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to containment air lock hatch entry, surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, and preventive maintenance of the control room ventilation system, will not affect equipment reliability when such equipment is required to be operable. The Limiting Conditions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation and Remedial Actions for these items remain unchanged to govern operability of the equipment. The containment boundary valves being added are closed when the reactor is at power, and are opened only after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor is shut down. The boundary valves being deleted are open only during plant heatup. The subject boundary valves are manual containment isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without compensatory measures to isolate the penetration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change will not create any new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change would allow excess flow check valves to be exercised through approximately 1.5 inches of valve travel on a quarterly basis without declaring the valves inoperable or taking compensatory measures. Such testing constitutes approximately 15 minutes per calendar quarter, during which time containment isolation can easily be reestablished. Similarly, access through an operable air lock hatch would allow the hatch to be open for only a short period of time and while under control of an individual dedicated to operating the hatch. The proposed change also permits the control room ventilation system to be inoperable for 30 minutes per calendar quarter, without a written report of such inoperability. Because of the short time during which these systems are unavailable, and because operation is easily reestablished, there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. The containment boundary valves being added are closed when the reactor is at power, and are opened only after the reactor is shut down. The boundary valves being deleted are open only during plant heatup. The subject boundary valves are manual containment isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without compensatory measures to isolate the penetration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Increasing the Technical Specification minimum to require a third RO does not decrease the effectiveness of the shift staff in response to normal or abnormal conditions. In fact, the third RO enhances the ability of the operating crew to mitigate complex transients which could occur during beyond design basis events. The shifts have trained and functioned at the higher staffing level for several years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The typographical corrections to page 6-4 provide a clearer representation of the required actions, and do not affect the intent nor implementation of the specification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously analyzed accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of a third RO to the minimum shift-crew composition required by Technical Specification Table 6.2-1 does not affect the operation of the unit, nor does it change any of the operating procedures, off-normal procedures, or EOPs [emergency operating procedures]. Staffing the control room with an additional operator enhances the capability of the operating crew to mitigate transients. Therefore, addition of a third RO to the minimum shift-crew composition cannot create the possibility of a new or different accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accidents which are potentially negatively impacted by the proposed change are any Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) inside primary containment as described in the PBAPS [Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station], Units 2 and 3 UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change increases the surveillance interval of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)) from 42 months to 66 months. This test is performed to determine that the total leakage from containment does not exceed the maximum allowable primary containment leakage rate (i.e., designated La) at a calculated peak containment internal pressure (Pa), as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J. The primary containment limits the leakage of radioactive material during and following design bases accidents in order to comply with the offsite dose limits specified in 10 CFR [Part] 100. Accordingly, the primary containment is not an accident initiator, it is an accident mitigator. No physical or operational changes to the containment structure, plant systems, or components would be made as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated is not increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The failure effects that are potentially created by the proposed one-time TS change have been considered. The relevant components important to safety which are potentially affected are the containment structure, plant systems, and containment penetrations. There are no physical or operational changes to any plant equipment associated with the proposed TS change. Therefore, the probability or consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety is not increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change introduces the possibility that primary containment leakage in excess of the allowable value (i.e., La) would remain undetected during the proposed 24 month extension of the interval between the second and third Type A test. The types of mechanisms which could cause degradation of the primary containment can be categorized into two types. These are: 1) degradation due to work which is performed as part of a modification or maintenance activity on a component or system (i.e., activity-based), or; 2) degradation resulting from a time-based failure mechanism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A review of activity-based failure mechanisms has determined that the potential from degradation due to activity based mechanisms is minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the potential for primary containment degradation due to a time-based mechanism, we have concluded that the PBAPS Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) program would identify most types of penetration leakage. The LLRT program involves measurement of leakage from Type B and Type C primary containment penetrations as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type B tests are intended to detect local leaks and to measure leakage across pressure containing or leakage-limiting boundaries other than valves, such as containment penetrations incorporating resilient seals, gaskets, expansion bellows, flexible seal assemblies, door operating mechanism penetrations that are part of the containment system, doors, and hatches. 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type C testing is intended to measure reactor system primary containment isolation valve leakage rates. The frequency of the Type B and Type C testing is not being altered by the proposed TS change. [However, in an April 18, 1994 letter, the licensee has requested a 60-day extension of the Type B and Type C testing.] The acceptance criterion for Type B and Type C leakage is 0.6 La (i.e., 0.3 % wt/day) which, when compared to the Type A test acceptance criterion of 0.75 La (i.e., 0.375 % wt/day), is a significant portion of the Type A test allowable leakage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS change only extends the interval between two consecutive Type A tests. The Type B and Type C tests will be performed as required. The Type B and Type C tests will continue to be used to confirm that the containment isolation valves and penetrations have not degraded. Containment system components that would not be tested are the containment structure itself and small diameter instrumentation lines. Time-based degradation of any of the instrumentation lines would most likely be identified by faulty instrument indication or during instrument calibrations that will be performed during the PBAPS, Unit 2 refueling outage 10. In examining the potential for a time-based failure mechanism that could cause significant degradation of the containment structure, we concluded that the risk, if any, of such a mechanism is small since the design requirements and fabrication specifications established for the containment structure are in themselves adequate to ensure containment leak tight integrity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above evaluation, we have concluded that the proposed TS change will have a negligible impact on the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. To support this conclusion, a review of the PBAPS, Unit 2 CILRT history was performed. This review identified that the only failure mechanism that has been detected during the past CILRTs is an activity based component failure, and that there is no indication of any time-based degradation that would not be identified during performance of Type B and Type C tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this review concluded that the risk of undetected primary containment degradation is not increased, the Individual Plant Examination (IPE) for PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, was also reviewed in order to assess the impact of exceeding the primary containment allowable leakage rate, if a non-mechanistic activity type (i.e., time-based) failure were to occur. The IPE included an evaluation of the effect of various containment leakage sizes under different scenarios. The IPE results showed that a containment leakage rate of 35% wt/day would represent less than a 5% increase in risk to the public being exposed to radiation. This evaluation was based on a study performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for light water reactors that evaluated the impact of leakage rates on public risk. As stated earlier, the current value of La for PBAPS, Unit 2, is 0.5% wt/day, which is significantly less than the 35% wt/day discussed in the IPE evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change involving a one-time extension of the Type A test interval and performing the third Type A test after the second Appendix J 10-year service period will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change is an increase of a surveillance test interval and does not make any physical or operational changes to existing plant systems or components. Primary containment acts as an accident mitigator not initiator. Therefore, the possibility of a different type of accident than any previously evaluated or the possibility of a different type of equipment malfunction is not introduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total primary containment leakage rate ensures that the total containment leakage volume will not exceed the value assumed in the safety analyses at the peak accident pressure. As an added conservatism, the measured overall leakage rate is further limited to less than or equal to 0.75 La during performance of periodic tests to account for possible degradation of the containment leakage barriers between leakage tests. There is the potential that containment degradation could remain undetected during the proposed 24 month surveillance interval extension and result in the containment leakage exceeding the allowable value assumed in safety analysis. A review of activity-based failure mechanisms has determined that the potential from degradation due to activity based mechanisms is minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the potential for primary containment degradation due to a time-based mechanism, we have concluded that the PBAPS Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) program would identify most types of penetration leakage. The LLRT program involves measurement of leakage from Type B and Type C primary containment penetrations as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type B tests are intended to detect local leaks and to measure leakage across pressure containing or leakage-limiting boundaries other than valves, such as containment penetrations incorporating resilient seals, gaskets, expansion bellows, flexible seal assemblies, door operating mechanism penetrations that are part of the containment system, doors, and hatches. 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type C testing is intended to measure reactor system primary containment isolation valve leakage rates. The frequency of the Type B and Type C testing is not being altered by the proposed TS change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a review of the results of previous PBAPS, Unit 2 CILRT results concluded that the only failure mechanism which has been detected during the past CILRTs is activity-based and that there is no indication of time-based failures that would not be identified during performance of Type B and Type C tests. Therefore, we have concluded that the proposed extended test interval would not result in a non-detectable PBAPS, Unit 2 primary containment leakage rate in excess of the allowable value (i.e., 0.5% wt/day) established by the TS and 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change decreases the allowed outage time of a Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) system. There is no hardware, software, or operating methodology change, so there is no increase in probability or consequences. Since the time allowed for one train of this equipment to be inoperable is shorter, the probability of an overpressure event not being mitigated has also been reduced. The consequences will not change unless the system or operation of the system changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. [The proposed change will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As this proposed change will not involve any changes to hardware, software, or operating practices, it cannot create any possibility of new or different kinds of accidents from those previously analyzed. The RHR SRVs are intended to provide protection against a rupture of a pressure boundary from an over-pressure condition which has the potential to result in core uncovery. The original design basis of the plant complies with the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix G and uses the RHR SRVs to meet the fracture toughness requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix G. This change only increases the availability of this protection and does not create any new or different kinds of accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. [The proposed amendment does not] [i]nvolve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCE&amp;G already has administrative controls in place to minimize the possibility of an overpressure event occurring as well as to assure that there are two trains of LTOP equipment operable during the modes when the potential exists for this event. There are controls to preclude the inadvertent start-up of a Reactor Coolant Pump or Charging Pump and controls to ensure that both RHR Suction Isolation Valves for each train are open and remain open except for testing and maintenance. This alignment is maintained until the RHR System is realigned for its ECCS function. These controls are proceduralized in plant operating procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as nothing is changed which affects the margin in a negative direction. The decrease in AOT actually increases the margin since the allowed time for one train to be inoperable has been reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

This proposed change was originally noticed on May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28060), which is superseded by this notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA's proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not increase the probability of an accident since the proposed change does not affect any plant systems, equipment, or components. The dual design functions of SQN's containment vacuum relief (VR) system (i.e., provide containment VR and containment isolation) are not affected. The consequences of an event are not significantly increased by the proposed increase in allowed outage time from 4 hours to 72 hours for returning an inoperable VR system to operable status. The probability of an event during the relatively short duration of the TS completion times, in conjunction with the redundancy provided in the design of the system, provide sufficient assurance that the VR lines are available for mitigating an accident or abnormal event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

TVA's proposed change provides a TS improvement that clarifies the TS requirements associated with the dual design function of SQN's VR system. The proposed change removes the potential for creating a conflict between Specification 3/4.6.3, ``Containment Isolation Valves,'' and Specification 3/4.6.6, ``Vacuum Relief Valves.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not alter any accident analysis or any assumptions used to support the accident analyses. The containment leakage assumptions used to determine offsite dose limits for compliance with 10 CFR 100 are not affected. The analysis that supports the containment VR system also remains unchanged. The proposed 72-hour and 1-hour completion times for returning an inoperable VR line to operable status are consistent with the NUREG-1431 and NUREG-1433. Consequently, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The margin of safety provided by the design of SQN's containment VR system remains unchanged. TVA's proposed change does not affect the VR function or the containment isolation function that currently exists in SQN TSs. The proposed change eliminates the potential for conflicting requirements within SQN TSs and ensures that the proper action is taken to preserve these dual design functions while the plant is in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4. TVA's proposed change provides a TS improvement that combines these functional requirements into a single specification. Both VR and containment isolation requirements will continue to be provided. Accordingly, the proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date.

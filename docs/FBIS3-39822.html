			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amsterdam, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Threats from the  conservative Freedom Alliance to boycott South Africa's first  multi-racial elections and go to war should not be given too  much weight, ANC leader Nelson Mandela said on Friday [18  February].    Mandela, speaking to journalists at the end of a two-day  visit to the Netherlands, said the threats of violence from  black and white parties in the Alliance were greatly  exaggerated, and it was not in a position to go to war.    The African National Congress leader said: "We must not  exaggerate the importance of the organisations in the Freedom  Alliance. We don't even think that they have the capacity to  conduct a civil war."    He did not believe the boycott threat was final, but even if  it was carried out it would not stop the election process.    A series of meetings were held Friday in Johannesburg by  both  the ANC and the government to try to convince the Freedom  Alliance to accept a last-minute compromise package and join the  April 26 to 28 election.    The package is set to be approved by a recalled multi-party  forum on Monday, before going to a special sitting of  parliament, probably in early March, to be passed into law.</p>

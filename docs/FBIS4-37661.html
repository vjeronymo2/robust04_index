			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Medicines Selection Board at the  Ministry of Health has approved the dispensing of Izoline 50 mg  [name as transliterated] to patients suffering from angina  pectoris [a heart attack] instead of Angipist [name as  transliterated]. A Health Ministry source said that this  measure was taken due to the unavailability of Angipist due to  the unfair embargo on medicines for the Iraqi people and the UN  Sanctions Commission's disapproval of Iraq's request to obtain  this medicine from the British Force Whitcome Company [name as  transliterated], which supplies Iraq with this medicine.</p>

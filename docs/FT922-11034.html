			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Genscher quits as foreign minister MR Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister for the past 18 years, is to resign next month. The announcement of his decision yesterday stunned the political establishment in Bonn and marks the end of an era in German foreign policy. It is also likely to cause new strains within the coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Genscher's successor was named swiftly as Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, 50, formerly the state secretary for European affairs, and most recently the construction minister. Mr Kohl was anxious to avoid any large cabinet reshuffle at a sensitive time. Report, Page 20</p>

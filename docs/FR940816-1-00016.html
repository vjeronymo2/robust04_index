			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, under section 188(b)(2) a moderate area is reclassified as serious by operation of law after the statutory attainment date has passed if the Administrator finds that the area has not attained the NAAQS. The EPA must publish a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice identifying the areas that have failed to attain and were reclassified, within 6 months following the attainment date (see section 188(b)(2)(B)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Reclassification of Initial PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 188(b)(1)(A) provides an accelerated schedule by which EPA is to reclassify appropriate initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. The EPA proposed on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58656) to reclassify 14 of the 70 initial moderate areas as serious. The 14 areas EPA proposed to reclassify were identified largely based on the magnitude and frequency of ambient PM&hyph;10 measurements above the 24-hour NAAQS of 150 micrograms per cubic meter (&mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) during calendar years 1988&hyph;1990. The EPA took final action on January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3334) to reclassify 5 of the 14 areas. The final decision to reclassify the 5 areas was based on the criteria utilized in the proposal, comments received in response to the proposal and on EPA's preliminary review of the SIP's for the areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the future, EPA anticipates that, generally, any decision to reclassify an initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area before the attainment date will be based on specific facts or circumstances demonstrating that the NAAQS cannot practicably be attained in the area by December 31, 1994 (the statutory attainment date specified in section 188(c)(1) for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Reclassification of Future PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 188(b)(1)(B) provides a timeframe within which EPA is to reclassify appropriate areas designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 subsequent to enactment of the 1990 Amendments. Appropriate areas are to be reclassified as serious within 18 months after the required date for the State's submission of a moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The statute requires that these moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP's be submitted within 18 months after the area is designated nonattainment (see section 189(a)(2)(B)). Taking these provisions together, the statute thus requires that EPA reclassify appropriate PM&hyph;10 moderate areas designated nonattainment after 1990 as serious within 3 years of such designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This directive does not restrict EPA's general authority, but simply specifies that it is to be exercised, as appropriate, in accordance with certain dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the moderate area SIP's are due before this reclassification deadline, EPA anticipates that any determination that such areas should be reclassified will be based upon facts contained in the moderate area SIP demonstrating that the NAAQS cannot practicably be attained by the statutory deadline. The EPA may also consider reclassifying moderate areas for which a SIP has not been submitted whenever it becomes apparent (e.g., because of an extensive delay in submitting the SIP) that an area cannot practicably attain the standards by the applicable attainment date. The EPA may also determine that an area cannot practicably attain the standards by the applicable date when the State submits an incomplete or otherwise inadequate SIP for the area (i.e., a SIP which would not assure timely attainment) and the State does not act expeditiously to correct such deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA does not believe that generally reclassifying moderate areas as serious rewards areas which delay development and implementation of PM&hyph;10 control measures. Rather, EPA believes its policy creates an incentive for the timely submittal and effective implementation of moderate area SIP requirements and facilitates the PM&hyph;10 attainment objective. For example, if an area that fails to submit a timely moderate area SIP is reclassified, this does not obviate the requirement that the area submit and implement the moderate area SIP requirements. Accordingly, in addition to reclassifying such areas, EPA would also determine that the State had failed to submit a PM&hyph;10 SIP and the area could be subject to sanctions under sections 110(m) and 179 for its delay. As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, States containing areas for which EPA has made such determinations have up to 18 months from EPA's determination to submit a complete plan or plan revision before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new source offsets described in section 179(b). If the deficiency has not been corrected 6 months after the first sanction applies, then the second sanction must apply. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The EPA's determination also triggers a requirement for EPA to impose a Federal implementation plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act. In conjunction with the possible imposition of sanctions, EPA may issue a determination to reclassify the area to serious.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Appendix K and Waivers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix K to 40 CFR part 50 provides guidance on the interpretation of ambient air quality data to determine the air quality status of an area. Appendix K and accompanying guidance (both preceding the 1990 Amendments to the Act) provide in part that measured exceedances of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS which are believed to be influenced by uncontrollable events caused by natural sources of particulate matter or by events that are not expected to recur at a given location are flagged and excluded from decisions as to whether or not the area should be designated nonattainment. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, if it is established that exceedances are caused by natural sources, a State may be permitted to avoid designating the area as nonattainment, even though the exceedances are expected to recur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See section 2.4 of appendix K of 40 CFR part 50 and ``The Guideline on the Identification and Use of Air Quality Data Affected by Exceptional Events,'' EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;86&hyph;007, July 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

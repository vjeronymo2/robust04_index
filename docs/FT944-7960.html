			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rising costs squeeze Norcros - Shares fall 7% as exceptional gain cushions pre-tax profits The rising cost of raw materials squeezed operating margins at Norcros, the building materials and print and packaging group, in the six months to September 30. The shares fell 9p to 120p yesterday as the company announced a 14 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 12.6m) on turnover ahead by 3 per cent to Pounds 194m (Pounds 189m). Pre-tax profits, however, rose to Pounds 8.98m (Pounds 7.36m) after an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.35m on the sale and leaseback of a property. The group still has Pounds 24m of property, which it intends to dispose of within 18 months. The rise in profits was underpinned by a 40 per cent reduction in net interest costs to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 5.2m) after last year's Pounds 49.7m rights issue helped to cut group borrowings. However, gearing at September 30 climbed back from 44 to 49 per cent. Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, said: 'The cost of virtually every raw material we use has gone up and it has been almost impossible to pass on. The overall impact of the costs we have had to absorb is 2 per cent of sales, or between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m. 'There is a marked reluctance on the part of retailers of any sort to accept price increases,' he added. Timber price rises of up to 40 per cent helped to cut profit before interest at the core buildings division to Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 3.9m) on turnover of Pounds 91.2m (Pounds 83.2m). Price rises have levelled off in the current period. Crosby Sarek, the timber door and window manufacturer, bore the brunt of a Pounds 1m group reorganisation as its workforce was cut by 100 to 700. Five years ago the company employed 1,600 people. Weak demand in the UK and falling export levels left the ceramics division with turnover down to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 52.3m) while profit before interest rose marginally to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 3.08m). However, the specialist print and packaging division reported a 16 per cent rise in profit before interest to Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 5.15m) on turnover of Pounds 53.6m (Pounds 51.9m). Earnings per share rose to 3.3p (2.8p) and the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.5p. COMMENT Norcros needs to grasp the nettle at its building products division. Crosby Sarek is languishing in a sector which is oversupplied by about 40 per cent, thanks in part to Spring Ram's expansion in capacity. The company claims to be the victim of raw material costs, but that is hardly supported by the performance of businesses such as John Carr, the Rugby-owned joinery business, which enjoys margins of about 11 per cent. Analysts forecast full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m, which gives a p/e of 18. Given the flat demand in the home improvement market, that seems a little optimistic.</p>

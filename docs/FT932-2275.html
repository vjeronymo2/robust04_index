			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Canons win close combat: Vanessa Houlder on a reprieve for church property Ever since Anthony Trollope satirised clerical life in his Barchester novels, England's outwardly tranquil cathedral closes have been perceived as hotbeds of gossip and skulduggery. This image has been revived in a wrangle about money and power concerning the ownership of property in cathedral closes. On Monday, the House of Commons agreed to a Lords amendment excluding cathedral closes from new legislation giving leaseholders the right to buy their homes. The Lords' decision was greeted with dismay by those affected. 'It is not right that people who have been loyal in paying their rent over umpteen years should not have the right to purchase their homes,' said one resident. 'I have never been fond of the idea that state rulings should not apply to the church.' The prospect of enfranchisement had aroused equal dismay among many clergy, prompting the House of Lords to intervene on their behalf. They feared that enfranchisement, which would force cathedrals to sell the freehold of properties in closes which have been let on long leases, could damage the atmosphere and architectural integrity of the precincts. The amendment was passed by 123 to 107 votes in the Lords. The amendment to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill was not the result of behind-the-scenes lobbying from the Church Commissioners, but the work of the Association of Land Owning Charities, which numbers some chapters among its members. The Church Commissioners candidly admit that they did not try to secure the amendment because they did not expect to succeed. They may have underestimated the Lords' respect for the place of the Church of England in English society. The church, argued one peer, Lord Williams, deserved to be given the same privileges as the National Trust and the Crown Estate, which were exempted from the bill. 'After all, the Church of England is the established church of the land and therefore should have some rights in the matter,' he said. Another point that weighed heavily with the Lords was the cathedrals' need to preserve control over their closes. The Bishop of Guildford voiced concern about the risk of damaging their 'religious and community focus'. The Bishop of Chichester said 'it would be a very unhappy situation and might cause a great deal of trouble' if precincts passed out of the final control of the dean and chapter, responsible for their maintenance. In fact, the degree of control exercised by a dean over the residents of a cathedral close already varies. In the view of some chapters, piety is an important qualification for living in a close. According to the former occupant of one close, it was important to be well regarded by a dean when a lease was due for renewal. 'The dean and chapter were negotiating with some people one way and some the other,' he said. 'They liked to manipulate it to keep the tone right.' But in many closes, the chapter has relinquished much of its control over residents by selling long leases. Some properties, which came into the remit of the 1967 Leasehold Enfranchisement Act, have been sold freehold. In many cases, this was the result of financial necessity. In Salisbury, for instance, close properties used to be let, at low rents, to deserving cases such as canons' widows. But by the end of the 1960s, the soaring cost of maintaining properties forced the chapter to treat its properties on a more commercial basis. Of the 80 houses in the close, there are now just 20 on the old-fashioned 'soft' leases. Another 20 properties are used for the staff of the dean and chapter. The remainder have been sold on long leases to the highest bidder. And Salisbury Close, widely seen as the most beautiful cathedral close in the country, attracts high bidders. One five-bedroom house is on the market for Pounds 900,000. The case of Salisbury might allay some of the fears about a dean relinquishing control over the residents in a close. The newer residents, who include Sir Edward Heath and other MPs, writers and businessmen, are generally perceived to be sympathetic to the character of the place, if not necessarily devout. 'At least 60 per cent take no role in the life and work of the cathedral,' said an elderly inhabitant of the close. 'But they are not opposed to the work of the church. If you come into the close, you do not have beer parties or dances.' But even if the chapter in Salisbury does not regret that it is no longer able to pick and choose its residents, the prospect of enfranchisement gave it a feeling of insecurity. 'Restrictions are not as enforceable with freeholds,' says Mr David Barke, who advises the chapter on the management of the close. He shudders at the idea that the chapter could not prevent a building being turned, for example, into a political office. Nonetheless, he has no complaints about the residents' willingness to maintain the buildings. 'The people who bought those properties look after them 10 times better than the chapter did in the 1950s and 1960s,' said Mr Barke. The willingness of residents to look after their property is, in some respects, at the heart of the debate about enfranchisement. One of the main concerns that led to the Lords amendment was whether enfranchisement would threaten a close's role as 'an oasis of peace and tranquillity in the urban environment'. Champions of the amendment, such as Lord Monson, argue that closes owe their character to 'integrated long-term planning made possible by the enlightened management policies of their governing bodies'. The government, however, believes that estate management schemes and the planning system are sufficient to maintain the character of closes. Some residents go further, believing that the cathedrals are not particularly worthy stewards of their architectural heritage. Over recent years, the cathedrals' need to provide facilities for tourists and raise funds to maintain their buildings have forced them to propose developments that have been bitterly opposed by conservationists. While nobody doubts that the closes need to be conserved, some of their residents will continue to think that the case for excluding them from the enfranchisement legislation has not been properly made.</p>

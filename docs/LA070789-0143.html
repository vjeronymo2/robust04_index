			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VANCOUVER PLAYERS, PROTESTING SLOW PAY BY PARENT WHITE SOX, DON'T PLAY  </P> <P> The Vancouver Canadians, citing what they said was a consistent policy of late  salary payments by the parent Chicago White Sox, refused to play a scheduled  Pacific Coast League game Thursday night.  </P> <P> The players left the Albuquerque Sports Stadium about 90 minutes before the  scheduled 7 p.m., MDT, start of the game against Albuquerque and returned to  their hotel, then went into a meeting.  </P> <P> "We have players with wives and babies back home, and if they don't have the  rent and grocery money, they're in trouble," infielder Jeff Schaefer said. "We  have obligations to meet just like everyone else."  </P> <P> The players issued a handwritten statement, which said in part: "The reason for  the walkout is delinquent salary payments out of Chicago. We have in the past  tried to resolve this issue through complaints to management and the Major  League Players organization."  </P> <P> Brent Imlach, vice president and general manager of the Canadians, said in a  telephone interview from Vancouver that the checks, due June 30, had been  mailed but apparently had been delayed in getting to the team because of the  July 4 holiday.  </P> <P> "My understanding is that they were sent Friday," Imlach said. "The checks were  sent out when they were supposed to be sent out" from Chicago.  </P> <P> The players, however, said this episode is nothing new.  </P> <P> "It has occurred for the past two seasons," Schaefer said.  </P> <P> The players said they would meet again today but indicated they would play the  final game in the series against Albuquerque if the checks arrived.  </P> <P> The umpiring crew declared the game a 9-0 forfeit victory for Albuquerque.  </P></p>

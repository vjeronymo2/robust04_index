			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Optimism on base rates turns cooler INVESTORS IN the London stock market yesterday paid closer attention to the rejections from Mr John Major, the British prime minister, of rumours that another early cut in domestic interest rates is on the cards. Caution over the near-term outlook for UK base rates was enhanced by trends in sterling futures and, at first, by firmness in cash sterling; a late dip in the sterling exchange rate had little immediate effect on equities. However, share prices opened firmly and only the continued weakness in pharmaceutical issues restrained the FT-SE 100 Index from reaching for a new peak in early trading. The day's high on the index of 2,859.7 was soon lost as the cooling of base rate hopes left the share gains of the previous session vulnerable to profit-taking. By the close, the FT-SE 100 was at 2,834.4 for a net fall of 17.2. Trading volume remained high, with the non-Footsie stocks continuing to attract interest; deals in the non-Footsie issues made up about 63 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 854.5m shares. Monday's customer, or retail, business was worth Pounds 1.27bn on a Seaq total of 793.4m shares. Heavy US selling of drug industry stocks was a significant feature. In addition to underlying uncertainties over possible changes to medical funding by the new US president, suggestions that Glaxo could surface in the list of rights issue prospects known to be hovering in the wings of the London stock market overshadowed the sector. Profit-taking in market sectors which have stood out strongly this week, notably the banks, aerospace and building materials groups, was modest. Stores issues, although also marked for profit-taking, rebounded when early falls took the sector relative below market tolerance. Construction and contracting shares, which have consistently outperformed as the stock market has been gripped by hopes for economic recovery and base rate cuts, extended their gains yesterday. The fall in the market yesterday of less than half of Monday's gain appeared to underline scepticism in the City of London over the apparent uncertainty in official policies over base rate policies. Having been taken completely unawares by last week's one percentage-point reduction in domestic interest rates, most analysts have now reverted to the belief that a further cut in rates will have to wait six weeks, until the March Budget. The cooler tone of the stock market allowed rights issue fears to reappear. Most of the names suggested were the old favourites, but many securities houses were braced for a heavy call on funds. However, the institutions are believed to be keener to put cash into the market by way of rights issues than by straightforward investment through the equity market. For the medium-term outlook, investment strategists continue to balance pros-pects between prospective returns on government bonds and equities. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, warned that while UK share prices will be buoyed this year by economic recovery, equity weightings of UK pension funds will fall gradually over the next few years. Any substantial fall in pension fund equity holdings would significantly hurt share prices, comments the US bank.</p>

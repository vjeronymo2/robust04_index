			<p>BFN     [Text] President Nelson Mandela says a referendum to  determine Afrikaners' views on a possible volkstaat [homeland]  is only one of several options being considered by the  government in response to right-wing demands. Speaking after a  meeting with ANC regional leaders in Durban, Mr. Mandela said  there was no firm statement about a referendum.    President Mandela said the issue of when regional  governments  would have powers to execute their duties had not been  discussed. ANC sources at this morning's conference said one of  the issues discussed with President Mandela concerned the court  case brought by the ANC in the region about alleged election  fraud. It's understood that President Mandela advised the ANC  to withdraw the case.</p>

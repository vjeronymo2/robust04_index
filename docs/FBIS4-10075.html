			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Carlos Seidl] </F>   [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 64, has said  in Sao Paulo that British consulting firms and investment banks  have "specific" and "practical" interest in "actively" engaging  in the privatization of the Brazilian electricity sector.    Hurd yesterday began a four-day visit to Brazil to promote  relations between the two countries. In Brasilia tomorrow, he  will meet with President Itamar Franco, with Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero, and with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim.    At Bandeirantes Palace, in southern Sao Paulo, Hurd met with  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, with whom he addressed the  plan for privatization the Sao Paulo potable water service.    Hurd added that Great Britain has successfully privatized  the  electric power and potable water sectors.    "As a result of this," he went on, "British enterprises have  direct experience in privatization management, and a new class  of entrepreneurs who specialize in denationalization."    Hurd said the British Government will consider reopening  official export credits for Brazil, which were suspended four  years ago when Brazil stopped amortizing its debt to the Paris  Club.</p>

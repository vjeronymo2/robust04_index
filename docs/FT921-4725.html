			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / French Property: Quiet corners with bargains galore THE FRENCH property market in Britain is more lively than at the end of last year. Busier with people looking, at any rate. For those who may feel they have heard enough of popular areas, we asked agents to suggest some lesser-known corners of France in which to look for a tranquil hideaway. Try Ariege, in southern France, says one. He has a converted mill there, with the mill house on three levels. It has a living room with exposed beams, four bedrooms, central heating and views over the mountains. The mill race runs under the mill and emerges through a stone vault. The attraction of Ariege? 'A nine-mile drive along narrow roads, followed by a three-mile walk on a footpath (or a cross-country ski over a few peaks), will get you to the borders of tax-free Andorra, or Spain.' Almost three countries for the price of one. The price of the mill? Barbers (071-381-0112) is asking Pounds 70,000. Water mills seem to be in fashion this spring. Another agency suggests one on the edge of the Charente, between Confolens and Limoges, set in 17 acres of rural land. The mill, plus cottage, face a lake. A fast-flowing stream feeds the lake and the waterfall could drive a generator. There is a living room, three bedrooms and central heating in the mill, and two bedrooms in the cottage. 'A quick purchaser might get a bargain for under Pounds 100,000,' says Waterside Properties International (081-944-0400). Head for south-west Lot-et-Garonne, near the Landes forest, advises Michael Treganowan, of the French Property Shop (0892-852-449) 'The area has strict regulations about commercialisation and its peace is assured. It is relatively unknown, free from tourists and property prices are realistic.' He picks a farmhouse in 12 acres in the heart of a pine forest on the edge of the Landes region. There is a large living room, study, four bedrooms, central heating, garage and an independent stone building for renovation. For day to day needs, a village is about a mile away. Price: Pounds 74,000. The agency has nearly 400 more properties on its books this season, passed-on by French associates who seem optimistic that the British recession is all but over. Caroline Jenkins used to be conveyancing manager with a London estate agency, selling French property. She is now with a firm of notaries in Frejus, on the south coast of France. She says there are bargains to be had in the little-known villages just inland from Frejus, with most vendors open to 'discussing' the price. The properties may need renovation but some are only half an hour from the beaches and can be found for between Pounds 35,000 and Pounds 45,000. They are often on two or three floors with not more than two rooms per floor. 'But it makes a change from the flats sold with their own mooring overlooking the port, most of which are fetching over Pounds 100,000,' she points out. One Frejus agency, Europazur (tel: 94 51 55 88), which is English-speaking, has properties from Pounds 24,000. This would buy a balconied, two-room, second-floor flat in the town, just over a mile from the beach. A three-bedroom village house might be Pounds 40,000. Agence Immobilia, at Bagnols-en-Foret, 20 minutes from Frejus, can offer a four-room house with roof terrace in woodland for Pounds 30,000 (tel. 94.40.61.54). A main street house for restoration within the village could be the same price. This agency is not English-speaking but Jenkins (office tel: 94 51 00 05) would act as interpreter, if necessary.</p>

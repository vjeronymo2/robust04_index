			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> WHAT NEXT?;  </P> <P> PONDERING THE LESSONS, HEALING THE SCARS;  </P> <P> ROAD ENGINEERS HAVE FEW ANSWERS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: EXPERTS WERE SHOCKED BY THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE TO THE NIMITZ  FREEWAY AND BAY BRIDGE. AND THEY DISAGREE OVER WHAT MUST BE DONE TO PREVENT IT  NEXT TIME.  </P> <P> It wasn't supposed to happen this way.  </P> <P> When a major earthquake strikes in California, state officials expect to see  plenty of damage. Broken water mains flooding streets. Cracked gas lines  setting off fires. Older brick buildings crumbling to the ground.  </P> <P> But freeways and bridges are supposed to stand up under the shaking, with only  some buckling and cracking of the concrete.  </P> <P> No one among the state's top road and bridge engineers thought that a major  freeway would simply collapse.  </P> <P> Four years ago, a top Caltrans engineer told a press briefing in Los Angeles  that, thanks to improvements made since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the state's  highways were now essentially earthquake-proof.  </P> <P> "We feel all the bridges and freeways will go through an event (an earthquake)  without collapsing," Ray J. Zelinski, design engineer for the California  Department of Transportation, said at the time.  </P> <P> Even the big one -- the catastrophic quake predicted for Southern California --  would not destroy an elevated roadway, he said.  </P> <P> Tuesday's 6.9 quake not only shattered lives and structures in the Bay Area, it  also shattered the confidence of the state's road and bridge builders.  </P> <P> Engineers, though generally an unemotional lot, admitted that they were shocked  by what happened Tuesday. Already, there is a demand to know what went wrong  and who is to blame. But they also admit that, so far, they can't supply the  answers.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised and very disappointed," Zelinski said of Tuesday's disastrous  collapse of a portion of Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway. "We didn't think a  total collapse was a real possibility."  </P> <P> From San Diego to Eureka, millions of California motorists drive each day on  freeway overpasses held up by concrete-and-steel columns built before 1971.  Now, Caltrans engineers say they may face the dauntingly expensive task of  reinforcing or even replacing the columns to prevent what happened on the  Nimitz.  </P> <P> The collapse of one portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, though  sure to be a haunting scene from Tuesday's quake, may not forebode a statewide  problem. Described as a vintage 1930s-era rigid steel structure, the Bay Bridge  is "unique," said Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago. "There is nothing else like  it."  </P> <P> More recent spans, including the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro and the San  Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego, were built to allow some swaying in a  quake. Nevertheless, after engineers determine what caused the collapse on the  Bay Bridge, they will be fanning out around the state inspecting the thousands  of old bridges to see if renovations are required, Drago said.  </P> <P> The freeway overpass problem is more pressing. While the collapse of the Nimitz  ended any disagreements over whether the older freeway overpasses pose a danger  during a major quake, engineers still disagree over what needs to be done.  </P> <P> Zelinski of Caltrans is among those who believe that the support columns need  to be strengthened. The steel rods holding up the columns need to be wrapped in  steel bands so that the rods do not buckle and "explode out" during a heavy  shake. The state has just undertaken a $64-million, four-year program to add  such reinforcements to freeway supports.  </P> <P> But others say the columns need to be made more flexible. Samuel Aroni, a  professor at the UCLA Graduate School of Architecture, said the heavy,  super-strong but rigid reinforced concrete structures built in the 1960s were  not elastic enough. Unable to bend to absorb the tremendous forces generated by  an earthquake, they fractured and collapsed.  </P> <P> Still, others are not sure what the proper remedy is.  </P> <P> "Frankly, we don't have the knowledge to fix them today," Caltrans chief  engineer William E. Schaefer said. Thousands of overpasses, such as those on  the Santa Monica Freeway, are supported by rigid, pre-1971 columns, and the  Nimitz disaster showed that they are vulnerable to collapse during a powerful  temblor.  </P> <P> The answer, said Schaefer, is to do more research, and that alone represents a  major change in attitude for Caltrans.  </P> <P> "We felt pretty comfortable" before Tuesday's quake, Schaefer conceded, because  of the recently completed $58-million retrofitting program begun after the  Sylmar quake.  </P> <P> After the magnitude-6.4 temblor in the north San Fernando Valley, engineers  discovered that the roadways bounced on their support columns, leading to their  collapse. To remedy that problem, Caltrans paid to have new steel ties added to  hold the road girders onto their support columns.  </P> <P> Tuesday's quake exposed an entirely different problem. The columns on the  two-tiered Nimitz freeway simply buckled and broke.  </P> <P> The Nimitz was unusual in one important sense. The state has relatively few  double-decker freeways and none in the Los Angeles area -- although plans are  under way to double-deck portions of the Harbor Freeway using different, newer  techniques than were used on the Nimitz.  </P> <P> But the state has hundreds, if not thousands, of freeway spans held up by rigid  reinforced concrete columns similar to those that broke on the Nimitz on  Tuesday. These were thought to be strong enough to withstand a major  earthquake. That thinking was wrong, at least in the case of the Nimitz.  </P> <P> "We expected damage but not total collapse," Schaefer said in an interview from  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Critics say, however, that if state engineers did not know about the problems  posed by the rigid construction techniques used in the 1960s, they should have  been warned by the near-collapse of a portion of the 605 Freeway-Interstate 5  interchange during the Whittier quake in October, 1987.  </P> <P> "Any structural engineer could see these (multi-column) structures are  vulnerable," said Aroni of UCLA, an earthquake expert.  </P> <P> "Reinforced concrete buildings of the 1960s were not designed with the  understanding of today," he said. "I am very surprised that (Caltrans) did not  realize they are dangerous," he said. Aroni said it is neither cheap nor easy  to upgrade so that the structure can bend and deform elastically and snap back.  </P> <P> "It's like a paper clip -- you can deform it up to a point and then release it  and it snaps back to its original shape, but if you bend too much, it will just  stay bent and won't go back to its original shape," Aroni said.  </P> <P> Some of the reinforced concrete structures built in the 1960s are more brittle  and not capable of bending without breaking, as the newer structures have been  designed to do, he said. Steel and concrete must be put together so they have  the ability to stretch and yield to the gigantic forces of an earthquake  without breaking.  </P> <P> State engineers realized that the support columns on older freeways could pose  a danger during a powerful quake. They planned a renovation program that  focused on those freeways supported by single columns. Freeway overpasses with  column supports on both sides were seen as secure -- until Tuesday. The Nimitz  was a multi-column overpass.  </P> <P> Caltrans engineers stress that it will be some time before they entirely  understand what caused the Nimitz disaster.  </P> <P> "We don't know why it collapsed. We have to find out," Schaefer said. The  Sylmar quake proved to be an important learning experience for engineers, and  the officials said they expect the same for the Bay Area quake.  </P> <P> "This quake will teach us what we need to do now," Schaefer said.  </P></p>

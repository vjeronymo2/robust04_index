			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Anglo-French air defence plan Leaders of France and Britain are today expected to unveil a planning unit to co-ordinate use of their air forces in peacekeeping missions. Greater defence co-operation will be the main theme at today's one-day summit meeting in Chartres. Prime Minister John Major and several of his cabinet will have some six hours of talks with the French side, led by President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. On defence there is a communion of interest between France's ambition for a strong EU defence effort and the UK's desire to play a positive role in foreign and defence policy discussions in advance of the EU's 1996 constitutional conference that may pit London and Paris against each other on other issues. The air planning unit will initially involve only about 10 officers from both air forces. But it is part of a broader defence dialogue which has involved contacts between French and UK rapid deployment forces, and a continuing discussion of nuclear doctrine. On joint arms projects, France will be keen to press the UK to join it and other Europeans in building the Future Large Aircraft, a new troop transport designed to give European armies the capacity to project power overseas.

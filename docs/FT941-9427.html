			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Played in the right spirit - Music on the South Bank Arriving at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday, one expected that Olga Borodina's lovely, lustrous mezzo would have drawn as many voice-lovers as the hall could hold. Not so: greatly appreciative though her listeners were, they filled only half the seats. Does that show that audiences at the Royal Opera, where she triumphed as Dalila in 1992, disdain mere songs? Here, with her accompanist Larissa Gergieva she offered a baker's dozen of Rakhmaninov songs and then a curious pairing of Shostakovich's op. 100, six Spanish pastiches, with Falla's artful but deeply authentic Seven Popular Spanish Songs. From her first notes in Rakhmaninov it was plain that she was in golden, generous, wonderfully easy form - though most of the composer's chosen texts carry heartache to the point caricature. Borodina fathomed their (slightly) varied sentiments with natural sympathy and spelled them out in glowing lines, with rich, solidly idiomatic support from Gergieva's Bosendorfer. More contrasts in weight and pace would have been welcome: left to her own instincts, this singer likes to be relaxed and unhurried, and some sameness began to be felt. Shostakovich's odd but lively op. 100 set (on 'Spanish' vignettes by a pair of Russian poets) enforced more variety. We heard no hint of affectionate mockery, however, only simple affection; some of the piano-writing can reveal more of a sardonic glint than the efficient Gergieva let it do. In the evergreen Falla sequence, she was out of her depth. The final 'Polo' is a brute of a piece with its furious flamenco effects, and here it sounded like forced labour. At least Borodina found the right spirit for almost every song, if in some Martian dialect of Spanish. On Sunday the Royal Festival Hall was packed for the first of three Philharmonia concerts with James Levine as conductor. A short series, but imposing, with the Mahler Third to come on Wednesday, and Berlioz's Damnation of Faust on Saturday; this opening programme comprised Beethoven's 'Eroica' Symphony and his Piano Concerto no. 4, with Murray Perahia as soloist. Perahia delivered the concerto with his usual unforced grace. It was as rewarding as it was captivating to hear, and Levine accommodated him with his usual professionalism. Perhaps the orchestral exposition built up a head of steam that the pianist would have to tamp down later, gently but firmly; and Levine made the string-statements at the start of the Andante strangely dry, bitten off note-by-note - a conception that had little to do with Perahia's reading. Those slight mismatches did no real injury to a beautiful performance. We were subliminally aware that Levine was drawing an unfamiliar hard-edged sound from the Philharmonia, especially from its strings - very tight and sharply focussed. That sound came into its own in Levine's 'Eroica'. The whole symphony was lean, swift, charged with determined purpose; the performance was at the furthest extreme from the old Viennese ideal of majestic, well-upholstered weight and ruminative depths. While it lasted, it gripped one's attention unrelentingly. It had been superbly rehearsed: the orchestral counterpoint was absolutely lucid, with lower voices striking pointfully through in places where usually we barely notice them. 'Expansive' Levine was certainly not, still less indulgent. Committed admirers of, say, Furtwangler, will not have been converted; to them, it may have seemed a heartless, machine-tooled reading. I found it unexpectedly bracing.</p>

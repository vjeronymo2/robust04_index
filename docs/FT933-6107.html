			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Clean-up crops tested for work on toxic soils PLANTS which take up toxic metals as nutrients could be used to clean contaminated soils. The crop would then be harvested and metal extracted for recycling. Professor Steven McGrath of the Agricultural and Food Research Council's Institute of Arable Crops Research described the experimental process - called green remediation - to the British Association meeting. His research team has tested a number of plants for zinc uptake on soils polluted by heavy metals from London sewage over 20 years. The most efficient plant, alpine pennycress, reduced zinc to acceptable levels after nine croppings. Prof McGrath said this could be achieved in three years, using intensive cultivation. Existing methods of physical and chemical treatment to remove soil pollution are expensive and also alter the soil structure, leaving it unsuitable for cultivation. Using green remediation techniques, a hectare of contaminated soil could be cleaned up for Pounds 5,000, leaving it fertile, whereas conventional treatment by vitrification costs Pounds 18,000 per hectare. At present the potential of the technique is limited by the productivity of the plants. Prof McGrath suggests that plants could be genetically engineered to speed up the rate of remediation and to improve the plants' take-up of toxic metals to levels where the metals could be harvested economically. Du Pont, the international chemical company, is interested in using the technique to clean up lead contamination around factories where the petrol additive tetra ethyl lead was produced, and a smelting company plans a test to produce pure metals from harvested material. Plants which have the ability to handle toxic metals are scarce and need to be protected, Prof McGrath said. One of the champion natural accumulators is Sebertia acuminata, a tree that lives on nickel-rich soils. 'An obvious application would be to 'tap' such trees for nickel, in an analogous way to that for rubber.' Prof McGrath said green remediation could be combined with bioremediation, the technique in which bacteria are used to break down organic pollutants such as pesticides to produce a one-stage clean-up. He said he would also like to study plants in areas where there is a high level of radioactivity, to see if they accumulated radioactive materials.</p>

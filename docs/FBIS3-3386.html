			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Deputies to the  National People's Congress (NPC) have agreed that despite risks  involved, new reform measures taken this year will enable China  to make a big step towards the establishment of a systemized,  standardized and legalized market economy.    Deputies attending the current NPC session expressed their  understanding of and support for these measures which will  involve a readjustment of interests among social sectors.    The hottest topics during group discussions of the current  NPC session include reform of the taxation, finance, investment  and foreign trade systems, and the establishment of a modern  enterprise system, since problems are likely to crop up in the  course of carrying out these reforms.    Sichuan Provincial Governor Xiao Yang said that reform  measures are formulated from a macro-economic angle with the  interests of the entire nation and its long-term interests in  mind.    Therefore, it is impossible to enable everyone to enjoy the  same benefits at the same time. "This is quite normal so far as  reforms are concerned," Xiao said.    He said that it is inevitable that some localities,  industries, enterprises or individuals will suffer relative  interest losses of varying degrees. "I think this problem can  be solved gradually in the course of pushing ahead with  reforms," he noted.    Inflation is also one of the hottest topics of group  discussions by NPC deputies.    Ye Gongqi, a deputy from Shanghai, said, "People are  concerned most with their rice bags, vegetable baskets and  cooking oil bottles."    If prices rise too rapidly, it will be impossible to  stabilize popular feelings, he noted. "While expanding a  socialist market economy, we should never take a hands-off  policy on prices," he said.    Huang Da, a deputy from Beijing, said society's capability  to  accept reforms is tested primarily by prices.    Specific conditions in China indicate that an annual rise of  around 10 percent in prices is the limit that consumers can  accept, he said, noting that exceeding that limit would cause  instability.    Many deputies also emphasized the importance of viewing  things from the angle of development.    They pointed out that no country in the world has thoroughly  eliminated inflation.    With a population of 1.1 billion, China needs a high  economic  growth rate, they said. At the same time, inflation should be  curbed to allow people to gain more tangible benefits.    Another hot topic is how to step up agricultural development  and narrow the gap between developed east China and  underdeveloped west China.    Many deputies agreed that agriculture is a sector essential  to social stability, as well as a sector with poor foundations.    That is why under no circumstances should rural work and  farmers' interests be neglected. However, farmers' incomes now  do not increase simultaneously with agricultural development,  nor do they keep pace with income increases of urban workers,  they pointed out.    While complaining that increased production did not result  in  increased incomes, farmer deputies talked more about how to  bring about a relatively comfortable life for farmers.    They agreed that township-run enterprises will play a  significant role in helping farmers live a better life.    Despite the fact that reform often means changes in existing  patterns of wealth distribution, reform is popular among the  deputies.    A survey shows that, of the nearly 3,000 deputies, no one  expressed objection to reforms, but some made proposals on and  voiced criticisms of specific reform measures.    Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of  the Chinese Communist Party, expressed the consensus reached by  many deputies that although reforms involve risks, they  represent the general trend and must continue.    Li said that it is imperative to carefully organize the  implementation of reform measures and reduce the risks to a  minimum in order to avoid wide repercussions on society.</p>

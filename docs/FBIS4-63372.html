			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Lvov] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 20 May -- In an interview for ITAR-TASS  today, the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who lives in  exile in the Indian city of Dhamsala, expressed his hope that he  would one day return to his homeland. "I hope to return to Lhasa  at some time, to the Potala palace, the residence of the Dalai  Lamas," said the former ruler of Tibet, who left Tibet after the  bloody clashes between the local population and the Chinese Army  in 1959.    The Dalai Lama said he "would find ways and channels to hold  a referendum on the future of Tibet." He said that in the  referendum the population would be given the choice of several  alternatives. One of these is supported by advocates of the  "middle way" who do not demand the complete separation and  independence of Tibet from China. The Dala Lama, himself, is  one of these. A different point of view is held by many young  Tibetans who insist on complete independence for Tibet. [passage  omitted]    The Dalai Lama stated that the unique Tibetan culture was on  the verge of disappearing. At the same time he stressed his  readiness to hold talks with Beijing on the basis of the  principle that Deng Xiaoping, the architect of Chinese reforms,  put forward with regard to Taiwan and Hong Kong -- "one  country-two systems" -- extending it to the present Tibetan  autonomous region of the PRC.    Sharing his impressions about present day Moscow, which he  has already visited several times, the Dalai Lama said "a lot  more cars" have appeared on the streets and "many houses are  under construction near the capital," which in his opinion is  evidence of development. But a much more striking change is that  "previously in Moscow it was difficult to communicate with  ordinary citizens, but now Muscovites converse willingly, they  ask questions and show a new openness of views and emotions."    "I think this is very important," the Buddhist spiritual  leader stressed. He advised Russians "to create something new  in the economic sphere" to avoid the drawbacks of the "Western  economic model."    On Saturday the Dalai Lama leaves for Delhi. During his stay  in Moscow, the PRC embassy in Russia expressed "serious concern"  about the activity of the Tibetan spiritual leader, which in the  opinion of Chinese diplomats, was directed "at splitting China."</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Flotation of Finnish markka causes investor confusion THE Nordic government bond markets were dominated by Finland's decision to allow the markka to float freely against other currencies, abandoning its link with the Ecu. The markka fell by about 13 per cent against the Ecu yesterday, and short-term interest rates jumped in Finland, Sweden and Norway. Dealers in Helsinki said trading in the Finnish government bond market was 'extremely hectic' as investors were in a state of confusion about the implications for bond yields. Bond yields rose initially, but fell later in the day to end lower. The 11 per cent bond due June 1995 opened at a yield of 14.13 per cent and ended at 13.62 per cent, while the 11 per cent bond due January 1999 saw a drop in yield from 13.12 per cent to 12.76 per cent. The Swedish Riksbank, the country's central bank, was forced to raise its marginal rate from 16 per cent to 24 per cent in an attempt to prevent a massive outflow of capital. There were rumours in the financial markets that some SKr30bn flooded out of Sweden in the morning, although the Riksbank would not comment on how much had left Sweden. The marginal rate, which sets the terms for Swedish banks' borrowing with the Riksbank, had been raised to 16 per cent from 13 per cent only two weeks ago in an attempt to reverse capital outflows from Sweden. Swedish bond yields soared with the 10 1/4 per cent bond due 2003 yielding 10.80 per cent at the close, against 10.51 per cent at the end of the previous trading day. At the short end, the yield on the 11.2 per cent bond due 1994 rose from 12.85 at the opening to 13.65 per cent. OUTSIDE Scandinavia, the impact of Finland's decision to float the markka was most keenly felt in European markets which are seen as potential victims of currency devaluation. Prices in gilts and Italian bonds were the hardest hit, as the realisation that the Finnish central bank appeared to be using up its currency reserves to no avail further undermined confidence in the ability of the UK and Italy to defend their currencies in difficult market conditions. Italian bond prices bore the brunt of growing fears about potential currency devaluation, due to an increasing awareness of the scale of structural problems in the Italian economy. Ten-year Italian bonds fell more than a point yesterday as the lira came under renewed pressure, despite Friday's discount rate rise to 15 per cent. Yesterday's short-term repo rate was set at over 20 per cent, up nearly 2 1/2 points from Friday. The gilts market lost close to a point yesterday, with the gilts market closing at 96.26, down  31/32 point, as the news from Scandinavia put sterling under renewed pressure. 'Foreign investors decided that maybe last week's brilliant package (the Treasury's Ecu10bn loan designed to support sterling) was not so brilliant after all,' said Mr John Kendal, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. 'Some of the benefit of that news has been unwound.' The German bond market out-performed most other European bond markets yesterday, to end just slightly lower on the day. The yield spread between 10-year gilts and bunds widened substantially from 160 basis points to 174 basis points. The bund market is providing a safe haven for many investors ahead of the Maastricht referendum in France on September 20, since it is likely to be well underpinned whatever the outcome of the vote. Further, although the Bundesbank is still not expect to cut official interest rates, hopes of some easing of money-market rates soon are growing. The French market continues to track the constant flow of opinion polls on the outcome of the Maastricht referendum. The OAT future on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, closed 10 basis points lower, but lost further ground after the latest polls showed a narrower lead for the yes camp than other recent surveys have suggested. Dealers said a slim yes vote is now discounted in the French bond market, but the market is likely to continue to fluctuate as conflicting poll results emerge. US Treasury prices yesterday retained the firm tone they adopted last week following an unexpectedly bad August employment report. A big move out of mortgage-backed securities and into intermediate-term government paper was also behind the market's big gains. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  27/32 at 100 13/16 , yielding 7.211 per cent. At the short end of the market the two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 27/32 to yield 3.786 per cent. Dealers and investors remained optimistic about the outlook for the market in the wake of the big decline in August non-farm payrolls and the Federal Reserve's subsequent easing of monetary policy, which came in the form of a quarter-point cut in the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent. Speculation centred on whether the Fed would follow that with a cut in the discount rate, but the consensus of opinion was that no further easing was likely, partly due to the continued weakness of the dollar.</p>

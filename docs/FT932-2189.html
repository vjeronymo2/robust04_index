			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: The train now arriving 15 years late . . . THE RECEPTION as we drew into Maputo station in Mozambique would have done any royal family proud. A crowd of 200 broke into applause and champagne corks popped. The British ambassador was present - a caricature in colonial diplomatic attire - with his South African counterpart in stiff attendance, too, not to mention the entire Maputo press corp. The previous half-an-hour had been even more celebratory. As the train pulled through the suburbs on the outskirts of the city, the track had been lined with thousands of cheering well-wishers, a mix of curious adults and children running alongside the train. For the few passengers on board, conspicuously white and privileged compared with the onlookers, it felt a little like Louis XVI surveying his subjects. The occasion was the arrival in Maputo of the first passenger train from South Africa in 15 years. It was no ordinary train, either. The Pride of Africa is an ultra-luxurious private steam train whose carriages and engines have been lovingly rehabilitated over the years by a bold entrepreneur, Rohan Vos. Previously, Rovos Rail, named after its owner, had only run as far as Hazyview in the Eastern Transvaal (it also travels to Cape Town) where guests disembarked to visit some of the country's premier wildlife lodges. Now Vos is determined to take his train through to Maputo on a regular basis. We were the first passengers to do the Maputo leg. In fact only eight of us, and the crew, completed the final, historic 88km from the Eastern Transvaal border town of Komatipoort to Maputo, as most passengers stopped off at the game lodges. Only later did Vos admit that, given some residual nervousness about the safety of the route, he had not been too unhappy about the slim passenger complement. His apprehension was understandable. Although most Mozambiquens are confident that peace has returned to the country following the ceasefire agreed last October between the Frelimo government and the rebel Renamo movement, the ravages of the war they fought are only too evident. Indeed, the three-hour trip from the Nkomati River is a grim testimony to the ravages of war. All the railway sidings en route are shot-up and abandoned. Burnt-out carriages lie abandoned next to the track. However, such gloomy images should not obscure the attractions of Maputo as a travel destination. Although very run down, there remains a romance, an air of continental sophistication, not found elsewhere in southern Africa. The languid people, the Portuguese language, local delicacies such as prawns and cashew nuts, the relatively unspoilt coastal strip - all combine to lend Maputo an exotic charm completely absent from Durban, the coastal resort not far to the south, whose beach-front Golden Mile is a monument to commercial vulgarity. At the heart of Maputo is the Polana Hotel, a jewel of a hotel restored to its pre-colonial splendour and the weekend destination for Rovos visitors who can spend a day looking around Maputo and take a day trip to the island of Inhaca. With a capacity of 46 passengers and a service staff of about a dozen, travelling by Rovos Rail is luxurious. The rooms, by train standards, are enormous: 14 to 16 square metres, with beautiful en suite bathrooms. The food is excellent, with imaginative menus and a good wine list. Guests are requested to 'dress for dinner', which lends a fine sense of occasion to meals in the wooden dining car. Service is friendly and efficient but unobtrusive, while the observation car at the back of the train offers a fine place to meet fellow passengers and appreciate the passing show. Perhaps the train's distinguishing feature is that it is steam-driven. (For reasons of speed and cost, electric engines are used for some of the night-time stretches). While the chugging steam locomotive adds immeasurably to the romance of train travel, it is a serious matter for lovers of steam, some of whom follow the train. One such devotee was Dave, a salaries and wages clerk from Witbank, who lovingly tracked the train's progress across the Eastern Transvaal in his old brown Peugeot 504. He gave up the chase at nightfall, but when dawn broke the next day, there was the Peugeot again, watching us from the far side of the Crocodile River as the train crept eastwards out of Nelspruit. Dave's persistence was rewarded when he was taken on board for the Maputo leg of the trip, where he was able to brief the press with due gravity about the full glories of the Pride of Africa.</p>

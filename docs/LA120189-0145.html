			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV VOWS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR SOVIETS;  </P> <P> VATICAN: DIPLOMATIC TIES WILL BE ESTABLISHED, AND THE KREMLIN LEADER ASKS POPE  JOHN PAUL II TO VISIT HIS COUNTRY.  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged in a historic meeting with Pope John Paul II today  that the Soviet Union will guarantee freedom of religion at home and establish  diplomatic ties with the Vatican.  </P> <P> Joaquin Navarro, a Vatican spokesman, said that Gorbachev also invited the Pope  to visit the Soviet Union and that John Paul thanked him and expressed the hope  that developments will allow him to make the trip.  </P> <P> The beaming Pope welcomed today's visit -- the first between a Kremlin chief  and Roman Catholic pontiff -- as a "promise-filled sign for the future" and  pledged support for Gorbachev's attempt to reform Soviet society.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Gorbachev told a news conference that a freedom of  conscience law will soon be adopted in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "People of many confessions, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and  others live in the Soviet Union. All of them have a right to satisfy their  spiritual needs," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader also said the Vatican and Moscow had reached agreement in  principle to give "official status to our interstate relations" with the  details to be worked out by diplomats. The Pope has long sought to re-establish  relations with the Soviets, broken since the Russian Revolution.  </P> <P> Departing from his prepared text, Gorbachev said: "We discussed a future papal  visit." John Paul has frequently expressed the wish to visit the Soviet Union,  provided he can meet with his flock all over the country, including Lithuania  and the Ukraine.  </P> <P> The Pope has disclosed on two occasions that he had been barred from visiting  Lithuania, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Navarro did not provide a date for such a trip. "I don't know when, but  certainly the Pope will be going some day," Navarro told reporters.  </P> <P> Earlier, as Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, entered the Apostolic Palace, they  were greeted by bemedaled Vatican dignitaries and received a salute from a  detachment of Swiss Guards.  </P> <P> Mrs. Gorbachev's red dress raised eyebrows at the Vatican where protocol  normally calls for women to wear dark dresses. But she seemed at ease as she  toured the palace and asked questions about its artworks.  </P></p>

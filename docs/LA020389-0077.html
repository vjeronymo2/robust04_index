			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court judge has dissolved a temporary restraining order that  prevented Genetics Institute, a Cambridge, Mass.-based biotechnology firm, from  manufacturing and selling an anti-anemia drug it is developing. The judge urged  a speedy trial in the matter. Genetics Institute is involved in a series of  patent infringement cases with Amgen, a Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology  company that is developing its own version of erythropoietin. Amgen and  Genetics Institute have applied to the Food and Drug Administration for  approval to sell the drug here, and both, through partners, are trying to break  into the European market.  </P></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: BTP rescue package agreed COMPAGNIE BTP, the French bank that specialises in finance for the property and building sectors, has agreed an emergency rescue package to cut costs and restructure its finances. The plan includes a radical reduction of 35 per cent in overheads, chiefly by shedding 220 staff. BTP, which has been badly affected by the downturn in the French property market, is also trying to salvage its finances by transferring FFr3.2bn (Dollars 560m) of property loans to a new company. The new company will be controlled by BTP's existing shareholders, which include a number of prominent names in French finance and construction, including Credit Lyonnais and Credit National, the banks, and the Bouygues building group. The BTP board, led by Mr Jean Bayle, chairman, has been trying to finalise negotiations for the rescue package since last autumn. BTP is the latest in a long line of French financial groups to have fallen into financial difficulty because of the precarious state of the property market. Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank which owns 4.1 per cent of BTP, last week disclosed that it produced its worst results for 20 years in 1992, partly because of its property problems. Other banks, including Paribas and Indosuez, have also been hit, as well as the French insurance companies. However, BTP is one of the most vulnerable institutions given that it specialises in property. It fell into the red with a net loss of around FFr720m last year, after making provisions of FFr600m, from net profits of FFr62m in 1991. The company said it hoped to break even this year, following the rescue plan, and to return to 'normal profit levels' in 1994.</p>

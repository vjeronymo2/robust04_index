			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Adam Lee in Macao] </F>   [Text] The latest trick in the race to leave China  illegally is to use a stolen Portuguese passport from Macao to  get a Russian visa in Beijing, according to a local government  official. Director of the Identification Department in Macao,  Salome Madeira said her office had recently received several  batches of stolen Macao-Portuguese passports sent to the Russian  Embassy in Beijing. She said Russian officials, suspicious of  the authenticity of the documents had handed photocopies to the  Portuguese Embassy, which had forwarded them to Macao for  verification. All the passports had the photographs changed by  forgers, she said.    A stolen passport can be sold for anything between HK$10,000  and $50,000 in Hong Kong and Macao, and fetches more in China  and some other Asian countries.    Ms Madeira said the number of passports reported missing in  Macao had declined from about 100 to around 30 every month.  This was partly because computerisation of check points meant  it was easier to trace people using two passports, and partly  because it takes between three and six months for a replacement.    About one quarter of Macao's 400,000 residents hold  Portuguese passports. Of the 100,000 Portuguese passport  holders about 6,000 are from Portugal or former Portuguese  colonies, about 10,000 are Macanese (born in Macao of mixed  Chinese and Portuguese descent) and the rest are of full Chinese  parentage. Until 1981, anyone born in a Portuguese territory  would automatically be a Portuguese national. However, the 1981  Nationality Law in Portugal stated that people born on  Portuguese territory after October 3, 1981 would only be  Portuguese if one or both of their parents was already a  Portuguese national.</p>

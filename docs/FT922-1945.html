			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan loosens grip on China Steel - A Dollars 680m rights issue will leave 76% in state hands THE second part of the partial privatisation of Taiwan's biggest steel group gets under way this month when local investors have the opportunity to apply for a Dollars 680m issue of shares. The issue by China Steel reduces the Taiwan government's stake to 76 per cent. It completes a share disposal programme worth more than Dollars 1bn to the government. In May, 5 per cent of the company was sold to foreign investors in the form of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs). Other local companies are eager to issue GDRs. President, the privately-owned food group, hopes to sell Dollars 100m of GDRs soon. Asia Cement and Chiah Hsin Cement have also submitted applications. China Steel, Taiwan's only integrated steel mill, was founded in 1971. It grew, with US help, into a vast, sprawling plant worth Dollars 5bn and capable of competing in the Japanese market. Despite the worldwide drop in steel prices, it managed to maintain net margins at 17.4 per cent in 1991. China Steel dominates the local market with a 60 per cent share. It will continue to concentrate on domestic business as demand continues to rise. The government will retain a controlling stake for at least four years. Privatisation will eventually free China Steel from the onerous process of obtaining parliamentary approval for all big decisions, and bringing new flexibility to financial, personnel and budget management. Last month, legislators pressured the government into forbidding China Steel from investing in Taiwan Aerospace, saying the move was too far from the corporation's core business to be justified. Taiwan Aerospace was to have invested up to Dollars 2bn in McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft-maker, but it is now doubtful whether the deal will go ahead in its original form. China Steel is also exploring a joint venture with the Australian steel company BHP to produce coking coal and iron ore, essential raw materials for steel-making. A planned joint venture to build two new blast furnaces in Malaysia has been shelved indefinitely owing to a lack of government incentives. However, China Steel says it remains open to negotiations with the Lion Group, its proposed partner. A fourth blast furnace is planned for the Kaohsiung site, and the company will be expanding its rod and bar production capacity, as well as extending its range of value-added products, such as stainless steel. Mainland China might be also be considered as a location for further expansion. China Steel is already looking ahead to the next share issue. 'Maybe if this goes well the government will push out another 20 per cent. From there it would be a small step to moving to a 49 per cent minority government stake,' the company said.</p>

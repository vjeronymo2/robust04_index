			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Posco chairman offers to resign MR Park Tae-joon, the chairman and founder of South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), yesterday offered his resignation a week before the company was scheduled to open its share register to foreign investors. Political factors appeared to have prompted Mr Park's decision, although his request has not yet been approved by the company's board of directors. Some analysts believe that the resignation offer by Mr Park, a leading figure in the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), may be a preliminary step to his leaving the party in order to support a rival candidate in the December presidential election. Mr Park was thwarted in his bid to become DLP presidential candidate earlier this year. News of his resignation sent Posco's shares tumbling on the Seoul stock market. Posco, which is 30 per cent controlled by the government, is next week expected to approve new rules allowing foreign investors to acquire up to 10 per cent of Posco stock. The company is the second highest capitalised company on the Korean exchange, accounting for 2 per cent of the total stock market value. The government is offering foreigners shares in Posco and Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco), another state-run company and the country's largest capitalised concern, in a bid to revive the sluggish Korean stock market. Mr Park offered his resignation less than a week after Posco inaugurated a fourth furnace at its Kwangyang complex, making it the world's third-biggest steel producer. 'My understanding is that he has made up his mind to resign now that the work of building a great steel industry is completed,' said an aide to Mr Park. Mr Park, a former military officer, was appointed by the government in 1967 to establish Posco as one of the main engines behind South Korea's push for industrialisation. He established the Pohang steel complex in south-east Korea and later expanded operations to Kwangyang on the southern coast.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS;  </P> <P> TIMEOUT IN ISRAEL FOR SOVIET GAME  </P> <P> Israel and the Soviet Union traded shots on the basketball court today in a  game followed so intently in Israel that radio appeals were made to taxi and  bus drivers not to mix driving and listening.  </P> <P> The viewing audience was huge for the first live telecast from Moscow in which  underdog Tel Aviv Maccabi beat the Red Army's CSKA team 97-92. In a nation of  only 4.2 million, more than 2 million people were watching at the last basket,  according to TV managing director Chaim Yavin. Even Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir, not a noted sports enthusiast, took time out to watch the game on a  small portable set in his office.  </P></p>

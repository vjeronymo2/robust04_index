			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Bank for millionaire monks: A look at the changes in management and profitability at Goldman Sachs The abrupt announcement this week of the resignation of Mr Stephen Friedman, head of US investment bank Goldman Sachs, has caused a certain amount of hand-rubbing in financial circles. Goldman is probably the most ferociously successful investment bank in the world. Last year it made Dollars 2.7bn in pre-tax profit, most of which was divided among its 150 partners. This year, the markets have dried up or gone the wrong way, and Goldman's profits have collapsed - some say by more than half. Other firms have suffered too: but according to the rumour mill, the two events must be connected. First pride, then the fall: and Mr Friedman is paying the price. This, says Goldman, is simple nonsense. The volatility of markets is a fact of life, and it is no use blaming individuals. Mr Jon Corzine, who this week was named as Mr Friedman's successor, is co-head of the firm's bond business, where most of the losses were made. The truth, according to Mr Friedman, is quite different. At 56, he is simply dog-tired. An exceedingly wealthy man, he wants to exchange life on an aircraft for trout fishing at his country seat in Wyoming. There seems no reason to doubt him. His evident relief this week at handing on the burden of office would have been hard to counterfeit. The question raised by his departure is a different one. Mr Friedman looks young and fit for his age. If he were running an industrial concern like Dupont or General Motors, he would have at least five more years ahead of him. Goldman is notorious for its fanatical devotion to work. Has the point been reached where it is only a young man's game? Not at all, says Mr Corzine, aged 47. One of the most productive members of the firm's management committee is in his late 50s. People's attitude to-wards work, he says, is a matter of individual taste. 'Some people like reading, some like sports, some just like working.' Nevertheless, the Goldman culture can seem to the outsider slightly spooky, even monastic. Take, for instance, the apparent addiction to running. Mr Friedman is reportedly an avid runner, and Mr Corzine goes out four or five days a week, 3 or 4 miles at a time. A story from Euromoney magazine - possibly apocryphal, but irresistible - tells of a bankers' meeting in London which broke up late in the evening. The other bankers tottered off to hail cabs. The Goldman team donned track suits and sprinted off in the rain. Though harmless enough, this seems symptomatic. The Goldman culture does not hesitate to reach into its members' spare time. The firm's published statement of business principles says: 'We expect our people to maintain high ethical standards in everything they do, both in their work for the firm and in their personal lives.' Or, as Mr Friedman put it in last year's annual review: 'We recognise . . . that we must be prudent in our business and personal planning and in our lifestyles.' It is a principle from which Mr Corzine does not dissent. What matters for a financial institution, he says, is reputation, both public and private. 'We don't try to dictate terms on how people handle their personal lives, but as a partner and a leader you have to be credible.' The private nature of the firm obviously plays an important part in its success. This week's announcement, however, set another hare running in the financial press: the familiar rumour that Goldman - virtually unique among banks of its size in retaining its partnership structure - is hungry for capital, and may have to consider going public. Mr Corzine, like Mr Friedman before him, gives this short shrift. The firm is always looking to raise capital, he says, if the terms are right. It raised Dollars 200m of equity from financial institutions last year. Something under a quarter of its equity belongs to outsiders at present. But going public, he says, 'is not on my practical agenda today, nor on my primary agenda for the future'. Perhaps the real threat to privacy comes from pressures of a different kind. Last year's Dollars 2.7bn profit was rather larger than Goldman's entire wage bill. That is, the 150 partners received more in aggregate than their 8,000-odd em-ployees. The question of fair distribution, says Mr Corzine, is a perennial one for Goldman. Compared with 10 or 20 years ago, the system feels to him fairer than it was, 'though of course, I may be biased'. More fundamentally, he argues, the bulk of the profit is left within the firm to make a return going forward for partners and employees alike. 'You must remember that the vast majority of that money is reinvested and at risk.' This is perhaps a little disingenuous. Anyone earning around Dollars 15m a year, as the average Goldman partner did last year, will aim to invest the bulk of it for the future. Goldman's equity capital at the start of last year totalled Dollars 3.7bn, so the Dollars 2.7bn of profit represented a return of 73 per cent. Faced with an opportunity like that, no investor in his senses would put his money anywhere else. For Goldman's employees, jostling around below partnership level, one obvious question is how many partners the firm can take on without exploding. According to Mr Corzine, this is not an immediate problem. 'At some point the group gets too extended to be a community of interest. That's probably not 250.' In any case, he points out, expansion is not inevitable. 'Theoretically, if opportunities in the financial arena were to decline over the next decade, we could have fewer partners.' This brings us back to the question of current trading. It has been, in Mr Corzine's restrained phrase, a difficult year: not just in the turbulent first quarter, when the Federal Reserve Board raised US interest rates unexpectedly, but in successive quarters as well. A lot of money was raised in world bond markets in 1992-93, when interest rates were low. 'That was a great window of opportunity, and a lot of people jumped through it,' he says. Business this year is down accordingly; Goldman's underwriting of municipal bonds, for instance, is down 50 per cent by volume. 'So some of our vital core business has slowed dramatically,' Mr Corzine says. 'That might go on for another couple of years. No one can predict.' Meanwhile, 1994 looks like joining 1979 and 1987 as a memorably bad year for the industry: not as bad as the other two, says Mr Corzine, unless maybe you were focused on European bonds. 'It might depend on what generation you put the question to.' This does not mean, he insists, that Goldman is pulling in its horns. 'There are lessons to be learnt. You get overly optimistic in the bountiful environment of bull markets. It was very easy in 1993 to think you ought to have a presence in every capital market in every major country in the world. There are ways of doing things more efficiently. But that's not retrenchment. It's adjusting the pace of expansion.'</p>

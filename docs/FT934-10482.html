			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Squatters face earlier eviction THE GOVERNMENT sought yesterday to buttress its tougher line on law and order by unveiling measures to strengthen legislation against 'squatting'. In a move welcomed by shopowners but condemned by organisations representing the homeless, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the legislation would allow rapid eviction of unauthorised occupants of domestic and commercial properties. The legislation, expected to form part of the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill, would replace lengthy court procedures to secure evictions with provision for owners and occupiers to secure immediate court orders against squatters. There would be no need for the squatters to be present or represented in court. Those who refused to respond to such orders within 24 hours would be liable to arrest and to be charged with a criminal offence. At present property owners frequently face lengthy civil proceedings to regain possession. Mr Howard expects local authorities and high street retail chains to make most use of the procedures. But law changes will also answer the frequent complaint at Conservative party conferences about homeowners returning from holidays or business trips to find their houses occupied by squatters. The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, warned that the new possession procedures were open to abuse, with occupiers and tenants only able to challenge proceedings after they had been evicted. It said there was no need to create a new criminal offence or streamline court procedures. The existing system caused delays because county courts had insufficient resources.</p>

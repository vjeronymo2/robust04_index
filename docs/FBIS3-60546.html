			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Annette Hagerup: ``Doctor Predicts Danish </F> Measles Epidemic''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE  introduction]    [Text] Parents' fear of having their children vaccinated  against measles, mumps, and rubella could result in a measles  epidemic with the risk of serious complications.    The Serum Institute fears that we will have a new measles  epidemic within the next few years.    The fear is due to the fact that requests for the MFR  [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccination dropped 10 percent  this year. (This vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and  German measles, ed.)    ``The public's support of MFR vaccinations is too low to  enable us to stave off a measles epidemic in the long run,''  said Tove Ronne, chief physician at the State Serum Institute.    ``At present measles is generally not seen in Denmark. But  at  some point the disease will be introduced into the country  again. And as by now quite a few children are not vaccinated  against measles there will be fertile ground for an epidemic. A  measles epidemic can occur only if there are enough unvaccinated  children in a society who can infect each other and thus keep  the epidemic going.    ``Today we have a large group of somewhat older children who  have not been vaccinated. In the event of an epidemic these  children run a bigger risk than they did before because the risk  of complications increases with age,'' Ronne said.''    Vaccinations for children is a service that is offered to  parents. There is no charge and they are not compulsory.    ``The first MFR vaccination is given when a child is 15  months old. So theoretically babies below that age risk being  infected with measles if they are in day care centers with  somewhat older unvaccinated children,'' Ronne said.    Inflammation of the brain is one of the serious  complications  of measles.    In Africa the disease is responsible for 5 percent of deaths  among children.</p>

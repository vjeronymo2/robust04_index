			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks hit by US downgrade DRUG stocks weakened in the face of a wave of negativity from the US, with Smith Barney leading the charge. The broker suggested that stock prices, which are some 25 per cent off their all-time highs of 18 months ago, could face a further correction of around 30 per cent within the next 12 months. The reasons for this, according to Smith Barney, are likely to be triggered by either patent expirations, or generic substitution of some of the sector's leading brands. The broker cut its forecasts across the sector and moved its industry rating from 'neutral' to 'underperform and high risk'. Warning of the rising dangers to some of the leading drugs, analyst Ms Christine Heuer said: 'For investors, we believe the situation is untenable. The downside risk is simply too great; we can envisage no commensurate upside potential.' She added that 1994 could bring dividend cuts for some of the drugs stocks which 'could send shock waves through the investment community'. Among the worst hit stocks, Glaxo slid 14 1/2 to 538 1/2 p, SmithKline Beechm rallied to close 6 off at 415p and Wellcome finished 16 down at 634p.</p>

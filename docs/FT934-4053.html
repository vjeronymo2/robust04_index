			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Private cash for schools studied: NM Rothschild to report to Patten on education financing The Department for Education has for the first time asked a UK merchant bank, NM Rothschild, to examine how the private sector could build and operate facilities for state schools. Mr John Patten, education secretary, has asked for proposals on how companies could be enticed to provide everything from concert halls to sports facilities for local authority-funded schools and the grant-maintained sector. The initiative, part of the government's drive to encourage private finance in the public sector, is being given a high priority within the department. Mr Simon Linnett, a director at NM Rothschild, has been asked by Mr Patten to establish a team of three executives to work alongside the department's internal working group on private finance in schools. It is understood that Mr Linnett, who advised the government on the Northern Ireland Electricity flotation, has already identified possible options to harness private sector skills and finance within education. They include encouraging companies to build and operate sports arenas, concert halls, theatres, science laboratories and colleges that would be rented by schools in the day and by councils in the evenings. The department would like secondary schools in England and Wales to be allowed to mortgage their buildings to raise funds to improve facilities. According to Whitehall officials, ministers believe that better maintained and operated facilities could save state schools money spent on repairs for buildings which are in severe disrepair. Given the constraints of public expenditure, officials argue that schools may have no alternative to seeking help from the private sector, although private borrowing costs more than public sector finance. The initiative on financing for schools will borrow from the experience of Britain's universities, which already receive more than Pounds 1bn a year, more than a quarter of their total income, from sources in the private sector.

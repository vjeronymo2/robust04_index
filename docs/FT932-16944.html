			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (12): Polanco enjoys a free hand - The Media MEDIA moguls should set up shop in Madrid. That is what Mr Jesus Polanco did and over the past decade he has built up the sort of empire that would raise alarm bells among anti-trust authorities in other parts of the world. As chairman of the Prisa group, Mr Polanco controls El Pais, which is by far the biggest and most influential national newspaper; Sociedad Espanola de Radiodifusion, SER, the leading commercial radio station; and Canal Plus, a cable television channel that is now poised to make massive profits. Mr Polanco has been able to do in Spain what Mr Silvio Berlusconi, for example, has been barred from from doing in his country. In Italy a group that has more than a 20 per cent quota of one media sector cannot be present in another. Where else, ask critics of the Prisa group, would a media conglomerate be allowed to corner markets with such blatant impunity? The latest raid of the Polanco empire has been on a rival commercial radio network called Antena 3 which at one point looked as if it might rock the well-established SER pre-eminence. Prisa's astute purchase of equity in Antena 3 has apparently neutralised the threat. Liquidity has fuelled the group's aggressive growth. El Pais, which sells over 400,000 copies a day and more than 1m on Sundays, posted 1992 profits of Pta7.5bn (Dollars 647m) on a turnover of Pta60bn. Canal Plus, launched less than three years ago and the group's heaviest investment to date, has pulled in 630,000 subscribers which puts it comfortably over its break-even point. Prisa's 25 per cent stake in Canal Plus now looks like the proverbial licence to print money and the group has announced ambitious satellite television plans. The free hand that Mr Polanco has enjoyed in his highly successful bid to penetrate the minds and homes of Spaniards has allowed him to become possibly the most important man in the country. Government ministers treat the Prisa group with awe. El Pais has been a firm friend of the governing socialist party but when its wide coverage of the Partido Popular's national congress last February included a soft interview with the party's leader and a favourable editorial that welcomed the growth of the centre-right opposition there were dark mutterings in the corridors of power. Had Mr Polanco switched horses? Mr Polanco and El Pais are probably quite sensibly covering their bets. The government's unease, nevertheless, pointed to the power that is wielded by the front-runners in the domestic media. ABC, which has daily sales of some 280,000 and has been required reading for Spain's conservatives since the turn of the century, often appears to create policies for the Partido Popular rather than echo them. The independence of Barcelona's intelligent La Vanguardia daily so discomforted the local nationalists that they launched a rival newspaper which, predictably, gained few readers outside the Catalan government's immediate circle. With average sales of 230,000 three years after its launch, Madrid's El Mundo is the fastest growing national newspaper and it has been instrumental in setting new standards of investigative and hard-hitting journalism that have benefited the press as a whole. The current illicit party financing scandal, known as the Filesa case, was first broken by El Mundo nearly two years ago. Uncompromisingly censorious of the governing Socialists, El Mundo has startled El Pais out of its complacency. And mindful of the Prisa group's power, the brash newcomer to the domestic press sector is also critical of the influence that Mr Polanco has been allowed to accumulate.</p>

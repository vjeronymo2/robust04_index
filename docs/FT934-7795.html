			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Krona's weakness helps Sandvik SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, improved profits by 23 per cent to SKr1.44bn (Dollars 175m) in the first nine months. The advance came without any upturn in business conditions. The revival has been attributed mainly to the weak Swedish krona, which enabled the group to push up sales by 27 per cent, to SKr15.8bn, and orders by 30 per cent to SKr16.5bn. Sales fell 5 per cent if currency factors and acquisitions are excluded. Mr Per-Olof Eriksson, chief executive, said demand remained 'very weak' in Europe and Japan, but the outlook was more positive in other parts of the world. He highlighted Latin America, Australia, China and south-east Asia as areas of strong growth, and noted a 'gradual increase' in North America. The biggest expansion of sales came in North America, with 56 per cent growth to SKr3.18bn, followed by Latin America, where sales climbed 43 per cent to SKr997m. Steel was the group's top performing division, due to a four-fold rise in profits, to SKr354m from SKr89m. This was achieved despite falling prices.</p>

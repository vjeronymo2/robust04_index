			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong bonds lend support to German equities NEITHER Paris nor Frankfurt were particularly enthusiastic about the gains which took the Eurotrack up yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was supported by a strong bond market early in the day, to the discomfiture of derivatives traders. The Bundesbank's average bond yield fell another 11 basis points, from 7.47 to 7.36 per cent. The DTB traders, caught short ahead of the options and futures expiry last Friday, were confounded again yesterday by the continuation of an impressive bond rally which has run since late August, and left them no choice but to cover again. Little investment buying was seen as the DAX index rose 17.46 to 1,479.07. International blue chips such as Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Daimler and Siemens were prominent among the winners, although Hoechst scored the biggest gain in this class with a rise of DM6 to DM227. Fundamentals registered in the DM7.50 rise to DM466 in BMW, placed on BZW's buy list last week. Thyssen fell DM7 to DM157.50, following its news of a 25 per cent cut in fourth quarter steel production. PARIS had another lacklustre day in turnover of just FFr1.54bn. The CAC-40 index ended 14.88 higher at 1,679.06, in the middle of its 28-point trading range for the day. The market was pleased by the news from Generale des Eaux that it expects net attributable profit to grow by 11 to 12 per cent in spite of trimming its 1992 turnover estimate. The stock rose FFr50 to FFr1,888. By contrast, Lyonnaise des Eaux fell FFr10.50 to FFr465. CMB fell FFr7.10 to FFr168 after JP Morgan downgraded its 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates for the company. MILAN showed signs of consolidation after its recent rally, the Comit index falling 6.59 to 411.11 in turnover estimated at less than Friday's L167.5bn. Fiat fell L107 to L4,225, Generali L750 to L27,720 and Mediobanca L460 to L10,930. But privatisation stocks bucked the trend, with Credito Italiano rising L90 to L2,290 and Nuovo Pignone up L170 to L5,350. Stet lost L43 to L1,292 in a London reaction to the company's rushed presentations last Thursday, explaining its reasons for buying Finsiel. Ras fell L210 or 1.3 per cent to L15,710 as the insurer's rights issue got under way, while its savings shares lost L177 or 2.3 per cent to L7,521. Shares in the engineering group, Worthington, were suspended pending details of an alleged sale of a majority stake in the group by Dresser Industries of Dallas to Ingersoll Dresser Pump Company. Analysts said that Ingersoll would be obliged by the new 'Opa' laws to buy out minority shareholders in Worthington. AMSTERDAM saw pressure on cyclicals intensify as the CBS tendency index retreated 1.5 to 104.0 in moderate volume. Retrenchment in world steel left Hoogovens at a four-year low as it shed Fl 3.20, or 9 per cent to Fl 31.00. Oce van der Grinten plunged nearly 19 per cent after a bigger-than-forecast fall in third quarter earnings, partly because of the strength of the guilder. It closed Fl 9.00 lower at Fl 38.50. Reports that sales at its stores had weakened drove Ahold down Fl 2.90 to Fl 73.20, although it repeated earlier forecasts of higher 1992 profits. ZURICH was led higher by banks, encouraged by easing interest rates, as the SMI index rose 21.2 to 1,904.7. Turnover was moderate. In banking, where German banks were said to have put their Swiss counterparts on the buy list, UBS was the most active stock as it rose SFr15 to SFr814, CS Holding gained SFr35 to SFr1,990 and SBC SFr5 to SFr286. BRUSSELS saw further weakness in Petrofina which eased BFr450 or 5.9 per cent to BFr7,150 on continued concerns about the future of the Ekofisk oil field. The Bel-20 index fell 3.38 to 1,091.07. STOCKHOLM was unmoved by a sharp fall in Skanska's eight month pre-tax profit and the Affarsvarlden index finished 1.3 lower at 660.3 in turnover of SKr308m. Skanska's B shares rose SKr1.50 to SKr46.00 as the results proved better than expectations. COPENHAGEN's all share index was down by 1.02 to 254.20, a new low for this year, writes Hilary Barnes. Unidanmark fell DKr3 to DKr113 following the bank's announcement that it expects a DKr4bn loss this year. The bank also announced that it is raising supplementary capital, laying off staff and concentrating on domestic business. MADRID was supported in low turnover by a strong banking sector and a better performance from utilities as the general index rose 1.36 to 195.32. VIENNA was dragged lower by the publication of a sell recommendation by Morgan Stanley on OMV, which fell Sch38 to Sch650. The ATX index fell 12.76 to 770.25. ISTANBUL fell to a four-month low as Ergeli, down TL250 to TL2,900, disappointed the market with third quarter results. The index lost 104.35 or 2.7 per cent to 3,790.28 in turnover of TL109.5bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 19                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                    Open     11.30    12.00    13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             997.53   1001.17  1000.65   999.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1059.641    062.69  1060.41  1059.28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  14.00     15.00    16.00    Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             999.57    999.66  1001.97  1001.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 200            1060.90   1060.76  1064.11  1063.18  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 16    Oct 15    Oct 14    Oct 13    Oct 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    996.54    986.39    992.09    999.62    984.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1066.23   1061.28   1074.77   1085.38   1069.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1002.22; 200 - 1066.42 Low/day: 100 - 997.35 200 - 1058.44  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SCHOOL CONVERSIONS, CLOSURES CONSIDERED  </P> <P> Ocean View School District officials disclosed this week that they might close  three schools and convert several elementary campuses to middle schools by  June.  </P> <P> The district, where enrollment has plummeted in recent years, faces a budget  deficit of between $1.3 million and $1.8 million.  </P> <P> Although officials have not yet announced which schools are being eyed for  closure, about 100 angry parents, chiefly representing Vista View School, urged  the school board Tuesday night not to close that school.  </P> <P> Some of the parents said they had heard rumors that Vista View topped the  district's list of schools targeted for closure, so they sent fliers home with  students urging parents to attend the board meeting. But board President  Charles Osterlund said no schools have been selected for closure.  </P> <P> Osterlund said studies indicated that the district would need to eliminate  three of its 17 schools to bring its average enrollment in line with other  county districts. Some Ocean View campuses now have 40% fewer students than the  norm.  </P> <P> A committee of school and district officials and parents is holding a public  hearing on the issue May 7 at Ocean View High School, and it will present its  final proposal to the board eight days later. Trustees are scheduled May 22 to  vote on that plan.  </P> <P> The parents at Tuesday's board meeting said they are determined to voice their  opinions well before the trustees make a final decision. They defended Vista  View, a K-8 school with a strong academic record.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to attack the board. We just want you to know that this is a  community that backs this school," Randy Vanderhook, whose two children attend  Vista View, told board members. "We don't want to get caught with our shorts  down and then, boom, something happens and our school gets closed down."  </P> <P> Osterlund told the parents they had no grounds for believing Vista View may be  closed.  </P> <P> "Many schools, eight or nine, are being looked at," he said. "There are many  different plans concerning schools being closed down for various reasons, but  there is not one school singled out. I think you do all of us a disservice" by  suggesting Vista View may be closed. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

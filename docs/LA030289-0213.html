			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORTH RAN CONTRA TALKS, WITNESS SAYS;  </P> <P> LIAISON MAN TELLS ABOUT 1985 MEETING TO PLAN REBEL FRONT  </P> <P> A Miami man today described how Oliver North ran a 1985 meeting that focused on  the Contra rebels opening a southern front in their war against the leftist  government of Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Rafael Quintero, a Cuban-American who helped coordinate the Contra arms supply  effort, testified at the trial of the former White House aide that "basically  Mr. North" was in charge of the June 28, 1985, meeting at Miami International  Airport.  </P> <P> Also attending the meeting, he said, were Contra leaders Adolfo Calero and  Enrique Bermudez as well as retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and  his associate Thomas G. Clines, an ex-CIA official, who were involved in  obtaining arms and shipping them to the Contras.  </P> <P> At the meeting, it was North's suggestion "to open a southern front," Quintero  told a jury in U.S. District Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan to Cut Supply Line  </P> <P> He added that North also discussed the possibility of sinking a barge to  obstruct the Rama River in order to cut off a military supply line that  Nicaragua's Sandinista government was using. Eighty percent of the supplies  passed across the river, Quintero said.  </P> <P> Quintero also testified he once heard North say that President Reagan backed  the clandestine effort to resupply the Contras.  </P> <P> This was, Quintero said, at a 1986 meeting in El Salvador when a high  Salvadoran official tried to get a commitment for continued aid. "This high  official was not going to stick his neck out and have it cut off," Quintero  said.  </P> <P> "Mr. North pointed out the President was very much aware of the efforts this  high Salvadoran official was doing, that the President wanted these efforts to  continue" he added in broken English.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Little Man From South'  </P> <P> Further, Quintero testified, North told the Salvadoran that when aid resumed  legally -- as it did in October, 1986 -- that the Salvadoran's position would  become "much easier than now."  </P> <P> Quintero said that in 1985 he returned from an inspection tour of Contra  operations in Central America. While in the Vienna, Va., offices of Secord, the  retired general telephoned North, telling him that "the little man from the  south just came back" with a report, Quintero testified.  </P> <P> Quintero, a veteran of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba who did work for  the CIA, said that Secord had enlisted his help in assisting the Contras and  that he was paid about $228,000 over two years for his efforts, including  expenses.  </P></p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Recession threatens top Paris fashion houses THE LATEST round of men's fashion collections kicked off in Paris yesterday against the gloomy backdrop of the fragile world economy and the news that the sales of the top Paris fashion designers fell last year for the first time in more than a decade. The latest figures from the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, which represents the designers, show a decline in sales of 11 per cent to FFr3.24bn (Pounds 330m) last year from FFr3.65bn in 1990. This fall follows a decade of uninterrupted growth for the Paris designers who, despite the rise of other fashion centres such as Milan and New York, still dominate the international fashion scene. However, the Paris designers have been hit, like other areas of the luxury goods industry, by the US recession and Europe's economic slowdown. The US economy is now recovering, but the fashion houses are being further threatened by financial worries in Japan, another big market. This weekend's collections are an important test of market conditions. The shows started yesterday morning when Dirk Bikkembergs, a young Belgian designer, unveiled his collection for spring next year at an art gallery in the Bastille area. True to the tradition of designer fashion, the show began nearly an hour late with empty seats as many buyers had not yet arrived from Milan, where Giorgio Armani held his show on Thursday. The mood of the men's collections is restrained. Thierry Mugler has stopped holding shows and displays his men's collection in his showroom. Comme des Garcons does not use professional models. Its show, yesterday, featured amateurs such as actor John Hurt. Despite the downturn the fashion houses are still expanding their menswear ranges. Yohji Yamamoto is launching its Ys line, a cheaper range already available in Japan, in Europe this autumn. Celine is introducing its first male line this weekend, as is Leonard.</p>

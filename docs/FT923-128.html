			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Jobs: Even non-lunatic fringes can blind - Consultants' survey confirms that UK organisations' executive-pay policies reflect the Gospel IT is time for an addition to be made to the standard dictionaries of English. True, most include the phrase 'perk up' - defining it, for example, as 'to make or become more cheerful, hopeful or lively'. But in none of them can I find 'perk down' which, as all too many people have learned this past year or two, means 'to be brought back to earth with a bump'. Although spoken of lightly as fringe benefits, the perquisites executives receive are apt to have a profoundly anaesthetic effect on their perception of reality. The Jobs column owes the most striking example it knows of to 39-year-old reader Ed Hughes. Describing the effects of suddenly ceasing to be a managing director, he singles out the shattering realisation that 'petrol is no longer 50p a gallon, as was the case the last time one bought it personally.' What might be some compensation to him and his luckless contemporaries, is the fact that things could have been worse. In Britain's pay-freezes of the 1970s, several companies extended the perks-supply to suits or dresses for spouses as well as executives, household furnishings, and boarding-school fees for children. Hence job loss might leave a once-proud couple shivering in their underwear, bereft of curtains to hide their shame from the neighbours, and picturing their kids awakening in the dormitory to find their suitcases standing packed beside their beds. While those lunatic days may be gone, however, managers evidently still have a lot on the fringe to lose - at least in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the rule seems to be that the bigger they are, the harder they are prone to fall. That much is plain from the underlying table, which is drawn from the P-E International consultancy's latest survey of executive rewards in the UK. Anyone who wants the full report, which contains a wealth of information and is priced at Pounds 350, should contact P-E's Michael Smith at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; telephone 0784-434411, fax 0784 437828. My extracts are limited to the survey's findings on the more common types of perks - although they exclude some apparently in growing vogue, such as free counselling on personal finances. The table takes 13 salary-bands from Pounds 20,000-Pounds 25,000 upwards and shows the percentage of managers on the various perches of the pay pecking-order who enjoy each perk listed. The all-ranks figures at the bottom, comparing this year with 1987, refer to all executives covered by the survey, including those on salaries under Pounds 20,000 a year. In general, the table surely again confirms that UK pay policies are guided by Matthew XXV:29, which starts: '. . .unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance' Alas, amid the joys of profiting by said principle, it's too easily forgotten that the same verse ends: 'but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.' N OW to a job being offered by head- hunter Dudley Edmunds on behalf of the London arm of an international bank he may not identify. Accordingly, he promises to honour applicants' requests not to be named to the employer at this stage. The treasury team advising small companies and individual millionaires needs an extra member conversant with currency and derivatives markets, and sweetly communicative in Italian and preferably French as well as English. Salary up to Pounds 60,000 with typically munificent City-banking perks. Inquiries to Mr Edmunds at Westminster Associates International, 1-4 Warwick St, London W1R 5WB; tel 071-287 5788, fax 071-287 9986. FINALLY today, to the puzzle printed last week which, as readers then in attendance may recall, consisted of decoding the following division sum:                  XX7XX              ____________         XXX ! XXXXXXXXXXX                XXX               ____                  XXX                  XXX                 ____                   XXXX                   XXXX The copy-book answer, which several dozen of you have taken pains to show you arrived at, is:                  80709              _________         124 ! 10007916                992               ____                  879                  868                  ___                   1116                   1116 One independent spirit also did the trick using a divisor of 111, but it seems questionable whether that solution fits the form of the sum as it was set out.</p>

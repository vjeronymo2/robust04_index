			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLINTRIDGE PREP SCORES BIG, 60-35  </P> <P> The details escape Glen Beattie.  </P> <P> Of course, when you coach -- much less watch -- a football team that plays a  game in which 95 points are scored, well, specifics can be difficult to recall.  </P> <P> "The game is kind of a blur," Beattie said of Flintridge Prep's 60-35 victory  over Pasadena Poly last weekend that gave the Rebels the Southern Section Large  Schools Eight-Man Division championship.  </P> <P> It was the first Southern Section championship of any kind for Flintridge Prep,  which opened in 1933 and began playing at the eight-man level in 1974. The  school has just 300 high school students.  </P> <P> Flintridge Prep played in the last six-man championship game in 1973, but lost  to Rio Hondo Prep, 39-8.  </P> <P> "Everybody just feels real proud," said Alex Rivera, Flintridge Prep's athletic  director and boys' basketball coach. "Everyone on campus is celebrating."  </P> <P> Earlier this season, Flintridge Prep had beaten Poly, 27-6, by keeping the ball  on the ground. This time the game plan changed as quarterback Chris Bisgaard  completed 14 of 19 attempts for 347 yards and six touchdowns. David Swayne had  10 receptions for 238 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Leading, 30-27, in the third quarter, Bisgaard and Swayne teamed up for two  touchdowns during a 23-point surge that took just 1:57 to complete.  </P> <P> "It was a great way to finish a great season," said Beattie.  </P></p>

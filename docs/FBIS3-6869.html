If you stop telling lies, then we might retrieve the die, he  replied to a question on his letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of  London in which he stated that the die is cast on the issue.    He also made clear that the ban only covered future  government contracts and did not apply to the private sector or  other economic activities.    Speaking to reporters at the 10th International General  Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council here, Dr.  Mahathir said taking legal action against the British newspapars  concerned would not get us anywhere.    It will only result in the British papers having a field day  reporting all kinds of mud which they are very good at, he added.    The Malaysian Government decided to stop awarding new  contracts to British firms following a barrage of wild  allegations by the British media implying that its leaders were  corrupt.</p>

The new  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system hooks 33,000 of Korea's  overseas trading firms to 33 banks for electronic issuance of  export-import approval, opening of letters of credit and other  trade-related banking transactions.    Kim Myong-ho, governor of the Bank of Korea, demonstrated  the  system in yesterday's opening ceremony at the main branch of  Hanil Bank in Myongdong in downtown Seoul.    The system presents standardized forms on the screen for  users to fill out. The governor processed one firm's request  for export approval in less than five minutes as a demonstration  of the system's efficiency.    Data indicate that banks processed some 1.3 million similar  requests last year alone. The difference was that those  transactions took place at the expense of actual visits to banks  through traffic and waits upon arrival.    Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy say  that plans are now underway to expand the system to include  shipping and customs by July and October of this year,  respectively. By 1996, they are envisioning a comprehensive  electronic network covering the A to Z of overseas trading. The  current system is limited to 33 Korean banks handling foreign  exchanges. But officials say foreign banks operating in Korea  are likely to be added to the system by July.</p>

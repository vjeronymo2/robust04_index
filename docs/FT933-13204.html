			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Directors at Kirin to resign over payments KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, said its chairman and two other executives would step down after last week's arrests of four company employees, suspected of paying up to Y33m (Dollars 308,411) to sokaiya, or racketeers. Mr Hideyo Motoyama, Kirin's chairman, Mr Teruchika Ishii, vice-president, and another executive willresign at the end of this month. Last October, Mr Masatoshi Ito, the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading retailer, was forced to resign after three Ito-Yokado officials were arrested for payments of Y27m to sokaiya. Kirin's payments to gangsters are believed to have started after a shareholders' meeting in 1983, which lasted five hours due to questions from the racketeers. The company said it would cut bonus payments for Mr Keisaku Manabe, company president, by 30 per cent, and by 15 per cent for Mr Yasushi Yamamoto, vice-president. Other board members face a 15 per cent cut. Kirin suspended all beer advertisements last week. The company said the suspension would last 'for the time being' saying it was wrong for the company to actively publicise its products at the same time as apologising for the scandal. Kirin has acquired 50 per cent of Hiljo, the Dutch flower-exporting subsidiary of Finnish state-owned chemicals group, Kemira. The Japanese brewer has taken an option to acquire the remainder of Hiljo, which has annual turnover of about Dollars 35m, at a later date. No price was announced. Faber Group has entered into a joint venture with Granton International, part of the Sheraton International group, to develop a hotel and a commercial complex in Kuala Lumpur, Reuter reports. Faber will take up 51 per cent of the venture company, Inter-Heritage.</p>

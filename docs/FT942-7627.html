			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Austria set for slow recovery Austria's economy will growth at about 1.5 per cent this year, although expansion is likely to pick up to 2.4 per cent next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This follows a 0.4 per cent fall in gross domestic product in 1993. In its annual report on the Austrian economy, published yesterday, the OECD said sluggish recovery among principal European trading partners was likely to limit the scale of the upturn. Additionally, Austrian exports are forecast to lose market share abroad as a result of the delayed effect on competitiveness of the appreciation of the schilling. The recovery of corporate investment will probably remain weak, the OECD said. Although a stimulus to business investment should come from further interest rate cuts and corporate tax reform, the impact might take time to come through. The OECD forecasts inflation as measured by the GDP price deflator will fall to 2.8 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 1995 from 3.7 per cent in 1993.</p>

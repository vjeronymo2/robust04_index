			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT PROBER KNOWN AS CHARISMATIC LITIGATOR  </P> <P> When Chicago lawyer Richard J. Phelan was named last summer to direct the House  investigation of Speaker Jim Wright's financial affairs, some Republicans were  immediately suspicious.  </P> <P> Phelan had raised money for Illinois Democratic Sen. Paul Simon's unsuccessful  campaign for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1988. And the  Illinois lawyer had been elected as a delegate to the Democratic convention,  although he decided not to attend.  </P> <P> But this week, when the House Ethics Committee voted to charge the Texas  Democrat with significant violations of House financial conduct rules based on  Phelan's findings, any anxieties that he was a party apologist were laid to  rest.  </P> <P> Rather, Phelan's performance demonstrated traits that those who know him say  dominate his professional approach much more than partisan loyalty. He is  aggressive, tenacious and charismatic.  </P> <P> "He's as dynamic and persuasive as anyone you'll ever meet," one former  associate said.  </P> <P> Some of Wright's defenders in the House would add another description to that  list -- ambitious.  </P> <P> "This shows why you should never appoint a guy special counsel unless he's near  retirement," said a Democratic congressional aide, referring to the 52-year-old  Phelan. "He's too tempted to make a splash."  </P> <P> Ethics Committee members and some others familiar with the investigation have  ardently defended Phelan, saying he was appointed to do a thorough job in a  very sensitive case and handled it expertly.  </P> <P> However, some of Wright's backers have charged that his exhaustive 450-page  report on Wright shows that, perhaps to raise his own profile politically, he  pulled together a huge amount of largely extraneous information and cast in it  in the harshest possible light for the Speaker.  </P> <P> Next week, the committee is expected to release Phelan's report and begin  pondering whether to recommend disciplinary action against Wright for allegedly  accepting improper gifts from a businessman friend and evading House limits on  outside income.  </P> <P> Phelan's acquaintances say they are not surprised that he managed to achieve in  the Wright inquiry a feat that many others would have considered highly  unlikely -- persuading two Democratic members of the Ethics Committee to vote  against their party's top House leader.  </P> <P> His record, they note, is one of success. In 1975, the lanky lawyer with the  infectious laugh left his position at a Chicago law firm and started his own  firm, now Phelan, Pope &amp; John. It has 63 members.  </P> <P> Over the years, they say, he developed a well-earned reputation as a  charismatic litigator who could immerse himself in complicated cases and then  win over jurors with his interpretation of the evidence.  </P> <P> A Phelan strength is "knowing instinctively how to try a case," said Bradley  Falkof, a former Phelan associate and now a partner with Griffin &amp; Fadden  in Chicago. He said Phelan presents his arguments clearly and persuasively in  plain language because "you aren't going to find a jury full of Harvard  graduates" on many cases.  </P> <P> Phelan has also had a particular bent for questions of ethics. At the Chicago  Bar Assn., of which Phelan was president in 1985 and 1986, executive director  Terrence Murphy praised him for "heightening the consciousness" of local  lawyers and judges on matters of professional propriety.  </P> <P> Phelan initiated a program that included videotaped sessions on prime issues.  "He stepped out front on the subject of improved ethics throughout the legal  profession," Murphy said.  </P> <P> In presenting his findings on Wright in executive sessions before the Ethics  Committee, Phelan strove to build credibility and rapport with the members.  And, some Democrats have noted privately, he apparently courted support outside  the formal meetings as well.  </P> <P> They point to an incident Tuesday night in which Phelan was robbed at gunpoint  when walking down a street near the Capitol. His companion at the time, who  also was robbed, was Rep. Chester G. Atkins of Massachusetts, one of the two  Democratic panel members who a day later cast the crucial votes on the  wrongdoing allegations. They had just had dinner together.  </P></p>

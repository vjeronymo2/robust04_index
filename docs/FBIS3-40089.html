			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Jianhua (2799 3386 5478): "Alarming Report </F> on Social Problems of Chinese Youth in 1994"--First paragraph is  editor's note]    [Text] This alarming report from Yang Jianhua, secretary of  the China Youth Research Center, is based on his study of  voluminous reliable documents and data supplied by the State  Statistical Bureau. Its intent is that all sectors of society  have an increased awareness of the social problems of our young  people, and implement efficient social administration and deal  with the problems at an early stage.    As a general observation, the main trend of the Chinese  youth  campaign will show both healthy and stable development in 1994;  the social problems connected with youth are not sufficient to  cause the eruption of a societal crisis, but neither can they be  regarded as unimportant.    In 1994, the susceptible points of society's youth problems  will be concentrated in the economic area. Due to the pressures  of the decrease in the domestic economic growth rate during the  year, youth benefits seeking space will tend to be relatively  narrow within a certain period of time. Once the macroscopic  activity of reforming the economic and political systems is  begun, it becomes impossible to accomplish immediately the  principle of fairness in social distribution. So when a part of  youths' benefits are threatened, they will either get the idea  of seeking society's protection, or else fall into an unbalanced  psychological state that puts them in a contradictory mood. The  possibility that economic problems will produce negative social  events will increase.  <H3>  The Blue Collar Tide Will Cause a Million Young Peasants To  Leave Their Villages and Fields </H3>   Experts forecast that in 1994, the tide of blue collar  workers in which young peasants are the dominant factor will  increase by more than 20 percent over the previous year, which  would be about 8 million people.    Due to the widening gap between industry and agriculture,  with less profit in farming, the peasants' enthusiasm has been  damaged, and finding outside employment has become the major way  of earning a living for rural youth. In Lin County, Henan, which  has the greatest number of peasants seeking work elsewhere, "a  construction army of one million has gone out from Taihang  Mountain," which can bring several hundred million yuan into the  county every year. Meanwhile, young peasants leaving their  villages and fields on a large scale could be fatal to an  agricultural labor resource which were not of a high quality  before.    Analysis shows that in 1994, the region which will be under  attack by the tide of peasant laborers will still be Beijing,  Tianjin, Shanghai, and the coastal open cities, these crowded  cities cannot bear such a heavy burden any longer. Shortages of  funds have caused sharp cutbacks in construction projects,  leaving a large group of peasants with no work to do, so they  will become a blind flow of people.    These circulating peasant laborers are carried by rail. If  in  1994 rail travel continues to be as rough as it has been, it is  possible that extremist activities directed at railroad  departments may occur in individual areas where there are  tie-ups.    Protection of the rights and interests of young peasant  laborers is steadily becoming a greater problem, as nearly every  day brings new instances of illegal employment of workers and  threats to the rights and interests of young peasant workers. In  Beijing's Chongwenmen illegal labor market, traders in human  beings abducted and sold to Qingzhou, Shanxi, more than 1,800  young female peasants who had gone to Beijing to find jobs.    It can be said that this large-scale transfer of the surplus  rural labor force will be a troublesome problem in urban and  rural construction and administration in 1994. Whether we let it  go or block it, whether we transfer it to other places or try to  accept it locally, there should be a scientific and practical  plan for resolution.  <H3>  Protection of Young Workers' Rights and Interests Is Leading  To Disputes Between Labor and Capital </H3>   As enterprises increase their reform, smashing the old  system, implementing various contract systems, joint-stock  systems, and perfected reorganization, it is urgent that the  rights and interests of both employers and employees undergo  major adjustment. Because enterprise reform is at present still  incomplete, the rights and interests of enterprises and young  workers are still not in conformity, leading to frequent  conflicts. In state-owned enterprises, disagreements between  young workers and enterprises are concentrated chiefly in the  system for using labor; in foreign capital enterprises, the  disputes lie for the most part in the area of interpreting and  implementing contracts; in privately owned enterprises, disputes  mostly center around threats to rights and interests.    During the first half of the year, the Shanghai Labor  Arbitration Department handled a total of 319 cases, an increase  of 43.7 percent over the same period last year. In foreign  capital enterprises throughout the country, there were 2,000  worker strikes during the first quarter of 1993 alone. Many  young employees of privately run enterprises went to court  seeking legal protection for their rights. Of these, the abuse  suffered by the Chinese crew of the foreign ship "Acadia" was a  shock to society.    It is forecast that in 1994 cases to labor arbitration  departments seeking legal resolution will tend to increase. It  is a matter of urgency to accelerate the formulation of labor  laws and regulations, providing a legal foundation to protect  the rights and interests of both enterprises and young people  from encroachment and threat. This will avoid and reduce this  destabilizing factor in society.  <H3>  Guard Against Secular, Aristocratic, and Mercenary  Tendencies on Campus </H3>   According to a survey, more than 60 percent of college  students and young teachers lack confidence about going into  society, establishing themselves and building the country  through what they have learned. Two-thirds of those surveyed  considered teaching, scientific research, and public affairs as  dangerous roads to take. This kind of phenomenon may include the  dissatisfied mood of intelligent young people who have lost a  balanced state of mind. What deserves more vigilance is the  depreciation of knowledge that has led to secular, aristocratic,  and mercenary tendencies on campus.    Secularization is expressed in a lack of concern for  politics, pandering to popular culture, and viewing popular  taste as fashion. Aristocratic tendencies are expressed as a  lack of concern for the masses, and regarding the main stream of  Chinese culture of China with contempt. Mercenary tendencies  appear when the value judgements of intelligent people tend  toward material desires and money in a great degree, their  awareness of civilization's development shaken.    The campus definitely provides an excellent base for  supplying the talent China needs to succeed in its strategy of  catching up with world trends by the end of this century.  However, the current situation is that people engaged in  business, teaching, and studying lack vigor, with future  problems difficult to foresee. Reliance on morality alone to  solve this problem is far from sufficient; it is urgent that the  State invest more in education and provide favorable policies  for education.  <H5>  Rising Prices Affect Young People's Financial Benefits </H5>   Economists forecast that the inflation rate for the cost of  living in 1994 will still be around 10 percent, and the  government will put its limited financial resources into  projects which are related to the nation's strength, such as in  agriculture, transport, and energy. At the consumer level, it is  the young people who will feel the greatest effects from rising  prices.    Statistical documents show that among young people, it is  farming peasants and the working class who will feel a money  pinch most acutely; government workers and young intellectuals  will see a continual increase in the gap between their income  and the average income in society, directly affecting their  standard of living and their recognition of reform. An  investigation by the Beijing Zero Point Survey Company showed  that worries about rising prices was undermining the morale of  residents of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Although experts do  not foresee the reappearance of panic buying, as in 1988, there  could be an abnormal reaction from young people, the group which  will suffer the greater loss in benefits. In addition, the  occurrence of negative events in some inland areas is not beyond  the realm of possibility.    As we are consciously breathing life into the education of  our youth and into reform, we should also set our hand to social  security work on young people's special benefits. This will help  young people who are having problems in their lives get past the  difficult stage, as well as assisting the government in  formulating relevant youth social security laws and regulations,  setting a minimum wage, a minimum cost of living, subsidies for  financial emergencies, and related welfare.  <H3>  Big Income Gap Leads Youth to an Unbalanced State of Mind  Regarding Society's Fairness </H3>   In recent years, the gap between people's incomes in China  has been growing steadily, taking shape on three obvious levels:  individual and private operators of businesses, company managers  and foreign trade agents, entertainment and sports stars have  become the wealthy class; salaried workers who are satisfied  with their lives; peasants, unemployed people, and retirees have  become the poor class. The average between the lowest and  highest incomes in the three classes is 1:15 to 1:20. At  present, in the world's developed nations, the income gap  usually stays at the rate of 1:10.    The statistics show that less than one-third of those at  society's highest income level are young people, but in their  activities, especially their consumption activities, these act  as a strong role model for others of their generation. A  significant number of low income youth sometimes have inner  doubts about "whether social distribution is fair." They cannot  concentrate on their studies or work, and some even take the  "shortcut" of breaking the law. Although the problem of large  gaps in personal income will be adjusted by personal income  taxes in 1994, it takes time to establish a distribution system  which is acceptable to the public. Unfair distribution is still  a factor which could potentially affect young workers'  enthusiasm for work.  <H3>  It Is Urgent We Strengthen Youth's Overall National  Knowledge and Unified Ethnic Knowledge </H3>   Political education in recent years has largely ignored  overall knowledge of the nation and unified ethnic knowledge;  rather, the reality has been that a tendency to local  protectionism has certainly developed. In 1994, opposing foreign  forces on our borders will continue to make trouble in Tibet and  Turkestan. Our northwest will still be a sensitive area of  ethnic conflicts and religious disputes. There will continue to  be antagonisms concerning rights in the South China Sea, Taiwan  Independence, and the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong.    We should strengthen the overall national knowledge of  youth,  telling them repeatedly that China is the family of every  Chinese, the joy of the Chinese nation, and it is not correct to  go the way of developing only a certain area or a certain  nationality in isolation. The present generation of youth should  keep a clear mind, definitely preserving the unity of state and  nation, and struggling against all types of divisional actions  by opposing forces both within and outside of China.  <H3>  Criminal Actions of Youth Are Obviously Directed at the  Economic Area </H3>   This year and next, criminal actions of youth have obviously  been directed at economic activities. Among these, economic  disputes which lead to hooligans fighting with weapons, and  cases of retaliation for injury have shown a sharply increasing  trend. All crimes, such as robberies on the road or on buses,  the abduction and sale of human beings in inland areas,  prostitution, drug dealing, and smuggling along the coast, have  the obvious intent of obtaining money.    We can predict that there will be new youth crime problems  in  1994. The youth black society group will spread to the economic  area; crimes of theft will rise among high school students;  there will be an increase in the flow of people blindly fleeing  crime; and fraud cases in economic activities will tend to be  serious. We should pay special attention to the problem of crime  among youth who are "the group outside the system," and the  trend of youth and teenage crimes to occur at a lower age.    Every segment of society should jointly look for scientific  countermeasures for dealing with this, to create an excellent  social environment for further reform and opening up.</p>

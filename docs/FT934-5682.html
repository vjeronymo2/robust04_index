			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / People: A belief in the power of reason - Louis Schweitzer tells Kevin Done and John Ridding about the Renault/Volvo debate Louis Schweitzer, the chairman of Renault, likes to have a sense of direction in his life. It served him well during his rapid rise through the elite ranks of the French civil service - he was chief of staff to Laurent Fabius when he was prime minister in the mid-1980s - and by the middle of last year it had brought him to the top of the French state-owned car group. But for several weeks he has been left twisting in the wind as Volvo, Renault's Swedish partner, has been forced to endure a shareholder rebellion which threatens a planned merger between the two groups. Shareholder resistance has already forced Volvo to postpone a vote on the deal. Investors will now deliver their verdict on December 7. The merger is one of the most ambitious ever attempted in the auto industry. It would also remove Swedish control of the country's biggest industrial group at a time when the country is already gripped by self-doubt, and is teetering on the edge of joining the European Union. Schweitzer is a keen theatre-goer, but he refuses to draw any business lessons from his recent attendance of a performance of The Persians - Aeschylus' account of how the Persians invaded Greece only to be humbled and sent packing. 'It is in everyone's best interests that Volvo should not lose its identity, nor its homebase. That would be crazy, that would not be sound management. You must keep a strong base in Sweden, technically and in manufacturing.' Schweitzer is clear that a no-vote from Volvo's shareholders would not only rule out a full merger but, just as important, it would jeopardise the existing far-reaching alliance between the two groups consummated in January 1991 with the exchange of sizeable cross-shareholdings. 'If there is a no, it is clear that the momentum that makes people co-operate would be lost. The momentum would disappear. You cannot work together without a sense of direction and there would be none,' he says. Leaning back in his chair against a backdrop of modern art and model cars Schweitzer still appears at ease in the face of such high stakes. But the challenges of the merger represent unfamiliar territory. The leader of a state-owned industry, he is confronted with a rebellion by small shareholders and institutions. A man of reason, he has become embroiled in an increasingly emotional debate in which he believes the facts have become increasingly obscured. The scale of the opposition from Swedish shareholders has caught Schweitzer by surprise. 'The debate became rather emotional. It became so loud it was deafening; and the issues were not being addressed.' Schweitzer's response has been to argue his case as dispassionately as possible. In a series of interviews with Swedish television and newspapers and frequent visits to Volvo, the Renault chairman has sought to provide reassurance on the principal points of resistance to the deal: the timetable for privatisation of the merged group, and the French government's retention of a golden share in the new company. He has emphasised the industrial logic of the deal which he regards as vital for both companies in the face of the increasingly competitive international automobile industry. Economies of scale, shared buying and R&amp;D expenditure are necessary, he says, to help ease the burdens of new product developments. Having made his case, he now stands firm. 'This is it, it is decision time,' he says. 'We have presented a fair deal. Feelings sometimes overcome reasoning in a debate; now I hope that reasoning can overcome the emotions.' The emphasis on the power of reason to win an argument reflects his background and education. Like other 'enarcs' - graduates of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for the elite of the French government service - Schweitzer has a training in logic and debate. 'He has an excellent analytical mind,' says Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman. It is not easy, however, for Schweitzer to put his message across. 'It is not natural for Renault to go to AB Volvo shareholders. I have no reason to say I know Swedish shareholders better than Volvo does.' If all goes to plan, however, they will become his shareholders from the beginning of January. As head of the industrial operations of the merged company, Schweitzer will be in charge of its day-to-day operations. Later in the year it is due to be privatised. But how will a product of the French administration and public sector industry adjust to the private sector? In particular, how will he deal with restive Swedish shareholders? Schweitzer is sanguine about the prospect. 'It is one of the peculiarities of the French system that this happens,' he says, pointing to the experience of Jacques Calvet, the head of rival car builder Peugeot-Citroen, and Michel Pebereau, head of Banque Nationale de Paris which was successfully privatised last month. Both had backgrounds in financial administration. Moreover, Schweitzer argues that Renault has long been operating as a private sector company. 'The real change occurred in 1985 when Georges Besse (then chairman) declared that Renault should aim to become the most profitable European volume carmaker.' That was achieved last year,' says Schweitzer. 'Renault will stay profitable throughout this recession,' he claims. 'That will be the ultimate test - that in the worst downturn in history we can still make money. I think that is rather commendable.' As for shareholders, even restive Swedish ones, Schweitzer is relaxed. 'Obviously there is a difference between having one shareholder or 1,000 shareholders, but management principles remain the same.' He argues that sensitive decisions such as those relating to expanding or closing plants will be taken on commercial grounds and would not be put to shareholders. If the merger does not go through, Schweitzer believes the challenges would be the same, but harder to deal with. 'All debates leave scars, and the scars would remain. We would have to turn to limited partnerships with other groups, which could give some solution to the problem of insufficient volumes.' He points to the existing collaboration with Peugeot in V6 engines and gearboxes. 'But it wouldn't be as good.' The delays of recent weeks are already a source of irritation. A product of France's fast track, Schweitzer believes in moving quickly. 'Speed is of the essence,' he said when the merger was announced. A no vote in eight days' time would force him to pull over to the slow lane.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Born: Geneva 1942 Educated: Ecole Nationale d'Administration, Paris Academic qualifications: graduated in law; Diploma from l'Institut d'Etudes Politiques Career: 1970: Inspecteur des Finances 1981: chief of staff to Laurent Fabius 1982: Professor at l'Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris 1992: Renault's chief executive officer, chairman of the board  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The Japan Iron and Steel  Federation [JISF] said the exports, on a shipment basis, also  posted the third consecutive year-on-year rise.    It attributed the sharp export growth to increased exports  early in the year to China, whose economy is sharply expanding.    The dollar value of the exports rose 9.3 percent, but the  yen  value dropped 4.1 percent, due to the yen's appreciation against  the dollar, the federation said.    The unit price of all exports dropped to 73,400 yen per ton,  down 21,400 yen from the previous year. It was the lowest  average unit price in six years.    Despite an increase in export volume, export earnings showed  little growth, industry officials said, predicting exports in  1994 will level off from 1993 both in volume and value.    The federation also reported exports to China increased  2.9-fold to 6,910,000 tons.    Shipments to Taiwan rose 19.0 percent to 2,910,000 tons and  those to South Korea increased 1.5 percent to 1,670,000 tons.  But exports to the United States plunged 30.6 percent to  1,820,000 tons.    Steel imports in 1993 increased 3.6 percent to 9,185,000  tons, the federation said.</p>

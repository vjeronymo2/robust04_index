			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities continue to hit new peaks UK SHARE prices resumed their upward path yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 Index bursting through into new territory and reaching fresh intraday and closing peaks. The latest upsurge was fuelled by encouraging economic news, plus another general advance by European bourses after Germany eased its money rate lower in the wake of satisfactory money supply data. Adding to a very confident mood around the equity market was the exceptionally strong performance of gilt-edged stocks after news that there will be no gilts auction in November, which some market strategists said would release something like Pounds 3bn worth of institutional cash otherwise earmarked for gilts. Dealers said the market had been gripped by the improved chances of a series of European interest rate cuts, possibly starting today when the Bundesbank council meets to consider monetary policy in the wake of the money supply figures for September. The trading session in London was featured by a sharp increase in the number of trading programmes and basket trades being executed by the big securities houses. A large programme trade carried out by one of the big UK houses was said to have been behind Tuesday's fall in UK share prices, but yesterday saw a flurry of buy programmes, and a significant amount of basket trading, where dealers arbitrage between the Footsie future and cash market. Share prices began the day on a cautious note, with dealers marking the leaders lower after the largely uninspiring performance of Wall Street overnight and concern over the day's economic news. But buyers quickly moved into the marketplace, gaining the upper hand and driving shares higher. They first made their presence felt in the futures market and the effects quickly filtered through into the cash market, where the FT-SE 100 saw an initial loss of around five points transformed into a 20-point plus rise in mid-morning, after the September retail sales and money supply news had been digested. A dull start by Wall Street caused few problems for London and the FT-SE 100, having reached an intraday high of 3,156.9, settled a net 26.7 stronger at 3,156.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 closed 20.3 up at 3,507.1. Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session, eventually reaching 744.1m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for around 62 per cent of that total. The value of customer business transacted in London on Tuesday was a hefty Pounds 1.7bn, well ahead of usual levels and an indicator that the big institutions had continued as aggressive purchasers of UK stocks. The widely held view among many senior traders in London is that the Footsie could still have considerable upside, possibly to 3,250, in the short term. 'You cannot ignore the weight of money, but perhaps now might be the time to start to lock in profits,' said one of the leading marketmakers at a UK house. Another was concerned that some of the 'short-term US money' may move on to other European markets. But all agreed that the big UK institutions saw no reason to pick the top of the market. Mr Nick Knight, strategist at Nomura and one of the market's biggest bulls, reaffirmed his message yesterday: '3,500 here we come.'</p>

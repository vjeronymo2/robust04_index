Ochirbat to India the president has granted an  interview to the newspaper "HINDUSTAN TIMES".    Answering the question of the newspaper correspondent, what  he expects from the visit to India, the head of the Mongolian  state notes that Mongolia and India were maintaining friendly  relations from the ancient times. These traditional relations,  according to the outstanding son of India J. Nehru, have more  than 1500 years history. Then the President P. Ochirbat  expresses satisfaction with the present successful development  of friendly relations and cooperation in all spheres, including  political, pointing out to an important role of the dialogue of  leaders of the two countries of the last years in the cause of  strengthening confidence, mutual understanding, cooperation  between Mongolia and India.    I am confident, announces P. Ochirbat, my present visit will  become an important event in the history of mutual relations of  the two countries and will open a new page. During the visit  the signing of a number of documents, including an agreement on  friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries, an  agreement on foundation of an intergovernment commission on  cooperation, an agreement on refusal of double customs duties  and income taxes, and an agreement on prevention of evasion of  payment of taxes, is expected, says the president.    Answering the question of the newspaper about the state of  trade cooperation between Mongolia and India, P. Ochirbat  announces that in relations of long centuries between the two  countries the trade relations prevailed. The first trade  agreement between Mongolia and India was signed in 1968.    The volume of Mongolian export to India constituted in 1992  3.8 thousand US dollars, in 1993 1268.3 thousand US dollars.  The volume of Indian export to Mongolia constituted in 1992  1268.3 thousand US dollars, in 1993 1759.3 thousand US dollars.  In this connection P. Ochirbat also points out to the changes  in structure of commodity circulation in the last years, its  shifting from the state limits to the private sphere, which  creates favourable preconditions for its expansion, opens wide  perspectives.    Answering the question about the existing difficulties in  expansion of trade relations and the ways of overcoming them,  the Mongolian president names such objective reasons as Mongolia  does not have an outlet to sea, absence of direct land transport  communication between the two countries. In P. Ochirbat's view,  for overcoming these difficulties it is necessary, first of all,  to create conditions for development of air communication, use  the privileges granted to the countries, which do not have an  outlet to sea. Secondly, also the transport agreements signed  between Mongolia and her two neighbours are of great importance  in this cause.    Answering the question about the unsolved issues of  development, which Mongolia is facing now, and the role, which  India can play in solution of them, the head of the state  stresses that the country has encountered with many problems on  the way of transition to market economy.    Among them providing with the dwelling, rendering support to  the aged persons and children, providing them with social  protection offer considerable difficulties. I think that the  Indian Government can render a concrete support in this cause  within the framework of realization of concrete projects, says  the Mongolian president.</p>

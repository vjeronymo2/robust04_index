			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust warns on profits for quarter Bankers Trust yesterday became the third big New York-based bank in a week to issue a profits warning, underlining the damage to the revenues of some banks caused by the weakness in financial markets. The bank, which relies more heavily than many competitors on income from trading in financial markets, said earnings in the final three months of this year were likely to be below the Dollars 169m after-tax profits of the third quarter. It blamed the fall on 'persistently difficult market conditions and a resulting decline in client activity'. At the same time, the bank said it was raising its quarterly dividend to Dollars 1 a share from 90 cents, reflecting long-term growth prospects. In this, Bankers Trust mirrored J. P. Morgan, which also raised its dividend last week while warning that profits in the final period would not match the previous three months. Meanwhile, Bankers Trust has agreed to cancel two foreign currency derivative contracts sold to a customer in the US. The customer, Federal Paper, said it was planning to take a Dollars 12m pre-tax gain in the current quarter following the cancellation of the two contracts.</p>

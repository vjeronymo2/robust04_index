			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Leading Article: The test before John Smith MR JOHN SMITH's address to the Labour party in Brighton yesterday was well-balanced, competently delivered, nicely judged to suit the occasion - and totally unexciting. This is only partly explained by the Labour leader's naturally conservative manner. Mr Smith's difficulty is that he was attempting to maintain party unity while at the same time reshaping Labour to make it electable once again. 'I shouldn't be too hard on John Major,' the Labour leader said. 'He is beginning to understand what his party's made of.' Mr Smith might have been addressing a mirror: he, too, has discovered that modern parties can be awkward beasts to control. Labour's long-standing divisions - today between traditionalists and modernisers, yesterday between followers of Mr Tony Benn and Mr Denis Healey, earlier still between Gaitskellites and Bevanites - are notoriously difficult to reconcile. In his speech Mr Smith sought to square the circle. He projected himself as a man of stature, demonstrated that he can knock the Conservatives about as well as anyone, and appealed to his party's moral sensibilities. A picture was painted of Labour saving the country from ruin. To make assurance doubly sure, he sought to appease the appetites of the trade unions that threaten his plans for internal party reform. Familiar list The man of stature addressed the problems of the world, referring to the Labour party's 'proud history of international action'. The hammer of the Tories, reminiscent of his best House of Commons performances, drew attention to 'casino economics', homelessness, crime, Mr Major's misfortunes and the rest of a familiar list, ending with a workmanlike peroration on the anger of the British people at the 'chronic failure of this discredited government'. The moral tone, the outrage at inequalities and unfairness in British society, came from the heart of Mr Smith the Scottish Presbyterian. True to his personal values, he can sing no other song. The Labour leader also undertook to save Britain from decline, to rescue it from unemployment. His promise to attune Labour's policies to the goal of full employment was first given widespread publicity at the recent conference of the Trades Union Congress. It has now become the central objective of the opposition's economic programme, just as constitutional reform has been brought to the forefront of its political platform. Minimum wage More immediately to the point, Mr Smith re-iterated proposals on regulation of the labour market that would make the attainment of full employment even more difficult to achieve than it already looks. The pledge to introduce a minimum wage and reconstitute the wages council was renewed. Labour's 'charter of employment rights' covers protection against unfair dismissal, the right to join a trade union and the right to union recognition. Its provisions would apply from the first day of hiring. The new protections would be enjoyed by full-time, part-time and temporary workers alike. In such circumstances, every employer would think twice before adding to the labour force. All of the above are becoming constant Smith themes. They were played yesterday with one overriding purpose in mind: to swing votes at the conference today towards accepting the Labour leader's proposal that parliamentary candidates be elected by party members and not by a combination of Labour and trade union franchises. This should be a minor matter. 'One member one vote', or 'omov', would leave unions in a strong position in constituency general management committees, in party leadership contests and in the party conference itself. It would not amount to the degree of separation necessary if the Labour party is to be genuinely independent of the unions. That said, 'omov' has become a touchstone: if it passes, Mr Smith will regard himself, and be regarded by many, as having demonstrated that elected politicians, not a handful of union leaders, control his party. If it falls, either entirely or into a sea of procedural fudge, Mr Smith will be seen to have lost authority and the modernisation of the Labour party will have come to a grinding halt. Not all news these days is bad news for the Conservatives.</p>

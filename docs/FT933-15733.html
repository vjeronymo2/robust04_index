			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Portugal ready to woo investors from abroad - The country's plans to catch up with its EC partners in the competition for loans PORTUGAL'S move to issue longer-dated government bonds marks its desire to encourage more overseas investors. It comes as recession is beginning to bite and economists expect the budget deficit to rise. The country can now plan debt and compete for loans on an equal footing with its EC partners. With the issue last week of its first 10-year bond, Portugal now has a fully-fledged debt market with maturities ranging from two years to 10 and is expected to have a bond futures market by next year. It is a rapid development for an economy that, just over six months ago, barely had a workable government bond market. What little it had was at the short-dated end and was so illiquid that it tempted very few overseas investors. The republic mostly refinanced its debt via three-month Treasury bills, leaving itself at the mercy of volatile interest rates. Historically, it has not been a problem as the country has managed to maintain a low budget deficit. The present debt of Es1,120bn is 65 per cent of GDP, which is above the Maastricht ceiling but compares favourably with Italy's 107 per cent and Belgium's 130 per cent. However, Portugal is now slipping into recession and beginning to drift further into the red. Last week, the Treasury issued Es10bn of 11.5 per cent stock dated July 2003. The issue was very aggressively bid with Es82.7bn of offers and an accepted yield of 10.67 per cent against expectations of 11 per cent. It was the first auction in an Es40bn borrowing programme. The issue follows that in April of new seven-year paper with a coupon of 11.875 per cent and marks the end of a yield curve which, because of the lack of buying at the long end, has stood out among its European counterparts as completely inverted. The appreciation of the extent of the divergence prompted a rush of buying last week with one London securities house taking up large blocks of two and three-year paper and investors taking profits from Spain to plunge them into Portugal. Securities houses first began to dip their toes into the market last year after interest rates began falling in response to lower inflation (since the last devaluation on May 13, short-term interest rates have fallen by 6.75 points to 10.25 per cent), the escudo's entry in April last year to the European exchange rate mechanism and the complete liberalisation of capital movements. However, there are still very few securities houses which are heavily involved in the Portuguese bond market partly because of the illiquid nature of the market and also because of the tax problems. On the tax front, domestic fixed rate bonds - the Obrigacioes Do Tesouro or Ots - are not traded through the leading European settlement houses and have to be held by a Portuguese depository. Withholding tax of 20 per cent is payable and although dual taxation treaties bring the rate down to 10 per cent for a number of countries it can take months to get the rebate. Nevertheless, Mr Andrew Roberts, bond analyst at UBS, says there is a possibility that the withholding tax might be scrapped. That possibility and the trend of increasingly lower interest rates is generating interest. And Mr Steve Major, a Portuguese bond specialist with Credit Lyonnais, which is a primary dealer with a big operation in Lisbon, says: 'Portugal has lagged Spain because of lingering currency concerns but the big picture story of a weakening D-Mark reduces the cross currency risk of holding high yield bonds.'</p>

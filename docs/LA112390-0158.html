			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BROWN SETS SEX ATTACK SEMINARS  </P> <P> Student outcry over sexual assaults on women and anonymously posted lists of  alleged male rapists on bathroom walls has prompted Brown University to require  special orientation seminars starting next fall for freshmen, an official said  today.  </P> <P> The Ivy League university will also see to it that every student who comes  forward with an assault or harassment complaint is provided with a trained  advocate who will follow the case through, said Robert Reichley, executive vice  president. The steps are being taken in the wake of a stormy forum on campus  last week in which members of the audience -- most of them women -- criticized  university officials for being insensitive and indifferent to the issues of  sexual assault and harassment.  </P></p>

He emphasized that since  the radical change in Ukraine's political tack in respect of  nuclear weapons and the Black Sea Fleet at the meeting between  the Ukrainian and Russian presidents in Massandra on 3  September, "less attention has been paid" to Ukraine at the  United Nations. Viktor Batyuk characterized mutual relations  with Russia as "a pendulum situation" and stressed that the  Russian mass media "are defaming Ukraine."    The Ukraine representative said that members of the  Ukrainian  delegation made over 50 speeches in the course of the session,  Ukraine co-sponsored 39 resolutions and was re-elected for three  years as a member of the Committee for Program and Coordination.  In Viktor Batyuk's words, Ukraine spoke against allowing any  country's claim to be granted peace-making powers in any given  region and demanded that peace-making actions should be carried  out in accordance with the CSCE Charter and the major UN  documents.    Viktor Batyuk confirmed that he has been appointed Ukraine's  ambassador to Canada and that he will leave for Ottawa at the  end of this week.</p>

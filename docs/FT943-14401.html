			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Generators forecast to need 15.5 per cent more uranium by 2000 New uranium mines will be needed at the turn of the century to cope with a forecast 15.5 per cent world-wide increase in requirements by nuclear power stations, according to the Uranium Institute, an international association of producers and consumers. Most of the new capacity will be in Canada, the US and Australia, it points out in what the institute claims is 'the most comprehensive global analysis of the uranium market published so far'. The report notes that the World Energy Council predicts global energy demand will be 50 per cent higher in 2010 than in 1990 and then looks at projected nuclear generating capacity on a country-by-country basis. It concludes that requirements will rise from 56,076 tonnes in 1993 to 64,786 tonnes in 2010. Some of the extra uranium will be supplied from existing mines which have been operating at well below capacity for some years. There is also the very real prospect that uranium derived from former military material will begin to be released into the market at some point in the next decade - 'a real manifestation of the peace dividend', was the way Mr Ian Duncan, the institute's chairman, described it. Depending on the restrictions placed by governments on this material, it could add between 5 per cent and 15 per cent to world supplies from all sources within 10 years. The report points out that uranium production in the western world has fallen sharply in recent years and in 1992 covered only half of western demand. The gap was filled by uranium from stocks, from reprocessing products and from imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eastern Europe and China. As existing western stocks begin to run out towards the end of the 1990s, and if the market share of the CIS and East European countries continues to be limited by economic factors and by trade restrictions imposed by the US and the European Union, production of uranium from western mines will need to increase, the report suggests. However, Mr Duncan said the fundamental issue raised by the report was 'how is the world to meet the burgeoning demand for electricity and what part is nuclear power to play in this?' The report says that in 1991-92 nuclear power supplied about 7 per cent of the world's primary energy and 17 per cent of its electricity. Since 1971 nuclear power has been the only primary fuel to increase its share of total electricity production. 'Nevertheless, nuclear power's future role and growth faces considerable uncertainty in spite of its competitiveness and demonstrated environmental benefits.'

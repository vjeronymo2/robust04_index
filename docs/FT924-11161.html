			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Caught in a game of snakes and ladders - Sterling's devaluation has reinjected an element of uncertainty into farm economics THE GOOD news for British farmers is that since the devaluation of sterling last month guaranteed prices for some European Community-supported farm commodities have risen. The bad news is that many of the production costs of those same commodities have also gone up as a direct result of the devaluation. Sadly the snakes that will add to costs are rather longer and larger than the modest ladders which have increased prices. While sterling was in the exchange rate mechanism and its value was locked within a narrow band, EC price guarantees for the UK farmers were relatively stable. Notorious 'monetary compensatory amounts' - payments to compensate for differences in value between real pounds and so-called green pounds in cross-border, intra-community trade - had almost disappeared. However, since the pound was suspended from the ERM it has fallen against the D-Mark by well over 20 per cent and against most other European currencies by almost as much. Farm prices are calculated in European currency units (Ecus) and MCAs were introduced to inhibit opportunistic exports from one member state to another in order to cash in on currency fluctuations and to reflect differences in production costs. But the actual levels of MCAs, set on a weekly basis, are subject to political decision as well as currency value. As sterling has fallen, MCAs have lagged behind the face value of sterling decline. A further complication - for instance with cereals, the key commodity - is that the intervention system, under which surplus stock is bought and stored until it is needed, domestically or for export, does not begin these days until November 1. So, although the official 'green pound gap' for cereals has risen from almost nothing to 11.7 per cent since sterling was suspended from the ERM the spot price for October delivery feed wheat, for instance, has gone up by only Pounds 8 to Pounds 116 a tonne, with prices for the supported November position Pounds 7 to Pounds 8 higher. This is a welcome and unexpected bonus for farmers with the appropriate commodities to sell, because the benefits have not been restricted to cereals. Sugar beet, for instance, which is being harvested now, will be worth a few pounds a tonne more than anticipated. Finished lamb prices, which normally decline in the autumn, rose for a week or two - although French buyers, who take most UK lamb exports, soon got together to force the price down again. But beef cattle - which should, according to the increased face value of the guaranteed price, have made more money - failed to respond. The EC single market, which is scheduled to come into operation at the beginning of 1993, is supposed to abolish MCAs altogether. It was originally expected that all community currencies would, by then, be stable within the ERM and that there would be no further need for measures to equalise farm prices. But with sterling still floating, mainly downwards, some traders say that in order to provide UK farmers with guarantees of equal value to those across the channel, the intervention price of feed wheat, for example, might have to be raised as high as Pounds 140 per tonne. It is almost inconceivable that this will be allowed to happen. Quite apart from giving a confusing and entirely inappropriate signal to UK grain growers (who are still smarting over the introduction of acreage set-aside to cut production by 15 per cent), such a price rise would add unacceptably to the costs of producing livestock, which consume much of the grain. In all the chaos of recent weeks, however, nobody really knows what will happen. All that is clear is that while sterling remains outside the ERM pricing farm products will be a game of chance. Moreover, specialist livestock farmers who buy grain but do not produce it are already having to pay substantially more for animal feed. Standard rations for pigs, for instance, went up by about Pounds 5 a tonne immediately after devaluation, not only because of the effect on home-grown grain but also because most of the protein in the form of soyabean meal and fishmeal has to be imported. Further substantial monthly increases are expected while the present uncertainty lasts. The UK imports many other requisites for the production of crops and livestock. Many crop protection chemicals and animal health products are supplied from continental countries as well as the US and the costs of these will inevitably rise in line with sterling's devaluation. In most cases this will amount to considerably more than will be compensated by MCAs and the EC's system of green money. As already explained these are in any case scheduled to disappear in two months. Farm machinery will be similarly affected. The UK's machinery manufacturing capability has been allowed to run down in recent years and the country now imports about 60 per cent of the tractors and 70 per cent of the farm implements it needs. Again, many of these come from Germany, with some from France, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands, among others. Very soon the effects of sterling's devaluation will be seen in the prices of such machines. In the meantime, a small window of opportunity has appeared for the relatively few farmers fortunate enough to be selling products such as grain at prices higher than budgeted Some farm machinery importers refused to trust the long-term value of sterling and purchased foreign currencies forward before that fateful bungy-jumping performance in September. Now they are passing on that currency advantage to those farmers with money to spend. It may seem strange to outsiders but such is the competition in the over-supplied farm machinery business and so thin have been sales in the last few years that importers and dealers feel they have no alternative. Undoubtedly they also hope that by cashing in on the temporary advantage of having 'cheap' money they will help push competitors who did not have the foresight or the cash flow to plan ahead into bankruptcy. But when that forward-purchased money is used up the whole of UK agriculture will face the full effects of the sterling devaluation. Full compensation through any future EC system is a pipe dream. And prospects for the kind of national top-up that farmers in several other EC countries receive, quite legally under the terms of common agricultural policy reform, look bleak against planned treasury cuts. The recession that has affected British farmers for at least the last seven years seems set to continue.</p>

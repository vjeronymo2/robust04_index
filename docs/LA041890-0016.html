			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 FARM WORKERS KILLED, 4 HURT AS VAN HITS EARTHMOVER BLADE  </P> <P> Two Mexican farm workers died and four were injured Tuesday when the van in  which they were riding collided with the sharp blade of an earthmover tractor,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Juan Reyes, 20, was driving the van east on Otay Lakes Road at 5:47 a.m. when  it struck the protruding blade of the tractor, which was aboard a westbound big  rig truck, according to California Highway Patrol officer J. E. Orlette.  </P> <P> Pedro Flores-Caldero, 35, and Margarito Murillo-Salas, 67, were killed by the  impact, which sheared off the van's left side. The van then spun around and was  thrown into the air, landing in a construction site.  </P> <P> The CHP was still investigating Tuesday. Orlette said that, although it was  raining at the time, she did not think poor weather caused the collision.  Orlette was also investigating whether the big rig's wide load was legal. It  was traveling with two pilot trucks, as required.  </P> <P> The men were on their way to work from their homes in Bonita, Orlette said. The  two dead men were from Tijuana, according to the county coroners' office.  </P> <P> Reyes underwent surgery at Mercy Hospital. His condition was unknown. Jesus  Sanchez, 42, was in stable condition; Rafael Gonzalez, 30, was in fair  condition; and Moises Zamora-Arroyo, 36, was in serious condition.  </P> <P> The driver of the big rig, John Theakston, 30, of El Cajon, was not injured.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Senator and former President Jose Sarney by </F> Denise Rothenburg; place and date not given: "Plan for  Governability"; introductory paragraph in boldface as published]    [Text] Brasilia--While several parties are getting  together in an attempt to find a candidate who can defeat Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva in the presidential race, Senator Jose  Sarney (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Amapa) is  working on a plan to ensure the country of governability. He  claims he has no "Lulaphobia" and says he does not approve of  constitutional revision in the way it is now being carried  out.    [Rothenburg] Do you believe that parties such as the PMDB,  the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], and others can form  an alliance capable of defeating the PT [Workers Party] at the  ballot box, considering that all the polls now show Lula as the  favorite?    [Sarney] An alliance cannot be against anyone. We must have  an alliance, true, but not to defeat the PT. An alliance must be  based on a plan for the country, and we are going to work to  that end. I have no Lulaphobia. The PT is now a large  organization and part of the country's institutional structure.  The PT needs to combat its radicals whether it wins or loses,  and Lula is mindful of that. I am not one of those who start  talking disaster when they think of the PT.    [Rothenburg] Does this mean that you might even support Lula  in the second round of balloting?    [Sarney] In politics, we cannot talk about what might happen  in the future. At the moment, our problem is to establish an  alliance that will have a plan for the country. And that  alliance cannot exclude the PFL [Liberal Front Party].    [Rothenburg] Do you believe it will be easy to bring the  PSDB, PFL, and PMDB with all their different factions together  following Governor Ciro Gomes's criticism of certain people in  the PMDB?    [Sarney] The evaluation of alliances will have to be made by  those entrusted with making it. I will not comment on the  statements by Governor Ciro Gomes. What I do know is that we  have already had one experience with the PFL--the Democratic  Alliance--and it resulted in the election of 22 governors and an  absolute majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.    [Rothenburg] But who would be the ideal candidate for that  alliance?    [Sarney] I don't know, but it will have to be someone from  the PMDB, since that is the largest party. It is necessary in an  alliance to take the weight of each party into account. The PMDB  is a center-left party. It was responsible for the democratic  transition, and it has some outstanding people. Anyone from that  party who is a candidate will have my support.    [Rothenburg] Would you exclude your own name from those  negotiations?    [Sarney] I have received several letters from admirers  asking  me not to exclude my own name. I have told all of them that I do  not want to throw my hat in the ring. I have already been  president, and I have no more ambitions.    [Rothenburg] You had dinner on Tuesday with Minister  Fernando  Henrique Cardoso. Was there any promise of support for the plan?    [Sarney] Basically, what we talked about was constitutional  revision. What I see is an absence of guidelines in our work.  There is no coordination regarding the points that need revision.    [Rothenburg] Are you against revision?    [Sarney] No. The problem is that we are concerning ourselves  with peripheral matters and engaging in casuistry.</p>

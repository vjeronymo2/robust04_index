As he said, Ukraine's pledge to remove nuclear weapons from  its soil and Russia's willingness to pay "an appropriate"  compensation will be stipulated at Friday's meeting between the  presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S.A. in Moscow. "The  size of such a compensation is yet to be fixed. Groups of  experts will deal with this," he noted.    When determining the size of compensation the experts will  take into account fuel supplies for Ukrainian nuclear-power  plants from Russia. "Participants in the trilateral Russian-  Ukrainian-American consultations conducted in Washington worked  out a plan, under which the nuclear arms withdrawn from Ukraine  to Russia would be dismantled and their highly concentrated  uranium be deconcentrated to serve as fuel for nuclear-power  plants. This fuel will be partly left in Russia for its own  needs, partly supplied to Ukraine, and partly sold to the  Americans," he said.    According to the diplomat, the question of writing off some  of Ukraine's debts to Russia may arise only if the cost of the  fuel for nuclear-power plants Ukraine will get from Russia  proves to be lower than the value of the enriched uranium from  the nuclear arms to be withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia. "The  possible "difference" is not likely to be great, since the price  of the fuel will include the cost of transporting the nuclear  arms, storing, dismantling and deconcentrating them. These  complicated operations cost a lot of money," he concluded.</p>

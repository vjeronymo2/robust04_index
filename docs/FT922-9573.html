			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sandvik plans expansion in metal-cutting tools SANDVIK, the Swedish engineering group, is hoping to expand its presence in the SKr50bn (Dollars 8.45bn) world metal-cutting tool market over the next five years through acquisitions of specialist companies and internal product development. The Sandvik Coromant division, which had sales last year of SKr4.88bn, is the world's largest producer of cemented-carbide tools, but has a relatively small presence in high-speed steel tools. Each sector accounts for half the total market, and Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, Sandvik Coromant president, predicted this week the company would have 'a bigger chunk' of business in high-speed steel, and in small-hole drilling tools, in five years. The company already produces 12,000-13,000 types of tools, of which around 1,500 are replaced each year. But Mr Hedstrom wants to be able to serve the needs of big manufacturing customers that use both types of cutting tool. Mr Hedstrom said there were a number of small cutting tool companies with a specialised product or market which could come up for sale. But he doubted whether Coromant would acquire Valenite, the big US tool company, because the two companies lacked the necessary product and marketing fit. Valenite's owner, the US telecommunications group GTE, said in September it was considering various options including the sale of its electrical products group, which includes precision materials. Mr Hedstrom also wants to increase the proportion of Coromant's sales which derive from fast-growing automation products such as tool changing systems. These currently account for 10 per cent of sales, but also have a beneficial knock-on effect on sales of consumable cutting tools known as 'inserts'. Coromant's sales fell 7 per cent last year, with Germany the last European market to succumb to the downturn. Mr Hedstrom indicated the German outlook was clouded by the current political and industrial uncertainty, but said the US market for consumable cutting-tools had 'passed the bottom'.</p>

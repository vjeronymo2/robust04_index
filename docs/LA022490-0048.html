By  police count, the battle for control of the Christian enclave between Samir  Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia and the rival army troops of Maj. Gen. Michel  Aoun has killed 688 people and wounded 1,906 since it broke out Jan. 30. Geagea  had declared his war to be over, but Aoun said the existence of two military  forces is not acceptable.  </P></p>

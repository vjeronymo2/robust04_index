			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (14): Focus is on performance - Privatisation exercise reaches end of the line for the moment ALMOST five years after its creation, the Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) is being wound up and replaced by a Bureau for Public Enterprise. The change-over marks the end of the privatisation exercise proper with the focus switching to monitoring the performance of 'strategic ' enterprises which will remain under state ownership. Fifty-five of the 111 enterprises originally earmarked for privatisation have been sold off by the TCPC. To this can be added a further 33 firms comprising 18 privatised before the TCPC was established, four which have been commercialised and 11 in which no further action is required. The committee has decided that eight of the remaining 23 cannot be privatised because they are technically insolvent or have a negative net worth arising from accumulated losses. Another nine are to be privatised before the new government takes over in five months' time, but the committee has decided not to proceed with the sale of the country's six government-owned vehicle assembly plants on the ground that this would be 'disadvantageous' under present conditions. 'We have no intention of selling unprofitable companies to Nigerian shareholders,' says one TCPC official. Three of the plants are operating at very low levels of capacity utilisation, two have cut back to 'skeletal' operations while one is in receivership. When, last year, the committee considered selling the government's 35 per cent stake in Volkswagen Nigeria (VON), the a price was set at 75k a share which capitalised the government stake at only N22.5m. According to Dr Hamza Zayyad, the TCPC Chairman VON's assets are worth more than N400m, and his committee therefore aborted the sale. The 55 parastatals sold off to date brought in some N3.3bn or five times the original investment in them by the federal government, estimated at N650m. The committee is proud, too, of its record in expanding personal share ownership in Nigeria. Privatisation sales created 800,000 new shareholders according to the TCPC though there is a substantial element of double counting here. One of the committee's final acts before being restructured as the BPE was the sale of the government's holdings in 13 banks, and public share issues have been completed for nine of these. Progress has been slower on the commercialisation front, but by the end of last year specific reform packages had been prepared for 30 of the 34 affected enterprises and performance contracts signed with most of them. The steel industry, specifically Delta Steel, described by one diplomat as a 'total disaster' remains to be tackled while performance contracts have still to be signed with the energy sector, including the NNPC. Dr Zayyad says that when the full commercialisation programme is in place annual savings to the government will exceed N5bn, Although no hard numbers are available yet, Dr Zayyad insists that some parastatals notably the telecommunications and electricity enterprises, Nitel and Nepa are operating with 'substantial surpluses'. Nitel recently financed a N3bn investment programme from internally generated funds, demonstrating what can be achieved. Two headache enterprises, Nigeria Airways and the Nigeria Railways Corp, are being 'deconsolidated'. In the case of the national airline, this involves privatising Air Nigeria, the international operator, while Nigeria Airways, which will operate domestic and regional services in West Africa, will continue to be government-owned. The plan is to sell 40 per cent of the equity in the international airline, Air Nigeria, to Nigerian investors while the government retains 20 per cent and hopefully a joint venture partner, with management control, will put up the remaining 40 per cent. TCPC officials say there have been 'promising' talks with two European operators, Swiss Air and Sabena. Industry sources are sceptical, pointing out that few international airlines have any appetite for take-overs at this stage of the business cycle while the airline's international operations are unlikely to be profitable, especially given British Airways' dominance of the all-important Gatwick-Lagos route. The second deconsolidation proposal is even more ambitious, involving breaking the railways down into four separate firms. A working party with technical and financial support from the World Bank has begun to put some flesh on the bones of the proposed restructuring exercise. It is still too early to pass judgment on Nigeria's privatisation programme, but for all the success of getting the government out of many enterprises, including the banks, the fact remains that government investment in parastatals continues to rise. More money has been injected into the sugar, steel and aluminium sectors and no progress has been made in tackling the deep-seated problems of the steel and vehicle assembly industries. Commercialisation is still in its infancy and during its five-year life the TCPC did not get to grips with privatising the hundreds of parastatals owned by the 30 member states of the federation. The next government will have to push the frontiers of privatisation a good deal further than the military were prepared to go.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henk Aben: "Door Left Open for New NATO Members"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- NATO left open the door yesterday for  new members, especially from Central Europe.    Government leaders from the Atlantic alliance signed an  agreement on Partnership for Peace to this effect in Brussels.    President Clinton claimed a second success in Brussels:  Ukraine, Russia and the United States will sign an agreement on  Friday [14 Janurary] on the removal of all nuclear weapons from  Ukraine.    Ukraine inherited the world's third largest arsenal of  nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union: 176  intercontinental ballistic missiles with 1,500 atomic warheads.    The U.S. President showed some sympathy for the NATO  position  that military actions in Bosnia, like air strikes against  Serbian positions around Sarajevo, could no longer be excluded.  "But these warnings must be more than hollow phrases. Those  besieging Sarajevo must understand that we are serious," Clinton  said.    Prime Minister Lubbers spoke in a similar vein. "If it is  necessary, you have to do it. In our view, it is really  necessary. It would also increase the credibility of the  alliance."    It was confirmed at the NATO summit that the approval of UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali was necessary for any military  intervention in Bosnia.  <H3>  Still No Perspective of Concerted Action From NATO Member  States </H3>   Despite growing readiness among the NATO member states to  take a tougher line in Bosnia, concerted action is still a  distant perspective.    There are also no signs that Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  is giving the UN commanders in the former Yugoslavia a free hand  to take actions.    In principle, the NATO member states have been in agreement  for months about committing more soldiers to protect aid convoys  to Sarajevo and the "safe areas" for the civilian population.  Air strikes were also said to be a possibility to protect UN  troops.    But as Foreign Minister Kooijmans indicated, NATO had to be  ready to implement its threats. Back in August, it was declared  that the member states would supply ground troops and air  support. Fifty thousand soldiers were mentioned, half were  supposed to come from the United States.    But so far nothing has happened, because the NATO countries  are divided on how to put decisions into practice. However,  Prime Minister Lubbers rejected the existence of two camps in  NATO. French President Mitterrand is a strong supporter of  intervention, while Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller called  for supporting the Bosnian government and lifting the arms  embargo against the Bosnian Muslims.    The British Prime Minister Major dropped his initial  hesitations about maintaining British troops in Bosnia. "They  will remain this winter. We will take another look in the  spring, depending on the political situation," he said. Canada  has the greatest reservations about a large-scale military  intervention in Bosnia.    Prime Minister Lubbers still believed the presence of  Netherlands troops was very useful, but added "the military  experts must be listened to properly." He openly admitted that  "peace could not be enforced with violence." "For the  Netherlands," Lubbers said. "The most important goal remains  offering people help on the ground, although it is difficult to  decide which means must be used to do so."    In the end, peace could only be reached if the warring  parties decided to lay down their arms, President Clinton once  again emphasized. He clearly showed that the United States did  not see much point in repeating in the final declaration what  NATO has already threatened in the past -- air strikes against  Serbian positions.  <H5>  Safety </H5>   The United States had been ready to carry out these attacks,  but the European partners were against them, because the air  strikes would have affected negatively the safety of UN soldiers  in Bosnia who accompany UN aid convoys.    Now the United States no longer has any inclination to play  a  leading role, although Clinton made another attempt to break  through the impasse. "At stake is not only the safety of the  people of Sarajevo and the possibility of bringing this tragedy  to an end, but also NATO's credibility," he said.    The talks in Bonn between Bosnian President Izetbegovic and  his Croatian counterpart Tudjman seemed to be successful  yesterday: Bosnian Muslims and Croats were said to be ready to  respect a cease-fire in central Bosnia. It is unclear when the  cease-fire is to take effect.</p>

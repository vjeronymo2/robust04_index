It is estimated that the drugs  seized, which required the processing of 40 tons of marijuana to  produce, had a market value exceeding 150 million new pesos.    Information obtained from the PGR's [Office of the Attorney  General of the Republic] assistant attorney's office for local  branches and inspection, headed by Alfonso Cabrera Morales, has  revealed that the French citizen, Herder Falaizer Bober, and the  Mexicans, Ismael Serrano Lopez, Ismael Adame Switeer, and Jose  Dolores Garcia, are at the disposal of the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office. The group had a shipment of 40.7 liters of  hashish in its possession.    The preliminary investigations reveal that those presumed  guilty, who have made confessions regarding the charges brought  against them by the social representative, were arrested in a  domicile on the corner of Lazaro Cardenas and Ninos Heroes  Streets, in the municipality of Cancun's Colonia Puerto Morelos.  The probe has been intensified in that locality.    It is recorded in preliminary investigation No. 50/94 that  the confiscated drugs presumably were to be taken by land and  air to the country's northern border. They were contained in two  plastic kegs, each with a 20-liter capacity, and one bottle.  Experts on the subject are still analyzing the hashish to  determine its degree of purity.    According to the police authorities, headed by the Attorney  General's Office representative in that state, Jose Luis Farrera  Olmedo, the captured traffickers are presumed to be members of a  criminal organization operating on an international scale. They  must have processed at least 40 tons of marijuana to procure the  hashish, which "most assuredly was bound for the neighboring  country to the north for sale and consumption."    Giving further details on the incident, the Attorney  General's Office reported that the police agents assigned to the  case are primarily seeking, in the same town, the clandestine  laboratory in which the marijuana was processed. They are also  attempting to learn where the public poisoners obtained it.    It was learned that the investigation has been extended to  Guerrero and Tabasco States, of which the Frenchman's  accomplices are natives. It is considered quite likely that  these individuals sent the cannabis indica to Quintana Roo, and  that it certainly was processed there. However, there is a rumor  that this processing occurred in Cozumel, where police personnel  also have been detailed.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Arts: The Madras House - Edinburgh International Festival VIRGINIA Woolf wrote that 'In or about December 1910 human nature changed.' She was writing years later in Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown, a lecture/essay where she observes how Edwardian novelists - Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy and others - had failed to show an adequately modern grasp of the real nature of the working class, of women, of the changing social order. In the plays of Harley Granville-Barker, however, those things are both felt and seriously presented. Especially in his poignant, acute comedy The Madras House. 'We've so organised the world's work as to make companionship between men and women a very artificial thing.' This is the most remarkable of the many extraordinary lines of The Madras House, not least for the ease with which it is located amid a vivid discussion. It is spoken by Philip Madras, heir apparent to a leading London couture house. Philip, the protagonist of a play virtually devoid of plot but as rich in episodic detail as a 19th-century novel, is a perpetual observer - as sardonic as Professor Higgins in Pygmalion (whom he anticipates), as wistfully detached as a Dickensian hero and as humanely concerned as Pierre in War and Peace. The play shows Philip in four different contexts: among a middle-class household with six adult but unmarried daughters; in the office of a drapery firm with numerous female employees, in an all-male business meeting (with female mannequins modelling clothes in silence), and at home with his parents and wife. And it shows us four married couples, each so oddly matched and so juxtaposed with the play's several unmarried women that we cannot help but reconsider marriage versus independence from many different angles. Every scene is full of amusement; every scene has its pain at the world's wretched muddle. In this production, which the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith is premiering at the Festival, the lines are slightly reordered so that Philip launches the play with the observation 'What are the two most important things in a man's character? His attitude towards money and his attitude towards women.' Philip keeps those two attitudes brilliantly interconnected, so that the play rises to its climax in his final, long dialogue with his wife Jessica. Like Higgins, he is an intellectual, impervious to female allurements; he treats his wife as a fellow-man - it is his compliment. Granville-Barker was riding a great new wave of drama. You feel Ibsen, Wilde and Shaw throughout The Madras House; they enrich it and add to its excitement. In terms of exposition and pacing, he is not the master-playwright they are; in several ways, his is a novelist's sensibility. But The Madras House, like The Voysey Inheritance, is a real play, and a great one. Its characters, situations, lines and arguments are vivid, and live keenly in your mind after the curtain's fall. Why is it so seldom performed? One problem, its large cast, is here solved in Peter James's production by having the women play multiple roles - to ingenious effect. Between scenes, the production also keeps confronting Philip and his friend Thomas with an ominous array of women in corsets - in the fashionable underpinnings marketed by the Madras House and required by the old order. Yes, a feminist production of a feminist play. Pamela Howard's designs strengthen the drama by being rudimentary. There are flaws: in particular the great all-male third act seems word-imperfect and under-rehearsed, its six contrasting characters not yet interacting spontaneously. Roger Allam's Philip provides an eloquent central thread to the play - ironic, witty, sharp, vehement, wide awake to the dilemmas. But he is a little too completely English - too Higgins, suave, urbane. For Eve Matheson as his polished, intelligent wife, every praise. Helen Ryan, Sam Kelly, Suzanna Hamilton and Frances Cuka are the best of the other players. No brief newspaper review can convey the way this play's detail becomes so enthralling. I had not seen it before; hours after, I am still electrified. No British play of this century has so excited me. The Madras House runs at the Lyceum until August 29. On September 2 it transfers to the Lyric, Hammersmith, where it continues until October 10</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: NOVICE INVESTORS CAN GET FREE HELP  </P> <P> QUESTION: I recently bought shares in two different companies. When I receive  my statements, I'm not fully confident that I understand them. Also, I would  like to become more active in the stock market, but I feel hampered by my lack  of understanding of the market's workings. Are there any publications aimed at  the average reader who wants to understand the stock market? -- A. R.  </P> <P> ANSWER: There are many such publications. For starters, you can ask one or more  of the national stock brokerage firms for their brochures written for new  investors. All you have to do is call a local branch office and request the  pamphlet; typically, there is no charge. However, be prepared for a follow-up  call from a broker looking for your business; nothing in life is completely  free.  </P> <P> The stock exchanges themselves are another good source of information. For  example, the New York Stock Exchange publishes an Investors Information Kit, a  fairly extensive guide for the beginning investor. The price is $10, including  postage and handling. You may obtain one by writing to the exchange at 1  Underhill Blvd., Syosset, N.Y. 11791.  </P> <P> Finally, your local public library should have a shelf full of books on  business and investing. Our experts say the following titles are among the best  for the novice investor: "Understanding Wall Street," by Jeffrey B. Little and  Lucien Rhodes; "How to Read and Understand the Financial News," by Gerald  Warfield, and "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," by Burton Malkiel.  </P> <P> Q: I use my vehicle during the normal course of my job, and I am reimbursed by  my employer at the rate of 20.5 cents per mile. May I depreciate my vehicle,  and if so, how should I do it? -- P. S.  </P> <P> A: Yes, you may depreciate the value of your car. But, be advised: it's not  going to be easy. The formulas are detailed and complicated, and, in the event  of a tax audit, you should be prepared to produce precise records chronicling  where and when you drove your car on business and how much money you spent  maintaining it.  </P> <P> Although there are several automobile expense deduction systems available to  the taxpayer, by far the easiest is the standard mileage rate deduction: 24  cents per business mile for the first 15,000 business miles you drive; 11 cents  thereafter. But if you want to depreciate your vehicle, you must use what the  IRS calls the "actual expense" method.  </P> <P> To employ the actual expense system, you will first need to determine the fair  market value of your vehicle at the time you started using it for business. If  you are just beginning to depreciate your car, the IRS says you must use a  five-year schedule. For the first year, the IRS allows you to depreciate the  vehicle by 20% of its fair market value, if you used it for business for more  than 50% of miles driven. If you used it for business 50% or less, then the  depreciation rate is 10%. In either case, the maximum amount for the first year  is $2,560. (This limit was installed to curb the number of taxpayers claiming  their luxury cars as business vehicles.)  </P> <P> Now, you must determine what percentage of the time you have driven your car  for business, compared to personal use of the vehicle. Multiply your allowed  depreciation by that percentage to arrive at your allowed business  depreciation. Let's say you're entitled to depreciate your car by $2,000 in  1988 and the car was used for business 50% of the time. You're entitled to  $1,000 depreciation. But don't stop here.  </P> <P> Now, you have to total your annual costs of maintaining your vehicle. Include  all expenses: gas, oil, maintenance, insurance, repairs and other operating  expenses. (This is why you must keep careful records.) Multiply the total by  50%, since you use your car only half the time on business. Let's say you had  $5,000 in expenses; the share allocated to your business use would be $2,500.  Including depreciation, the total is now is $3,500.  </P> <P> However, you must now subtract the amount of mileage reimbursement you received  from your employer. Any excess expense is considered a miscellaneous deduction  and is added to the rest of your miscellaneous deductions. (Any excess  reimbursement is considered ordinary income and you must report it.)  </P> <P> But, beware: Miscellaneous expenses are deductible on your income taxes only to  the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income. So, after doing  all these mathematical computations, you may very well discover that you really  don't have anything -- including depreciation -- to deduct at all.  </P> <P> By the way, if your employer lists your mileage reimbursement on your W-2  statement of salary and wages, you are allowed to deduct -- dollar for dollar  -- up to that amount. But any expenses incurred above the reimbursement level  is subject to the 2% limit.  </P> <P> Use IRS Form 2106 to compute your deduction, and read the instructions  carefully. You may also want to read a fuller explanation of the depreciation  and business auto expense deductions in one of the many income tax manuals  available at book stores and your public library.  </P> <P> Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this  column to financial questions of general interest.

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Chinese bring business to new Vietnam: Would-be refugees are now exporters Ten years ago, Vuu Khai Thanh spent his life trying to find a way out of Vietnam for himself and his family. He failed to do so, but now is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country. Mr Thanh, an animated, gold-toothed man in his mid-40s, runs Binh Tien Imex Corporation, which is universally known as BiTi's after the shoes the company manufactures. Binh Tien was set up in 1982 with 30 workers in two small workshops churning out rubber sandals for export to eastern Europe. Now, 11 years later, Binh Tien is worth Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.3m) and produces some 8m pairs of footwear exported all over Asia and to the rest of the world. In the late 1970s, Mr Thanh wanted to leave Vietnam because he is ethnically Chinese and at that time the government was making a serious effort to force all ethnic Chinese people out of business. A few years later, the situation changed and he decided to stay. 'I could have left in 1986 because my brothers and relatives abroad sponsored me and I was ready,' he says. 'But then I changed my mind because I saw better opportunities in Vietnam due to the open policy of the government, so I stayed.' Now, his brothers are coming back. Some have invested in other projects in Vietnam; others are working to set up representative offices for BiTi's in the US as soon as the economic embargo is lifted. Cho Lon, the Chinatown of Ho Chi Minh City, became a ghost town in the late 1970s, as businesses closed and their owners fled, taking whatever they could carry and hide on small boats sailing across the South China Sea to Hong Kong and the countries of Southeast Asia. Until 1975, business in South Vietnam was controlled by the ethnic Chinese traders and business people in the capital, Saigon. Now renamed Ho Chi Minh City, it is again the driving force in the country's economic development and the ethnic Chinese are back in centre stage. Cho Lon, which literally means big market, is now at the very heart of the economic reforms in Vietnam. Chinese-Vietnamese who fled the country in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most of the first wave of 'Vietnamese boat people' who arrived in Hong Kong were ethnic Chinese, are beginning to return to Vietnam in search of investment opportunities. They are well placed to profit from the government's economic reforms, using links with family and friends to explore business prospects. Those who have done best out of the reforms, though, are people like Mr Thanh who never left the country. Another man who profited by staying behind is Lo Ky Nguon. He runs Viet Hoa Construction, which literally means 'Vietnamese-Chinese Construction,' and he has just been instrumental in establishing the Viet-Hoa Bank. Viet Hoa Construction was formed five years ago to build the An Dong Centre, a five-storey market and retail complex with a hotel on top. The project was intended as a token of the ethnic Chinese community's faith in Vietnam's economic reforms and all the investors in the project are ethnic Chinese. The first development was so successful that the group is now building An Dong Two on a site next door. This time, the plans are much less modest. An Dong Two will be a 22-storey block, built of steel and glass, and will, Mr Nguon says, be the most spectacular building in Cho Lon. The company is also developing several other commercial sites, as well as building a series of residential blocks in a joint venture with a Taiwanese construction company. Like his counterpart at BiTi's, Mr Nguon stayed in Vietnam when his relatives and friends were queueing up to leave. After modest beginnings in manufacturing, he too has become a successful entrepreneur in Ho Chi Minh City and is acting as an adviser to overseas Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese who are interested in returning to invest in the country. 'I have met a lot of friends who lived here, then went abroad but have now decided to come back and invest here,' Mr Nguon says. 'This is because there is an economic decline in the countries where they are now living. So they want to invest here again, where the economy is growing fast.' Estimates of the wealth that was lost, hidden or smuggled out of the country by ethnic Chinese people in the 1970s vary widely, but there is no doubt it runs into the tens of millions of dollars. Slowly and, in most cases, quietly, a great deal of that money is now being put back to productive use.</p>

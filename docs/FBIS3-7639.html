			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [REUTER/YONHAP from Vienna] </F>   [Text] Kim Kwang-sop, North Korean ambassador to Austria,  said today that North Korea will permit progress in the nuclear  inspection [haek sacharul chinjonsikinun de tongui] only when  the United States holds the third round of talks with it.    In an interview with REUTER, Ambassador Kim insisted that  the  best way to resolve the nuclear issue is to hold high-level  talks between North Korea and the United States.    The third round of U.S.-North Korean talks was supposed to  be  held in Geneva last week but was canceled because North Korea  did not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection  team to conduct an overall inspection of major nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon.</p>

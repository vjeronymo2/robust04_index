			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Spanish minister quits over police search laws MR Jose Luis Corcuera, Spain's long-standing interior minister, yesterday tendered his resignation, prompting the first cabinet crisis for Mr Felipe Gonzalez since he was returned to power at the head of a minority government in general elections last June. Mr Corcuera's aides said he had resigned 'irrevocably' after Spain's Supreme Court, the 12-member Tribunal Constitucional, ruled against powers in new public security legislation drawn up by the Interior Ministry for police to search the homes of suspected drug dealers without a court order. The resignation is politically ill-timed for Mr Gonzalez, who had hoped to delay a cabinet reshuffle until early next year, when he planned to bring in members of minority nationalist parties from the Basque Country and Catalonia to the government. Mr Corcuera had been among those earmarked to leave the government, as he is likely to run for a senior post in the ruling Socialist party at its national congress in March. Neither the Basques nor the Catalans have however shown any inclination so far to join the government and Mr Gonzalez will next week have to find an unexpected substitute for Mr Corcuera, which will make his cabinet look rather like a caretaker administration. Complicating the prime minister's choice were reports yesterday that senior officials in the Interior Ministry, who might have been expected to replace Mr Corcuera, had indicated that they wished to resign along with him. Mr Corcuera, who joined the cabinet in 1988, had served notice during June's election campaign that he would resign if any articles of his department's security legislation were ruled unconstitutional. An electrician by training and a former trade union official, he is the only member of Mr Gonzalez's Socialist government who is not a university graduate, and his tough and bluff stand against both terrorism and drug dealers had earned him widespread respect and affection.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Captivated by the Bard and Burton - Theatre Never mind about the hard words, I was told: there will be plenty of action, a suicide and eight murders. I had been left in the charge of a female cousin who had two tickets for a play which my parents told me they would much rather go to than the comedy they had been invited to that evening. My cousin explained anxiously that it was rather long, that it would not end happily, but that there would be a sword-fight and a ghost. This, and the fact that I had money to buy ice creams for both of us, induced a mood of great solemnity. But it did not prepare me for the magic of that cold autumn evening at the Old Vic theatre 40 years ago. I was just 11 and the young Richard Burton was being acclaimed as the remarkable new Hamlet. The audience was silent as soon as he appeared, slim and powerful and in perfect black, restlessly undermining Claudius's apologia for incest. By the time he strode forward to the footlights, fixing his gaze on the gods for the great soliloquy, we were all entranced. Burton defied every one in the audience to savour every one of his words (as he was to do much more aggressively in Look Back in Anger, and later as Petruchio). To an 11-year old who had never before heard 'To be or not to be . . .', his delivery said simply: 'Listen, I am going to tell you a great mystery, in poetry.' What the words then meant, I have no idea. Looking back through the veils of time, it seems I understood every one. But memory is false: 'Who would fardels bear . . . the proud man's contumely . . . that undiscovered country from whose bourn . . . Nymph, in thy orisons . . .' Many hours with the glossary stand between me and that early innocence. Yet it all made perfect sense, more in a way than many productions I saw after long study of John Dover Wilson's What Happens in Hamlet and a shelf-full of other explanatory works. This is not a trick of memory, for although details decay a profound experience lives on. It was an experience which not many people have these days, because, leaving aside Burton's fiercely intelligent cadence, hardly anyone goes to Hamlet now without first studying the text at school. So they miss the raw power which Shakespeare exercised over the groundlings - the uneducated riff-raff who stood in the open courtyard before the stage. They were no doubt quicker than a 1950s 11-year old to catch the dirty puns ('Get thee to a nunnery' ie brothel; 'Nothing . . . That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs' etc, etc). But those groundlings must have had pretty much the same reaction to the ghost. Some people are a little embarrased by the ghost, but not I, ever since that day. There was no messing about then with interpretations, allegories, anachronisms or (as I once saw) a ghost in a greatcoat standing on a chair. This one was completely real and terrifying: he rose pale and massive straight out of the front stage amid billows of green smoke and eerie music. The apparition explained everything: Hamlet's peculiar behaviour, his despair and his determination all mixed up in wild and witty words, which Burton delivered with supreme authority. And then, the sword fight . . . I must not go on . . . but it was, I believe, superbly executed. Never, since, have I been so sorry to see Hamlet die, nor felt so strongly the grim exaltation of an audience facing up to the triumph of evil over good. A more profound effect, though not realised until much later, was to understand the power of imagination over facts, people and events. Producers who try to 'explain' Shakespeare too often forget that, despite the amazing complexities of his verse, he told a rattling good story which even a child can enjoy; and that children, particularly, are thrilled by sonorous language and tales of moral dilemma.</p>

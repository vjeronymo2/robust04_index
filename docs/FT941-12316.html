			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Observer: No show Willie Five months after moving to London on the Bank of England's insistence following HSBC's takeover of Midland, Sir William Purves is hardly a familiar part of the City scenery. But his determination to maintain a low profile reaches new heights this month. He is not going to turn up to his own bank's results presentation at its headquarters. Sir William has opted to present the results in Hong Kong, leaving the honours in London to John Bond, chief executive. All perfectly proper, given that HSBC has a slightly higher capitalisation on the Hong Kong exchange than in London. But perhaps rather telling about the city in which he feels most comfortable, central bank formalities aside.</p>

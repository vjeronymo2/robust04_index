			<p>BFN     [Text] Blantyre May 21 Sapa -- Fifty-one-year-old  newly-elected Malawian President Bakili Muluzi was given a  standing ovation on Saturday when he announced a general amnesty  for all political prisoners, and commuted to life imprisonment  the death sentences of ordinary prisoners. Mr Muluzi made the  announcement in his first speech to the nation shortly after his  presidential inauguration. The inauguration followed the  country's first multiparty election, which stripped one of  Africa's longest serving autocrats, Dr Kamuzu Banda, of power.    A crowd of 60,000 supporters packed the Kamuzu stadium to  hear Mr Muluzi and to witness the birth of the new Malawi. They  chanted: "Scenes have changed in Malawi."    The amnesty and life imprisonment sentences will take  immediate effect.    Along with these measures President Muluzi also ordered  immediate closure of the country's three notorious political  detention camps. Amid wild applause from the crowd he said these  camps were closely associated with the "shameful" violation of  human rights under the rule of Dr Banda's Malawi Congress Party.    The president also invited all international human rights  organisations to Malawi, saying: "They are free to visit this  country and inspect our prisons as they wish."    Mr Muluzi said the 300 million kwacha State House built by  Dr  Banda in Lilongwe should be turned into a parliamentary chamber.    He said Malawi could not afford the luxury of having state  residences in each of the country's 24 districts. A committee  would be set up to work towards disposing of all the unwanted  state residences.    Mr Muluzi said the day was a special and memorable occasion  which would be cherished forever as the moment that ushered real  change into Malawi. "We have earned our freedom from the  autocratic ruler who oppressed us and pounced on our rights  ruthlessly."    He pledged to uphold the principle of genuine democracy and  to work for the betterment of all the people irrespective of  their tribal, political, or ethnic differences.    It is expected Mr Muluzi, whose party won 84 of the 177  parliamentary seats, will now need to form a coalition  government with the Alliance for Democracy, headed by Mr  Chakufwa Chihana, 55. He has already chosen former civil servant  Justin Malewezi, who was booted out as secretary to the  president and cabinet during Dr Banda's regime, as  vice-president. The choice apparently dashed the expectations of  many Malawians, who hoped this position would go to Mr Chihana  in a bid to bring about national unity.    Results of the general election have clearly shown that  Malawi is a divided nation, desperately in need of someone who  can unite it.</p>

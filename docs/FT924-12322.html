			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK borrowing The original objective behind the government's foreign currency borrowing programme announced in September - the defence of sterling within the ERM - has long since been abandoned. Still, there are compelling reasons for yesterday's DM5.5bn bond issue. The Bundesbank has to be repaid for its intervention before long. Buying that many D-Marks in the market would be risky. Besides, the intervention would then no longer count towards PSBR funding - a promise in which the gilts market has invested a great deal of faith. September's money supply figures tend to confirm market estimates of intervention in the region of Pounds 12bn-Pounds 15bn. Since UK foreign exchange reserves fell by Pounds 4bn in September, the Treasury would thus appear to owe around Pounds 8bn to foreign central banks - the Bundesbank chief among them. Little wonder the Treasury was eager to jump the queue of sovereign borrowers waiting to take advantage of exceptional demand for DM bonds. The UK is paying a fractionally lower interest rate on its five-year issue than in the gilts market. A longer maturity would have resulted in greater relative saving to the government. But it obviously lacks the courage to take a long-term bet on the performance of sterling against the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Observer: Dios mio What's in a name? Plenty, if you are south of the border of the United States of America. Mexico's formal name is the United States of Mexico. It has caused no end of irritation to more independent-minded Mexicans that their overbearing northern neighbour appropriated part of their country's name. Now that economic integration with the once loathed Yankees, via the Nafta trade agreement, is becoming a reality, some leftist politicos are preparing to do something properly to distinguish their homeland. If they get their way, Mexico will soon be known as plain Mexico; the Republic of Mexico; or the Mexican Republic. If that isn't absurd enough, if their move fails they plan to ask the US to change its name.</p>

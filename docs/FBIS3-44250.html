			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] On the line to Maputo, Timothy Ecott asked the UN  special representative, Aldo Ajello, what they were doing about  the accusations of child abuse.    [Begin recording] [Ajello] Well, the first time I received  the news about this allegation was from Save the Children Norway  in December. I asked immediately the forward commander to make  an investigation, and I asked Save the Children Norway to  provide additional information because what they gave us was  very little. They just said that they had news and information  about some UN soldiers sexually abusing children.  Unfortunately, Save the Children Norway was not in position to  give us any additional information. The forward commander has  started an investigation, and I don't think that he has got  very, very serious results. There was subsequently another  allegation, always from Save the Children Norway, and I insisted  once again with the forward commander that he had to make a more  serious and detailed investigation. And once again he came up  with no evidence of this allegation. Finally, we had this third  round now. And now I decided to put in charge of an inquiry  board my deputy, Mr. (Sadre), and he has already built up the  body and he is looking at that very carefully and very seriously.    [Ecott] What do you make of the allegations yourself, Mr.  Ajello?    [Ajello] Well, it is very difficult to say. The juvenile  prostitution in this country is at an incredible level, but I  hope that UN troops are not involved in this. We are ready to  clarify this question, to make a very serious investigation.  And if anybody has been responsible for that, he will be  immediately repatriated.    [Ecott] You say that juvenile prostitution, as you call it,  is at a high level. Does that mean you think it is likely this  sort of thing could have gone on?    [Ajello] No, obviously not. But, unfortunately, it is going  on.    [Ecott] What about the effects of these allegations on the  United Nations' reputation in Mozambique? Are you worried about  that?    [Ajello] If this should be proved, I think that the effect  will not be certainly positive. But I think it would have a  very positive effect if we take immediate measures to stop it  and to punish who has been responsible for that, which I have  all the intentions to do.    [Ecott] The allegations, you say, were fairly vague  originally from Norway, but now there does seem to be evidence  of troops of girls being supplied on one particular occasion at  an official function. Can you comment on that?    [Ajello] Well, this is exactly what my deputy is looking at,  and he is making a very serious investigation. I don't want to  interfere with his work at this stage.    [Ecott] How long do you think that investigation will take?    [Ajello] I think that must be very short, and he has been  instructed to do that very quickly in the most flexible [way] he  can. He is quite a skilled person. I am very confident that he  will be able to provide me with a very convincing report about  that. [end recording]</p>

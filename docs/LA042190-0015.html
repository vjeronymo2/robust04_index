			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSESSING A 'FOR ADULTS ONLY' RATING PROPOSAL FOR MOVIES  </P> <P> Regarding Jack Mathews' April 12 commentary, "Is It Time to Change the Ratings  System for Movies?": Perhaps it is time for an A rating (for adults only); but  after reading his synopsis of the movies he thought needed an A rating, I  couldn't help but wonder why anyone would want to make those film -- or watch  them.  </P> <P> What could be entertaining or enlightening about graphic sex, scatological  violence, child abuse, torture, cannibalism? Do we really need "Tie Me Up, Tie  Me Down," a movie about bondage? Why not a how-to course too?  </P> <P> MADELINE BAKER, Whittier  </P></p>

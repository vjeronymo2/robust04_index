			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The Christian Democrats  (KDH) will answer the invitation of two smaller parties, the  Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Entrepreneurs and  Tradespeople (SPZ) to form an electoral coalition at Wednesday's  meeting of right-wing parties, KDH chairman Jan Carnogursky told  CTK today.    "We do not yet have a special standpoint on this invitation.  We are still maintaining our offer of open candidate sheets,"  Carnogursky said. He confirmed that rather than form an  electoral coalition, the KDH preferred to continue offering  places on its candidate lists to politicians from the smaller  right-wing parties.    The KDH's offer has as yet been accepted only by politicians  known from the days of the Czechoslovak federation, headed by  ex- Minister of the Interior Jan Langos. While the Slovak left  today officially entered into a coalition, the other side of the  political spectrum is still unclear. According to pre-electoral  polls, only the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the  left-wing coalition and the KDH are sure of gaining the five per  cent of votes needed to enter parliament.    In the 1992 elections the Slovak right was not able to  overcome its fragmented nature. The method in which the  right-wing parties will enter the autumn elections has to be  decided before the candidate lists close in July.</p>

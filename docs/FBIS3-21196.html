			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Going Backwards </H5>   ``There are people who are taking research institutes  backwards; we think this is a very awful thing.''    President of Japan Infralogic, first in the world to develop  fuzzy reasoning processors, Masayoshi Tokai looks back to the  time spent working at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in the United States for  almost four years from 1982.    With the thought that ``as said by those researchers, we go  backwards when people break down. Therefore, going backwards is  movement without energy and is no match for gravity'' (Tokai),  this is practiced.    This is an amusing anecdote, but the problem is that  researchers which are also said to be such apparently eccentric  people naturally find receptive soil in the United States  wherein such creative ideas are born.  <H5>  Facing Income Balance </H5>   In addition to the technical power and R&amp;D level of each  country, looking at the technology trade balance which is  becoming an important indicator, the quantity of Japan's 1992  technology exports was &yen;386.5 billion and technology imports  were &yen;910.1 billion (according to the Bank of Japan  international income and outgo statistical monthly report) and  were very much in the red.    The United States has overwhelmingly excessive exports with  technology exports of &yen;2.562 trillion and technology imports  of &yen;631.2 billion.    In 1970, the technology exports of the United States at that  time were already &yen;834.7 billion and, looking just at the  export funds, Japan's current level has not even surpassed the  1970 level of the United States.    When seen by type of industry, the areas of Japanese  construction and steel already have an excess of exports and the  income and outgo ratio for electronics and transportation  machinery is almost balanced. Even in the field of machinery  with an excess of imports, the ``technology trade balance is  still in the red. However in this, there is technology already  exceeding cooperation. This does not end at the relationship of  the contract.'' (Hideo Nishikawa, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,  Technology Department, Technology Control Director). Moreover,  ``Income and outgo are even and either becomes an excess of  exports'' (Takemitsu Hoashi, Komatsu Business Research  Department Director); accordingly, this is movement toward a  fairly balanced state.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-23A>           Movement in Japan's Balance of Technology Trade </FIG>       Tokai makes the analysis that ``technology has three  aspects:  ideas, making products (realization), and production. One alone  is useless. At this point in time, the ideas are mostly from the  United States, but Japan is already succeeding with the  remaining two.''    If the three required elements of technology are ideas,  making products, and production, technical innovation does not  happen without creativity for each. The pursuit of creativity  for insufficient ideas is natural for Japan in the future, and  the degeneration of the two elements for which we already have  creative power must be avoided.    (New Technology Establishment News Group) Next published on  28 September  <H5>  Scenario </H5>   In the year 20XX, Japan's technology balance of trade will  have an excess of exports for the first time. This is twenty  years after the economic sector such as the Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren) founded four ``applied basic  technology research institutes'' in separate production areas  with joint contributions to plan for the strengthening of basic  research fields. The basic technologies for biology, new metals,  and environmental preservation developed here being successively  industrialized and production patent registration increasing  drastically in each enterprise was analyzed by the Agency of  Industrial Science and Technology as a major reason.    Up to the 1990's, Japan's technology trade had an  overwhelming excess of imports and the United States and Europe  criticized Japan as a free rider. Those voices are no longer  heard.    It is widely known that the medicines and biotechnology  developed in the respective ``applied basic technology research  institutes'' are regenerating the U.S. industry and contributing  to U.S. development. Additionally, the workers and researchers  in these research institutes also include many foreigners,  especially persons from the United States and the people of the  world have come to be aware that this is one international  organization rather than a Japanese institution.    In the year following Japan's balance of technology trade  becoming an excess of exports, in the General Assembly of the  United Nations, Japan which is a permanent member of the  Security Council proposed the foundation of such research  organizations in developing nations and this was unanimously  passed.    This was an attempt to predict the future of R&amp;D areas.</p>

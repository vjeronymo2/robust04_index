			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS: THE NEXT DECADE;  </P> <P> MACHINES;  </P> <P> ONE EYE IS REPLACING TWO;  </P> <P> SOME WONDER WHO JOHN MCENROE IS GOING TO YELL AT IF THERE ARE NO OFFICIALS?;  </P> <P> ACCUTRACK HAS PHASED OUT A FOND RELIC OF THE SPORT: STOPWATCHES.  </P> <P> Technology has been applied in sports most often to benefit athletes.  </P> <P> And why not? Machines are increasingly responsible for the gains made in the  last decade by athletes, who now have access to computerized weight-training  devices and wind tunnels in which to ride their bicycles.  </P> <P> But machines also are used to govern and judge sport. Some believe this area  will yield the greatest sports breakthroughs of the next decade.  </P> <P> Here, then, is a brief look at technology as it is applied in some sports, and  projections for the future for others.  </P> <P> Instant Replay, or: Just a Second . . . Hang On . . . Let's See That From  Another Angle  </P> <P> Who would have guessed that one of the most significant innovations in  professional football would entail a gang of men clustering around a television  set, intently watching something they had already seen.  </P> <P> Instant replay has been an experiment in the NFL since it was approved in 1986.  It has survived tenuously on a year-to-year basis since then.  </P> <P> Its institution was born out of the agonizingly close calls, foot-on-the-line  touchdowns and flat-out missed infractions that persuaded league owners to  approve the use of video replays to review controversial or close calls by  officials on the field.  </P> <P> As it is used, a replay official -- the league has 16 -- calls for a play to be  reviewed. Using a television feed, officials review the play and either confirm  or reverse the on-field official's call.  </P> <P> The use of the replay was approved on the strength of two of its strongest  advocates -- Commissioner Pete Rozelle and Dallas Cowboy General Manager Tex  Schramm. Schramm's advocacy was so great that he has been called the godfather  of replay. Rozelle was a staunch supporter, guiding the decision through its  rocky early stages.  </P> <P> Now both men are out of the NFL, and the future of instant replay is in doubt.  Put another way, the NFL may have to look at the situation again.  </P> <P> Replays have proved to be costly and -- most irritating -- time consuming. And  the replay has many times provided controversy of its own.  </P> <P> It appears clear that the use of instant replay for this season was about to go  the way of other well-meant innovations. With Rozelle out, and new Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue lukewarm on the concept, the NFL may choose not to play it  again.  </P> <P> But if the NFL is losing interest in instant replay, at least two other groups  are investigating it. The National Hockey League has decided to experiment with  instant replay during the next exhibition season. If, after the tryout, the  league goes ahead with the plan, instant replays likely will be instituted for  the playoffs of the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> The replay will be used only to determine if the puck crossed the goal line,  often a difficult assessment to make in such a fast-moving sport. Hockey is  plugging along as it always has, with an official stationed in a glass booth  behind the net. The official watches the play and, if he determines a goal has  been scored, activates a red flashing light.  </P> <P> The NHL uses video replays to determine who scored a goal or assisted.  </P> <P> For the NHL experiment, teams will not be able to request replays. That  decision will be made only by the referee. Once requested, the replay will be  made by a supervisor of officials, who will watch the replay on a monitor from  the press box. Already league officials have expressed a concern about the time  it takes to make decisions.  </P> <P> "Our decision-making certainly has to be under five minutes," said General  Manager Bob Pulford of the Chicago Blackhawks "It should be done in three, four  minutes tops. We don't want any major holdups."  </P> <P> College football has flirted with the idea of using replays but has  resisted.Again, time and cost are high considerations. Also, the college game  is fraught with tradition and use of replays may be viewed as a crass  interloper.  </P> <P> The Cyclops, or: Beeeep. Excuse Me, Mr. McEnroe, Your Serve Was Long  </P> <P> Tennis has experimented with mechanical alternatives to linesmen. No one is  100% happy with the electronic line-calling system, which still has bugs. But  some players have longed to see linesmen absent from matches.  </P> <P> One such system is called Accu-Call. First used in competition in January of  1988, the system was developed after 10 years of research and at a cost of $2.5  million.  </P> <P> Accu-Call uses an electronically charged line that determines in and out balls  that land within two feet of the line. Beyond two feet, the umpire makes the  call.  </P> <P> The system uses a ball with electronic circuitry woven into its fabric. The  manufacturer claims lines can be called to within one-thousandth of an inch.  </P> <P> Then there is the British system, Cyclops. Used in all Grand Slam tournaments,  the system uses two rays of light covering a band 20 inches wide. If the ball  breaks the light ray outside the service line, it is ruled out and an  electronic peep is sounded.  </P> <P> Cyclops is used only to call service lines and only in singles. The light beam  can't distinguish between a ball, foot or racket breaking the beam. So, it  can't be used to call all lines.  </P> <P> And, one wonders who John McEnroe is going to yell at if there are no  officials? And who would pay to watch?  </P> <P> Electronic Scoring in Fencing, or: Touch Me There And You've Had It  </P> <P> Fencing may have been the first sport to gear up electrically. Equipment  manufacturers at the turn of the century began to offer battery-operated foils  and sabers for training to alert the novice with a beep when a touch was  scored.  </P> <P> The system was first used in the Olympic Games in 1936, in men's epee. By 1956,  it had been allowed in the men's and women's foil.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly in such a formal, traditional sport, there was an outcry  against these devices.  </P> <P> "There were some people who said, 'That's it! I'll never fence again,' " said  Dan DeChaine, chairman of the U.S. Fencing Assn.'s technical commission and  member of the international federation's commission for electronic scoring,  installations and materials.  </P> <P> DeChaine said there were some protests because the implements were heavy and  unwieldy. Officials prevailed because of problems caused by subjective judging.  </P> <P> "In order to salvage the sport, we went to this," he said. "There was nothing  blatant, but an awful lot of arguing. Politics were a big part of it."  </P> <P> Electronic scoring in fencing is fairly simple. There is a switch on the end of  the weapon, which, if pressed hard enough, registers a touch. The switch is  fixed with a calibrated spring and plugged into a scoring machine that records  touches. Most touches wins.  </P> <P> "The machine has no politics," DeChaine said.  </P> <P> Still, there is a human element. A president of the jury is in charge of the  bout. Like a referee in boxing, he starts and stops the bout and watches for  certain things. For example, if a fencer is attempting to touch an opponent and  misses and hits the floor, the official ensures that no touch is scored even  though one may register electronically.  </P> <P> DeChaine says the system has worked "marvelously well," but there are ways to  beat it.  </P> <P> The sport experimented with a wireless scoring system for a time, but soon  found people in the stands with little black boxes, busily punching in their  own scores. The rules now say that the fencer must be connected to a scoring  box in a completely closed system.  </P> <P> Fencing suffered its darkest moment at the 1976 Olympics when a Soviet  pentathlete was caught with a switch built into the grip of his epee. He needed  only to press his finger on the handle to score a touch.  </P> <P> "It was embarrassing to all of us in the sport," DeChaine said. "We were  outraged that someone, a world champion, would do something like that. I heard  he wound up driving a taxi in Kiev."  </P> <P> Electronic, Computerized Judging In Boxing, or: Switched On Box  </P> <P> Next to gymnastics and diving, what sport has had more judging controversies  than boxing? Some boxing decisions make one wonder if the judges saw the same  bout as everyone else.  </P> <P> The Seoul Olympics featured what was perhaps the most wild and unpredictable  competition in the history of boxing. Some purely political decisions were made  and most observers agreed that boxing -- in an ironic metaphor -- had given  itself a black eye.  </P> <P> Officials in the sport were told that politics had to be taken out of judging.  Thus, for the first time, an electronic scoring system was used in this year's  World Championships.  </P> <P> Judges sat before a computer keyboard and registered each scoring blow when it  happened. Information was transferred to a video screen, showing the scoring  blow and which judge had registered it. For a blow to count, three of five  judges had to register it.  </P> <P> The system is more precise, linking a point directly with the blow, and also  holds judges more accountable.  </P> <P> With a videotaped history of each bout, protests are more easily handled. And  monitors show the judges scoring at the boxing jury's table, so there is  constant review of the scoring status of each bout.  </P> <P> According to Jim Fox, executive director of the U.S. Amateur Boxing Federation,  the system was implemented with some difficulty.  </P> <P> "It is a major issue, getting the coaches and federations to realize that this  is the way they have to go," he said. "The issue is that by moving in these  directions, we may bring rhyme and reason to the sport where the general public  can understand what's going on. Seoul was a major factor in the scoring  machine."  </P> <P> Track and Field, the NBA and everybody else, or: Plug Me In, Coach  </P> <P> Jim Terrill was the meet director for the three years of the International  Track Assn. This professional track circuit was around from 1973 to 1976 and  was responsible for not only some of the most blatantly gaudy gimmicks, but  also technological innovations ahead of their time.  </P> <P> The ITA would do nearly anything in the name of promotion.  </P> <P> With that in mind, Terrill brought in pacing lights, a system of lights  designed for training. The ITA rightly guessed they would made great theater.  </P> <P> A string of large light bulbs, encased in plastic, was placed around the inside  of the track. Time was programmed into the device and lights "ran" at that  pace.  </P> <P> The lights were synchronized with the electronic starting device and would  blink in succession around the track, operating as a kind of "rabbit." The  concept, was either "extremely effective or devastatingly bad," Terrill said.  </P> <P> "It's extremely exciting for the crowd, if the runners are equal to the  lights," he said. "We had some real dog races, then, however. We would set the  lights at a certain pace and the lights would actually lap the athletes. Then I  would be accused of turning off the lights, which, of course, I did."  </P> <P> Even renegade outfits have pride.  </P> <P> It may be that track and field utilizes more equipment than most sports.  Devices start races, record the finish, time and measure.  </P> <P> A machine, the Accutrack, phased out a fond relic of the sport: A pack of men  in dark suits and hats, bunched together, peering at stopwatches.  </P> <P> Now hand timers are used as backups. The starter's gun is wired to the timing  system and automatically starts the race "clock." The order of finish is  determined by a photograph.  </P> <P> Field events are effected, too. Officials no longer rush out after the javelin  lands, pulling a 300-foot tape measure. Now throws and horizontal jumps are  measured by a surveyor's transit or triangulation.  </P> <P> In triangulation, a scorer sights where the implement was released and where it  landed. Using his position as the third leg of a triangle, the scorer, or his  computer, calculates the distance the discus, for example, has traveled.  </P> <P> These systems in no way eliminate the human element -- or cheating, for that  matter. But within their limits they are precise.  </P> <P> One can foresee using a pressure pad embedded in a long jump or triple jump  take-off board to call fouls. Or a beam of light instead of a crossbar in the  high jump or pole vault.  </P> <P> Terrill believes that we could transfer technology from one sport to another.  The NFL could use a photo-finish device to detect whether the football breaks  the plane of the goal line.  </P> <P> Or perhaps offensive players could wear sensors, much like clothes tags in  department stores, that would trigger an alarm once they enter the end zone.  </P> <P> In the NBA, a sensor could be implanted at the three-point line to determine if  a shooter was on the line, behind it or over it. The trick would be to develop  a sensor that would not also record everyone else on the floor who was stepping  on the line at the same time.  </P> <P> Why couldn't baseball use laser technology to project a batter's box and strike  zone?  </P> <P> Dog racing's use of technology has put rabbits on the bread (carrot?) line.  Live rabbits once lured greyhounds around the track, but now there is a  mechanical rabbit, or lure, that emits an electronic noise. This can best be  described as a squeak.  </P> <P> Normally this system works quite well. But human control can breed human error.  There have been cases of dogs overtaking the lure and attacking the squeaking  metal rabbit. When this happens it is called a mechanical failure and all money  is refunded.  </P> <P> Auto racing has been on the replay bandwagon. In the 1981 Indianapolis 500,  video replays showed that Bobby Unser passed slower cars during a caution  period. Officials penalized Unser a lap, making Mario Andretti the winner. The  call was later reversed, but the replay can of worms had been opened. Replays  are still used in auto racing to review protests.  </P> <P> Yachting is talking about starting races with a video camera positioned at the  starting line with an imaginary line drawn through the screen and real time  projected on image as a way of measuring who may have false-started and when.  Since most sailboat races start with one or two boats over the line, this may  catch many cheaters.  </P> <P> But don't forget to factor in human nature. For every technological  breakthrough that may make sports and games more nearly fair, there is sure to  be someone with a device designed to thwart it.  </P> <P> Said Andy Kostanecki, chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee's panel on Sports  Equipment and Technology, "One thing you can always say is the technology is  always ahead of the politics. Then politics catches up."  </P></p>

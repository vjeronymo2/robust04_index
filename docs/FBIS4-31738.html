He was welcomed at the Bratislava Milan Rastislav  Stefanik Airport by the Slovak Army's Emil Vestenicky. Our  collegue Peter Toman reports on General Wilmink's agenda today.    [Toman] General Wilmink was welcomed by the Slovak Army's  Lieutenant General Julius Humaj in Trencin this afternoon. He  briefed the NATO representatives about the tasks being currently  fulfilled by the Slovak Army and also on the transformation in  the Army and its command to structures comparable to those of  the NATO armies. In the course of their talks, both  representatives agreed that the conditions stipulated in the  Partnership for Peace program offer a realistic basis for the  incorporation of the Slovak Army into the European security  structures and thereby, into NATO.

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency [HE] Khieu Samphan, head of the Party  of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], sent a message on 25 May to King  Norodom Sihanouk. The gist of this message is as follows:    1. HE Khieu Samphan joyfully expressed his support for a  unified and undivided Cambodia, with its territorial integrity  in line with the frontiers recognized internationally from 1963  to 1969. He also voiced support for Cambodia's national ideals  of peace, (?solidarity), unity, and progress toward rebuilding  (?Cambodia).    2. H.E. Khieu Samphan also stressed the cease-fire issue to  the king. He said the situation in Cambodia is very complicated  because of the 24-year war. The Vietnamese war of aggression  alone has already lasted for 15 years. In addition, foreigners  -- both old and new -- have come to interfere in Cambodia's  internal affairs, both militarily and as civilians.    For this reason, to enable the cease-fire to proceed  genuinely, clearly, and permanently, H.E. Khieu Samphan and the  PDK proposed to the king that foreign observers from five  countries be chosen from among the following 10 countries:  Brunei, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Switzerland,  Austria, Finland, the Philippines, and Egypt. H.E. Khieu  Samphan proposed that these neutral foreign observers join the  Cambodian joint commission in monitoring the cease-fire.    H.E. Khieu Samphan proposed cease-fire monitoring in the  central, western, and eastern parts of Cambodia and on  Cambodia's seas. This will ensure the cease-fire and prevent  foreign troops and arms from entering Cambodia. The cease-fire  may begin any day as long as cease-fire monitoring is thoroughly  arranged.    H.E. Khieu Samphan stressed that a cease-fire would be a  chance at a solution to end the war and achieve national  reconciliation and peace. Therefore, it should be thoroughly  arranged. All of Cambodia's problems should be discussed at the  roundtable meeting without any preconditions. This will enable  all Cambodian parties to discuss and settle all problems -- big  and small -- in line with the goals (?of) genuine national  reconciliation and peace which constitute the profound desire of  our entire Cambodian nation and people.</p>

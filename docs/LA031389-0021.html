			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The producers of "Cheers" have lined up Oscar nominee John Cleese ("A Fish  Called Wanda") for a guest role on their NBC comedy series when he comes into  town to attend the Academy Awards later this month. Cleese will reprise his  role of Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, a school chum of Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey  Grammer) and fellow psychiatrist. In the episode (expected to air in April),  Dr. Finch-Royce, an expert in marriage and family counseling, will be visiting  the United States to promote his book, "Successful Marriage and Fidelity." In  real life, Cleese wrote (with psychiatrist Robin Skynner) a book titled  "Families -- How to Survive Them," that treats the subject seriously -- but  with humor.

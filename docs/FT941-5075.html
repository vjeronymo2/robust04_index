			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: PosGold raises bid for Aztec Mining The bid battle over Aztec Mining, the diversified Australian mining group, was stepped up yesterday when PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, announced it was raising its cash offer to 74 cents a share. This compared with a previous bid of 68 cents a share, and values Aztec at ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m). Aztec, which last week found a white knight in the shape of Pancontinental Mining, said it did not intend to make any statement immediately. The recommended merger with Pancontinental was an all-paper deal and Aztec shareholders were offered a mixture of Pancon shares and options in return for their Aztec stock. When the deal was announced, Pancon traded at about ADollars 1.85, and that deal was said to be worth 76 cents per Aztec share. However, the stock market's weakness last week lowered Pancon's offer to below 70 cents. The revised PosGold offer is now free of certain conditions, meaning that the bidder can acquire Aztec shares in the market, where they were trading yesterday at 68 cents.</p>

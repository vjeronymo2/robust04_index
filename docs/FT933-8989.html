			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Less fizz as Vimto declines to Pounds 3.4m LIKE MANY British cultural icons, the herbal drink Vimto wins greater recognition abroad than at home. However, the effect of poor weather on sales in its home market overcame sustained export demand for JN Nichols' 85-year-old flagship brand, in particular the launch of the brew on the Russian market and its continued popularity in the Middle East. Pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 3.53m to Pounds 3.4m, on turnover of Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 23.6m). Vimto sells in more than 25 countries and has roughly 2 per cent of the UK market. The brand was first concocted in 1908 by John Noel Nichols, a former stockbrokers' clerk. He moved the soft drinks maker from beginnings in Salford, which its advertising describes as 'humble', to the implicitly more glamorous setting of 'an old Manchester laundry' and it has stayed in that city ever since. The company blamed the downturn on the combination of sterling's exit from the ERM, which raised raw material prices, and inclement weather in the UK in May and June which together put pressure on margins. Nevertheless, the interim dividend goes up to 5.4p (5.1p), payable from earnings per share down at 14.4p compared with 14.8p. Mr John Nichols, grandson of the founder and managing director, said: 'There are many factors that will influence the final outcome for the year but the board feels sufficiently confident to raise the interim dividend.' As well as its soft drinks activity, Nichols has canning operations and a vending machine ingredients business. It is in the middle of a Pounds 4m capital spending programme.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of </F> the Staff for Coordinating CIS Military Cooperation, by Igor  Lenskiy; place and date not given: "Colonel General Viktor  Samsonov: `CIS Security Causes Disquiet'"]    [Text] [Lenskiy] Viktor Nikolayevich, while studying your  career I thought that fate could quite easily have destined not  P. Grachev but you to be Russian defense minister 4 October  1993. Would you have carried out the order to storm the House of  the Soviets?    [Samsonov] As an official I would not like to answer your  question. As a Russian officer I would say no.    My service has not taken place in offices and on parquet  floors. (You know how some officers and generals advance  through the central apparatus.) I spent 10 years serving in the  Transcaucasus. I remember how it all started in Sumgait in 1988  before my very eyes. I was involved in the events in Ganja. I  saw our boys at the controls of the tanks confronted with a  dilemma: Should they carry out orders and continue the convoy's  advance? But that meant crushing women and children. (The  People's Front "got busy" dragging kids out of baby buggies and  putting them on the road). The order came that they must reach  their objective right on schedule. Could our Russian lads,  raised in school on Soviet traditions, have crushed women and  children? Of course not. No one calling himself a man could  have tried to force them or have ordered them to do that.    [Lenskiy] Could you please tell us the reason for the CIS  Joint Armed Forces High Command being transformed into the Staff  for Coordinating Military Cooperation? Does this move not  indicate that the CIS heads of state and defense ministers are  losing interest in common security problems?    [Samsonov] The reason for the change is that we regrettably  failed to reach a common view regarding the need to preserve the  unified defense area along with the unified early-warning, air  defense, and space defense systems within the framework of the  Commonwealth of Independent States, nor did we succeed in  creating Joint Armed Forces and a unified command and control  system for the strategic nuclear forces. Although there was,  and still is, an obvious need to do so.    Interest in problems of military security within the CIS has  certainly not faded lately, indeed it has considerably  increased. Late last year the number of CIS states party to the  Treaty on Collective Security rose from six to nine. Now only  three of the 12 CIS states -- Moldova, Ukraine, and Turkmenistan  -- remain outside the treaty. They too have lately been showing  great interest in military cooperation issues.    [Lenskiy] Did you try to stop the disintegration?    [Samsonov] Of course. When it was decided to switch to  national armed forces we wanted to preserve at least the most  important systems in our common interests. Let me cite a simple  example. There was a common air defense system in the Central  Asia region... At one time we suggested setting up the "Yug"  [South] air defense system under joint command, covering the  interests of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The point is that the 12th Army was  deployed on the territory of several republics! You had a  command post was in one republic, a corps in another, a division  in a third, and a regiment in a fourth. Some system that was!  We suggested that it should not be broken up, because borders  cannot be drawn in the air. But to no avail: It was destroyed.  Now we are about to recreate it. But that is a very costly  business. And it will take a very long time.    [Lenskiy] What impact have these actions had on the combat  readiness of the new independent states' armies? Can they  rebuff outside aggression where necessary?    [Samsonov] That is something for these states'  military-political leaderships to worry about, since it was they  who set up the national armed forces. They are answerable to  the people. But the fact that the systems that I mentioned have  been destroyed means that we cannot talks seriously about the  Commonwealth as a whole or its individual members' being totally  secure.    The point is that readiness to rebuff such aggression,  particularly by military means, is forged in peacetime. Common  operational planning of the use of coalition armed forces is  carried out along with advance training and coordination of  national armies for conducting joint combat operations. Command  and control systems are set up as well as the main types of  support and a definite infrastructure.    [Lenskiy] But, to all intents and purposes, that kind of  training is not being carried out today?    [Samsonov] No, it is not. The experience of setting up  Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] in Tajikistan is very  indicative. It took over three months to get together just one  battalion apiece from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. And  Kazakhstan's battalion has still not turned up! I do not know  when we will set up groupings in case of major aggression. That  should be pondered in peacetime.    [Lenskiy] What is hampering you: ambition, general  confusion, objective difficulties?    [Samsonov] All of those. The current situation in the  defense sphere is closely connected with economic and social  decline. There can be no integration on defense questions  against a backdrop of political and economic disintegration.    [Lenskiy] How are the republics fulfilling their commitments  regarding funding your activity?    [Samsonov] To be frank, not a single document is being  properly implemented. As for Russia's contribution, that is  mainly what we are living off. We are even in its debt, since  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Belarus are not fully  meeting their commitments. They are not, of course, refusing to  pay. But they are citing difficulties with the mechanism for  mutual settlements.    [Lenskiy] What conclusions can be drawn from the experience  of the CPF in Tajikistan?    [Samsonov] I take a positive view of these forces' activity.  Thanks to the CPF, conditions have been created for peace talks  and dialogue with the opposition, and their presence acted as a  stabilizing factor at the last parliament session in Tajikistan,  where passions hotted up at one moment. The Tajik leadership  should take advantage of the favorable conditions to conduct  dialogue with the opposition. There is not that much time.  According to our data, the Tajik armed opposition is preparing  for decisive action in the spring.    [Lenskiy] Last July we were all shocked at the number of  casualties sustained by the 12th Russian Border Outpost in  stopping infiltration of the Tajik-Afghan border. Government  and parliamentary commissions traveled to the scene of the  incident, nonetheless the public never learned who was  responsible -- the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Security,  or the border troops. Or perhaps it was just a tragic  coincidence?    [Samsonov] I believe that the border troops leadership bears  the bulk of the responsibility. Nonetheless it cannot be held  entirely responsible. The border troops are greatly in need of  hardware and arms, but most particularly of personnel. Many  outposts, including the 12th Border Outpost, are by no means  fully manned. I flew out there with a group of officers, we  conducted an investigation and redeployed Defense Ministry  battalions, but that is patently inadequate.... The attack on  the 12th Outpost did not come as a surprise. Audacious,  impudent attacks have been going on a long time. The proper  response has not been forthcoming, the situation was not  analyzed carefully, and steps were not taken. And any aggression  has only expanded as it has not been rebuffed. That is the  unfortunate lesson.    [Lenskiy] Are we insured against another tragedy?    [Samsonov] I am not certain right now. Attempts have been  made, and outposts are bombarded with rocket shells and heavy  machineguns several times a week. Enemy weapon positions are  immediately suppressed by helicopter attack, artillery and  mortar fire. However, our combat readiness and reactions  continue to be tested and probed.    [Lenskiy] Following the breakup of the USSR the length of  Russia's borders to be guarded (compared with the Union) dropped  by a factor of 1.5. Why have the liberated hardware and arms  not been operationally redeployed to the most dangerous part of  the border, Tajikistan?    [Samsonov] Nothing has been liberated! It has all been  "privatized" by the new independent states. In a not entirely  civilized manner, to put it mildly. The principle employed was  that everything on my republic's territory is "mine"! There was  no discussion as to whether it was needed or not, whether there  was an adequate supply or a surplus over requirements, and it  was impossible to reach agreement. In the Transcaucasus, for  instance, special technical equipment from the security strips  was barbarically destroyed. The argument was as follows: Why  have the border guards got so much land, when our sheep have  nowhere to graze?    [Lenskiy] The commander of the border troops claims that  13,000 km of border are open today.    [Samsonov] We have not even determined where to have a  border, with whom, and what kind of border it should be. For  instance, Azerbaijan effectively has no border with Iran and no  one knows who is to guard it. Russia too has no border with  Azerbaijan. In the proper meaning of the word.    [Lenskiy] What new opportunities do you see for settling  local conflicts within the CIS (Karabakh, Abkhazia) in  connection with Azerbaijan and Georgia's joining the  Commonwealth?    [Samsonov] I think that the admission of Azerbaijan and  Georgia to the collective security system will create favorable  opportunities for these conflicts to be resolved by political  means. Real conditions have emerged for groups of military  observers and CPF troops to be used to localize and put a stop  to conflict. Everything, or virtually everything, now depends  on the good will of the political leadership in these states.  We would remind you that peacekeeping forces have played their  part in the Dniester Region and South Ossetia.    [Lenskiy] But the conflicting sides must mutually agree in  order for this to occur. At the moment the only signs of that  are in Abkhazia. Karabakh is another matter. Azerbaijan has,  on the contrary, been observed to step up hostilities since the  Ashgabat meeting.    [Samsonov] You were absolutely right to say that there must  first be mutual agreement for a cease-fire. If that is secured,  military observers can "maintain" the situation, prevent it from  breaking away.... A political solution has to be found. At one  time I thought that leaders had already had enough of war --  both peoples have suffered a great deal. But it turns out that  I was mistaken. Someone thinks that the fighting must go on.    [Lenskiy] There are reports that foreign mercenaries are  involved on both sides in the Karabakh war. There are  increasingly frequent references to Afghan mojahedin.    [Samsonov] There is a lot of talk like that. I was told  about this during an emergency meeting with the states'  representatives -- the deputy chiefs of staff. I said: Show me  just one prisoner of war on television who is a citizen of  Afghanistan, Iran, or Pakistan. They are unable to do so!  There is talk, but no facts.    [Lenskiy] On the other hand we have clearly seen Russian  boys who have been fighting on either the Armenian or the  Azerbaijani side and have then been captured. How do you regard  that?    [Samsonov] There are only a handful of these mercenaries.  However, that is the cost of the processes that occur during the  breakup of a great empire. Who thought about the guys who were  left on the territory of a particular republic regardless of  what they wanted? They had one homeland -- the Soviet Union --  and it sent them to serve in Armenia or Azerbaijan. Overnight  (there was no period of transition) these boys found themselves  without a place to serve, without an apartment, without any  certainty.    No one was asked who wanted to swear another oath and who  did  not. No, they just had people shouting at them: All you  Ukrainians and Belarusians, go back home to your own country.  They did so. But there are no jobs. For instance, 100  engineers are needed, but 200 turn up. "But we don't need 200."  Where are they to go? They will no longer be welcomed at their  former post in Russia -- they have been crossed off the unit's  rolls. They are told: Take discharge. These people have ended  up wanted by no one.    We now have servicemen in Central Asia, for instance, who  do not know to whom they belong. They have no status. They are  not being given dual citizenship. Some would like to continue  their service, but they are told: Take local citizenship. "I  don't want to." "No? Get lost." Many problems would be  settled if the parties to the Treaty on Collective Security  signed an agreement on dual citizenship.    [Lenskiy] Won't the Baltic states' involvement in the NATO  "Partnership for Peace" military program threaten the security  of the Commonwealth?    [Samsonov] That is not an easy question. There must be an  in-depth investigation into the real idea behind this program.    At first glance the NATO plan, as it is being presented to  the Western public, does not aim to pose additional dangers to  anyone.    However, the fact that this document emerged shortly after  the North Atlantic alliance's official decision not to expand  the bloc by admitting new members does cause some concern. This  decision was adopted under pressure from the world and European  public, as well as owing to Russia's tough stance. There is  doubt as to whether the new program constitutes a veiled means  of expanding NATO, establishing its strategic influence in East  Europe, and bringing the bloc's front lines right up to Russia's  western borders.    If that is the case, this move could upset the balance of  forces in Europe as enshrined in the CFE Treaty -- which is  unacceptable to us.    [Lenskiy] However, NATO does not cease to assure us of its  peaceableness....    [Samsonov] As if we had been friends for ever and ever. But  then the commander in chief of the NATO southern theater travels  to Greece and Turkey. To what end, do you think?    [Lenskiy] Probably to reduce their military presence.    [Samsonov] If only! He went to strengthen NATO's southern  flank. That is the point. But you were saying about the  Baltic....    [Lenskiy] Do you believe in the future of a single security  system in Europe with NATO and Russia under the same "umbrella"?    [Samsonov] Not right now. Only in the very long term.  Judging by the statements and the arguments it all looks OK in  theory. But not in practice. Our national interests are  confined to Russia's borders or, in the last resort, to the  territories of the CIS republics. But U.S. national interests  are increasingly focusing on Europe, East Europe even, and Asia.  Recent statements indicate that U.S. interests must be present  worldwide! Once again something does not somehow gel here....    [Lenskiy] Will you be making additional efforts to securer  UN or CSCE status for the CIS states' peacekeeping forces? Is  that necessary?    [Samsonov] Tackling these issues is not part of the Staff's  functions. The Collective Security Council or the Council of  Commonwealth Heads of State will probably tackle them. As for  whether it is necessary, I think it is. After all, a UN mandate  does not only relieve a state of possible accusations of  expansionist policy but also considerably reduces the burden of  its material expenditure on a peacekeeping operation, lends it  an international character, and gives its mission UN or CSCE  prestige.    [Lenskiy] How do you regard the prospect of Russian military  bases being set up on the territory of certain other CIS  countries (Baykonur, for instance)?    [Samsonov] If the Commonwealth countries reach a mutual  agreement with Russia on the siting of such military bases, I  take a positive view of this. By and large they are elements in  the Commonwealth's common defense area. This step does nothing  but strengthen CIS stability and security.    [Lenskiy] From time to time reports appear regarding your  Staff's difficult -- to put it mildly -- relations with the  Russian Federation Defense Ministry. What can you say about  that?    [Samsonov] You know, there can never be easy relationships  during a period of reorganization, when major reforms are being  implemented and new approaches and views of those issues are  being formulated.    Time will tell who is right and who is less so.    It is a fact that it has become easier lately to work,  cooperate, and find mutually acceptable compromise solutions.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (9): Further turbulence ahead - Japan / The deadline is approaching for Tokyo to make a long-term decision on the future of telecommunications in Japan The past few years have been a tumultuous time for the more than 210,000 employees of NTT, Japan's huge telecommunications company. Just under a decade since it was privatised, NTT has had to embark on a wide-ranging restructuring effort, fight a fierce battle against newcomers in the profitable long-distance market and venture for the first time in its history outside the domestic telecommunications business into the 'unknown world' of multimedia. But if the past few years of frenetic activity at NTT have unsettled its employees, more accustomed to the bureaucratic ways of the former monopoly, the years ahead promise to be even more turbulent. Next year, the Japanese government is expected to make a long-overdue decision on the future of NTT, which is still over 65 per cent owned by the finance ministry. They are scheduled to conduct a telecoms review which will have implications far beyond NTT's own operations and is likely to change the shape of Japan's telecommunications industry in the years to come. As in many other industrialised countries, the Japanese government faces a pressing need to review the regulatory environment surrounding its telecoms sector and to draw up a vision of what the industry should look like in the 21st century. Although Japan was relatively early in deregulating its telecoms industry with the privatisation of NTT in 1985, the measures it adopted back then were half-baked. Rather than break up the former telecoms monopoly into separate regional or business entities, the Japanese authorities preserved NTT as a dominant operator with national coverage and introduced competition only into the domestic long-distance and cellular markets. NTT was kept in control of the crucial local network. While the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications made it known on reviewing NTT's status in 1990 that it favours breaking up NTT, the decision was deferred for five years. The result of the authorities' decision to allow only partial deregulation of the telecoms sector so far has been that almost ten years after NTT was privatised, the Japanese market suffers from the adverse effects of a lack of competition. The price of telecom services in Japan, from simple phone calls to more value-added services, is still relatively high, particularly for long-distance calls, compared with what is charged in more liberalised markets. The tight regulatory environment and the lack of competition has stunted the development of new services, which are expected to play an important role in stimulating future economic development. The experience in the cellular market has been somewhat different, with a second phase of liberalisation in April this year stimulating greater competition and rapid growth. However, even in the relatively open cellular market penetration is low compared with many countries in the west due to high user charges. Tokyo's telecommunications authorities have indicated recently that they are in favour of further deregulation of the market in preparation for the much more expanded information industry extending from telecoms to computer communications and broadcasting that is expected to emerge within the next decade or so. As the deadline approaches for the Japanese authorities to make a long-term decision on NTT and the future of telecommunications in Japan, and as it has become increasingly evident that the US is leading the way in building an advanced information society, the MPT has appeared increasingly favourable towards changes in the industry, not only to catch up with the US but to ensure the country's future economic and social well-being. Mr Shun Oide, Japan's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, emphasised the importance that telecoms is expected to play in the country's future development in addressing a gathering of international telecoms ministers in Kyoto last month. Japan faces various difficult issues, such as dealing with the unprecedented ageing of its society, rectifying the excessive centralisation upon Tokyo, converting the framework of industry and employment to create products and services with high added value through effective use of knowledge and skill, and realising life-styles for our citizens which bring both comfort and an enhanced spiritual quality of life, Mr Oide says. These issues 'can no longer be solved with the conventional methods of industrialised society,' he notes. 'Instead, we believe that an approach through information networks, allowing the best use of information and expertise, is essential.' Telecommunications, together with other forms of information transmission, and the future multimedia services they will provide, are also expected to become a key source of economic activity. The MPT estimates that with an advanced telecommunications infrastructure in place, the multimedia market will grow to a leading industry with a value of Y123 trillion yen and creating 2.43m new jobs by 2010. Such considerations will form the basis for the authorities' decision next year on the fate of NTT and the future of Japan's telecoms industry. It has become increasingly clear to the authorities that deregulation and greater competition are crucial in preparing the Japanese telecoms industry for future growth. In recent statements, the MPT has indicated that it is looking to the CATV companies to provide further competition to telecom operators. 'It is important to establish the fibre-optic network efficiently through the competition of private companies. The telecommunications carriers and CATV operators are expected to build networks competitively,' a recent MPT report states. However, the need to nurture a strong information industry in many ways complicates matters. If greater competition in the market were the only goal, there would be a strong case for breaking up NTT, a step the telecommunications ministry has long favoured. While competition on some vital intra-city lines has been heated, with three new common carriers taking over 50 per cent of traffic on the important Tokyo-Osaka line, the three long-distance carriers' share of the intra-prefectural market last year was just 29 per cent. NTT has been able to keep a tight grip on the long-distance market through its monopoly on local lines which, in effect, has allowed it to control access charges and gain information on its competitors' costs. 'The minimum pre-requisite for the three new common carriers' entry into the long-distance market was the breaking up of NTT into long-distance and local businesses,' said Mr Kazuo Inamori, president of Kyocera and chairman of DDI, in a recent interview. However, plans to build an advanced information industry have brought other considerations into the picture. While competition is important in stimulating new developments, the huge investment required and wide-ranging business territory to be covered by communications operators calls for large, integrated companies to support the information industry. As Mr Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, argues: 'Telecommunications companies from now on will provide a full range of services from telephone and fax to personal computer communications and cable television. Competition in future will be between large companies and there will be very little room for companies than can only compete in parts of the market.' Rather than breaking up NTT - a move that would create smaller companies which would be less competitive in the global multimedia race  - the authorities should work towards integrating smaller companies into a larger company that can offer a full range of services, Mr Kojima asserts. NTT, which has already converted trunk lines to optic fibre, also believes it is the only company that is capable of building Japan's super highway infrastructure singlehandedly. Breaking the company up, as the MPT envisions, would weaken its ability to do so, the company argues. The growing view among industry watchers is that despite arguments against divestiture, there is a strong chance the MPT will in the end follow its initial instincts and break up NTT at least into separate long-distance and local businesses. The impact of such a move, combined with deregulation of the CATV industry announced this year, is expected to stimulate the development of Japan's telecom and cable industries into the information industry of the future. Increased competition from cable operators provided an incentive for the US Regional Bell Operating Companies to modernise their networks to provide advanced communications capabilities, which in turn, helped them to improve profit margins, notes Mr Dargan at SG Warburg. Greater competition upon divestiture could also encourage the MPT to relax rules which currently restrict NTT from offering cable TV and other services, Mr Dargan points out. When that happens, Japan will move one step closer to the US in building companies that can offer the public a full range of multimedia services.</p>

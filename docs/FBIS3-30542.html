			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Text of speech by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in </F> Brussels on 2 February]    [Text] My visit to the NATO Headquarters is taking place  at a particularly important time. Today, I will sign on behalf  of Poland a framework document pertaining to "Partnership for  Peace." To say that we are shaping the future prospects of our  continent's secure development is not an overstatement. A few  weeks ago we witnessed a NATO summit which took place here, in  Brussels. We awaited that event with no less interest than the  member countries themselves. We have spoken out on many  occasions to present our problems and our concerns, to share  with others our vision of European security and our expectations  with regard to the NATO partners. We have faith that the  decisions reached at the NATO summit create a chance and a hope  for a better future and security in Europe. Security must be  thought of as a process of eliminating divisions and tensions,  and developing cooperation and partnership.    We recognize NATO's special role in contemporary Europe. At  the same time we understand that European security cannot be  regarded as the exclusive responsibility of NATO. Decisions  made by NATO countries will be successful only if they are  appropriately responded to throughout Europe. I want to assure  you that Poland is ready for comprehensive and serious  cooperation.    We were happy to take note of the fact that NATO has  confirmed a relationship which exists between the security of  its member states and the security of Central and East Europe.  In my view, that confirmation not only contributes to a  strengthening of the external security of the countries of the  region, but it also has a role to play in terms of success of  the radical internal reforms being implemented by those very  countries.    Our intentions with regard to NATO are clear and widely  known. Even though the most recent NATO summit in Brussels did  not fulfill all of our expectations, we were happy to take note  of NATO's declaration of openness to development of cooperation  with the partner countries. We were also happy to take note of  the prospect created at the summit of a future widening of NATO  to include new members.    Poland accepted "Partnership for Peace" and intends to  actively participate in the program. We perceive "Partnership  for Peace" to be a new and promising element of the process of  building European security. We also regard the initiative as  Poland's chance for strengthening its links to NATO, for better  cooperation with the Alliance. We also perceive the initiative  as a chance for the future implementation of our strategic goal  of Poland's integration with Western security structures.    We see the implementation of "Partnership for Peace" not  only as a way of getting closer to NATO. We also want to avail  ourselves of the opportunities that the program creates for  maintaining good, partnershiplike cooperation also with our  eastern neighbors. Maintaining such a mutually beneficial  cooperation with the countries of our region, a cooperation  which would be based on equal rights, remains a crucial issue  for Poland.    "Partnership for Peace" has a chance of becoming a wide area  of concrete, day-to-day cooperation among European countries for  the sake of common security.    Taking into account a certain skepticism which has emerged  in  the public opinion on this issue, it is important to go beyond  mere political declarations and to provide the program with a  clear content and complete credibility.    "Partnership for Peace" is a factor which has the potential  to positively shape security relations. But while thinking  about the future, one should reach beyond mere security.  Security, broadly speaking, also means successful economic,  cultural, and social development.    Those same goals were also the guiding ideas for the authors  of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. It is worth recalling  that under Article 2 of the Treaty, the parties to the Treaty  took upon themselves an obligation to "contribute to the further  development of peaceful and friendly relations" among others  "through supporting the conditions of stability and prosperity."  The parties also obliged themselves not only to eliminate  conflicts occurring in their economic relations, but also to  "support economic cooperation between every one of them and  among all of them." So, while implementing "Partnership for  Peace" in the area of political and military cooperation, we  should also strive to create a "Partnership for Development,"  which would be a multiaspect, broad kind of cooperation among  America, West, Central, and East Europe. It would be a  cooperation among different structures and governmental and  extragovernmental institutions, taking into account both  regional and local cooperation.    That cooperation should in particular cover those countries  which are on their way to a market economy. The cooperation  should contribute to increasing the countries' growth rate, to  an increased sense of stability, to promoting economic  transformations, and to a widening and a strengthening of the  market economy in the entire area covered by the partnership  concept.    These forms of a broad, open cooperation may significantly  contribute to the final elimination of the existing divisions,  to Europe's integration, and, as a consequence, to securing  stability and prosperity, and to eliminating many sources of  current and potential conflicts.    I have faith that together, we will achieve these goals.</p>

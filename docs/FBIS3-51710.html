			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The wealthiest 10 percent of Chilean households  accounted for 47.5 percent of the total income generated by the  country in the late 1980's, although the distribution of income  was somewhat less inequitable at the start of the 1990's. We can  gather this from a study by the Economic Commission for Latin  America and the Caribbean, ECLA.    In contrast, the study, which was made public this past  weekend, notes that the poorest decile (10 percent) of the  country's households received just 1.5 percent of total income;  this figure remained practically the same as the 1990's began.    The rest of the income pie is divided up among the other  eight deciles. From top to bottom, the ninth has 14.8 percent;  the eighth 10 percent; the seventh 7.7 percent; the sixth 6  percent; the fifth 5 percent; the fourth 4 percent; the third  3.4 percent, and the second 2.3 percent.    The numbers in Greater Santiago are very similar to the  nationwide totals. According to the ECLA data, the wealthiest  decile of households account for 43.1 percent of the total,  while the poorest decile commands 1.8 percent.    There is greater inequity, however, in rural areas. Here,  the  wealthiest decile of households accounts for almost 60 percent  (59.8 percent) of total income, while the poorest decile  accounts for just 1.1 percent.    There is hardly a surplus of studies on income distribution  in Latin America. They became particularly scarce in the early  1980's when the circumstances of the poorest groups grew  markedly worse, after which the recovery benefited the richest  segments of the population first.    This trend was especially marked in Chile, where the  military  government and its technocrats chose a macroeconomic policy of  belt-tightening rather than seeking to distribute more equitably  the wealth generated by the country.    Very few studies were conducted on the issue.    Afterwards, under the current administration the Planning  Ministry (Mideplan) undertook several studies in this regard,  also covering the issue of poverty and indigence levels. They  showed that although the trend towards income concentration that  Chile saw in the 1980's is being reversed, there have not been  major improvements in the early 1990's.    In spite of the serious efforts undertaken, which can be  evaluated only after the current administration's term is over,  Chile is still one of the Latin American countries with the  worst income distribution according to World Bank figures.    For example, the numbers in the ECLA study show that  although  Mexico underwent a macroeconomic belt-tightening just as severe  as Chile's or even more so, its income distribution is better  than ours at present.    In Mexico, the wealthiest 10 percent of households accounted  for 33.4 percent of total income in 1990, that is to say, about  a third, compared to more than 45 percent in Chile. The status  of the poorest households is only slightly better in Mexico than  in Chile, however; they receive 2 percent of national income,  compared to 1.5 percent in Chile.    UN data from 1992 show that the situation in Chile is  comparable to that in Brazil and Peru, two of the countries in  the region that are doing the worst in this regard, and is worse  than in Argentina and Venezuela at present.    For comparison purposes we might note that in the G-7  countries (the seven most developed countries in the world) the  richest 20 percent of the population accounts for just 38.7  percent of total income and the poorest 20 percent 6.8 percent.    If we use the same yardsticks in Chile, the numbers are 60.1  and 3.8 percent in 1990 (this does not take into account the  subsequent mild improvement).    Another yardstick shows that the income of the wealthiest 20  percent was 12.45 times greater than the income of the poorest  20 percent in Chile in 1987, 13.19 times greater in 1990, and  back down to 12.31 times greater in 1992, a positive trend.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Income Distribution in Chile                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Decile                   |1989 (percent)           |1990 (percent)           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1 (poorest)              |1.5                      |1.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2                        |2.4                      |2.3                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3                        |3.1                      |3.4                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |4                        |4.0                      |4.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5                        |4.7                      |5.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |6                        |6.0                      |6.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |7                        |7.4                      |7.7                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |8                        |9.5                      |10.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |9                        |13.9                     |14.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10 (richest)             |47.5                     |45.3                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: ECLA, households |                         |                         |  |categorized by total inc-|                         |                         |  |ome                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

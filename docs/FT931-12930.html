			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie nears its peak after rate cut THE BANK of England caught the London stock market wrong-footed yesterday morning with the unexpected announcement of a one percentage-point cut in domestic interest rates. The City of London had expected the rate reduction to be held back until nearer to Budget day. The market scored its biggest daily gain since mid-September, the FT-SE 100 Index closing within one per cent of its all-time high, after equity strategists saw the base rate move as a clear signal that 'the government is putting economic growth first, and inflation risk second', to quote one leading analyst. After dawdling at the opening, the UK markets sprang to life when the Bank announced that interest rates were being lowered to 6 per cent. Trading volume increased substantially in both stock index futures and the underlying equity market. Share prices boiled over after the initial gain of 63 Footsie points but buyers returned at the close in spite of hints that a large rights issue was back on the corporate agenda in the wake of the Bank's action. At its final reading of 2,835.7, the FT-SE Index was 63.8 up on the day and only 26 points below the peak of 2,861.5 reached on January 4 this year. The largest gains came in those sectors directly benefiting from lower interest rates, notably building materials, construction and contracting, food retailers, banks and other financial institutions. Although the focus was on the FT-SE 100 stocks, the second liners were also strong. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 1.6 per cent to 2,951.6. The success of the UK authorities in catching the market unawares was reflected in trading volume data. On Monday, Seaq volume fell to 490.3m shares, which was worth only Pounds 984m in retail terms, at the lower range of recent daily averages. But in the wake of the interest rate cut, Seaq turnover jumped to 861.8m shares yesterday. Market analysts were in no doubt that the move to 6 per cent base rates was a green light for the stock market. Base rates have now been reduced by 400 basis points since sterling's departure from the ERM network in mid-September and the benefits are expected to show up dramatically in the March round of final corporate results. Sterling stood up well to the move and the government bond market advanced smartly as investment houses hurriedly reshaped their stances ahead of today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of UK government securities. However, Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, said that yesterday's move was 'the end of the economically justifiable rate cuts - any further reductions could seriously endanger sterling'. Many strategists, perhaps showing wisdom after the event, said the authorities either had to make their move on interest rates before the bond auction, or wait until well afterwards; some suggested that the rate cut, regarded as a reaction to last week's poor data on UK unemployment, might have been delayed until the new governor of the Bank of England could set his seal on the decision. Equity professionals are convinced that share earnings will now achieve a recovery of 15 to 20 per cent this year, but asked themselves what further move to stimulate the economy the government can now produce on Budget day in March.</p>

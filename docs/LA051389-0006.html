			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS IN STABBING  </P> <P> A21-year-old Tujunga man was sentenced Friday to four years in prison for a  stabbing death that occurred during an argument about a woman.  </P> <P> Jaime Marquez Alvarez was sentenced by San Fernando Superior Court Judge  Meredith C. Taylor after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the Jan.  25, 1988, slaying of Martin Jimenez Pelayo, 25, of Tujunga.  </P> <P> Alvarez received a lesser penalty for the offense because it was determined  that he may have suffered brain damage in a fight with the victim, triggering  his behavior, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Meredith S. Rust.  </P> <P> Authorities said Alvarez had gone to an apartment in the 10200 block of Tujunga  Canyon Boulevard to see a woman. Pelayo, who was in the apartment, told Alvarez  that the girl did not want to talk to him because he was drunk.  </P> <P> At that point, Rust said, the men started fighting.  </P> <P> Alvarez eventually left and returned a short time later with a sharp object  that he used to stab the victim, Rust said.  </P></p>

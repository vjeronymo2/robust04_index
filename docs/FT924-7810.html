			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nippon Credit Bank downgraded THE MOUNTING bad debts of the Japanese banking system yesterday led Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency, to downgrade the rating of the Nippon Credit Bank, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks. Moody's also said it was considering downgrading three Japanese trust banks  -Mitsui Trust and Banking, Yasuda Trust and Banking and Toyo Trust and Banking. Nippon Credit Bank's rating for short-term deposits was lowered to Prime-3, from Prime-2. The three trust banks' long-term and short-term deposits as well as their senior debt is under review. The reviews reflect the banks' high direct lending to real estate companies and to the non-bank sector, which expanded real estate lending in the late 1980s. The Japanese banking industry has been badly hit by a sharp rise in non-performing loans, largely due to a steep fall in real estate prices. The Ministry of Finance last month announced that non-performing loans for the top 21 banks had risen from about Y8,000bn in March to more than Y12,000bn (Dollars 96.77bn) by the end of September. Moody's move focuses attention on the long-term credit and trust banks as the most seriously affected sectors of the industry. It confirms the private view of many bankers that Nippon Credit may prove to be one of the worst affected banks. Moody's said the four banks' exposures to the real estate market and to the non-bank sector were very high in relation to their assets and earnings. Non-banks lend but do not take deposits and are far less tightly regulated than banks. Its assessment of the four banks concluded: 'Their weak core earnings are likely to continue to be burdened by unrealised losses embedded in their large exposures to problematic sectors. Some of these banks may be required to assist their non-bank affiliates. The scale of the assistance that may be required to recapitalise some of these affiliates may prove to be quite large.' Moody's said it expected the resolution of the banking system's bad debt problems would prove difficult because it would be hard for the banks to reach a consensus over how the losses should be allocated.</p>

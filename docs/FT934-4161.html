			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Emblematic encounters - An evening at the Riverside theatre Two shows at the Riverside Studios demonstrate how catholic a venue this has become. One is Heartstrings, a multi-lingual and multi-cultural workout, and the other is How To Act Better, a slice of flim-flan served up with a VCR and big screen. Heartstrings misses the mark for the right reasons. It tries to be bold and demanding, but strays too often into no-sense, worse than nonsense. It is devised and acted by the fine European company, Talking Pictures. Five actors run a series of emblematic encounters together to make an emotional history: arrivals, departures, beginnings and endings are played in mime, song and (at least) seven different languages, more if you count the various dialects of Spanish and English. The show relies on creating moments of insight which show rather than tell what is happening. The best scenes emerge where least is said: a silent tableau of incest, where the victim cries only 'Mama', or the hilarious meeting of two sisters quasi-married to the same man, one speaking Castillian, the other Argentinean Spanish. There is a poignant retirement home scene and a good slapstick meeting between two lovers where one learns the other's language with haphazard abandon. The director, Sandra Mladenovitch has rightly realised that drama can levy demands and entertain. She keeps the scenery to a minimum, using only translucent black screens and a junk pile of props. The actors are unremittingly energetic and versatile. The play has moments of great intensity, but it still needs a strong unifying theme. The overall effect is tousled rather than coiffured. Later at the Riverside, hair is on the agenda for the American, Annie Griffin, who talks three hopefuls through a course in How To Act Better. This is a documentary about acting. At one point, the ubiquitous video camera through which she addresses the audience follows her backstage for a bit of dressing-room verite where she bemoans the fate of her tonsured locks. She starts the evening, her back to the audience, presenting her resume: 'Height 5.10' (negotiable) 'weight 126 pounds, good posture, fluent French, perfect teeth.' She has blood red lipstick, black evening gloves, pearls round her throat and the inevitable black velvet dress. For documentary read vampumentary. The idea of a tour round the theatre, beginning with Upstage Left and visiting the corners of the stage ('Let's continue our journey downstage') runs out of steam as Griffin runs out of the theatre, seducing the video cameraman on screen. But for 60 minutes, the idea works as Griffin makes hay in the dry ice and camps up imitations of Sara Bernhardt and scenes from La Dame aux Camelias. Griffin is precise, versatile and engaging. Her mannered delivery puts her in Kathleen Turner territory; and the fake chaos and video link trespass on the TV documentary province of fellow Americans Ruby Wax and Laurie Pike. She has a trio of beefcake proteges hoping to act better (Will Brook, Eliot Giuralarocca and Oliver Senton), but they neither need nor profit from her advice. How to Act Better makes a relaxing reward after the rigours of Heartstrings earlier in the evening. Both shows at The Riverside Studios (081 748 3354) until December 11</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Business jet users accuse BAA of unfair practice A LOBBY group backed by some of Britain's largest companies has lodged a complaint with the European Commission against BAA, alleging anti-competitive practices. It accuses BAA, which operates London's largest airports, of unfairly excluding some business jets so that more commercial aircraft on scheduled flights can use the overcrowded runways. Some companies using business aircraft have contacted the office of Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, to argue that business aircraft should continue to have free access to Heathrow. The export manager of one large manafacturing company said: 'This is a serious issue. It could be the beginning of a trend to exclude small aircraft from major airports.' BAA acknowledged that it wants to give more landing slots to bigger aircraft and had cancelled some of the peak-time slots reserved for business aircraft. It said that a small aircraft's slot is twice as long as a normal slot because it has to wait until the turbulence caused by a preceding large aircraft has settled down. Private aircraft account for 4 per cent of the traffic at Heathrow. The lobby group intends to take BAA to the European Court in Luxembourg.</p>

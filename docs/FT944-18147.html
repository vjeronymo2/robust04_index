			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Adams benefits from shadow-boxing: The Sinn Fein chief's warmer-than-expected welcome in Washington The Clinton administration this weekend decided to salve Mr Gerry Adams's pride and salvage his two-week tour of the US with a last-minute upgrade in the level of its contacts with him. Until last Friday the Sinn Fein leader had been scheduled to meet the State Department's director of the office of Northern European affairs, and to 'bump into' Ms Nancy Soderberg, staff director of the White House National Security Council, at a dinner party hosted by the Washington correspondent of the Irish Times. But after Mr Adams balked at this relatively low level of meeting his US sponsors, led by Mr Edward Kennedy, the Democrat senator, increased the pressure on the White House to accord Mr Adams a more effusive reception. While sticking to the letter of its promise to the British government that there would be no meeting at the White House and no meeting with Mr Bill Clinton, the president, Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, or Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, the White House obliged. Mr Adams's State Department host was upgraded to deputy assistant secretary Mr John Kornblum. Ms Soderberg and Mr Leon Fuerth, the vice-president's national security adviser, were added to this formal meeting and Mr Lake conveyed the decision in a gushing letter that had British officials snorting with annoyance at its praise for Mr Adams as a 'harbinger of peace.' To cap it all, the White House decided that Mr Gore would announce the ending of a 25-year-old US policy barring official contacts with Sinn Fein in a telephone call to the home of Mrs Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Mr Robert widow of the late Mr Robert Kennedy, where Mr Adams was staying. A senior administration official said: 'We felt this was a fairly historic decision, and a decision of that level should come from the vice-president.' Mr Adams's need for a symbolic victory had been increased by the moderate success of the early part of his US tour. Before Monday's phone call the view in Whitehall was that the Sinn Fein president's visit had been much less successful than feared - certainly in comparison with his ground-breaking trip to New York in February when he was front-page news. Events in Haiti and the OJ Simpson trial did not keep the Sinn Fein president off the air and front pages in the UK as they did in the US. But when he did hit the headlines - as in the wake of his veiled threat of a return of IRA violence and the encounter on BBC TV's Newsnight with Mr Michael Mates, cast in the role of government emissary - the coverage tended to be critical. After his hectoring and argumentative performance in the debate with Mr Mates the impression started to form in London that this period of intense media exposure - following a six-year spell when Sinn Fein voices were banned from the airwaves - had quite simply found Mr Adams out. There was a feeling that one of the most enduring results of his visit would be to undermine Sinn Fein's image as a ruthlessly efficient propaganda machine. Ironically, Fleet Street's news agenda came to London's assistance in the wake of Washington's decision to open relations with Sinn Fein. The Labour party conference and a sensational royal story helped to ensure it was covered less prominently than might otherwise have been the case. The final verdict on Mr Adams's success in influencing American public opinion was expected ultimately to hinge on his performance last night in a 30-minute televised debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman. Although British officials sought publicly to play down the impact of Washington's diplomatic upgrades, arguing that Mr Clinton had stuck to his promise not to allow a White House meeting, private reactions have been much more caustic. The upgrades probably say less about US policy towards Sinn Fein, or even about the political clout of Mr Adams's sponsors, than they do about the weakness of the Clinton administration in general, and on foreign policy in particular. They will do nothing to dispel the view prevailing among the US's allies that the president remains incapable of making and sticking to a decision. Nevertheless, they have reinforced suspicions that the US is seeking not just to support the peace process but to play a role in steering it. 'This administration needs to be careful in its contacts with Northern Ireland,' warned Dr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, whose visit to Washington coincided with Mr Adams's. Dr Alderdice was received at a higher level - by Mr Peter Tarnoff, the State Department's number three official. US officials deny any intention of interfering. But the White House has alarmed some in Northern Ireland and in the British government by promising to continue its dialogue with Sinn Fein through its consulate general in Belfast and its embassy in Dublin - where yet another member of the Kennedy clan, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, is US ambassador. There is talk of another high-level Sinn Fein visit in November, and administration officials have even refused to say that they would continue to refuse visas to members of the IRA.</p>

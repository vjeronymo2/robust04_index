			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrew Marshall in Brussels and Colin Brown: "EU </F> Heads for Deadlock on Presidency"]    [Text] Deadlock on the choice of a new president for the  EU [European Union] Commission is all but certain at the Corfu  summit this weekend, with the two main candidates both refusing  to pull out of the race.    John Major would be relieved to postpone the decision until  a  special summit under the German presidency. The Prime Minister  would face a storm of criticism from his anti-European right  wing if the Belgian Prime Minister lean-Luc Dehaene, wins. But  the Government does not expect to be alone in seeking a delay.    Foreign Office sources hinted that they were hoping for a  "white knight" to emerge as an acceptable candidate during the  next six months. Peter Sutherland, the former Irish EU  Commissioner, now the head of GATT, is one option Britain would  be prepared to consider.    As European Union leaders drawn from Christian Democratic  parties assembled in Brussels last night, Ruud Lubbers, the  Dutch Prime Minister, discounted the idea that he was about to  defer to Mr Dehaene. "No. Not at all, of course not," said the  Dutchman testily.    At their meeting last night the Christian Democrats failed  to  agree on a consensus candidate.    Mr Lubbers' irritation has grown as France and Germany have  tried to make his opponent's selection seem a foregone  conclusion. Mr Dehaene, accused by British Euro-sceptics of  being a Euro-federalists in the Delors mould, only formally  entered the race last week and is not likely to back away now.  The two met last night in a frosty encounter. Both will also  be at the two-day summit starting in Corfu tomorrow.    Germany's Helmut Kohl, also a Christian Democrat, has  annoyed  several EU leaders by appearing to settle the matter when he met  Francois Mitterrand in Mulhouse earlier this month. Now the  Italians are saying that they see no reason why a decision needs  to be taken immediately; the British concur; the Portuguese are  miffed; and it is more than likely that there will be no  decision.    In London, senior ministers fear the Prime Minister has been  boxed into a corner by reports of his intention to use the veto  against the allegedly Euro-fanatical Mr Dehaene in Corfu. They  fear he would lose credibility and face a rebellion by the Tory  right wing if he accepted the Belgian, even though, in truth,  the Government has no particular objection to him.    Germany takes on the EU presidency next month, and it has  already considered the possibilities for a special summit to  settle the question in September. Britain is still supporting  Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's trade commissioner, for the  president's job. But his chances are slim; it seems more likely  he will get an extension of his role to cover more foreign  policy issues when Commission portfolios are sorted out later  this year.    If there is no decision in Corfu, a "dark horse" might be  preferred to break the deadlock.    Mr Sutherland is not yet the preferred candidate of the  Irish  government, which wants to keep Padraig Flynn in situ as a  Commissioner in Brussels. But the Irish government accepts that  if he became a serious contender for the president's job, it  would have to back him.</p>

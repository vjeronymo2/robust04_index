			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: CARLSBAD NOT YET READY FOR 'KNIGHT OF YOUR LIFE'  </P> <P> Is there a medieval castle in Carlsbad's future?  </P> <P> Sword fighting, jousting and knights on horseback? Up to 1,040 people at a time  dining on roasted chicken flambe spare ribs, herb-basted potatoes and fruity  wine cocktails? Half a million people a year touring the Hall of Arms, the  Knight Club, the Courtyard of Crests and Crafts, an art gallery and the  stables?  </P> <P> The answer is yes, if Medieval Times Dinner &amp; Tournament Inc., a theme  park-restaurant-dinner theater chain based in Buena Park, has its way. The  answer is no, unless concerns of city planners about traffic, height  limitations and architectural conformity are satisfied or overcome.  </P> <P> Medieval Times would like to build on a 4-acre site west of Interstate 5 just  north of Marie Callender's restaurant on Avenida Encinas. The company's other  castles are in Buena Park; Kissimmee, Fla.; Benidorm, Spain; the island of  Majorca in Spain and, soon, The Meadowlands in New Jersey.  </P> <P> Each diner receives a color-coded crown and is assigned a champion to represent  him during the ceremonial procession and games. There are 11 shows a week  during the winter, 15 a week during the summer.  </P> <P> "We think of ourselves not just as a restaurant or park, but as an  "attraction," spokeswoman MaryAnn Powell said.  </P> <P> Therein lies the land-use rub. The heraldic spirit of 1093 and the zoning  restrictions of 1989 clash like two armored knights on galloping stallions.  </P> <P> Medieval Times would like a 65-foot tower. Carlsbad has a 35-foot limit.  Medieval Times would like a freeway-catchy sign that says "For the Knight of  Your Life." Carlsbad likes signs to be demure.  </P> <P> Powell is sure that these and other sticky points are not insurmountable.  "We're confident we'll be in Carlsbad in the not-too-distant future," she said.  </P> <P> Planning Director Michael Holzmiller is wary. "We have a lot of talking to do  about traffic and other visual impacts," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bright Idea for SDG&amp;E  </P> <P> Fact One: A tried-and-true lobbying technique involves contacting a  politician's campaign contributors and asking them to speak to the pol on your  behalf. It's sometimes indelicately called the squeeze play.  </P> <P> Fact Two: A secretary to SDG&amp;E lobbyist Buzz Schott was spotted at the city  clerk's office at San Diego City Hall, intently studying the contributor lists  of City Council members.  </P> <P> "The more we know, the better job we can do," Schott explained. Any connection  between this surge of interest and the would-be buyout of San Diego Gas &amp;  Electric by Southern California Edison?  </P> <P> "Could be," Schott said. "We're definitely trying to gear up for any future  conflict. . . . We're looking for anything that might help us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homework Welcomed  </P> <P> Higher education is so broadening.  </P> <P> MiraCosta College in Oceanside is offering a seminar March 11 on "Finding a  Mate in San Diego." It is advertised thusly in the spring catalogue:  </P> <P> "Take charge of your social life. Learn proven methods of how to identify a  compatible, stable, available mate. What to say and what not to say. . . .  Learn flirting tips and how to tell if someone is interested or just being  friendly. Hear about six kinds of love and a 14-point plan to improve your  social life . . . "  </P> <P> The text will be instructor Sally Gary's book, "San Diego Connections: A  Single's Guide &amp; Resource Book."  </P> <P> </P> <P> All Aboard Aren't Human  </P> <P> Yes, those were mice you saw darting beneath the seats on the Amtrak train  between San Diego and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Mice are a continual problem aboard the trains, and Amtrak has a year-round  contract with an exterminator. It's the food, not the travel, that lures the  mice.  </P> <P> "Some people are slobs and leave all kinds of food scraps on the train,"  explained Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd. "The San Diego-to-L.A. train usually  makes two round trips a day and isn't cleaned thoroughly until the end of the  day. The mice can eat quite well until the exterminator gets them."  </P> <P> The freeloading rodents also have a preference for riding first-class.  </P></p>

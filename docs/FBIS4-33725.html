			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for  21 August.    Through 31 May, the National Action Party, PAN, spent 12.5  million new pesos. The PAN urged the other parties to publicly  disclose their finances and stated that it has well-founded  doubts regarding financial reports presented by the  Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. In Chiapas, 60,000  people left the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, to  protest the way party leaders nominated candidates. (Mexico City  XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 7 Jun 94)    On the occasion of Freedom of the Press Day on 7 June, PRD  presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solarzano signed a  document advocating the creation of a pluralistic social  communication council that would guarantee freedom of  expression. Cardenas said freedom of the press in Mexico is  still very limited. Labor Party, PT, presidential candidate  Cecilia Soto Gonzalez said she received death threats last week.  She rejected that such threats could affect the coming  elections, however. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish  0000 GMT 7 Jun 94)    PT's Soto underscored during a meeting with teachers that  only a coalition government will be able to meet the needs and  demands posed by Mexico's current situation. As for the  skirmish between PAN and PT militants over destruction of PT  political propaganda by PAN followers in Durango, Soto noted  that the PAN attitude is censurable. (Mexico City Radio ACIR  Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 9 Jun 94)    Also on Freedom of the Press Day, the presidential  candidates  made an unprecedented joint appearance before the media. PRI  candidate Ernesto Zedillo indicated that there are two  candidates who seek to tarnish Mexico's image. He added that  Mexico has problems, but it also has victories and great  potential. Intolerance should not prevail and there is  intolerance when constitutional reforms that have received the  support of most Mexicans are being criticized, he added.  Zedillo criticized Cardenas' intolerance and uncivilized  attitude while urging his opponents to hold "personal dialogues"  to ensure clean elections.    Alvaro Perez Trevino, candidate for the Authentic Party of  the Mexican Revolution, stated: "I will not invest a penny for  glory. We will strive so Mexicans have a guaranteed access to  jobs, health care, welfare, and education."    Popular Socialist Party candidate Marcela Lombardo said it  is  unfair to try to establish a bipartite system in Mexico, and  Mexico wants a genuine democratic regime to strengthen its  sovereignty.    The PRD's Cardenas denounced the existence of shady  relations  between the government and some media, and accused private  television of becoming one of the pillars of the PRI. Cardenas  also accused the PAN of condoning the alleged "electoral fraud"  that gave the victory to President Salinas in 1988.    National Opposition Union candidate Pablo Madero stressed:  "Democracy feeds on tolerance and respect for the will of  people. The tripartite system seeks to trade with the popular  vote."    Rafael Aguilar, candidate for the Cardenist Front for  National Reconstruction Party, claimed that following the last  debate, there was a feeling that an arrangement outside the  popular will had been concocted. In this arrangement, the PRI  secured the presidency before 21 August while the PAN and the  PRD candidates obtained the first and second vice presidencies  beforehand.    Mexican Green Ecologist Party candidate Jorge Gonzalez  argued: "Mexico demands justice, honesty, democracy, and  congruity in politics and public administration. Colosio's case  has become a mockery of Mexicans. The corruption that pervades  the police force and the judicial system is becoming unbearable."    PT's Cecilia Soto said: "I want to urge you to build a  bridge  so that Mexicans can overcome apathy, intolerance, and the  inability to conceive a new way of life for Mexicans." (Mexico  City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 8 Jun 94)    The private sector has voiced mixed views regarding the  10-point proposal presented by Ernesto Zedillo. The Mexican  Council of Businessmen stated the proposal was clear and precise  and that it will lead Mexico to steady growth in 1995.    Meanwhile, Raimundo Artiz, president of the National  Processing Industry Association, said Zedillo's presentation was  just a campaign speech and will not help solve the economic  problems. Artiz added that if the PRI candidate wins, Mexico's  economic prospects will be even worse than those of the last six  years.    Salvador Lopez, president of the National Chamber of  Commerce, noted that it was too soon to voice an opinion on  Zedillo's proposal while urging the remaining candidates to  present their proposals for the benefit of the public.    Eduardo Bours, president of the National  Agricultural-Livestock Council, said Zedillo's proposal is part  of a great national concern to give the countryside the  significance it deserves because it suggested viable solutions  that will help this sector grow. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in  Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 12)    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the  Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, has visited  Veracruz and said Mexicans are prepared for change and demand  respect for the people's vote. Aguilar said there are favorable  conditions for peace and social calm for the elections. (Mexico  City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 June 94)    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for  the  Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), has initiated a  three-day tour of Puebla and Oaxaca States. In Acatlan,  Cardenas has said the region has been abandoned and needs  schools, rural roads, and irrigation works. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94)    Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has visited Hermosillo, Sonora  State, to meet with newspaper editors. He also visited  neighborhoods in southern Hermosillo. As to the Colosio case,  Fernandez said the final word has not been given, adding it is a  very difficult crime to solve. (Mexico City XEW Television  Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94)    Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the Green  Ecologist Party, has visited (Tlamanalco Municipality), Mexico  State, and said one or two debates are not enough to discuss the  great problems the country faces. Gonzalez has said at least  three debates are necessary. (Mexico City XEW Television Network  in Spanish 0430 GMT 3 June 94)    Gonzalez has visited Puebla and discussed problems in the  agricultural sector. He discussed problems rural workers face  throughout the country. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in  Spanish 0000 GMT 4 June 94)    During a news conference, Marcela Lombardo Otero,  presidential candidate for the Popular Socialist Party, has  called on all Mexicans to denounce those who may try to promote  violence during the 21 August elections. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94)    Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for the National  Opposition Union, has continued his campaign in Jalisco, where  he met with a political committee and local media. Regarding  the Colosio assassination, he has said: "It all seemed to  indicate it was a plot, but to say it was an assassin who acted  alone is a simplistic view." (Mexico City XEW Television  Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94)    Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the Labor Party,  has  visited Guadalajara and protested because her party has been  excluded by the Government Secretariat from holding negotiations  on political reform. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in  Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94)    PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo has announced in  Tlanepantla Municipality, Mexico State, one of the most  industrialized in the country, he will implement a policy for  the creation of jobs. "My intention is to draft an economic  policy to promote investments because investments generate  stable, productive, well-paying jobs," Zedillo has said. He  added his biggest challenge will be to create 10 million jobs  before the year 2000, when all fiscal and tax obstacles faced by  businessmen should be eliminated. (Mexico City XEW Television  Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 3 June 94)    Zedillo had a breakfast meeting with members of the  Permanent  Agrarian Congress in Mexico City. During the meeting, Zedillo  said the crisis in the countryside has produced sad faces,  discouragement, and even violence, as in the case of Chiapas.  Zedillo said peasants do not understand the Program of Direct  Support to the Countryside. He said the government should stop  subsidizing poverty and the state should end paternalistic  policies. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4  June 94)    Speaking to university students from public and private high  schools, Zedillo said differences can be overcome through  dialogue and debate, adding that pressure by inflexible minority  groups do not scare him. Zedillo also talked about the  environment and said he who contaminates it should pay for the  damage, and he who protects the environment must be rewarded.  (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300  GMT 6 June 94)    Zedillo has promised a 10-point program to foster investment  and economic growth in Mexico. Zedillo explained the program  during the Economic Growth for Family Well-Being Forum held in  Mexico City. He said: "Mexicans have made great efforts to  stabilize the economy in an unprecedented process of sacrifices  by all." (Paris AFP in Spanish 2212 GMT 6 June 94)</p>

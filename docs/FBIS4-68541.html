			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Yakovlev, economist: "A Slump Has Begun </F> in Moscow's Foodstuff Market"]    [Text] At the end of March, along with the traditional poll  of private wholesale firms, the Institute of Organized Market  Research and the Higher School of Economics polled, for the  first time, the directors of state and privatized wholesale  trade enterprises operating in the foodstuff market. The  selection included meat and fish refrigeration plants, dairy  combines, vegetable warehouses, firms trading in groceries,  canned goods, wine and spirits items, etc. The results of the  poll make it possible to draw a conclusion as to the essential  differences in the evaluations of the current market situation  made by representatives of the former state food trading  enterprises and private firms.    The general deterioration in the situation in wholesale  trade  in foodstuffs in Moscow, which was observed in both sectors of  the market, can be singled out as the main trend for the month.  At the same time, while for private firms it was accompanied by  a noticeable drop in trade turnover, estimates of the volume of  sales in the past month made by the directors of state and  privatized enterprises on the whole proved to be favorable. At  the same time, the predictions and expectations of private  wholesalers for the next quarter remained considerably higher.    The dynamics of the wholesale prices also differed.  Twenty-six percent of the private wholesalers raised their  prices in March, and the same number dropped them. As a result,  on the whole for this sector of the market, a "zero" rise in  prices was noted for the first time. Conversely, in the state  sector, 50 percent of the firms polled raised their prices, and  not a single one began lowering them. Higher inflationary  expectations were also characteristic for state trade.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-051-83A>      FIGURE </FIG>     In our opinion, the difference in the estimates of the  current market situation and the predictions made by respondents  of INIOR [Institute of Organized Market Research] and VShE  [Higher School of Economics] were caused, in the first place by  the varied trade assortment. Food commodities in daily demand,  as before, were to a considerable extent sold through the former  state wholesale bases. It is obvious that, by virtue of the poor  elasticity of demand, the drop in trade turnover here proves  smaller, and the potentials for a further rise in prices  --greater than for the commodity products list characteristic of  private trade.    In the second place, the more flexible and quicker reaction  of the private trade firms to an unfavorable change in the  system of foreign economic regulation might play a certain role.  According to the estimates of INIOR and VShE specialists, the  forthcoming March introduction of new customs duties was  reflected in the prices of Moscow private trade as far back as  January-February. It is this (and not just the reserves  accumulated) that made it possible for them to avoid raising  prices in March. The state and privatized enterprises, on the  contrary, follow the change in the foreign conditions of the  functioning market in their price policy.</p>

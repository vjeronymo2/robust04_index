			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Nicaraguan Vice President Virgilio Godoy Reyes this  weekend agreed with Daniel Ortega's opposition to the national  economy adjustment agreement. On Sunday, Godoy Reyes and  Daniel Ortega both said on local radio stations that street  violence may erupt if the government implements the economic  measures scheduled for this month. Godoy, however, did not say  whether UNO [National Opposition Union] will support such  protests. The Sandinist National Liberation Front, which has  always supported violence, says it will support these events.    Ortega and Godoy agreed the economic measures are very harsh  and might prompt disturbances. The leadership of COSEP [Higher  Council of Private Enterprise], through its president Ramiro  Gurdian, said the measures should be implemented as the only  real solution to Nicaragua's economic problems.</p>

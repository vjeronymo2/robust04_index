			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Waiting for the mist to clear: A crucial part of the London share trading system faces calls for reform Like toothpaste which cannot be returned to the tube once it has been squeezed out, London's share trading system may be irrevocably altered by inquiries begun by the City regulators. Over the past six months, a debate has been heating up about London Stock Exchange rules which give privileges to a handful of securities firms in exchange for ensuring there is always a market in listed shares. Such 'marketmakers' are legally obliged to buy and sell large blocks of shares even in turbulent markets. In June, the Office of Fair Trading launched an inquiry into whether existing practices were anti-competitive. Earlier this year, a report by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, questioned whether the rules were necessary. That report raised the question of whether such privileges - for instance, a right to withhold temporarily some information about share prices from investors  - were damaging investors' interests. Although Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, says the report was intended to stimulate debate, rather than prompt reform, London's marketmakers are glum. 'We are at the stage where the microscope is on the strengths and weaknesses of the marketmaking system,' says the head of one of the City's largest marketmaking firms. 'The fact that SIB has drawn attention to the system has increased the pressure for change.' The future of marketmaking is important for leading securities houses because, since the 1986 'Big Bang' deregulated the City, it has become an integral part of their services. Old-style 'jobbers', who once only made markets, are now part of firms which also act as brokers and underwriters, and trade in derivatives - complex instruments whose value is based in part on that of an underlying financial market. If the rules governing marketmaking changed, it would become a less profitable business. But it is not clear whether firms could easily withdraw from marketmaking without damaging other parts of their businesses. The dilemma over rules for securities trading comes when competition is rising from Continental European bourses. London's marketmakers say that the current system means that, even in turbulent conditions, investors can buy and sell large blocks of shares with relative ease. If it were altered, they argue, the City would lose its competitive edge. But futures exchanges and foreign securities houses disagree, and are anxious for reform. Futures exchanges say that the lack of transparency in the current system means that London derivatives prices do not accurately reflect the price of the underlying shares, and consequently investors are staying away. Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange, says the volume of derivatives trading in London is below that in Continental European centres. London branches of foreign securities houses say customers increasingly prefer other European markets, where the rules are more familiar and each share deal is declared as soon as it is concluded. Marketmakers counter that introducing greater transparency would allow competitors to see their positions - roughly akin to viewing a fellow poker-player's hand. They point out that they are putting their capital at risk to make markets for the benefit of others and that they are entitled to something in return. They cite the three years following Big Bang, when they suffered swingeing losses under a transparent trading regime. That episode led to the current rules, which allow marketmakers to delay releasing details of deals involving large blocks of shares. This delay gives marketmakers time to sell shares without other securities houses knowing there is a big seller in the market. But Mr Michael Marks, chief executive at Smith New Court, one of London's leading marketmakers, argues that the current delays are often not long enough for them to hedge risks involved in making markets: 'I believe that we need marginally less transparency, not more.' Marketmakers warn that, if transparency was increased, they would limit the capital they commit to trading, harming investors' interests. Most institutional investors support the marketmakers' arguments. They feel liquidity is more important than transparency, says Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds. But such support is not universal. Mr Dick Barfield, investment director at Standard Life, one of the UK's largest life insurance companies, says many investors are unaware that a lack of transparency has a cost. 'What institutions don't realise is that very often, when they are dealing in shares at a rate which requires immediate disclosure, someone else is dealing in a larger size at a better price. They just don't know there is a better price.' Stock exchange statistics support Mr Barfield's view. Last year, just over half of the largest share deals (those worth more than Pounds 1m) were struck at prices better than the best publicly available price. But foreign securities firms, in particular, say that the real difficulty is not lack of transparency, but the system itself. Most Continental bourses operate 'order-driven' systems, in which no participant is obliged to make a market and, when any deal is struck, details are immediately available to all. If London operated such a system, investors would know the true prices at which transactions were being conducted, the foreign firms say. Moreover, they dispute the claim of marketmakers that the London system provides greater liquidity, arguing that increased investor confidence would increase investor participation. 'We keep trying to fudge a system which is fundamentally flawed,' says Mr Chris Salter, executive director in charge of trading at Swiss Bank Corp. He believes this is increasingly putting the London Stock Exchange at a disadvantage. To an extent, it is hard to see why: since 1988 the stock exchange has operated what is in effect an electronic 'bulletin board' - the Seaq International system - where marketmakers post the prices at which they are prepared to deal. Because UK securities houses were prepared to risk capital in a way Continental firms were not, London quickly dominated trading in shares across Europe's borders. But in recent years, Continental bourses have been fighting back, altering their systems to make it easier to trade large blocks of shares. Recognising the profit opportunities, Continental securities houses have become more willing to use their own capital to buy shares, taking on a kind of marketmaking role. These efforts are showing signs of success. Turnover on the Paris bourse in the first half of 1994 was 67 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The London Stock Exchange counters that Seaq International turnover increased by a similar amount. That, it says, reinforces its view that no change to the current rules for marketmakers is necessary. As the OFT inquiry proceeds and the pressure for reform increases, that position may be harder to sustain. One sign that even the exchange perhaps realises change is in the air was its decision this spring to build into the replacement version of Seaq a facility that would allow for an 'order-driven' system.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Float price values Hamleys at Pounds 42.3m Hamleys, the self-styled 'finest toy shop in the world', yesterday set its flotation share price at 185p, valuing the group at Pounds 42.3m. The estimated total proceeds of the placing and intermediaries offer, the joint sponsors of which are Hambro Magan and Cazenove, are Pounds 12m net of expenses. That will pay off Hamleys' remaining long-term debt. The market capitalisation was slightly higher than the Pounds 40m previously suggested. But the shares, on a notional historic p/e of 17.8 times, are at a discount to the sector average of 19. A notional dividend of 4.7p for the year to January 29 would give a gross yield of 3.2 per cent - higher than the sector average of approximately 2.8 per cent. The deadline for receipt of applications and cleared funds from intermediaries is midday on May 4. COMMENT The question for Hamleys is whether it can capitalise on its retailing expertise and the strength of its brand - demonstrated by its Regent Street flagship - to grow the business. The strategy of opening small outlets in airports and tourist centres seems sounder than failed attempts in the 1980s to build full-range branches in UK provincial cities, although their profits contribution may be unspectacular. Potentially more interesting is the plan to operate concessions for other retailers, such as the deal recently struck with House of Fraser. Earnings growth prospects may be modest, but the business is soundly managed, the yield is good, and the price looks realistic.</p>

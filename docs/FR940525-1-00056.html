			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the claim is denied following the review of the public comments, FSIS would notify the applicant by letter of the basis for the denial, including the reason why the claim on the labeling was determined by the Administrator to be false or misleading. The applicant would have the opportunity to appeal this decision by instituting a proceeding that would be conducted under the same procedures specified above if a labeling application were summarily denied by the Administrator during the initial review. If the claim is approved by the Administrator, FSIS would notify the applicant by letter and would also publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a final regulation regarding the approval of the claim. The final regulation would amend the regulations to authorize the use of the health claim in the labeling of meat and poultry products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS's proposed labeling application process concerning health claims differs from that of FDA as detailed in 21 CFR 101.70. Although FSIS has attempted to harmonize to the maximum extent possible with FDA in most aspects of nutrition labeling, FDA's rulemaking process regarding health claims differs from FSIS's statutory authority mandated by Congress under section 7(e) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 607(e) and section 8(d) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 457(d)). These statutes afford applicants whose labeling claims are denied by the Administrator the right to appeal that decision to a Federal court of appeals. Because of these statutory requirements, the Department has promulgated regulations (9 CFR 335.12, 9 CFR 381.233, and 7 CFR 1.130  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) that specify the hearing procedures and rules of practice which are used in proceedings before the Secretary under section 7(e) of the FMIA and section 8(d) of the PPIA. Accordingly, the labeling application process proposed by FSIS concerning health claims provides applicants with those same rights to a due process administrative hearing if their claims are denied by the Administrator, and is thereby consistent with FSIS's statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the Administrator has determined that a health claim may be used, firms may make claims based on the regulation provided that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease or health-related relationship are based on, and consistent with, the conclusions prescribed in the summary of scientific information and proposed health claims;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion of the substance may have on a particular disease or health-related condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The claim is complete, truthful, and not misleading;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material, except that the label may bear the statement, ``See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for information about the relationship between  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,'' with the blanks filled in with references to the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance, and the disease or health-related condition, with the entire claim appearing on the other labeling;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food is sufficiently low to justify the claim, or, if the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food is sufficiently high to justify the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the nature and complexity of health claims and the consumer's reliance on them in making decisions on food purchases, FSIS believes it is essential that health claims be conveyed to consumers in an accurate and informative manner. Therefore, if this proposal is adopted as a final regulation, FSIS would make the final regulation effective 6 months from the date of publication of the final regulation. FSIS believes that this would provide sufficient time for meat and poultry producers to conform to the new health claim requirements. It is noted, therefore, that the health claim requirements would not become effective on July 6, 1994, along with the mandatory nutrition labeling regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9 CFR Part 317  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Food labeling, Food packaging, Meat inspection, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9 CFR Part 381  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Food labeling, Poultry and poultry products, Poultry inspection, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, FSIS is proposing to amend 9 CFR parts 317 and 381 of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 317_LABELING, MARKING DEVICES, AND CONTAINERS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance in the meat or meat food product and a disease or health-related condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

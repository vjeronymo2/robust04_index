But that will  change, according to Miguel Pourier, who is to become prime  minister next week. He wants to do his utmost to get things  straightened out so that Netherlands solutions for Antillean  problems are no longer necessary.    "The big change for me came after the referendum. It took me  days to get used to the idea, but after the results I realized I  could not get out of going back into politics," said Miguel  Pourier (54). In a week, he will take over as prime minister of  the Netherlands Antilles. It is a return for the former  minister, former interim prime minister and former banker, who  had in fact been planning to take things at a more leisurely  pace. Now he has set himself the task of leading the Antilles  into a new era: That of an efficient and business-like  government culture, not just internally, but also in relation to  the Netherlands.    In the meantime Pourier is aware that a difficult task is  awaiting him. He acknowledges that his personality -- he is  known as honest, friendly, and open -- is the big factor behind  the success of the Antillean Restructuring Party (PAR), once a  movement and now a party. The hopes of most of the Antillean  people are in Pourier personally. [passage omitted]    "Our goal is to make autonomy here complete," he said. "We  will put all, absolutely all our energy into getting things  straightened out; that applies to every island and every  organization in the government field. We will work very hard on  that and we do not want to see a lecturing finger wagging in our  direction from the Netherlands. I believe that in the kingdom  we must deal with one another as truly equal partners." Neither  does he expect any opposition from the Netherlands. "They can  expect some reliability from me," he said. "No mess, but a  well-ordered household. The people also expect that of us. How  could the Netherlands disagree with that?"    In recent years the relationship has not been so harmonious,  as Pourier knows. "Things went wrong on both sides," he said.  "We often made agreements simply to stop being pressured by the  Netherlands, but once we came home we just forgot about them. We  often did not solve our problems ourselves. The Netherlands then  started to think: We will do it, but that brings other problems  in its wake. Netherlands standards and solutions were put  forward for Antillean problems."    There is no doubt that the biggest challenge facing the  Pourier cabinet is finally achieving a new political structure  after 10 years of interminable talking and arguing. Pourier  thinks he will have everything ready in a year's time. He sees  the restructuring as a purely political-administrative problem  and a question of mentality. "Politicians from the various  islands were used to just tending their own garden," he said.  "Everyone followed their own course on their island and felt  they were the supreme authority there."    Pourier wants to put an end to the polarization which  developed in that way. "Politics is alienated from the people,"  he said. The individual gardens were a problem "because  everyone has a brother or sister in another garden. For example,  on St. Martin, there are more people entitled to vote from  Curacao and Bonaire than from St. Martin itself." Pourier sees  it as a collective task to get the best for the islands and the  Antilles as a whole. "With respect for each other's views," he  said. "If an island, in spite of the possibility of  cooperation, nevertheless prefers to go on independently, then  we would respect that."    Pourier is still leader of his party and will soon be leader  of the government, but he will soon transfer the leadership of  his party. Just three months after it was set up, the PAR is to  be restructured. Pourier sees danger in his party's  overwhelming election success. "Anything which arises so  suddenly brings problems with it," he said. "I also know that  some people have joined the PAR out of opportunistic reasons,  they see a profit in it. But these people will be disappointed  because we are in fact trying to break with the traditional way  of doing politics, with doing favors, patronage and corruption."    The next prime minister does not want to manage everything  alone. "I think we must act in an educated manner and teach the  people to be responsible themselves," he said. "That applies to  families, school boards, trade unions and business, everyone has  a job. When these responsibilities exceed people's individual  abilities, then there is space for the government to help. So  that the help goes where help is really needed."    Pourier and his family see the coming prime ministership as  a  sort of mission. "It is clear I plays an important role, I could  not avoid that," he said. "But after 31 years on the front line,  I wanted to take things more easily. I used to work just five or  six hours a day and earned between 300,000 and 400,000 a year.  Now I am going to work 14 hours a day and lead a very busy life  for a relatively small income."</p>

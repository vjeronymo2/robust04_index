			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For these reasons, RSPA rejects requests to lower the tangential design load. In many cases, manufacturers will find it necessary to develop new designs for overturn protection devices, perhaps with associated short-term increased cost, but with enhanced safety benefits. Several manufacturers already have developed satisfactory protection devices which meet these design criteria. In addition, RSPA has made several minor editorial revisions in paragraph (c)(1) to improve clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(3) prescribes that each cargo tank rear-end protection device and its attachment to the vehicle must be designed to satisfy the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) when subject to an impact of the cargo tank at rated payload, at a deceleration of 2 ``g''. Such an impact must be considered as being uniformly applied in a horizontal plane at an angle of 30 degrees or less to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. Commenters requested elimination of the 30 degree angle for this impact load. They stated that most rear-end collisions of trucks and trailers involve other vehicles and are ``in line'', i.e., the longitudinal centerlines of the two vehicles are parallel at impact. TTMA pointed out that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a notice of proposed rulemaking [Docket No. 1&hyph;11, Notice 9; January 3, 1992], containing a proposal for rear impact guards and protection. The NHTSA proposal specified an impact only in the direction of the longitudinal centerline of the struck vehicle; it did not address angular impact. NHTSA's rear impact requirements are intended for the design of underride guards that will minimize impacts in occurrences where automobiles underride (i.e., slide under) the rear-end of large trucks and trailers. These requirements are intended to protect passenger occupants while RSPA's requirement for cargo tank rear-end protection is intended to prevent impacts to lading retention components that could result in the loss of hazardous material lading. Upon further review, RSPA agrees that requiring rear-end protection devices to withstand impacts at an angle of 30 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle is excessive. Therefore, paragraph (d)(3) is revised to reduce the angle of impact to 10 degrees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A requirement contained in current paragraph (d) of &sect;178.345&hyph;3 specifying design stress for accidents involving longitudinal deceleration is revised and moved to new paragraph 178.345&hyph;8(e) in this final rule. The specified design stress is based on the ultimate strength of the material with a factor of safety of 1.3 (i.e., the reciprocal of 0.75 times ultimate, rounded). The use of 2 ``g'' as a reasonable maximum level for longitudinal deceleration in accident situations generally has been accepted by industry but commenters have stated that the reliability of strain gauge testing and finite element analysis is questionable when structures are loaded above the yield point. For this reason, cargo tank manufacturers who choose to design at this level may use performance testing to prove that tank heads and shell can withstand this 2 ``g'' loading condition. Alternate analytical methods or combinations of test and analysis may be used if they are accurate and verifiable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 178.345&hyph;10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section specifies requirements for the pressure relief and vacuum systems on DOT 400-series cargo tank motor vehicles. It also specifies lading retention requirements for the pressure relief system in the event of an overturn. Numerous commenters suggested alternative provisions for pressure relief systems on DOT 400-series cargo tanks. Pressure relief valve manufacturers stated that they have found it very difficult to attain ``no loss of lading'' with valve designs capable of withstanding the characteristic dynamic pressure surge required by the regulation, especially at low design pressures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, commenters requested that RSPA allow the loss of one liter of lading. If adopted, a properly functioning pressure relief valve could be expected to release no more than one liter of hazardous material in an overturn accident. This amount of liquid would be so widely dispersed by the motion of the vehicle as to cause minimal danger of fire or environmental damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cargo tank shipments of poisonous-by-inhalation (PIH) materials in Hazard Zones A and B are subject to special provisions which result in high working pressures, thicker tank walls and thermal insulation. Insulation moderates thermal gain, thus increasing the pressure differential between valve pressure settings and dynamic pressure; also, it cushions the impact of accidents. The net effect of these features makes it unlikely that even small releases of PIH lading will occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

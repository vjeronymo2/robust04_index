			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stocks of base metals show remorseless growth RECESSION IN much of the industrialised world has brought remorseless growth in stocks of traded metals. With the exception of tin, all other major non-ferrous metal stocks in the hands of producers, consumers, traders and the London Stock Exchange, have doubled since the end of 1990. Figures released by the World Bureau of Metal Statistics show aluminium stocks up 2m to 4.15m tonnes at the end of June; copper stocks up from 692,000 to 1.246m tonnes; lead stocks up from 382,000 to 667,000 tonnes; nickel stocks up from 89,000 to 198,000 tonnes; and zinc stocks up from 567,000 to 1.207m tonnes. Tin stocks, which were at record levels after the collapse of a price support scheme in 1985, slipped from 39,000 tonnes at the end of 1990 to 31,000 tonnes in June this year. Nickel suffered the sharpest drop in output among the traded metals in the first half of this year, according to the bureau. Refined nickel output in the western world dropped by 8.1 per cent to 285,000 tonnes. Tin was also badly hit by lacklustre world economic activity and production was down by 6.9 per cent to 67,000 tonnes. However, despite aluminium prices being the lowest ever in real terms, output climbed by 1.8 per cent to 7.45m tonnes at a time when consumption was falling by 1 per cent to 7.688m tonnes. The statistics show clearly how lead and zinc mines cut back drastically in the face of low prices but smelters continued to keep producing refined metal at a relatively high rate. Mine output of lead was down 5.4 per cent but production of refined lead was up 1.4 per cent. Zinc mine output slipped 4.2 per cent but the refineries produced 0.6 per cent more slab zinc. The statistics give a confusing picture of the copper market by showing refined production at 4.487m tonnes, consumption at 4.747m tonnes, a deficit in east-west trade and a supply deficit of 323,000 tonnes. Yet total western world stocks have grown from just over 1m tonnes at the end of 1992 to 1.246m tonnes, which suggests a supply surplus - a better reflection of the market as most analyst see it. Behind this confusion is a lack of metals statistics from the Commonwealth of Independent States, a hang-over from the days when these were deemed to be state secrets, which continues to cause big headaches for analysts in the west. Metal imported to the west from the CIS can take months to appear on official statistics. It may be put in bonded warehouses and remain there for a long time before being cleared through customs. Mr Lloyd Davies, general manager of the WBMS, says that consumption data must also be treated with some caution since it is based on essentially incomplete trade statistics for European Community countries. This is a consequence of the introduction of the so-called Intrastat system of recording intra-EC trade, which is only now beginning to produce useful information.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          WESTERN WORLD SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION (THOUSAND TONNES)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1993       1992                1993        1992                    Jan-June   Jan-June            Jan-June    Jan June  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                               Nickel  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Supply                7,853      7,732  Supply         301        328 Consumption           7,688      7,765  Consumption    324        316  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copper                                  Tin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Supply                4,424      4,575  Supply          67         72 Consumption           4,747      4,597  Consumption     85         85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lead                                    Zinc  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Supply                2,233      2,214  Supply       2,800      2,798 Consumption           2,194      2,194  Consumption  2,664      2,712  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bureau of Metal Statistics.

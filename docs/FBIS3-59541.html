			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.R.: "Bull Undergoing General Reorganization"] </F>   [Text] Bull is casting its skin. At least from the  organizational standpoint. The group's new structure is built  around a new management committee that has been baptized the  "Bull Executive Board." It consists of 11 members, including  Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the new CEO [chief executive officer]  since the eviction of Bernard Pache last October. This Executive  Board has in turn formed an operations council -- the Bull  Operating Council --consisting of approximately 100 members. The  group's operations units are also reorganized. The Bull group  will now consist of seven major divisions, each financially  autonomous. These units will concern themselves with the  company's products (servers, open systems and softwares,  microcomputer systems), its services (integration of systems,  maintenance, and multivendor services), and its industrial  activities.    Through this reorganization, Bull clearly hopes to recover  financial equilibrium in 1994, thanks also to the support that  will be generated by its forthcoming recapitalization of 8.6  billion francs.    And thanks also to implementation of its staff-reduction and  assets-divestment plans. The first to be affected by these plans  will be its artificial intelligence activities and its in-house  printing activities.</p>

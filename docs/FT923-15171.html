			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y defaults on California payment OLYMPIA &amp; YORK is poised to abandon its role in the sprawling Yerba Buena commercial property development in San Francisco after defaulting on a crucial Dollars 2m payment that was due this week. In a separate development, Lazard Freres, the New York investment bank, was hired yesterday by O&amp;Y's US subsidiary to try to raise capital for the Canadian group's US operations. The San Francisco project was originally supposed to be O&amp;Y's next big showcase, involving a Dollars 1bn investment in three office blocks with 1.5m sq ft of space plus an entertainment complex. Six months ago, the troubled Canadian developer lost its rights to all but one of the office blocks because of missed payments. According to the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA), O&amp;Y has been given until the close of business next Tuesday to make good its Dollars 2m payment toward the purchase of land or lose all its rights as the developer of the site. The 750,000 sq ft office block that would be abandoned would have involved an investment of around Dollars 250m. Mr Edward Helfeld, director of the SFRA, said that if O&amp;Y failed to pay the Dollars 2m by next week his agency would collect a Dollars 4.4m letter of credit that is being held in escrow in New York. He said O&amp;Y could also forfeit the Dollars 20m of instalment payments it has made to the San Francisco agency since 1990 on the site. 'I find it very difficult to understand why they don't pay us the Dollars 2m, keep their rights and get another developer to take over the project,' said Mr Helfeld. O&amp;Y in New York said it believed the company would not make the Dollars 2m payment. 'The company is conserving cash and it is highly unlikely that we will make that payment,' a spokesman commented. The San Francisco default is not expected to force O&amp;Y's US subsidiary into a bankruptcy filing. The US subsidiary, which is holding debt restructuring talks with its creditors and is hoping to sell up to a dozen US office buildings to raise cash, has thus far avoided having to seek protection from creditors in a bankruptcy filing. Lazard Freres said its O&amp;Y team in the US would be led by Mr Felix Rohatyn. Mr Rohatyn who worked closely in the 1970s on the New York city financial crisis with Mr John Zuccotti, the chief executive of O&amp;Y's US operations who at the time was deputy mayor of New York. The last time O&amp;Y employed Lazard Freres was in the autumn of 1990, when it was retained to seek buyers for 20 per cent of the US property business. The deal did not occur. Among the top priorities for Lazard Freres will be the search for equity investors who could acquire a shareholding in O&amp;Y' US subsidiary. O&amp;Y is hoping to raise at least Dollars 100m by selling a minority stake to one or more investors.</p>

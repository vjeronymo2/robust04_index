			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> AMBITIOUS EXHIBITS DEMONSTRATE MOCA SPREADS ITSELF TOO THIN  </P> <P> The Museum of Contemporary Art presents a pair of exhibitions that try to do  too many things at once. The smaller -- and by far the more interesting -- is  "Selections from the Beatrice and Philip Gersh Collection." The big one is a  sprawling and only occasionally coherent shuffling of some 150 works from the  permanent collection called "Constructing a History." It would be more aptly  titled "Deconstructing History."  </P> <P> Both shows are housed in MOCA's California Plaza headquarters on Bunker Hill.  They derive graceful authority from architect Arta Isozaki's galleries and a  crisply professional installation. If the cosmetics are a hit, the content is  another matter.  </P> <P> The Gersh material stands up nicely. The couple are veteran Los Angeles art  patrons who have collected for some 30 years. She is a MOCA trustee and both  have been active at the old Pasadena Art Museum and the County Museum of Art.  They have donated and promised works to MOCA including a small Jackson Pollock  and Susan Rothenberg's spooky "Black Dress."  </P> <P> Their collection skips through the history of modern art from a small 1912  Kandinsky to Ed Rusha's recent "Picture H House" which represents his welcome  return to the use of images after a long siege of pure wordworks. The 45  examples (on view through March 11) admirably combine objects of unpretentious  domestic scale with a keen eye for excellence. Aside from a slightly  indifferent Frank Stella -- "The Whiteness of the Whale" -- virtually  everything is of museum quality. They also reveal a knack that museums often  funk in their quest for boffo impressiveness by the yard. The Gershes know how  to distill.  </P> <P> The most striking quality here is in the number of works so small as to  approach miniature scale while capturing the essence of the artist. Francis  Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" packs all his essential Pinteresque  vision of everyday horror into a canvas about one foot square. From 1963 -- the  period before Bacon started doing impersonations of himself -- it compresses  his talent for painting a face that vacillates between old-master solidity and  the scattered terror of a mind coming unglued.  </P> <P> The Gersh nose for condensation sniffs out the right stuff in everything from  Giacometti's poignantly dignified 23-inch "Bust of a Man" through de Kooning's  1949 pastel "Two Women" and on to Joel Shapiro's foot-tall bronze block-man. It  expands the surrounding gallery space into an immense hall where a cabinet-size  painting looks like a vast billboard. A very amusing and unusually good work by  Jenny Holzer sits nearby. It is a marble bench carved with ironic modern  truisms like "Government is a Burden on the People." Near the Shapiro it  becomes a marble temple.  </P> <P> It's a nourishing aesthetic experience only diluted by a barely disguised sense  of lurking mixed-motive. The Gersh collection is virtually enveloped by the art  from the permanent collection -- as if the museum can hardly wait to get its  hands on them. One can hardly blame the desire, but the symbolism of the  installation and the courtliness of the catalogue foreword sets one worrying  about matters unwelcome in the midst of an artistic experience -- of the  shrinking numbers of serious collectors and the vanishing breed of truly  philanthropic donors to public museums.  </P> <P> Then there is "Constructing a History" (to March 4). The general idea seems to  have been to put works in unusual juxtaposition so as to trigger unexpected  insights. The first space contains artworks by such disparate contemporaries as  Allen Ruppersberg, Julian Schnabel and Louise Lawler. The only insight to be  gained from the combo is that there sure is a lot of different stuff going on.  But we already knew that.  </P> <P> In the second gallery it appears that the idea was to put the art in roughly  chronological order, demonstrating the way MOCA's permanent collection is  slowly growing to be able to track the development of contemporary art. Here we  find classics by the likes of Miro, Gorky and Pollock followed by a room of  Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko and Lee Krasner leading to another  space full of minimalists.  </P> <P> Here we see the likes of Morris Louis and Jules Olitski. The odd man out is Ron  Davis represented by one of his back-painted geometric-illusion panels.  Presumably this was the work that was supposed to kick open the doors of  perception. All it does is cause us to remember that not every Davis is a  masterpiece.  </P> <P> A room of California light-and-space types such as Larry Bell, Robert Irwin and  Mary Corse is invaded by such contextual anomalies as Agnes Martin and Sherrie  Levine. The net effect is to remind us that when you combine such delicately  nuanced art it loses its subtle resonances and just looks thin, thin, thin.  </P> <P> The presentation carries on like this for some 15 tedious galleries.  Occasionally it works, as when Vito Acconci's cinder-block construction about  social repression is joined by Larry Clark's suite of drug-culture photos,  "Tulsa." We certainly knew that both artists have a subversive, outlaw quality  so it's not the information that's important, it's the poetry of the  combination. They rhyme, these guys.  </P> <P> There is a hasty quality to the exhibition as if -- unable to decide on theme  -- assistant curator Ann Goldstein just tried to present several at once. The  result is a patchwork of art trying to prove similarities where none exist and  papering over significant differences. But the main shortcoming here is trying  to do a visual version of a college-exam compare-and-contrast essay question  with works of radically different quality.  </P> <P> Fine things show up by the likes of Anselm Keifer, Jill Geigerich and Alexis  Smith, but there is too much fudging about probing the significance of art  whose main significance is that it's second-string work. Revelatory combination  is an important staple of curatorship but it only works to advantage when the  art is all about equally super. New York's Museum of Modern Art permanent  collection is smartly placed, but this is possible because the works are all  masterpieces.  </P> <P> "Constructing a History" seems to have been infected by MOCA's ever-clearer  leanings to spreading itself too thin. It lives under a veneer of activities  all of which are good in themselves. Good community relations are good, as are  good international relations. Good publicity is good. Design shows are good as  architecture, performance and radio broadcasts are good.  </P> <P> But a place that calls itself an art museum is by definition about a solid and  undistracted striving for excellence. As we move into the '90s, let's hope this  admirable young institution sets its priorities and pursues them with the  tenacity of a mountain climber.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Cabinet met in the Presidential Palace this  morning. It approved several bills on its agenda and referred  an urgent bill to the Chamber of Deputies to amend the salaries  of teaching staff at the Lebanese University.    Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz advised the Cabinet on the  content of a message he received from U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher warning against the resumption of violence in  south Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. The message considers  violence to be very dangerous and potentially harmful for the  peace process. We will now hear the Cabinet's resolutions as  announced by acting Information Minister Muhsin Dallul.    [Begin recording] [Dallul] Upon the invitation of Prime  Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, the Cabinet held its weekly session  this morning chaired by His Excellency President Ilyas  al-Hirawi. At the outset, his excellency spoke of the recent  crime perpetrated in Ba'labakk [killing of a woman and her two  sons by a young boy, who was later executed by Hizballah  according to Islamic shari'ah]  and the messages addressed to the government demanding that it  protect the Constitution. The prime minister said that the  justice minister did his duty as best he could and that the  Public Prosecution Office has been notified to apply the law.    Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz advised the Cabinet that he  received a message from the U.S. secretary of state warning  against a resumption of violence in south Lebanon and western  al-Biqa'. The message considers that an escalation of the  situation would be very serious and could harm the peace talks.  The message also said there is a need for self-restraint  because violence runs counter to the positive atmosphere that  prevailed at the Geneva summit conference. Christopher concluded  his message by saying the continuing military escalation can't  be accepted because it might torpedo the peace process.    In line with the justice minister's proposal, the crime of  the killing of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah has been  referred to the Judicial Council. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified Correspondent] What about the Lebanese stance  on the U.S. message? How will the government respond to the  Israeli escalation in the south?    [Dallul] The discussions at the Cabinet meeting noted that  it  is Israel that constantly escalates the situation, that the  fedayeen operation that targeted Israeli soldiers was carried  out in the border strip and on Lebanese territory, and that as  long the Israeli occupation continues, the government cannot  halt any Lebanese group that wants to confront the occupation by  any available means.    [Correspondent] How do you view the timing of the U.S.  message, especially as it coincides with talk about Israel  proposing to the Lebanese negotiating delegation in Washington  the formation of joint military committees?    [Dallul] We have rejected the formation of any committees  that do not stem from a program for Israeli withdrawal and we  hold on to this stance because we are dutybound to defend our  rights as people and as a homeland.    [Correspondent] Do you expect a large-scale Israeli military  operation?    [Dallul] We expect anything from Israel, but everything has  a  price. Israel will pay for any action it may take.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the General Labor  Federation?    [Dallul] No, no one proposed it.    [Correspondent] Did the prime minister brief you about [word  indistinct] meeting?    [Dallul] No.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] your request tasking the  Internal Security Forces with supervising soccer matches?    [Dallul] He rejected the request and insisted that the Army  continue this task.    [Correspondent] Given the Israeli threats and aggression in  the south, [words indistinct] the U.S. [words indistinct] to  stop resistance, what is the fate of the peace talks?    [Dallul] The peace talks will continue and as long as the  Israeli forces occupy Lebanon the resistance will continue.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust fined over derivatives Bankers Trust has agreed to pay Dollars 10m in fines to the US government to settle claims that it broke federal anti-fraud laws when it sold derivatives to a Cincinnati-based company, Gibson Greetings, which incurred Dollars 20m in paper losses on the derivatives. Although the New York-based bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the case, its settlement with two federal regulators - the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission - is the first time a big US bank has been fined for its activities in the fast-growing derivatives market, where a variety of companies in the US and overseas have lost large amounts of money this year. According to the settlement, Bankers Trust misrepresented the value of the derivatives when it first sold two derivatives products - both complex forms of interest rate swaps - to Gibson Greetings, and later provided the company with valuations which significantly understated the extent of the losses it faced on the derivatives. The value of the products dropped sharply in early 1994 after US interest rates rose. Yesterday, Bankers Trust attributed the misrepresentations to a single employee, who it said was no longer with the company. The agreement with regulators comes less than a month after the bank reached a separate settlement over a lawsuit brought by Gibson Greetings. Under that deal, Bankers Trust agreed to swallow Dollars 14m of the Dollars 20.2m in losses Gibson Greetings faced on the two derivatives contracts. The bank still faces a second derivatives-related lawsuit, filed by Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, which is seeking Dollars 130m and unspecified punitive damages over a single interest rate swap that went bad. Bankers Trust says it will defend itself vigorously against the P&amp;G lawsuit. Legislators in Washington, who this year have expressed growing concern about the largely unregulated derivatives market, welcomed the fines against Bankers Trust. Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, said the settlement sent 'a strong signal to Wall Street's derivatives traders that lying and cheating customers will not be tolerated.' He pledged legislative action to improve the oversight of derivatives dealers' activities.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND 3 LATIN NATIONS OK MILITARY ROLE IN DRUG WAR  </P> <P> The United States and the cocaine producing countries of Bolivia, Colombia and  Peru tentatively agreed Sunday to include military units from each country in a  stepped-up war on drugs.  </P> <P> However, South American delegates said the agreement leaves out any language  that might open the door to direct U.S. intervention in the fight.  </P> <P> The text of the plan will be kept secret until President Bush and at least two  of the South American presidents sign it at a drug summit Feb. 15 in Colombia,  officials said.  </P> <P> The agreement, reached early Sunday after a five-day preparatory meeting,  represents "an integral commitment by the four countries, which have proposed  carrying out a frontal and unstoppable assault on narcotics trafficking," said  Bolivian Foreign Minister Carlos Iturralde Ballivian.  </P> <P> He said the accord recognizes the need for more U.S. economic aid to the South  American countries, which in turn committed themselves to a full-fledged  military campaign against the multibillion-dollar cocaine industry.  </P> <P> "Until recently, we perhaps haven't wanted to accept the reality of narcotics  trafficking," Iturralde said. "We limited ourself to police action."  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the South American countries are committed to using "all  the means they have available," including the armed forces, in the war on  trafficking, he said.  </P> <P> His speech, which covered the agreement in general terms, concluded the meeting  at 4:30 a.m. Sunday, one day later than planned.  </P></p>

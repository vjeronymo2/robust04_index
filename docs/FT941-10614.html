			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Unemployed exceed 4m in Germany: East bears brunt of rise Unemployment in Germany climbed above 4m in January, with the eastern states bearing the brunt of the increase and western Germany recording its highest postwar jobless levels. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, said the figures, which compared with 3.69m unemployed in December, were dramatic. According to the Federal Labour Office, the combined unadjusted unemployment total in east and west Germany was 4.03m, comprising 2.74m in the west and 1.29m in the former Communist east. It cited seasonal factors and cuts in public spending on job creation schemes and short-time work for forcing more people on to the labour market. Mr Rexrodt, speaking at an economics conference, said: 'This unemployment figure is of a dimension which is not acceptable. It is not a surprise, but it is nonetheless dramatic. 'We must be aware that lasting high unemployment threatens not only our economic order but also the foundations of our society. We must devote all our efforts to averting this threat.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking at the same conference, said: 'We are not dealing with a normal recession but with structural problems which have been building up for too long. We need to rethink.' The official east German unemployment rate is put at 17 per cent. But the figures for the eastern states are not seasonally adjusted, unlike those in west Germany. Nor do official German figures include people on job creation schemes, short-time work, or in early retirement. The unofficial unemployment rate in the east is more than 35 per cent. In west Germany, the unemployment rate, based on unadjusted figures, climbed last month to 8.8 per cent compared with 8.1 per cent in December and 7.3 per cent in January 1993. This brings the total unadjusted figure to 2.74m, a rise of 220,000 over the previous month, but a slight decrease compared with the rise in January last year when 230,000 more people were added to the register. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in west Germany rose last month to 2.52m, a rise of 27,000 from the previous month, and a rise of 360,000 from January 1993. Economists said unemployment was expected to rise in coming months as short-time working and job creation schemes expired. In west Germany, short-time employment fell to 517,374 last month compared with 556,192 in December. In east Germany, short-time employment fell to 115,900, compared with 125,449. The figures confirmed repeated statements by government ministers that unemployment would continue to rise, despite more optimistic forecasts that the economy might grow by more than 1 per cent.</p>

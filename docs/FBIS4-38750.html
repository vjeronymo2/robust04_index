			<p>BFN     [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has introduced a  curfew for an indefinite period, beginning 22:00, June 1. The  curfew will be in effect from 22:00 until 5:00, Groznyy time.    On May 28, the Chechen Government introduced a curfew in  Grozny after an attempt on the president's life.    The republic's Commandant Sultan Geliskhanov told Interfax  on  Wednesday that the curfew had been introduced after Ingushetia's  Malgobek and Sunzhen regions were added to the  state-of-emergency zone in the region of the Ossetian-Ingush  conflict in accordance with Boris Yeltsin's decree, approved by  Russia's Federation Council.    On the one hand, part of the Malgobek and Sunzhen regions is  a zone of territorial dispute between Chechnya and Ingushetia,  and, on the other, Russian troops will find themselves in the  direct vicinity of the Chechen border, he said.    Geliskhanov, who is also head of the Chechen Security  Department, said that control over the observance of the curfew  would be exercised by the Chechen Interior Ministry and security  department. Special importance will be attached to the  confiscation of illegally kept weapons and ammunition.    Commenting on the sociopolitical situation in Chechnya,  Geliskhanov stated that "the forces which earlier tried to usurp  power, have stepped up their activity again." Hoping for  support from definite forces in Russia, the opposition is trying  to deprive the Chechen people of their last chance to build a  sovereign state, he said.</p>

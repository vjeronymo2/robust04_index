			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["It Seems to Me" column by Zhang Huimin: "Spectre of </F> Aggression Still Haunts Japan"]    [Text] The moment I heard the statements, I knew I had to  write something. But things happened too fast. Before I could  turn my rage into action the event had already receded into the  past.    Mr Shigeto Nagano's remarks on Japan's role and behaviour in  World War II were published in the news media last Wednesday.  He retracted his "inappropriate" comments on Friday. And then  he resigned as Japan's justice minister on Saturday.    Nagano is down and out and his case seems to have already  been forgotten.    But from a historical perspective, these comments must not  be  forgotten so soon. I know Nagano is not the first Japanese  politician in recent years to make such "inappropriate"  utterances regarding Japan's past, but I wonder if he will be  the last.    In 1894, Japan defeated China's Qing Dynasty and wrested  Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China. This marked the first  successful step of Japanese aggression against China in modern  times.    With the 20th century ushered in, Japan's aim to devour all  of China intensified and the methods diversified.    It imposed on a Chinese warlord then in power the Twenty-one  Demands, which reduced China to a de facto colony of Japan.  Then, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, it replaced  Germany's interests in Shandong Province after World War I. It  engineered the Jinan Incident slaughtering Chinese people in  Shandong to deter Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expeditionary Army  from pushing further north. And a bomb blast killed a warlord  who ruled northeast China when he got in their way.    In 1931, Japan conquered China's three northeast provinces  and set up the Machurian puppet regime; soon afterward, it  seized the then Jehol Province in north China.    In 1937, it launched a full-scale invasion of China. In  1941, it started the war in the Pacific with the bombing of  Pearl Harbour.    Finally, in 1945, after a half-century effort to repel  Japanese aggression, came Japan's unconditional surrender to the  Allied Nations. The fond dreams of the Japanese militarists for  world domination came to naught.    Their aggression brought untold misery to the victim  countries, killing millions upon millions of people. It also  grievously hurt the Japanese people themselves. Japan is the  only country in the world to have been hit by atomic bombs.    Mr Nagano, now 71, is well educated enough that he was  qualified to serve as Japan's justice minister.    He cannot be ignorant of his nation's past.    This being the case, any Japanese person with reason and  sense should be able to form an objective view of Japan's role  in Asia and the whole world in the first half of this century.    In 1972, when Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei came to  China to re-establish diplomatic ties, he said that Japan had  caused China trouble in the past, and for that, he was sorry.  Mild as the wording was, it was meant as an apology  nevertheless.    I remember resenting his understatement though I recognized  that he was the first Japanese leader to apologize to China.    Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is the Japanese  official who made the most candid and unbiased appraisal when he  admitted that the events in the 1930's and 1940's were "a war of  aggression and a wrong war." The apologies he made during  official tours of South Korea and China were the most sincere  and thorough any Japanese prime minister has ever made.    However, there is another crop of Japanese who still deny  their past even though it is almost 50 years since Japan's  aggression was completely defeated.    In the mid-1980's, a Japanese education minister had the  audacity to defend Japan's infamous record in World War II. He  won no open applause. Instead he evoked condemnation from the  former victim nations as well as his own countrymen.  Consequently, he too resigned dismally.    A few years later another cabinet member followed suit and  met with the same wretched fate. And when a Japanese minister  tried to whitewash the past by saying that the academic  definition of the aggression should be left to the future  historians, he was immediately trounced by angry critics.    The fact is that whenever a Japanese politician makes some  "inappropriate" remark on Japan's past, he is bound to meet with  indignant refutation at home and abroad.    Nagano claimed that the Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication.  Let me remind him about a fact which he, as an old man of 71,  must still remember.    Two young junior officers of the Japanese Army, on entering  Nanjing in the winter of 1937, competed with each other on who  would kill more Chinese civilians in one day. The result was  that each killed more than 100. A photo of the two standing  side by side with swords in their hands was published in the  most influential newspaper in Japan with the caption praising  the two as "heroes."    However, as the saying goes, the mills of God grind slowly,  and 10 years later, these two Japanese butchers received justice  in full measure in Nanjing. Ironically, the news report and the  photo, once in honour of them, became damning evidence against  them.    Mr Nagano, can you dismiss this as fabrication?    Nagano, as a shrewd politician, must have known what  response  his wild remarks would evoke. Nevertheless, he did not hesitate  to make them. This makes me suspect that this former member of  the Imperial Japanese Army is, from the bottom of his heart,  still nostalgic for the glories of Japanese militarism. He  simply could not contain the strong urge to vent his inner  feelings, whatever consequence his mouthing off would bring.    Strong pressure forced Nagano to retract his erratic  utterances and offer apologies in three day's time. This shows  how unpopular his behaviour was even in his own country.    But his retraction is only lip service meant for appeasement  so that he can get away. How can you expect to fundamentally  change in only three days' time the deep-seated ideas of a  politician?    The string of incidences simply indicates that the spectre  of  militarism still haunts some Japanese minds, especially the  older ones.    Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the Japanese have  conscientiously awakened to the inglorious past of their country.    When Nagano's behaviour aroused an uproar, Japan's new prime  minister, Tsutomu Hata, lost no time to make known his stand.  "Japan's past actions, including aggression and colonial rule,  caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people," he  said. He even pledged to communicate this solemn admission to  future generations to affirm "Japan's commitment to the path of  peace."    Only with this approach can Japan hope to win the respect of  the world community and cultivate true friendship with other  countries, including China.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega for the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of  the United People alliance, went to the San Fernando Hospital  for a drug test, which came out negative. Perez Balladares  stressed that if he wins the presidential elections, he will  implement a vigorous policy against drug trafficking.    [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I came for a drug test  because I think the Panamanian people have the right to demand  and to know whether their candidates are using chemical  substances. I also had a stress test because I think the next  president should have enough physical stamina and be in good  enough health to keep the promises made to the Panamanian people.    [Ortega] Could this be viewed as a prelude to your  government's policy against drugs?    [Perez Balladares] You can be sure that if I took the test,  I  will demand that everyone else do likewise.    [Ortega] How do you view this final stretch only a few days  before the elections?    [Perez Balladares] I am very pleased. Thankfully, I think it  has been a first-rate campaign during which we have not insulted  anyone but have proposed solutions. I honestly think it is going  to conclude on Sunday with a great civic festival for all  Panamanians. We are very happy and proud to have participated in  it.    [Ortega] Some say that the Cubans are giving you a hand in  this campaign?    [Perez Balladares] I think the party has already stated  clearly that this is a lie made up by political adversaries. Of  course, it is completely false, completely false. Our party  told the Justice and Peace Commission two or three weeks ago  that such a falsehood would be fabricated. They are holding the  documents that show this is a lie.    [Ortega] Why did you take the drug test? Have other  candidates done the same?    [Perez Balladares] I hope we all do it. I think it should be  done as a sign of respect for the Panamanian people so they can  be sure that none of us use any type of chemical substance. [end  recording]    Shortly before meeting with a group of international  observers at midday, Perez Balladares said today he will  announce the list of three attorneys from among whom he will  choose the new attorney general of the Republic if he is elected  president.    [Begin Balladares recording] I plan to keep my promise and  name three citizens from among whom I plan to select an attorney  general in January 1995. That is when the attorney general must  be appointed and his name sent to the Legislative Assembly. One  of those three citizens will be chosen to head the list. I will  ask the other two to be alternates. [end recording]    Perez Balladares could make this announcement tonight at  2100  in a speech to be aired over RPC Television.</p>

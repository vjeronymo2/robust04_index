			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "S. Africa Opens First China </F> Fair"]    [Text] South Africa's first commodity fair in China opened  yesterday in Beijing, marking a further step by the growing  African nation into the mainland market.    More than 300 South African business representatives are  attending the four-day event.    "The exhibition is a landmark of the strengthened relations  between the two countries," said David Graaff, South Africa's  deputy-minister of industry and trade.    Companies at the South Africa China Exhibition 1994 come  from  31 industries including South Africa's strongest sectors such as  mining equipment, electronics and jewellery.    Many South African big name companies such as Sasol, Iscor  Mining &amp; Steel Production, Saflec Electronics and Nampak are  seeking shares in China's flourishing industrial and commercial  market.    Graaff said he believes the exhibition "will make an  important contribution to bilateral trade relations by  stimulating more joint ventures, flow of investment and tourism."    Since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1992,  sound  trade ties have been achieved, he said.    Since then, bilateral trade volume has risen more than 30  percent to reach $658 million last year.    If trade through Hong Kong is included, the figure surpasses  $1 billion.    "China is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and  we  always take her as an important trading partner," said the  deputy-minister.    He added that South Africa will continue to enjoy ties with  China for years to come.    After years of isolation on the world market, South Africa  has become a strong economic power.    Fifty-five percent of the nation's gross national product  comes from international trade, 30 percent of which is generated  by exports.    China mainly imports minerals and exports light industry  products to the South African nation.    Besides being rich in mineral resources, South Africa also  produces construction equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The investigation into the suicide of Private  Leonardo Castro has led to the removal of Colonel Carlos Pinzon,  commandant of the Presidential Guard Battalion.    [Begin General Norberto Adrada, Army 13th Brigade commander,  recording] We have decided to relieve the colonel to allow a  smoother investigation, without any kind of obstacle.  Lieutenant Lozano was also moved, primarily to make the  investigation process a little easier. [end recording]    For the same reasons, Pinzon was not present for today's  change of command ceremonies. His future in the army is being  questioned.    [Begin Adrada recording] That is a decision the commander of  the Army must make. It is something we are evaluating, as you  know, because the investigations are continuing. The Army  commander will make the final decision. [end recording]    Regarding Ricardo Lozano, the 13th Brigade commander simply  said he had been transferred to a position similar to the one he  held when the tragic events occurred. The new commander of the  Presidential Guard is Colonel Jose Domingo Rubio, former  commander of the Military School.</p>

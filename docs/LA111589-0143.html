			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH ENDORSES HOUSE PLAN TO BOOST SALARIES, TIGHTEN ETHICS, FOLEY SAYS  </P> <P> President Bush will back a plan to raise salaries for members of Congress and  other top government officials by more than a third while tightening up ethics  rules, the Speaker of the House said today.  </P> <P> Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that agreement with the  Administration had been reached and that a statement from the President would  be released. White House officials confirmed that privately in advance of the  statement.  </P> <P> With the President's endorsement, House leaders formally unveiled their plan  and scheduled a vote Thursday.  </P> <P> The package would raise salaries from $89,500 to almost $125,000 in just over  13 months and impose new ethics rules on the amount and type of members'  outside income.  </P> <P> The plan would apply to top officials governmentwide, except for the Senate,  which was considering a separate ethics and pay package for itself.  </P> <P> The House package implements the pay raise in two stages. On Jan. 1, members  would get a 7.9% increase as a "cost-of-living" adjustment to make up for the  two years in which members did not receive raises.  </P> <P> In 1991, a 25% raise would take effect and the teeth of the ethics package  would kick in -- a ban on lawmakers padding their income with speech  honorariums and stricter limits on other outside income.  </P> <P> Currently, House members are allowed to keep honorariums up to 30% of their  income, Senate members up to 40%. The new rules would ban accepting honorariums  and limit other outside earned income to 15% of salary.  </P> <P> If Congress later votes to kill the pay raise, the ethics changes on outside  income would automatically be rescinded.  </P> <P> Other ethics changes in the bill include:  </P> <P>  -- Ending in 1993 the rule whereby House members elected before 1980 can  pocket their campaign treasuries when they retire from Congress. Some members  currently have more than $1 million stashed away.  </P> <P>  -- Increased detail of disclosure of personal wealth.  </P> <P> Currently, the top category is "$250,000 and above." The new forms would have  categories for "$250,000 to $500,000" and "greater than $1 million." Members  who have blind trusts for their assets would have to report the size of the  trust, in addition to the current requirement of reporting the income.  </P> <P>  -- Revised procedures for the House Ethics Committee, including expanding the  panel so that some members could investigate and others judge the results.  Currently, the whole panel does both.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, March 18 (AFP)--The Palestinian leadership  rejected Thursday [18 March] night a US proposal for a meeting  Sunday between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shimon Peres, a PLO official told AFP.    Samir Ghawshah, a member of the Palestine Liberation  Organisation's executive committee, said US envoy Dennis Ross  had made the suggestion in a telephone call to 'Arafat.    'Arafat has called for an "urgent" meeting of PLO leaders to  take stock of the situation after intense diplomatic activity  this past week.    The United States has been trying to persuade the PLO to  resume talks with Israel on implementing the historic accord on  limited Palestinian autonomy they signed in Washington last  September 13.    The PLO broke off negotiations after a Jewish settler gunned  down some 30 Muslim worshippers at prayer in the West Bank town  of Hebron on February 25.    'Arafat on Thursday also received messages from the Russian  and French governments, spoke by telephone with Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa and met with Norwegian Deputy Foreign  Minister Terje Larsen.    Ghawshah stressed that the PLO was sticking to its demand  for  "the adoption and application of a (United Nations) resolution  guaranteeing international protection" for Palestinians on the  Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.    The PLO leadership reiterated its conviction that Jewish  settlers should be removed from Hebron and that any renewed  negotiations focus on the status of Jewish settlements in the  territories.    "Our people can no longer trust American promises and will  never agree to continued negotiations in the present situation,"  Ghawshah said.    But he added that the PLO would draft its official position  following a UN Security Council meeting scheduled for Friday.    Ghawshah cited a Norwegian proposal under which joint  Israeli- Palestinian patrols, supervised by international  observers, would ensure security for the Palestinians.    But he said the idea had been turned down by Israel, which  would only accept the presence of observers from the  International Committee of the Red Cross.    [In an earlier, related report, Paris AFP in English at 2340  GMT on 17 March adds the following: "PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat  received a message Thursday from Russian leaders handed to him  by the Russian ambassador to Tunis Boris Shchiborin, the  Palestinian agency WAFA reported.    ["The contents of the message were not specified, but WAFA  said the two men discussed a UN proposal to provide protection  for Palestinians in the occupied territories.    ["WAFA said 'Arafat and Shchiborin discussed 'contacts made  to activate a decision by the UN Security Council concerning the  Hebron massacre.'    ["'Arafat also received a message from French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe expressing the 'solidarity and support' of  France, the current Security Council chairman."]</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Shoprite advances strongly to Pounds 1.04m A strong advance in half-year pre-tax profits, from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 1.04m, was reported by Shoprite Group, the Isle of Man-based grocery and vehicle retailer which has interests in property. The group is also proposing to pay a maiden interim dividend of 2p. The result for the six months to May 3 was achieved on turnover more than doubled from Pounds 18m to Pounds 37.7m. The profits figure is only slightly short of the outcome for the 1990-1991 year. Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman and managing director, said the Scottish expansion had been the main contributor to the improved results - Shoprite opened seven new stores there bringing the total to 18 at the period end. This growth was expected to continue as sufficient fur-ther sites had been identi-fied to meet the company's store opening plan for the next 18 months, Mr Nicholson added. Within this programme up to 17 stores could be opened in the second half. The interest charge fell slightly to Pounds 742,000 (Pounds 759,000). Net gearing stood at 51 per cent at the period end. Earnings surged to 6.3p a share against 1p last time.</p>

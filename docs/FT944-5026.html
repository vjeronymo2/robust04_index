			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Standing up to Japan's giants - How small companies are holding their own How does a small, family-run parts supplier protect itself from the whims of large, powerful customers on which it depends heavily for business? The question has haunted Akira Jimbo, president of Jimbo Seisa-kusho, as he has steered his small components manufacturing company through boom and bust over three decades. Jimbo Seisakusho, which specialises in the manufacture of small parts such as nuts and bolts for electric tools, line printers and medical equipment, is located in an industrial region west of Tokyo. The company employs about 25 people and delivers 80 per cent of its output to a Japanese maker of heavy electrical machinery. At a time when many small Japanese suppliers have seen business dry to a trickle in the country's sluggish economic environment, Jimbo has been so busy it has had to turn orders down. Growth in revenues has been in double digits this year, rising 30 per cent in August alone. The struggle to find a way to enable his company to stand on its own stems from the bitter experiences Jimbo has had with large customers over the years. The company has faced collapse twice in the past. 'We used to manufacture products in volume but during times of difficulty, our customers would tend to take these products in-house or competitors would undercut us,' Akira Jimbo explains. In today's high-yen environment many small Japanese suppliers are again losing business to their customers or lower-cost countries in Asia. 'Anything that can be made in China or other cheap countries is being taken away,' he laments. Jimbo also found that large customers often copied manufacturing techniques the company had developed through trial and error. This is a particular problem in Japan where relationships between suppliers and their customers are extremely close, making it difficult for small suppliers to stand up to large customers. 'In the past we used to rack our brains about how to make some products faster and better than others. But customers would send people over to look at what machines we used and how we had them developed and order exactly the same machines from the same companies which supplied us,' Akira Jimbo recalls. His solution has been to reduce dependence on mass production and concentrate on making things that other people cannot make. The company has discarded all its mass-production machines which were copied by its customers. Instead, it has developed expertise in producing very small nuts and bolts which others, including clients, find impossible to imitate. For example, it developed a method to make a nut for the Monju fast-breeder reactor that is just 2.4mm wide and 1.5mm thick and which has a screw inside that is cut at an angle. 'There aren't very many companies which can do this kind of work because it requires extreme precision,' Akira Jimbo says. The company's ability to produce such small parts stems from the use of digital computer techniques to program machinery and processes. Akira Jimbo's son, who trained as an engineer, is the programming brain behind the controls used. The expertise it has developed has meant customers seek the company out. It does not ask for work. 'When you go asking for work you have to offer a 10 per cent cut in prices. But if they come asking you, you can put 10 per cent on top of the going price,' Akira Jimbo says. With that advantage, the company has been able to follow a golden rule never to take on work that could be shifted overseas, and it no longer suffers from being copied by its clients either.</p>

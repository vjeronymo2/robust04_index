			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: MG Corp stops debt payment MG Corp, the US arm of Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and manufacturing group, has suspended debt payments to its banks and raised Dollars 300m in additional credit lines. The news suggests that MG Corp has come under growing financial pressure in recent weeks, even though Metallgesellschaft reached an agreement with its bankers at the group level last month which saved it from bankruptcy. MG Corp said it had been granted a 90-day moratorium on debt payments, intended to give it time to restructure its debts. In a brief statement, Mr Karl von der Heyden, chief executive, said: 'With this new facility, we are confident that we will have adequate liquidity and that we will reach agreement with the banks during the 90-day period on a long-term debt restructuring.' Some Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m, or two-thirds of MG Corp's total bank debt, is subject to the restructuring talks. The other third, which was owed to the group's bankers rather than those of the US subsidiary directly, will be converted to equity under the terms of last month's agreement, MG Corp said. MG Corp said the new facility provided by its bankers was not needed to finance additional losses in its oil trading business, but would support its normal business while talks were under way with banks. Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has called off its hostile takeover bid for International Musto Explorations, the Vancouver-based company which controls a prized copper and gold deposit in Argentina, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Metall said that it is withdrawing its proposed CDollars 232m (USDollars 172m) offer in view of an joint-venture agreement which Musto signed last week with MIM Holdings of Australia to develop the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit.</p>

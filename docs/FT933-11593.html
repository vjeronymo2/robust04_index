			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Stock speculator arrested in Tokyo JAPAN'S securities watchdog finally showed its teeth yesterday when prosecutors arrested a leading stock speculator and a finance company official for alleged stock price manipulation. It is the first time that investigations by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, set up in July last year, have led to a crackdown by the prosecutors on stock transactions. The Tokyo district public prosecutor's office arrested Mr Makoto Araya, a stock speculator, and a former executive of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, an unlisted financing subsidiary of Sumitomo Realty and Development. Mr Araya is suspected of ramping the stock price of Nihon Unisys, the 32 per cent owned Japanese affiliate of the US computer group, during 1990 and 1991, through loans totaling some Y55bn (Dollars 514m) from Mr Hiroshi Kimura, former senior managing director of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance. The SESC conducted a well publicised raid on the offices of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance last December, and claimed that Mr Araya used more than 10 accounts at 27 brokerages to trade Nihon Unisys stock. In May, the commission called for the indictment of Mr Araya and Mr Kimura for violating the Securities and Exchange Law. The commission, modelled on the US Securities and Exchange Commission, was set up after a spate of stock market scandals shocked investors, fuelling the fall on the Tokyo stock market. However, it has found it difficult to cultivate the image of an aggressive and independent watchdog, due to its closeness to the Finance Ministry, with which it shares a building and staff. On the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, fears that investigation by the prosecutors may spread to Sumitomo Realty and Development depressed its share price, which fell Y14 to Y706.</p>

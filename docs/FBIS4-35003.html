			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luis Acevedo Pesquera] </F>   [Text] The political events of the past five and a half  months of the final year of the current presidential term have  made the vulnerability of and lack of confidence in the Mexican  economic program obvious to local and foreign investors.    According to data provided by the SHCP [Finance and Public  Credit Secretariat], the INEGI [National Institute of  Statistics, Geography, and Information Science], the Bank of  Mexico, and private consulting companies, the federal government  will support the awaited economic takeoff by reprogramming  public expenditures for the rest of 1994.    Reaching satisfactory statistical levels with export  revenues  has also being taken into account, although this mechanism has  created something of a paradox, because the economic opening, by  replacing consumer expenditures, has failed to remove the  obstacles that impede domestic production and job creation.    Authorities believe that domestic supply and demand will  improve by year end thanks to a combination of these two  factors; namely, current public expenditures, estimated at "to  what prudence dictates," and revenues from exports.    To that effect, the GDP is expected, statistically speaking,  to reach an annual growth rate of 1.0 to 1.9 percent. That is  the best case scenario.    But even if the economic recovery were to reach the best  estimates for the whole year, the population's demand for jobs  would still not be met and would increase the government's  social debt that has accrued throughout the current presidential  term.    According to these sources, the reorganization of  expenditures and export revenues, in theory, would achieve the  ultimate goal of formally reviving the basic indicators: supply  and demand. Abel Hibert, an analyst for Vector Brokerage House,  says that statistically speaking, this recovery is important  because the two indicators represent 80 percent of GDP.    The analyst added that based on the gap in which public  spending growth multipliers operate, it is conceivable that "the  national economy will grow at reasonable rates" beginning in the  fourth quarter of the year. This will be possible insofar as  the best possible scenario includes complete political stability.    Despite the sectorial heterogeneity, official reports on  the first semester of 1994 indicate that the economic  deceleration has already reached its lowest point.  Nevertheless, the reactivation strategy adopted at the  beginning of the year has yielded none of the expected results.  Domestic consumption has stagnated, the strongest evidence of  which is the commercialization of durable goods. Domestic sales  in the automotive industry dropped 11.1 percent from January to  April, a situation that has continued since the third quarter of  1993.    The outlook is no better for nondurable goods. Perhaps the  situation has been aggravated by imported goods, which divert  consumer preferences and lead to serious contradictions in local  production by swelling inventories and deterring productive  investment.    Speaking of investment, preliminary SHCP and INEGI reports  show that a considerable number of the projects announced late  in 1993 -- all except those of the country's biggest and most  profitable enterprises -- were postponed indefinitely.    The construction industry, a sector that more accurately  represents investment, achieved 4.5 percent growth at the close  of the first quarter, mainly as the result of the construction  of petrochemical plants, highways, and public projects, but  clearly not because of the construction of public sector  projects.    The Construction Industry Chamber said the sector  experienced  a significant drop in the four-month period, resulting in the  unemployment of 58 percent of its members.    The investment sector was further weakened by the fact that  although steel production increased 11.3 percent until April,  cement production barely increased to 4.5 percent, a figure  lower than the 6.5 percent registered during the last quarter of  1993 and the first quarter of 1994.    "A high degree of consumer debt, increased unemployment, a  lack of job security, macroeconomic uncertainties, and higher  interest rates have combined forces to postpone purchases of  durable goods," Hibert pointed out.    A similar situation is unfolding in the field of investment.  SCHP sources have admitted that the vicious circle of scant  demand and reduced investment leads to lower supply and,  consequently, stagnation.    The public expenditure reorganization, which, particularly  in  view of the Chiapas crisis, had been regarded along with the  external sector as a catalyst for immediate growth, has not  yielded the desired results even though the deterioration of the  main economic indicators has stopped.    The conditions do not currently exist to attain the growth,  consumption, and investment objectives presented to Congress in  the economic program. What is worse, we must now add to this  situation the authorities' decision to tighten restrictions on  the handling of money with the purpose of checking exchange and  financial pressures.    The method used during the first half of the year will  continue until late into the six-year term as the result of both  poor domestic demand and the prevailing instability. This will  make it possible for the new government to begin its  administration with rising rates, as has happened in the  previous three administrations.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Arts: Key political dramas on the post-war stage - German Theatre The warnings are strident, unmistakeable, and up-to-date. Everyone has his price, and anyone, by refusing to face the truth, can let an evil regime like Hitler's spring up under his nose. For nearly 40 years, Frederich Durrenmatt's The Visit (1956) and Max Frisch's The Fireraiser (1958), have reigned unchallenged as the key political dramas on Germany's post-war stage. Now, in the country's greatest turmoil since the war, they have acquired a new, mythic currency, and are among the most popular modern works in the repertory. Both are short, devastatingly simple parable plays which bowl you over the first time but hold no later subtleties. I caught two new versions, in Dusseldorf and Berlin, which stand as the best of straight, hard-hitting theatre: strong acting, hypnotically intense setting, comic diversity. In The Fireraiser ('Biedermann und die Brandstifter'), two terrorists infiltrate the home of rich business-man Biedermann and stack petrol in the roof to blow him up. Biedermann ('honest man') pretends not to see what is happening and relies on good-natured civility to keep menace at bay. He invites the fireraisers to dinner, offers nervous friendship, and at last hands them the matches to light the fire. On a tiny stage in Dusseldorf, Peter Arens plays it as theatre of the absurd with a heart. Eckart Dux's Biedermann, floppy grey hair, cardigan and specs, is par excellence the bourgeois liberal secure at home. 'I'm a free man, I can think what I want,' he explodes to a suspicious fireman as petrol cans, wires, fuses, proliferate round his gemutlich house. The fireraisers, Ulrich von Bock a smooth entrepreneur, Claus Stahnke a skinhead in punk gear, are 1990s types who could fit into any race riot recently on German television screens. They are a comic duo - one gives a Nazi salute, the other slaps him down with an apologetic laugh. The ease with which these boors play at civilised living - admiring the Beaujolais while gulping mustard neat from the jar - threatens the core of Biedermann's cosy worldview. Dux and his wife (Margrit Ensinger), a loving but weak couple, tread with comic genius the line between paranoia and a self-deceiving attempt at normality. When the fireraisers put on a post-prandial performance of Everyman she reassures herself by recalling the Salzburg Festival. Then they stand clasped, knowing their doom, as the chorus 'Everyman' changes to 'Biedermann'. For all the absurdity, a lyric finale, recited by a fireman while giant statues of fireman glow all round the auditorium, is almost unbearably moving. In The Visit ('Der Besuch der alten Dames'), the shopkeeper Herr Ill is Everyman. To his little town of Gullen, a poverty-stricken place with a railway station in central Europe, returns his former lover, now a rich old lady. Years back, he got her pregnant and rejected her. Now she offers his fellow citizens a thousand million marks for their town as the price of his head. We, and Ill, know that he will die, and in Berlin Ekkehard Schall gives a performance at once passionate and measured. His Ill, first a frightened wretch who trembles, paces up and down his shop in frenzy shouting, by the end acquires dignity as a tragic hero, resigned and low-spoken. As the creepy old lady, Anneliese Romer becomes less and less dignified, although she too has her moment of poignancy. She tells her roving lover that she has a tomb ready for him at her palace in Capri: 'There you will stay. With me.' The Schiller Theatre shoots the fable through with psychological interest, but mostly, with its flair for dramatic design, goes for symbolic staging. Romer is now in a black robe, harbinger of death, now in a white gown, eternal bride. As she endows the town, the grey-green pallor of a bleak set yields to richer colours. Alfred Kirchner directs at a fierce pace, and throughout the contemporary resonance sounds: is the new united Germany selling ethics for material security? Two evenings as compelling as any in the theatre this year. And if art reflects life, this piece and The Fireraisers show a Germany obsessed with itself, its history and its moral and political future. The Fireraisers, Dusseldorf Kammerspiele. The Visit, in rep at the Schlosspark Theatre, Berlin</p>

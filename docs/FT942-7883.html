			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Call to improve aid programmes: Report criticises assistance 'tied' to purchases from donor countries An independent evaluation of international aid published yesterday sharply criticises tied aid, expresses concern that donors are failing to meet commitments to increase assistance, and says only 6.5 per cent of aid is spent on meeting the needs of the poorest. Official development assistance (ODA) worth Dollars 60.4bn (Pounds 40bn) represented just over a third of the net flow of resources from the countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to developing countries in 1992, said the report, The Reality of Aid. Aid flows were critical in sub-Saharan Africa, where aid averages more than 13 per cent of gross national product. The study, published by the London-based charity Actionaid, was edited by Development Initiatives, an independent consultancy specialising in aid and development policy. The era of slowly growing aid is coming to an end, says the report, with the increase in real terms in aid from DAC donors of only 0.5 per cent between 1991 and 1992. The share of humanitarian relief and peacekeeping has gone up from 2.3 per cent in 1988 to more than 7 per cent in 1991. Business interests are becoming more assertive and their influence in the shape of aid and the countries it goes to appears to be increasing. This is not being matched by any coherent attempt to serve the needs of the poor. However, the report notes that DAC measures introduced in 1992 to improve the quality of tied aid 'appear to be increasing accountability and having some impact'. Around Dollars 15bn each year has been tied to the purchase of goods and services from individual DAC members, says the report. In 1991 this rose to nearly Dollars 18bn. 'This results in developing countries paying above the market rate,' says the report, adding that estimates vary between 10 and 20 per cent. 'This excess price is a direct subsidy to exporters in OECD countries amounting to more than Dollars 2bn a year - nearly 4 per cent of DAC aid.' The volume of untied aid is unduly inflated by relief for bad debts arising out of export credit agreements which have originated from export promotion for domestic industry - Dollars 1.3bn in 1991 or 2.2 per cent of total ODA. The aid available for sustainable development is being hit by a combination of declining public expenditure budgets in the OECD and the increasing use of ODA to meet costs formerly borne by other government departments. The costs of asylum seekers and forgiveness for bad debts arising from commercial export credits accounted for 5 per cent of total ODA in 1992, it says. Public suport still far outstrips criticism of aid and its effectiveness, the report adds, 'and the universal picture of aid fatigue is not borne out by opinion poills which continue to show that public support is founded on humanitarian concern'.

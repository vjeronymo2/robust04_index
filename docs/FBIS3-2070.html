"The Key Technologies for Our National Economic Development  in the 1990's" is a guiding policy document. Through this  document, the state -- proceeding from the overall needs of  national economic development -- would make full use of the role  of planning as well as the market as a means of regulation;  guide along scientific and technological capabilities throughout  the nation; put together human, material, and financial  resources at the central and local levels; and bring into play  the initiative of all quarters to emphatically solve a number of  major scientific and technological problems closely related to  national economic development, so as to promote readjustment of  the industrial structure and push on the optimization and  upgrading of the industrial structure.    "The Key Technologies for Our National Economic Development  in the 1990's" announced this time comprise mainly those in the  following categories: 1. Agriculture: involving two kinds of  technologies, including crop breeding and comprehensively  tackling problems at moderate- and low-yield areas; 2. Energy  and the environment: involving five kinds of technologies,  including low- temperature nuclear heating, tertiary oil  recovery, coal cleaning and utilization, and other technologies;  3. Transportation: involving three kinds of technologies,  including high-speed railway transportation, high-grade  highways, and inland river shipping; 4. Raw materials and  resources: involving seven kinds of technologies, including the  continuous casting and rolling of thin sheets and billets [bo  ban bei lian zhu lian zha 5631 2647 0999 6647 6999 6647 6509],  iron-smelting using oxygen and coal, deep processing and  compounding of heavy oil, engineering plastics, plastic alloys,  and others technologies; 5. Information and communications:  involving nine kinds of technologies, including integrated  circuits, computers, software, optic-fiber communications, and  other technologiges; 6. Manufacturing: including numerical  control technology, laser technology, technology for  manufacturing large sets of thermoelectric generating equipment,  and five other kinds of technologies; 7. Biotechnology:  involving six kinds of technologies including genetic  engineering for animals and plants, cross-breeding fibroma [za  jiao liu 7177 0074 4058] technology, industrial microbiological  technology, protein engineering, and other technologies.</p>

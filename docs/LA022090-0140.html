			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NOLAN RYAN'S SON PICKS TEXAS U.  </P> <P> Reid Ryan, son of major league strikeout leader Nolan Ryan, is one of four high  school baseball players who have chosen to attend the University of Texas.  </P> <P> Ryan, a 6-foot, 170-pound right-hander, has an 86-m.p.h. fastball, a drop-off  from the 98-m.p.h. fastball his 43-year-old father throws, but is said to have  a good change-up and breaking pitches.  </P> <P> "People expect you to be the same as your father," Reid Ryan said. "I don't  think I'll ever be like my dad, but I try to copy him. I'd like to pitch until  I'm 43."  </P> <P> Nolan Ryan, with the Texas Rangers, said the Longhorns also offered him a  scholarship when he was a high school senior in his hometown of Alvin. But he  said his son is "overall a better athlete than me. He's developed as a pitcher.  I just don't think he's shown as much velocity at his age."  </P></p>

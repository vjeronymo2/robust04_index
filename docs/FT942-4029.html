			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Credit shake-up urged - A look at OFT proposals to give consumers a better deal New proposals by the Office of Fair Trading this week aim to simplify the way that interest rates for credit, including mortgages, are quoted and advertised. They also aim to give consumers a fairer deal if they repay loans early. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, announced a 'spring clean' of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act so as to make consumer protection rules relevant to present market conditions and get rid of unnecessarily complicated regulation. Central to his review was the question of annual percentage rates - APRs - which are required by law to be shown for any form of credit. The APR calculation involves such items as the actual interest rate, the way it is applied, the timing of payments, all charges, and compulsory insurance. This produces a single figure by which to compare different credit offers. So, if one type of credit has a relatively high interest rate while another has lower rates but high fixed charges, consumers can see which one actually costs them less. A survey by the OFT found that although few people had a very clear understanding of what an APR actually was, most of them understood that a lower APR generally meant a better credit deal. The review proposed some changes. These are: The three different methods of calculating APRs, as allowed in the 1980 Consumer Credit Regulations, should be reduced to one in line with an EC directive on consumer credit. APRs on all forms of 'running account' credit, such as credit and store cards, should be based solely on interest rates, with fixed fees listed separately. This should reduce the distorting effect of annual fees, which have a smaller impact the more you spend on a card. It will, however, mean that comparing the cost of credit cards with other forms of credit will be more difficult. Credit card and store card APRs should assume an average outstanding balance of Pounds 500, rather than Pounds 1,000 as now. Two APRs should be listed for mortgages with an initial fixed or discounted rate: one based on the initial rate and one, less prominently, based on the lender's variable rate, to which the mortgage reverts when the special rate runs out. At present, lenders are allowed only to quote an APR based on the initial rate, which might last for as little as one year. APRs need not be given for credit deals under Pounds 150, and should be replaced by precise information on repayments. The upper limit for credit agreements regulated by the Consumer Credit Act should be increased to Pounds 25,000 from Pounds 15,000, and the lower limit should be increased to Pounds 150. Another important change suggested was that the calculation of early settlement costs should be made more equitable to borrowers, and it should be made clear at the outset what the penalties were. An OFT survey found that many borrowers were not aware there could be substantial penalties for repaying loans early. Those quizzed felt the level of penalties often was unjust. Sir Bryan also called for greater 'transparency and choice' for home-buyers who often are pushed into packaged mortgages where the loan is tied to an endowment, sickness and redundancy insurance, or buildings and contents insurance. Sir Bryan said: 'There are clearly considerable pressures upon some consumers to take tied-in services without their being able in practice to assess the value of those services by shopping around.' He did not rule out the possibility that some unscrupulous lenders were bamboozling borrowers deliberately with unnecessarily complicated explanations. Sir Bryan said lenders should provide clear information at an early stage on what the mortgage package involved, and what the options were. But the Consumers' Association pointed out that this would apply to only half the market: mortgages arranged directly with the lender would be covered, but not those arranged through intermediaries such as estate agents or mortgage brokers. The advertising of credit will also change if the OFT proposals are implemented. The acres of small print at the bottom of newspaper advertisements may shrink a little, to be replaced by clear information on the most important points in readable type. And we may no longer get the message: 'Your home is at risk if you do not keep up payments on a mortgage or other loan secured on it' tacked on to the end of radio advertisements, or running along the bottom of the screen in tiny print on television advertisements. Sir Bryan said that awareness of this message and what it meant was, generally, wide. He felt that the transient nature of broadcast advertisements made it irrelevant, but that it should stay for printed advertisements.</p>

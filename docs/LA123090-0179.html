			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN ARABIAN NIGHTMARE ENDS FOR AIRMAN  </P> <P> Some wanted war to break out, others just want it to be resolved peacefully.  (For me), it was just whatever would get me out of there. . . . The waiting,  that was the fear; the war wasn't really a fear. . . . Not knowing when you're  going to go home, not knowing when anything's going to happen, that was the  fear.  </P> <P>  -- James Erlick, 48th Tactical Fighting Unit airman  </P> <P> All of 21, Jim Erlick sounds as if he could be auditioning for a part in the  next flyboy recruiting commercial. Glowingly, he speaks of traveling to distant  lands, learning a trade, serving as electronics trouble-shooter for the F-111  bomber, all opportunities offered by the Air Force.  </P> <P> "Oh, I've definitely enjoyed it," he says of his ongoing military service, his  voice falling flat, "up until the last three months."  </P> <P> The last three months. For the graduate of Fullerton's Sonora High School, they  were alternately "a nightmare" and "an eye-opener."  </P> <P> For his mother, Pauline, they were "three of the most miserable months of my  life."  </P> <P> Jim Erlick has spent the last three months in Saudi Arabia, maintaining and  fixing the electronic tracking systems of the two-seat bombers that may have to  drop their payloads on Iraqi targets. Through some fortunate military  scheduling, his temporary assignment with his tactical unit out of Lakenheath,  England, ended earlier this month, so now he is home in Fullerton for the  holidays. Then he'll be off to a new assignment in Utah in February.  </P> <P> The airman is one of a handful of military personnel from Orange County who  have served a stint in Saudi Arabia and already returned. Like most of them,  Erlick is hoping that he will never have to go back.  </P> <P> He never saw any of the scorpions and lizards that are lore among GIs in Saudi  Arabia. But Erlick says there were enough other downsides to his stay there to  ensure that he will not be booking vacation flights to the Persian Gulf soon.  </P> <P> Sandstorms. The endless sea of sandy terrain, virtually devoid of vegetation.  The dry, 110-degree daytime heat. The 12-hour work shifts to prep the F-111,  starting at 6 p.m. Sleeping on the floor of the air shelter his first few  nights there.  </P> <P> Worst of all was the boredom.  </P> <P> "The boredom was the toughest part -- not knowing when anything is going to  happen," Erlick says. "Basically, you're just sitting around; no alcohol, no  women. It's just monotonous. . . . I couldn't party, couldn't go out and do  things."  </P> <P> The lifestyle got better over his three months, Erlick says; by the end, his  base was even known by other units -- some of which stay in tents out on the  sand -- as the Club Med of the Air Force.  </P> <P> The base had a chow hall with a choice of spaghetti, dried fruit, punch mix and  about a dozen selections in all. Some men still preferred Meals Ready to Eat  rations.  </P> <P> A base exchange for purchases was set up. And the airmen even got a TV and  videocassette recorder; "Mississippi Burning" was a base favorite.  </P> <P> Yellow balloons inside and out of the Erlicks' Fullerton home marked his Dec.  20 return from England. It will be a nice holiday, all say. Erlick plans to  relax mostly, see some friends, travel a little -- and look into colleges.  </P> <P> He is getting out of the Air Force in a year or so and wants to go back to  school, thanks in part to the "eye-opening" experience of Saudi Arabia. He says  he will not miss much about the service, except some friends left behind.  </P> <P> He never did get a chance to see the scorpions, but Erlick's not complaining;  he missed a possible war.  </P></p>

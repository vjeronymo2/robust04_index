			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: PARTY HAS AN OSCAR STATE OF MIND  </P> <P> The Scene: A pre-Oscar party Sunday night at L'Orangerie restaurant; its sole  intent was to provide Hollywood executives, actors, insiders, columnists, and,  yes, nominees one more opportunity to prognosticate and pontificate on Monday  night's outcome. No speeches. No honoree. Harry Winston jewelers and Relais  &amp; Chateaux, the international restaurant and hotel directory, just wanted  to throw a party.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Oscar shoptalk. Shoe-ins. Party overload. The ongoing enigma of How  Academy Members Think. Companies that close early on Oscar Monday so people can  go home and watch the arrivals on television.  </P> <P> Overheard: "I voted for you."  </P> <P> Quoted: By nominee Ron Kovic (adapted screenplay, "Born on the Fourth of  July"), "My mother and father are driving all the way from Yuma, Ariz., in  their motor home. At the last minute they decided they wanted to come."  </P> <P> Noted: By nominee Martin Landau (supporting actor, "Crimes and Misdemeanors"),  who recently returned from the Berlin Film Festival, on the response to his  film there, "East Berliners loved it. The laughs came when they were supposed  to -- no difference from a New York audience."  </P> <P> Who Was There: Nominee Oliver Stone (director, adapted screenplay, "Born on the  Fourth of July"), Army and Selma Archerd, Maurice Jarre, Maximilian Schell and  Natalya Andrechenko Siberiade, Michael Caine, Roger Moore, Irving and Mary  Lazar, Jose Eber, Jackie Collins, Marvin and Barbara Davis with daughter Patty  Raynes, Jack Valenti, Robert Wagner and Jill St. John, Jaclyn Smith, Leonard  and Wendy Goldberg, Freddie Fields, Al and Wanda Ruddy, Robert and Rosemarie  Stack, and L'Orangerie owners Gerard and Virginie Ferry.  </P> <P> Dress Code: Tuxedos for the men (the sole exceptions were Kovic, in sports  jacket, and Stone, who wore white athletic shoes with a dark suit); materials  that twinkled for the women including the dazzling diamonds worn by the Harry  Winston contingent.  </P> <P> Chow: Smoked sturgeon and salmon with chanterelles and basil, lamb loin with  ginger and mint, pear tart with candied ice cream and petit fours, all washed  down with Dom Perignon.  </P> <P> Planning ahead: The indefatigably sociable Jayne and Henry Berger will stay  home in their robes and watch the Oscars on TV -- starting off with caviar,  followed by hot dogs, hamburgers and chili, all prepared by their French chef.  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Compulsory purchase fear halts Cammell Laird bid The bid by Coastline Industries to buy the Cammell Laird shipyard at Birkenhead, Merseyside, has been put on hold after worries about whether the site might be compulsorily purchased and government failure to provide a Pounds 2m derelict grant. VSEL, the Barrow nuclear submarine builder which owns the yard, had given Coastline until today to complete the deal or withdraw. VSEL says the deal is now off, although Coastline's advisers yesterday made clear it has not been abandoned. Coastline, a ship repair company, wants to buy the all-weather construction hall, three dry docks and a wet basin. It is already leasing the facilities, with 600 people employed. It plans to expand the workforce to 1,600 by the end of next year. VSEL's deadline, however, seems to have made it impossible to tie up loose ends with Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency with planning authority over the site. Mr John Stafford, Coastline's chief executive, wanted guarantees against future compulsory purchase and a Pounds 2m derelict land grant for environmental improvements. Without certainty of these, he was not prepared to take the risk of purchase. Compulsory purchase is an issue because Coastline was not trying to buy the whole site - only the shipbuilding and ship repair facilities. Mr Chris Farrow, corporation chief executive, said it was unlikely that working shipbuilding and repair facilities would be sought for purchase.</p>

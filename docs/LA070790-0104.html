			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIONDI, EVANS GET VICTORIES BUT DON'T THREATEN RECORDS  </P> <P> Two 1988 U.S. Olympic heroes won events Friday in the opening day of the Santa  Clara International Swim Meet, but their times were well off world and American  records.  </P> <P> Matt Biondi, of Castro Valley, Calif., who won seven medals in Seoul, held off  Bart Pippenger of Kamiah, Idaho, who was competing for the Las Vegas Gold, to  win the men's 100-meter butterfly.  </P> <P> Biondi was clocked in 56.06 seconds, which didn't threaten Pablo Morales' world  and American standard of 52.84 seconds.  </P> <P> Triple gold-medal winner Janet Evans of Placentia, who attends Stanford  University, bested Michelle Von Notze of Australia in the women's 400-meter  individual medley. She finished in 4:57.13, nearly 20 seconds slower than her  American record of 4:37.76.  </P> <P> None of the other six individual winners in the first day of the three-day meet  came close to the record books either.  </P></p>

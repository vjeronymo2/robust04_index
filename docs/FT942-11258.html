			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Observer: Mint condition? The Royal Mint has made a bit of an ass of itself - and produced a mule. In addition to the Pounds 2 base metal coins being struck to commemorate the Bank of England's tercentenary, the Mint decided to produce a limited edition of one thousand 22 carat gold coins. About 800 had already been dispatched when one eagle-eyed numismatist noticed that the design on the front of the coin differed from that in the marketing literature. It lacked the crucial 'Two pounds' legend under the Queen's head. Apparently the die for a double sovereign (confusingly also worth two pounds, but which has St George and the dragon on the reverse) had been paired with the (correct) reverse of the special Bank commemorative design. Ergo, a mule, which is two incorrectly associated dies - and a rare enough event to get coin collectors pretty excited. The Mint would like the duff ones back. Sadly, the fact that they are not legal tender is hardly going to bother the punters, who paid Pounds 295 apiece for their now distinctly more curious curiosities.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / EC 'social dialogue' underlines divisions EUROPEAN employers and trade unions yesterday failed to reach a breakthrough in talks on bolstering European competitiveness, but both sides agreed to co-operation in order to narrow differences and overcome mutual suspicion. The annual 'social dialogue' summit in Brussels between employers' representatives and trade unions was billed as a step towards achieving a consensus on why Europe is failing to create jobs at the same rates as the US and Japan. But both sides were reluctant to commit themselves to a joint position on how to reconcile the EC's need to improve job creation with the preservation of the welfare state. Mr Norman Willis, president of the ETUC, made clear that his priority was to safeguard social benefits and to tackle the recession. Mr Carlos Ferrer, president of Unice, the employers' federation, stressed the need for new models to tackle mass unemployment. Before the meeting, employers asked Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, to refrain from a direct call for a European-wide social pact as widely advertised in the run-up to the summit. Mr Delors agreed, but later made no secret of his interest in the idea. The Commission president said the EC was in danger of becoming simply an 'economic space', marked by a lack of solidarity and a lack of political direction. He believed that a tripartite pact between governments, employers and trade unions on the lines of similar agreements on the continent could be a 'fantastic idea'. Unions and employers agreed to set up a committee on competitiveness to study how to improve European job creation. The two sides will make some joint submissions for Mr Delors's White Paper on competitiveness. They reserved the right to make separate reports before the EC summit in December in Brussels.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: New openings behind Harry Ramsden's rise OPENING NEW branches helped Harry Ramsden's, the Yorkshire-based fish and chip restaurant operator, increase interim pre-tax profits by 14 per cent, from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 88,000. Turnover rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.24m in the six months to March 28, reflecting November's successful openings in Manchester and Tyneside. The group last week opened a new outlet in Edinburgh and will operate from one in Birmingham next month. It will then have nine branches, including one in Hong Kong. Mr John Barnes, chairman, said sales at the original restaurant at Guiseley, near Leeds, were 18 per cent ahead of last year. He was encouraged that opening new branches had increased, rather than diminished, the attraction of the first restaurant, which opened 63 years ago and has long been a shrine to lovers of fish and chips. Harry Ramsden's was determined not to open more than 20 branches in the UK, so as not to dilute the brand's image. Mr Barnes said: 'There was a real sense of occasion in Edinburgh last week, with people travelling from far afield, and we don't want to lose that.' Nonetheless, more openings were planned next year, on a joint venture and franchise basis. Partners subscribe from 60 to 80 per cent of the investment in a new outlet, share profits on the same basis, and pay royalties equivalent to 7 per cent of turnover. Internationally, the new restaurant in Hong Kong was the pilot for expansion in the Pacific Rim. Although that had not yet moved into profit, sales were, encouragingly, on a par with the UK restaurants. A franchisee had been recruited in Singapore and negotiations were under way in Australia. In the Middle East a site search by a partner was expected to lead to an opening next year at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Despite providing restaurants with uniformed waitresses and chandeliers, Mr Barnes said expenditure per head in the UK averaged only Pounds 5 for fish and chips, bread and butter and a large pot of tea. Take-away fish and chips could be bought for Pounds 2.20, so the restaurants had continued to attract customers even when spending was tight. Apart from a successful branch at Heathrow Airport, the group's furthest venture south in the UK will come in the spring, when it opens in Bristol. Mr Barnes said he was looking at a site on the M25, but had yet to find a partner. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1p, utilising in full earnings per share of 1p (0.9p).</p>

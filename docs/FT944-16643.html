			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Elf Sanofi sells food additive units to Viag Elf Sanofi, the drugs and beauty products subsidiary of French chemicals group Elf Aquitaine, yesterday took another step in a disposals programme designed to raise more than Dollars 1bn. The bio-industries and rendering businesses were sold to Viag, the German industrial and energy conglomerate, for FFr4.4bn (Dollars 830m). These business supply the food industries with additives such as pectin and xanthan gum. Sanofi embarked on a disposals programme when it bought Sterling Winthrop's prescription pharmaceutical activities from Eastman Kodak for Dollars 1.68bn in June. 'We decided then to sell all our bio-activities. Animal health and seeds activities are not yet sold, but we are in talks to sell them,' said Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, Sanofi's chairman and chief executive. The company is also making small disposals from the beauty side, and said its 46 per cent shareholding in the Entremont cheese-making business would also eventually be sold. Mr Jean-Claude Leroy, finance director, said Sanofi hoped to sign agreements for the sale of the remainder of its bio-activities by the end of the year. The company's target was to raise FFr6.5bn from the sale of the bio-activity portfolio, he said. Mr Leroy said Sanofi should be paid by Viag by December 31, so it would have to carry financing charges for the Sterling acquisition until then. The food additives business had sales in 1993 of FFr3.3bn. Sales to food manufacturers accounted for 80 per cent of revenues. The rendering business, which processes 1.5m tonnes of meat and fish by-products annually, had sales last year of FFr1.5bn. Most of its business is in France, Germany and Spain. For Munich-based Viag, the acquisition of these businesses will strengthen its position in food additives and in the French market. Mr Dehecq said that once the disposals of the bio-industries had been accomplished, the company would have completed its transition to a business with just two industrial divisions. The first will be prescription pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostics, the other beauty products including the Yves Saint Laurent range. Lex, Page 26</p>

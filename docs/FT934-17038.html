			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Motoring: Two hot favourites for Europe's big car prize - Stuart Marshall has his own ideas on who will take the laurels NIGHTS DRAW in, the London Motor Show looms and marketing directors of car makers have but a single thought; will we win Car of the Year 1994? There are more car of the year competitions than you could shake a gear stick at, but the big one is European Car of the Year, decided by a panel of nearly 60 motoring journalists. I am not among them so I feel free to forecast the result. A potential Car of the Year must have been available in five markets with the prospect of at least 5,000 sales each year. This rules out exotica such as Ferraris and Bugattis. The most extravagant cars ever to have won were the Porsche 928 in 1978 and the Mercedes 450 V8 (1974). A win is worth millions in free publicity although it does not mean the car is a technological masterpiece or a sure thing in the showrooms. Would you believe the Rover 3500, Chrysler Horizon, Lancia Delta and Renault 9 were European Cars of the Year in their time? And that the first, trend-setting, best-selling VW Golf was passed over. Sometimes - like last year when the British-made Nissan Micra was the jury's choice - the entries are so thin the result is almost a foregone conclusion. In others - as in 1991 and again this year - the field is so large that picking a likely winner can be tricky, even assuming all members of the jury put national prejudices to one side and vote objectively. This time there are 15 names in the frame and two hot favourites, the Ford Mondeo and Citroen Xantia. They replace mid-range favourites - Mondeo the Sierra, Xantia the BX - and have been selling well. Mondeo can be had as a four-door saloon, five-door hatchback or estate; Xantia only as a five-door hatchback at present. Both are all things a modern car should be; mechanically refined, quiet and comfortable performers, with good safety features. If the jury gives more weight to passive safety than, say, the benefits of self-levelling, semi-active suspension, then Mondeo will win. (It comes with a standard driver's airbag which the Xantia lacks). But the Xantia's styling - unlike the Mondeo, you would never take it for a Mazda, Nissan or Toyota - and its ride, handling and roomier rear seats must pick up extra votes. The clincher could be the sheer urbanity of the higher-geared turbo-diesel versions of Xantia which currently have no rival in their size and price class. Renault's Twingo, which looks like a miniature Espace and took the 1992 Paris salon de l'automobiles by storm, and General Motors' (Opel or Vauxhall) Corsa should be well up in the field. But neither is likely to win, if only because last year first and second places went to a brace of little cars, the Nissan Micra and Fiat Cinquecento. Also likely to be among the front runners is the Saab 900, first fruit of the marriage between Saab and General Motors. In every way a worthy car, it is still strongly Swedish though less overtly masculine in character than the old 900. A strong mid-field challenge to the Saab is likely from the Mercedes C-Class, replacement for the very successful 190 and crucially important for its embattled manufacturer. Those not quite identical twins, the Honda Accord and Rover 600, are slightly upmarket of Mondeo and Xantia and have been entered separately. Will the jury come down on the side of the Accord's price-for-price better equipment or the Rover's lovely interior? If the Citroen ZX could not take last year's award - many thought it was voted down simply because too many French cars had been winning - the Peugeot 306 which shares all its mechanical components is unlikely to be among the leaders this year. Of the remaining six long shots, the new Seat Ibiza will probably attract more votes than the Daihatsu Charade, Lancia Delta, Mitsubishi Galant, Nissan Serena or Hyundai Impreza. The jury is out and its verdict will be delivered a few weeks hence. Were I to be making a book on Car of the Year, the odds I would chalk up on the board are: 4-5 Citroen Xantia; evens Ford Mondeo; 2-1 Renault Twingo and Opel (Vauxhall) Corsa; 3-1 Mercedes C-Class and Saab 900; 5-1 Rover 600; 9-2 Honda Accord; 12-1 Seat Ibiza and Peugeot 306. The contenders include: Citroen Xantia, Daihatsu Charade, Ford Mondeo, Honda Accord, Hyundai Impreza, Lancia Delta, Mercedes C-Class, Mitsubishi Galant, Nissan Serena, Peugeot 306, Renault Twingo, Rover 600, Saab 900, Seat Ibiza, and the Vauxhall (Opel) Corsa.</p>

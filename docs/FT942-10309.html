			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survival at stake as losses byte: Digital Equipment's restructuring plan may not be enough to remedy its failures Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive of Digital Equipment, described the outlook for the computer company in brutally honest terms last week. He told employees that the 'entire enterprise could be at risk' if drastic steps were not taken to cut costs. At least 20,000 jobs had to be axed and segments of the business sold or abandoned if Digital was to return to profitability, he warned. 'We must achieve a competitive cost structure as rapidly as possible, and unfortunately we cannot escape the fact that significant additional downsizing at Digital is unavoidable.' Digital has been thrown into crisis by heavier than expected losses for the January-to-March third-quarter period (its 1994 fiscal year ends in June), which revealed serious weaknesses in the company's management and a further decline in profit margins. Losses widened to Dollars 183m, from Dollars 30m in the same period of 1993. Revenues for the quarter declined by 6 per cent to Dollars 3.26bn. In the wake of the financial report, Digital's share price plummeted 20 per cent to Dollars 23. On Monday it closed at Dollars 21 7/8 , and rating agencies have downgraded the company's debt. Wall Street is not alone in its fears for Digital's future. Mr Palmer this week tried to reassure the company's customers that it remains a 'viable, long-term partner that you can rely on'. However, confidence in his ability to steer Digital back from the brink of disaster has been severely shaken. After sustained criticism from financial analysts, the press, directors and customers, Mr Palmer feels chastened. 'One of us has a brand new and personal appreciation for what it feels like to undergo a public lynching,' he told employees. Mr Palmer's attackers charge that Digital has failed to come to grips with its principal problems - high sales costs, weak marketing and poor management controls. Although the strength of Digital's technology is widely recognised, the company is still struggling to adjust to an industry-wide trend toward lower profit margins. Just 18 months ago, when he took over the top job from Digital founder Mr Kenneth Olsen, Mr Palmer hoped to engineer a speedy turnround at the ailing computer group and restore it to former glory. In the 1970s and 1980s, Digital was second to International Business Machines in the world computer market. The company 'looked as if it could walk on water', says Mr Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research, a US market research firm, recalling the days when Digital's Vax minicomputers were best-sellers. But Digital's earnings began to slump in 1989 as competition from lower-cost, powerful desktop workstations made by companies such as Sun Microsystems and from networks of personal computers by IBM, Compaq and many others running industry-standard software began to eat into its core businesses. Digital was slow to respond to these shifts in technology. So in October 1992 Mr Palmer took on a company with flat revenues and deepening losses. Digital had already reduced its workforce by 12,000 to 114,000 and taken restructuring charges of Dollars 2.75bn over the prior three years. Still the company had failed to stem deepening operating losses. Moving quickly to cut expenses and institute tighter management controls, the new chief executive seemed to be making all the right moves. He rationalised the company's structure, forming nine customer-focused and product divisions out of Digital's more than 140 business units. In sharp contrast to Mr Olsen, who believed strongly in encouraging entrepreneurial spirit within his company, Mr Palmer began shifting Digital towards 'a more directive, decisive, top-down management style' to streamline the company. In important moves that his predecessor had vetoed, Mr Palmer announced workforce cuts, streamlined engineering and manufacturing operations and introduced a commission-based pay scheme to provide incentives to the salesforce. Mr Palmer also finally put to rest debate over Digital's commitment to 'open systems' software which enables different types and brands of computers to work together more efficiently. Although Digital declared itself an 'open systems' company in 1990, Mr Olsen continued - right up to the time of his retirement - to undermine the efforts of his marketing staff by expressing doubts about the performance of open systems software. In a symbolic break with the past, Mr Palmer announced in April 1993 that Digital would vacate the disused woollen mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, its headquarters since the company was founded in 1957. When Digital recorded a small profit of Dollars 113m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 (March-June) it seemed that the company was on the road to recovery. With the introduction of its first 'Alpha' computers, it set in place the cornerstone of a strategy to restore revenue growth and offset declining sales of older minicomputers. A super-fast microprocessor, Alpha is the core technology for a broad new range of products. But it has been downhill for Digital ever since. Between July and September last year Digital dropped back into the red, as its European sales - typically about half of total revenues - declined sharply. The quarter to December produced another disappointing performance with higher than expected losses and a 12 per cent fall in revenues. Sales of Digital's 'Alpha' computers were not growing as quickly as the company had hoped, in part due to delays in the development of software and poor marketing. Then came the shocking third quarter - a 'slap in the face', Mr Palmer acknowledged, 'a complete surprise'. Although sales of the Alpha increased by 66 per cent over the previous quarter and Digital more than doubled its personal computer sales, the gains did not offset a steep drop in minicomputer sales and an unexpected fall in service revenues. Some customers are upgrading older minicomputer systems with new Digital disc drives that are more reliable and require less maintenance, the company said. Gross profit margins fell 6 percentage points to 33.8 per cent of revenues compared with the same period last year, as Digital's sales continued to shift from high-profit proprietary systems to lower-margin Alpha workstations and personal computers. Worse than this performance, in the eyes of investors, was Digital's inability to foresee sales trends. The company has 'not done a good job of being able to forecast in sufficient detail the mix of products that our customers are likely to buy', Mr Palmer acknowledged to the FT this week. For example, the company could not keep pace with orders for its Alphas, because it wrongly predicted which models would be in demand. This resulted in excess inventories of some products and a shortage of others. 'This has a cascading effect on other parts of the business,' Mr Palmer said. For example, the service business suffered and sales of disc drives for workstations were held up. Heavy discounting of prices by Digital's salesforce was another problem, Mr Palmer told the FT. 'There is some concern that our sales people were put under tremendous pressure to meet their numbers.' Digital's head of worldwide sales and marketing, Ed Lucente, resigned in the wake of the results. Digital is 'like the barber's son who needs a haircut', said Mr Palmer. The company lacks the sophisticated management information systems needed for forecasting, matching supply and demand and other standard business procedures, he explained. 'We are re-engineering our business processes and redesigning our whole management information system.' But such measures are unlikely to solve all of Digital's problems. Last week Mr Palmer announced the 'second phase' of his restructuring plan. To be cost-competitive with companies such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Digital will cut its workforce by about 20 per cent. Mr Palmer said he was reviewing all the company's activities and would decide over the next six to eight weeks which parts of the business might be sold to reduce costs and raise cash to offset further restructuring expenses. Digital's salesforce is expected to take the brunt of the job cuts. Unlike other computer companies, Digital has been slow to switch sales to less expensive, 'indirect' channels, via independent resellers. Such distribution channels would need to be in place before swingeing cuts are introduced if revenues are to be protected. Although Mr Palmer has yet to set a timetable for the next round of job losses, he has made it clear that the survival of the company is at stake. 'I intend Digital's operations to be profitable by the end of this calendar year at the latest. Shareholders demand it, the board of directors expects it, and I expect us to deliver it.' Mr Palmer's job also depends upon it.</p>

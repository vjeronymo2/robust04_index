			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Campaign Diary: Unknown political leader ready for top Euro job The European election campaign has thrown up a surprise challenger to Virginia Bottomley and Margaret Beckett for the unofficial title of Britain's most powerful female politician. Beckett's claim will strengthen if she declares today that she is a candidate to succeed John Smith permanently. But even if she defeats Tony Blair, the red-hot favourite, she will still be in opposition. Not so Pauline Green, the former policewoman who leads Labour's Euro MPs. As leader of the largest delegation in the European parliament, Green already wields great influence in Europe. But she is also favourite to become leader of all the socialist MEPs in the new parliament - almost certain to be the largest political group. That would make her the single most important European parliamentarian, with massive influence over legislation. Green says she has no interest in moving to Westminster. But she is already a member of Labour's national executive committee. Beckett should watch out. * * * John Major is developing some decidedly Thatcherite ways of dealing with the awkward squad. Interviewed on LBC radio about Lord Tebbit's Euro-phobic views, the prime minister twice referred to the former Conservative party chairman as Mr Tebbit - which is a bit strange considering that it was Major who asked the Queen to raise Tebbit to the peerage in 1992. Downing Street said it was a slip of the tongue. But those with long memories may remember that Baroness Thatcher - then plain Mrs - once inflicted similar humiliation on Sir Robin Day by repeatedly 'mistering' him during a long television interview. She, too, said it was a slip of the tongue. * * * Shadow chancellor Gordon Brown was forced to think on his feet on Tuesday morning when his notes for a press conference speech on the OECD jobs report failed to arrive in time at the TGWU's Transport House headquarters. Campaign chairman Jack Cunningham helped out by calling Margaret Beckett and John Prescott to speak first, but with dozens of anxious hacks straining at the leash, Brown had to deliver his remarks off the cuff. The disappearing notes turned up near the end of the press conference - ferried by an embarrassed aide. He had been stuck for 25 minutes in the security doors outside Brown's Millbank office. No-one noticed Brown's difficulty, which suggests that either he thinks extremely quickly, or he usually ignores his notes anyway. * * * Lord Sutch's Monster Raving Loony party has plenty of rivals in the Euro-election for the title of Britain's wackiest party. Apart from three other Loony parties, the 79 parties contesting the election include the Eurobean from the Planet Beanus party, the Boston Tea party, the Rainbow Connection Oui-Say-Non party, and the Make Criminals Concerned About Our Response To Hostility and Yobbishness party. The Campaign Diary prize goes to the 21st Century party, based in a market in Rickmansworth, which bases its manifesto on the lyrics to songs by Pink Floyd, the pretentious rock group. The party, which has candidates in NW London and Hertfordshire, says it wants to make politics less boring. But not, unfortunately, less noisy. * * * Wondering where the beards and sandals went when the Liberals and the Social Democrats merged? Look no further than the Liberal party - formed (or continued) by a handful of enthusiasts when the others set up the Liberal Democrats. The Liberals, fighting 19 Euro-seats, are not quite a spent force: they have 60 councillors across the country and are the biggest group in Warminster, the Wiltshire town renowned for UFO sightings. The party's platform is splendidly unconventional: they oppose Maastricht but support common European citizenship and a 'democratically constituted' world government in which 'all disputes will be resolved by ballots and legal processes'. What a good idea. * * * Jack Straw, Labour's larrikin campaign organiser, has asked the police to investigate the alleged misuse of opinion poll figures by Liberal Democrats in Suffolk, claiming that an offence has been committed under the Representation of the People Act. (The Lib Dems say it was a mistake). Labour has been more careful in neighbouring Essex North and Suffolk South, where an article headed Labour - Leading the Way, says of the local elections: 'In Colchester, Labour gained Tiptree, and now runs neck and neck with the Tories in the borough.' Well, sort of. Actually, Labour took 24.4 per cent of the vote in May, just behind the Tories on 25.8 per cent. But the Liberal Democrats won 47.5 per cent - nearly double the other two parties put together. Sounds like an offence under the Mis-Representation of the People Act. * * * The Islamic Party of Great Britain seems to be rather less of a threat to the established parties than once seemed likely. General secretary Sahib Mustaquim Beleher says the party wanted to put up European election candidates in the main Moslem areas of Yorkshire, Lancashire and London, but had to drop out to conserve its resources for the by-election in Bradford South, where it won 0.3 per cent of the vote in the 1992 general election. But it was unable to run a candidate there either. So far, the party's best performance was 4.8 per cent of the vote in a Rotherham local election. * * * Peter Lilley, the deeply Euro-sceptic social security secretary, seems to be developing a penchant for things French. First, he spends most of the campaign at his Normandy holiday home, then he rushes back to speak in Huddersfield for Christine Adamson, the only French candidate standing in Britain. It's not clear why Lilley chose Yorkshire South West for his reappearance - the rock-solid Labour seat is hardly at the centre of national attention. Surely he was not trying to avoid the media? He has still not appeared on the platform at Conservative Central Office during the campaign, allegedly because social security is outside the competence of the EU. But pro-European Tories are not buying that one. They say Virginia Bottomley has appeared, although health is also outside the EU's scope.</p>

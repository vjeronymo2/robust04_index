			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hopes fade for BFr25bn float of Belgian state savings bank THE PROSPECT of a BFr25bn (Dollars 717m) stock market flotation of ASLK-CGER, Belgium's state-owned savings bank, is fading, according to Belgium's biggest bank. Generale de Banque had offered to pilot ASLK-CGER onto the Belgian stock market in a British-style public offer of shares. However, Mr Ferdinand Chaffart, Generale's chief executive, said yesterday he 'seriously doubted' the bank's proposal would be accepted. Generale de Banque announced that consolidated net profits had increased 10 per cent to BFr5.8bn in the first half of 1993, against BFr5.28bn in the first six months of last year. The group said second-half net results should be in line with the first half. The bank believed a high-profile sale of shares in ASLK-CGER - the first stage in a four-year BFr70bn privatisation programme - would have attracted Belgium's private investors. 'I think (the Belgian government) has missed a great opportunity to do something for the stock exchange,' said Mr Chaffart. In theory, the bank's proposal for a public offer is still on the table. However Generale said it now seemed more likely that Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, would buy a large stake in ASLK-CGER. The Belgian government expects to raise about BFr25bn from the sale of a 49 per cent holding in the savings bank, which has an extensive banking and insurance network. Gross profit at Generale de Banque rose 38 per cent, from BFr16.63bn to BFr23.02bn, in the first half, helped by strong capital gains on government bonds and a BFr2bn gain on the sale of shares in ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank. Mr Chaffart said in view of the depressed economic situation, the bank had decided to transfer most of those capital gains to reserves. Depreciation charges and provisions against bad debts increased from BFr7.64bn in the first six months of last year, to BFr12.52bn. The group's customer deposits rose 7 per cent to BFr2,227bn from BFr2,083bn, and total assets were up 8 per cent to BFr3,627bn from BFr3,364bn. Gevaert, the Antwerp-based financial holding company, increased interim net consolidated profits from BFr1.12bn to BFr1.56bn in the six months to June 30. Current earnings reached BFr1.04bn from BFr959m. The company said it expected to match last year's current earnings of BFr1.64bn.</p>

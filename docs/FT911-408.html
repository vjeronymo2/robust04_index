			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: 50% expansion for Cambridge Group Mainly as a result of organic growth, Cambridge Group, the Dublin-based financial services organisation, pushed up pre-tax profit by 50 per cent for the year ended February 28 1991. Mr Colm Menton, chairman, said the fact that all aspects of the group's business were still at an early stage of development indicated that 'there was considerable upside potential for earnings'. Profit was up from IPounds 3.02m to IPounds 4.53m, or Pounds 4.1m. Earnings were 6.25p (4.57p) after allowing for the shares issued to acquire control of Xtra-Vision, the video rental group. The final proposed dividend is 0.5p for a total of 0.9p (0.27p). The chairman said the performance in the UK was particularly encouraging given the sharp fall off in the economy and the poor performance of many competitors. Leasing and confirming accounted for some 80 per cent of the group's profits, underlying the strength of those two the core businesses.</p>

This was stated by the president of the National Association  of Industrialists (ANDI), Carlos Arturo Angel Arango, in a  message to the members of the association.    According to Angel Arango, it was not easy to get good  results in negotiations in which the trade commitments had been  defined beforehand and the political circumstances, with the  imminent change of government in Venezuela, required immediate  decisions.    The leader of the business association said that in view of  these circumstances, an overall evaluation leads to the  conclusion that the negotiations were handled well by the  Foreign Trade Ministry.    In his view, the Colombian industrial sector "will not find  it easy" to adjust to the new system. He explained that the  country-of-origin standards will be more stringent for Colombian  companies and for other sectors because their production  conditions are less favorable than those of Mexico, and the new  developments will provide little or no protection from that  country's goods.    "Nevertheless," added Angel, "we are not interested in  discussing the mechanisms contained in the agreement right now;  the ANDI will do that later, and the necessary analyses are  being prepared for that purpose."    Angel indicated that the trade agreement with Mexico goes  much further than this type of pact usually does. The commitment  will be a key factor in the country's future tariff situation,  making the economic liberalization irreversible and its  expansion inevitable.    The president of the ANDI reiterated that the Colombian  industrial sector is preparing to compete with an economy like  Mexico's, which, in turn, must face the challenge of competing  on an equal footing with the United States.  <H5>  The Agreement </H5>   Angel suggested that we join the Free Trade Agreement  quickly; otherwise, we will be at a disadvantage in competing  with Mexico, especially with regard to raw materials and capital  goods, "since our partner will have the benefit of having the  United States as a supplier in the next few years."    As the agreement stands now, Colombia may export 62 percent  of its industrial goods tariff-free, while Mexico may sell only  16 percent of its goods tariff-free.    Mexico, on the other hand, will have to wait five years  before the products that were on the semi-slow list can enter  the Colombian market free of tariff.    Other sectors' goods will see annual tariff decreases of 10  percent for the next 10 years.    The tariff protection of vehicles will be dismantled in two  years. In addition, the agreement calls for the creation of an  automotive committee that is to establish a barter program  within two years. This instrument obliges Mexico to import from  Colombia a greater value of vehicles than it exports.    In agriculture, it was decided to exclude from the  liberalization program farm products that are subject to price  bands or receive some type of subsidy in Mexico.    The pact brings the Colombian economy into an expanded  market  with 145 million consumers, in a region producing $373 billion  worth of goods and services (gross domestic product).</p>

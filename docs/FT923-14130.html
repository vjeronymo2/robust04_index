			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Aimless dollar gets down to some serious weakness: 'Triple-dip' fear and low interest rates AFTER months of uncertainty about the US dollar, foreign exchange dealers have decided what course of action to take. Sell. Since April the US currency has been drifting aimlessly in the market, undermined by sluggish growth in the US economy and a huge interest rate differential in favour of the powerful D-Mark. But in recent days, dealers have become aggressive bears. The dollar is being heavily sold, while the D-Mark, its most important competitor in the market, goes from strength to strength. After peaking at DM1.6750 in the spring, the dollar gradually slumped to around DM1.5200 last Thursday night. Since then it has been hit by a wave of selling, touchingDM1.4760 in European trading yesterday. Most analysts expect it to return to its all-time low of DM1.4430 in February 1991. Others are even more pessimistic: 'The market is already gearing up for DM1.44,' says Mr Christian Dunis, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London. 'The question now is whether the dollar will go into something like a free fall.' Many analysts admit that they have been startled by the dollar's weakness. But in recent days, several factors triggered a decline in confidence: Many traders gave up waiting for the upturn in the US economy. Dismal June employment figures released last Thursday were the last straw. A rise in the payroll figure of around 80,000 was expected, but, said one analyst, 'the drop of 170,000 forced us to hold up our hands in horror'. The US Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 3 per cent, the lowest level for 29 years, in a further attempt to boost the economy. That established a yawning 6.75 per cent gap between US and German short-term interest rates. 'It's so costly now to remain a dollar investor that if you don't have good reasons to hold the currency, you have to get out of it,' says Mr Dunis. The political difficulties of President George Bush are increasingly cited by dealers as a reason to ditch the currency. Many dollar investors were disappointed at the outcome of the Munich summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Far from instigating an attempt to prop up the dollar, the G7 had nothing to say about currencies in its final communique. Analysts now feel that the US authorities are undertaking a policy of 'benign neglect' towards the dollar, allowing it to weaken in the hope that it will boostUS exports. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, says exchange rate policy is now the only way the US authorities can speed the upturn. 'The other two weapons of economic policy have been spent.' There is little that can be done with fiscal policy now that the US has a budget deficit close to Dollars 400bn. With interest rates so low, the Fed has run out of monetary ammunition as well. A weaker dollar is probably also welcome to the German and Japanese governments. Fears of high imported inflation in Germany as the eastern states are industrially renovated will mean that a strong D-Mark is welcome. The Bank of Japan, facing an economic downturn, may also need to reduce interest rates later this year, a policy that will be eased by a stronger yen. Whether the dollar will rebound depends on whether there is an economic upturn in the last half of this year. Some economists are optimistic, recalling that the US economy has been advancing for four quarters, albeit slowly. But Mr MacKinnon remains pessimistic: 'The fact is that consumer demand is weak, real earnings are declining and employment prospects are deteriorating.' The US authorities could be forced to intervene to prop up the dollar if its weakness starts to affect domestic financial markets. Until now, Wall Street has barely reacted to the currency's weakness. But a lack of confidence in the currency has affected the stock market before. The dollar is most likely to gain, however, from new fears about the German economy which will put the D-Mark under question. Some analysts expect a slowdown in the German economy in the final quarter of this year, which may have the effect of leading the Bundesbank to ease German interest rates. All these economic data are weapons in a battle between two groups of investors. On one side, they are saying that the dollar is cheap and a bargain buy. On the other, they believe the US economy is into a 'triple-dip' recession and that the best thing to do is sell. Whichever is stronger will decide the currency's fate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/04/1994 -- "Romania has the  capacity to employ its own potential," said Romanian minister of  state, head of the Council of Economic Coordination, Strategy  and Reform, in an interview granted to the governmental daily  VOCEA ROMANIEI.    "The market economy is not a goal, an objective," says  Cosea,  but it must be considered as "a way to organize production and  consumption based on relations of equivalent exchanges."  Minister Cosea opined that Romania should consider the projects  for the future according to the objectives it wish to reach.  The development, as a goal, "depends on a country's capacity of  employing the potential it has and, in this respect, few  countries have this capacity that Romania has."    Minister Cosea said also that the reform in Romania was "an  action of updating and civilizing which entails time and  efforts. Still, the reform must be, in the end, visible and  perceptible at the level of the individual" and not reduced to  some statistical figures with regard to the pace of the  privatization. "If it does not bring a change in the life of the  individual, in his life in the society, the reform has no  motivation." Reviewing the past four years of reform, Mircea  Cosea concluded that the single change in the life of the  individual was only a "permanent stress caused by the vanishing  of the old values."    The reform, Cosea opined, should lead to the healing of the  Romanian individual from two maladies he suffered from very much  in the communist regime, namely, "the apathy, lack of  determination," and "a certain underestimation of the country  and of the people he belongs to in favor of foreign values,  usually Western ones." Mircea Cosea said that at the time being  Romania needed "a well structured system of values" and "a  revigoration of the real, genuine patriotism which means one's  faith that he belong to a valuable and strong nation." These can  be achieved, Cosea considers, through the economic factor. When  the Romanians would be able to live a better life, they will  abandon the tendency of over-estimating the values of other  peoples only because of their higher living standard, believes  Cosea.    Referring to the privatization issues of primary concern in  1994, Mircea Cosea warned that "privatization is not a reform  element in itself but a single step which must be taken in the  economic and social field." Minister Cosea said also that  because of the way privatization has been made from 1990 till  now, it is no longer perceived by the public as a reform element  but as "a collective trauma." In this respect, Cosea mentioned  certain abuses, elements of corruption, in the first years of  the privatization process.</p>

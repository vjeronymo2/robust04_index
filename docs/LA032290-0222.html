			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> CAL POLY WOMEN TO HOST FINAL FOUR TOURNEY FOR FIRST TIME  </P> <P> The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team will make its seventh appearance in  the last nine seasons the NCAA Division II final four tournament starting  Friday.  </P> <P> But this appearance will be a little different from the rest.  </P> <P> It will mark the first time that the Broncos will host the final four  tournament. The semifinals will be Friday and the final and third-place game  Saturday at Kellogg Gymnasium in Pomona.  </P> <P> Pomona, which enters the final four with a 28-3 record and the No. 2 ranking in  Division II, will have a difficult assignment in their tournament opener at 8  p.m. Friday. The Broncos must face top-ranked Delta State (30-1) of  Mississippi, a team that defeated Pomona by a one-sided 88-58 score in the  championship game last year in Cleveland, Mississippi.  </P> <P> In the other semifinal game at 6 p.m. Friday, fifth-ranked Bentley (30-3) of  Massachusetts will meet 14th-ranked Oakland (27-4) of Michigan. The winners  play for the title at 8 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> But first the Broncos must get past a Delta State squad that has exceptional  size on its front line.  </P> <P> The Lady Statesmen, who have an all-time record of 15-3 in Division II  tournament play, have four starters returning from last year's championship  team including 6-0 seniors Crystal Hardy and Anita Robinson at forward and Pam  Lockett at center.  </P> <P> Hardy is averaging 15.5 points and 7.3 rebounds, Lockett 15.1 points and 8.8  rebounds and Robinson 13 points and 7.1 rebounds. Another player from last  year's title winner is senior guard Liz Wallace (5-7).  </P> <P> While Delta State has an impressive track record in NCAA tournament play,  Pomona's may be even more noteworthy. The Broncos have a 28-5 all-time record  in postseason play and captured Division II titles in 1982, 1985 and 1986.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who defeated fourth-ranked North Dakota by a 67-64 score in the  Division II quarterfinals last week to advance to the final four, have been led  by the strong inside play of All-America 6-2 center Niki Bracken and  All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 6-1 forward Marcine Edmonds. Bracken  averages 19 points and 9.5 rebounds and Edmonds 13.6 points and 6.9 rebounds.  </P> <P> The other starters for Pomona are juniors Kelly Connelly (6-1) at forward and  Denise Ogburn (5-5) and Stephanie Coons (5-11) at guards. Coons, a former  standout at Wilson High in Hacienda Heights, averages 9.9 points and 5.5  rebounds.  </P> <P> Pomona has also received steady play from reserve center Danielle Carter, who  averages 9.7 points and 6.8 rebounds. Reserve guard Serenda Valdez also played  well in the quarterfinals last week with a career-high 23 points and a  school-record seven three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Many of the top track and field performers in the world will compete in the  fifth annual Azusa Pacific University Meet of Champions on Saturday in Azusa.  </P> <P> Field events start at 9:30 a.m. and running events at 12:10 p.m.  </P> <P> One of the best events could be the 300-meter run, which will include  world-class sprinters Innocent Egbunike and Sunday Uti of Nigeria, Gabriel  Tiacoh of the Ivory Coast and Darryl Robinson and Henry Thomas of the U.S.  </P> <P> Egbunike, a former Azusa Pacific star, has the fastest time by a non-American  in the 400 meters at 44.17 seconds. Tiacoh was an Olympic silver medalist in  the 400 in 1984, and Uti won an Olympic bronze medal on Nigeria's 400-meter  relay team in 1988.  </P> <P> Another strong field has been assembled for the 300-meter hurdles including  former UCLA star Kevin Young, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 400-meter  hurdles last year with a best of 47.86 seconds. Also included are Amadou Dia Ba  of Senegal, who won a silver medal in the 400 hurdles in the 1988 Summer  Olympics, George Porter of USC and Nate Page of the U.S.  </P> <P> The high jump has a pair of outstanding competitors in Doug Nordquist, former  American record holder, and Lee Balkin, a former NCAA champion from UCLA.  </P> <P> The sprints will be well-represented with world-class long jumper Larry Myricks  of the U.S. competing in the 100- and 200-meter runs and Grace Jackson of  Jamaica, who won the silver medal in the women's 200 meters at the 1988 Summer  Olympics.  </P> <P> Among former Azusa Pacific standouts competing will be Dave Johnson, who holds  the American record in the modern decathlon, and Mike Barnett, ranked No. 1 in  the U.S. in the javelin in 1989.  </P> <P> The Cougars will also be represented by senior Ade Olukoju, a native of  Nigeria, one of the top-ranked discus throwers in the world, and Latrese  Johnson, a sophomore who is two-time National Assn. of Intercollegiate  Athletics Champion in the women's high jump.  </P> <P> Dean Karnoski of Glendora High School and Jim Walker of Temple City, two of the  most successful coaches in the San Gabriel Valley last season, have been named  coaches for the 11th annual Hall of Fame All-Star Football Game to be held July  20 at Citrus College in Glendora.  </P> <P> Karnoski guided Glendora to a co-championship in CIF Division IV last season.  The Tartans tied Ramona, 28-28, in the title game to finish with the season  with a 12-1-1 record -- best in school history.  </P> <P> Karnoski has a winning career record of 30-23-1 at Glendora.  </P> <P> Walker also directed Temple City to an outstanding season as the Rams reached  the CIF Division VII semifinals for the second year in a row before losing to  Lompoc by a 48-38 score. The Rams finished with a 9-4 record after posting a  10-2-1 mark the previous year.  </P></p>

The first round of expert talks on minorities took place in  Strasbourg on January 24-28. In accordance with the autumn 1993  CE summit in Vienna, these talks are supposed to produce by the  end of this year a series of international documents codifying  minority rights.    "The most active delegation was the Hungarian, whose  position  could be described as extreme," Rozgonova said, adding that  Slovakia had pointed out it preferred to stress individual  rights for members of minorities, since protecting individual  rights represented the greatest guarantee of a democracy's  functioning.</p>

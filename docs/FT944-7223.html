			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ML at Pounds 2.33m midway and outlook is good ML Holdings, which designs and manufactures electrical systems for the aerospace and defence industries, had pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.33m for the half year to September 30, 13 per cent ahead of Pounds 2.06m last time. Turnover was 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 46.3m, compared with Pounds 43.1m. Earnings per share rose to 1.2p (1.1p) and an interim dividend of 0.3p (nil) is declared. Mr Howard Grant, chief executive, said German subsidiary Schopf Maschinenbau's operating loss had 'masked the good progress' of the group as a whole. The outlook continued to improve and this would be reflected in the full-year results.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Pialuisa </F> Bianco in Rome on 31 May: "Berlusconi: This Is How I Will  Govern" -- first two paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Things got off to a bad start, because I am always  punctual and I do not like to be kept waiting. The Palazzo  Chigi [government seat] was unusually bereft of official cars  and bodyguards, so I thought with irritation that the prime  minister was out. But instead, there he was, right on time, in  his double-breasted suit with a spotted necktie and a big smile.  That was enough to win me over to the new incumbent. On one  occasion, at the time of the barons of the First Republic, Paolo  Cirino Pomicino, recently arrived at the Agriculture Ministry,  made me wait for an hour and then proceeded to explain to me  that power is measured by how long you can succeed in keeping  someone waiting.    Bodyguards and security staff, with their red and white  symbols of authority, have been reduced to a minimum. "This is  the first thing I did when I reached here," Berlusconi said,  somewhat embarrassed. "You should have seen the state I found  this place in. You may not believe it, but among the tapestries  and stucco work they had amassed reproduction antique furniture  -- lamps, chairs, and tables made in Brianza. Apart from the  lack of taste and discrimination, there was a complete neglect  of even the external dignity and decorum of this institution."  After another, inevitable, smile, this former businessman from  Brianza explained: "The lack of identity of a political class is  apparent even in small things. For instance, if the prime  minister wants to invite a prominent figure to lunch, he has to  ask the other ministries to provide hospitality. And to think  that the staff and officials scattered in the various offices  total 5,200 people -- 5,000 more than under De Gasperi. You  know what the cross section of a tree looks like when it has  been felled and you can see its age from the growth rings? It  is like that in these offices: Imagine cutting a section  through them, and you will see the stratification of the  apparatus accumulated from government to government. [no end  quote as published]    [Bianco] I know that your name is synonymous with  efficiency,  Prime Minister, but there were moments in Parliament when your  face betrayed your irritation with parliamentary ceremony....    [Berlusconi] There is only one thing that usually irritates  me -- theatricality, rhetoric, pomp. But this applies both  inside and outside Parliament. I am concerned with the things  that need to be done. The moment I arrived at the Palazzo Chigi  I decided to announce that the prime minister's salary would go  to charity. Then I changed my mind, because of my horror of  rhetoric. You can imagine: People would have said right away  that a sacrifice of 6 million lire a month for Berlusconi was no  sacrifice at all.    [Bianco] In your first parliamentary victories in a  difficult  Senate situation, did you succeed mainly because of your courage  to gamble everything, or were the opposition forces left  confused by the force of attraction exerted by the first prime  minister, enjoying strong popular support, to believe himself  invincible?    [Berlusconi] I have realized something: In Parliament there  are no victories and defeats in pitched battles; there is a  dialogue, a debate on the basis of different roles, and a  majority decision that it often takes too long to reach and that  is often reached by means of confused mechanisms. The  confidence debate was an excellent example. Those who wanted to  turn it into a propaganda event failed; it was ideas, programs,  and -- if I may be permitted to say so -- the attitude of the  government which prevailed. And not only the effect of the  people's support.    [Bianco] Would you rather gain a victory or an overwhelming  victory?    [Berlusconi] Good manners are for me the most important  rule.  But political observers find it difficult to appreciate their  importance. You saw what an impact my shaking hands with  Giorgio Napolitano in Parliament had. But that was merely a  necessary gesture; I tried to explain that it was neither a  propaganda gesture nor an attempt to secure a benevolent  attitude. While other left-wing oppositionists were yielding to  demagoguery and personal attacks, Mr. Napolitano was able to be  both tough and correct.    [Bianco] Nevertheless, that handshake did almost more to  create difficulties for the opposition than the adherence to the  spoils system has....    [Berlusconi] I am not trying to cause difficulties for the  opposition. That was the favorite pursuit of the parties of the  First Republic, which used parliament to build a new balance  every day by dint of successive declarations....    [Bianco] What is your strategy, Prime Minister?    [Berlusconi] It is to govern. That is all. Then the voters  will decide. This is the essence of rotation in a  first-past-the-post system.    [Bianco] A few days at the Palazzo Chigi have caused the  coercive Berlusconi to disappear in favor of the Doroteo-style  [reference to former Christian Democratic Party (DC) faction]  Berlusconi....    [Berlusconi] I do not feel like either. If I had to describe  my experiment I would say: the happy mean, a liberal and  moderate government. I am learning that there is no politics  without patient negotiation, but if negotiations exhaust and  enfeeble politics, then that means trouble.    [Bianco] Are the opposition forces right to demand at least  a few chairmanships of parliamentary committees as a means of  exercising institutional monitoring?    [Berlusconi] The issue of the parliamentary committees must  not be exaggerated. The basic principle is that Parliament  exercises legislative and monitoring functions, and can accept,  amend, or reject the government's political orientation. This  is the task of the whole of Parliament, both majority and  minority. Parliament is an instrument of the people for  exercising their sovereignty, not a weapon of the opposition  forces for obstructing the government's activity. This role is  not determined by the chairmanship of a committee. We have been  clear with the minority -- limited political accords in an  atmosphere of institutional courtesy and calm coexistence amid  our differences, but no associational joint management of  parliamentary activity.    [Bianco] You have learned to sound like a manual of  parliamentary procedure, Prime Minister.    [Berlusconi] I like precision and I do not like to talk  about  things about which I know nothing.    [Bianco] Are the relations that you seek with the PPI  [Italian Popular Party] solely for opportunistic reasons, in  order to increase your majority in the Senate?    [Berlusconi] On the contrary. The PPI is a political area  that attracts a moderate Catholic vote, which is also part of  our own coalition. We and they are close, whether or not that  party's leaders like the fact. I am not trying to undermine  anyone's position, and I do not want their party to  disintegrate. I am seeking a serious dialogue with the PPI; I  reject the attitudes of preconceived hostility of the old DC  Right.    [Bianco] Samuelson says that even though you won such an  overwhelming vote in the elections you "cannot do anything."  Are you afraid of becoming the umpteenth representative of  Italy's "nongovernment?"    [Berlusconi] I preferred Kissinger's assessment: The  government must concentrate on specifics and implement its  program proceeding from its economic part; and the disputes over  questions of principle, the ill-intentioned and vengeful climate  imposed by the losers -- all this will disappear faster than is  believed.    [Bianco] Even Clinton, a Democrat, made the same  recommendation, thus disappointing progressives in this country.    [Berlusconi] I too was surprised. I expected vaguer and more  diplomatic remarks, with a more remote reference to our problems  and recent history. Instead President Clinton said what he had  to say, with a friendly and pragmatic attitude that is typical  of the best of his country's culture and, I would say, of the  "American spirit." I am sure that, leaving aside justifiable  anxieties stemming from the innovations, our allies will display  impeccable respect for our independence of judgment and support  for the new Italy that emerged from the 27 March elections.    [Bianco] Yesterday a less optimistic governor of the Bank of  Italy warned you not to lower your guard on the public spending  front.    [Berlusconi] That was a strange point to make, since  reducing  and selecting public expenditure and lowering tax pressure have  always been at the center of my program.    [Bianco] What would you do if another Crotone [location of  major industrial dispute] were to occur?    [Berlusconi] I would seek a responsible and realistic  solution, as [former Prime Minister] Ciampi tried to do. But I  would try to ensure that its entire burden did not fall on the  shoulders of the community as a whole or on the general interest  in a recovery of the economy and of employment. Jobs must be  protected by creating new ones and by stimulating development,  not by placing constraints on state industries.    [Bianco] Is your decision influenced by the spreading  propatronage attitude in the Catholic component of the majority  or the AN's [National Alliance] "social" policy? At Crotone the  MSI [Italian Social Movement] demonstrated together with the  Left.    [Berlusconi] The suggestion that the AN is a neostatist  party  is one of the many myths constructed on the basis of empty talk.  As far as I know, and in the absence of any evidence to the  contrary, Fini and Tatarella [AN] share the government's  approach to deregulation in the economic field.    [Bianco] Some 20 years ago La Malfa senior complained that  it  was impossible to dream of Scandinavian-style social services in  an economy such as ours that produced one-third of the per  capita income of those countries. Is this still so?    [Berlusconi] Scandinavian-style social services are perhaps  not within our reach even now, but we can permit ourselves  something better than we have now.    [Bianco] The entire political class, both Right and Left,  who  have left the scene, was convinced that these services should be  administered by the state, and that the difference lay solely in  the quality of management. Now that you are in Rome, are you  too starting to think this way, or are you convinced that social  services administered by the state are in themselves a source of  waste?    [Berlusconi] The state owns essential services that it  cannot  relinquish. But who says it must administer them  bureaucratically instead of on the basis of the criteria of  efficiency that prevail in the private sector? The Constitution  states that the republic guarantees certain social rights such  as work, health, and education -- not inefficiency and neglect  of the citizens' needs.    [Bianco] Now that the ministers have been changed, is it  necessary to change the ministries and their respective  bureaucracies?    [Berlusconi] I have found the public administration to be  full of expert and responsible people. Certain procedures and  old habits are an obstacle, but many members of the so-called  bureaucracy were only waiting for a new wind in order to get rid  of them.    [Bianco] What advice would you give to Fini?    [Berlusconi] The AN leader has a great opportunity to  legitimize, definitely and unequivocally, a governmental Right  capable of a positive attitude and a civilized and reassuring  language, leaving the dross and the nostalgia to their proper  fate. The country is ready for this, and Fini is too astute a  politician to be unaware of it. All the rest -- the dispute  over the remark that I in fact never made in my interview with  THE WASHINGTON POST -- seems to me artificial.    [Bianco] Do your ministers not have a slightly guilty  conscience, as in the case of [Interior] Minister Maroni, who  demanded the head of the Vicenza police chief after the Nazi  skinhead rally?    [Berlusconi] Maroni is a good minister and has not set a  foot  wrong so far. The opposition forces are full of praise for him  because they hope to be able to set him against his government  colleagues. These are childish tricks. Maroni seems to me a  solid person free of vanity.    [Bianco] What would you like to say to [Northern League  Secretary] Bossi that you have not already told him?    [Berlusconi] To proceed courageously along his chosen path.  To move on, with the League, from a phase of protest to a phase  of government and real reform of this country. In the short  term excesses seem to yield more, but in the long term a  rigorous attitude and a sense of state are what pay.    [Bianco] Bossi says that [former League ideologue] Miglio,  since their split, has been working for Berlusconism.    [Berlusconi] I respect Mr. Miglio, but I do not engage in  underhanded tactics. Ultimately, leaving aside the bad feeling,  convergence on a possible form of federalism will prevail over  all the misunderstandings.    [Bianco] With regard to bad feeling, there has been some  even  in Forza Italia. What would you prefer it to be like -- a  business party, a new mass party, an American-style  mega-electoral committee with no apparatus?    [Berlusconi] A movement of public opinion, a solid but  flexible organization that does not crystallize into a party,  that does not become rigid; an electoral cartel that can return  to its presence within society between one election and the  next, maintaining constant contact with the deputy and senator  for the constituency concerned, with the entire institutional  system, and with the citizens, organized through the clubs.  Forza Italia has, and must maintain, its own soul and identity;  but we do not need too forceful an ego, we do not need a party  that will copy the policy of the parliamentary groups and that  of the government. I said this in Parliament. We must move on  from government by the parties to government by the institutions.    [Bianco] Would you have dinner with Cacciari and Occhetto  [Democratic Party of the Left]?    [Berlusconi] I consider the mayor of Venice someone who can  reason calmly. Perhaps I could talk with him about the  usefulness to the country of an opposition that has a very clear  objective. Not to obstruct the incumbent government's path but  to plan an alternative government. Perhaps we would agree on  many things, perhaps even on the menu.    [Bianco] The Scalfaro issue: At the start of the Second  Republic is it still possible for the president to be someone  who took part in the constitution of the First Republic?    [Berlusconi] Why not? Renewal is never entirely confined to  individuals.    [Bianco] Have you been won over by the grand old men?    [Berlusconi] This republic's grand old men still have  something to teach us. For instance, Francesco Cossiga's Senate  speech was very fine -- committed, a real challenge.    [Bianco] The whole of Italy knows Berlusconi's dream, but  are  you sure that you can achieve it?    [Berlusconi] It is within everyone's reach -- to work hard  and to pursue a straight path, without fear and with humility.</p>

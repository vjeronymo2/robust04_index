			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART;  </P> <P> MORE AID FOR BAY AREA:  </P> <P> Cultural institutions in the Bay Area earthquake disaster area have been given  an extension on applying for grants from the federal government's Institute of  Museum Services. The deadline for applications for money from the institute's  largest program -- for general operating support -- was Friday, but it has been  changed to Nov. 17. Meanwhile, the National Endowment for the Arts expects to  establish an earthquake-disaster relief grant application for arts institutions  there. The money -- $100,000 to $200,000 -- would be channeled through the  California Arts Council. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

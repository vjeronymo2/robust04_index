			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro </F> Hosokawa with foreign and Japanese correspondents at the New  Century Hotel in Beijing, with passage-by-passage translation  into Mandarin -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified Japanese official] Please, will the  designated correspondents come forth before the microphones and  state their names.    [Ono] I am Ono from YOMIURI SHIMBUN. The issue of North  Korea's nuclear development was a major item on the agenda of  the Japan-China summit talks. The prime minister himself has  expressed deep concern over the issue. Prime Minister, you held  a series of meetings with Chinese leaders. I would like to ask  you how the Chinese leaders view the present situation regarding  North Korea's nuclear development, and how China will exercise  its influence on North Korea. Prime Minister, you have said  that the Japanese Government will deal with the issue of North  Korea's nuclear development within the framework of the  Constitution. If the issue is referred to the UN Security  Council, and the council decides to impose economic sanctions  against North Korea, what sort of actions will Japan take?    [Hosokawa] North Korea refused to allow nuclear inspections  of certain nuclear sites by the IAEA, and as a result nuclear  inspections by the IAEA ended insufficiently; the North-South  working-level talks ended with no agreement being reached. I am  deeply concerned over this situation. As for economic sanctions  against North Korea, I would like to refrain from making any  specific comment at this moment. As a general rule, I think if  the UN Security Council decides to take some kind of sanctions,  Japan for its part will also have to take responsible action.  As regards North Korea, China is its most friendly nation, and  my understanding is that the role to be played by China is very  important and great.    [Aoyama] I am Aoyama from KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Prime  Minister, I would like to ask you about human rights in China.  Speaking at a welcoming banquet hosted by Premier Li Peng, you  stressed human rights as a universal value. I assume you made  the remark out of consideration for the positions of both China  and the United States. Since the issue of human rights affects  the livelihood of ordinary Chinese people, I would like to ask  you to explain the issue of human rights in China in a manner  that we can easily understand. I would also like to ask you if  China needs to improve its human rights record. Prime Minister,  what do you think of China's position regarding the Untied  States' deamnd for improving human rights in China that it is an  intervention of China's internal affairs? Prime Minister, you  mentioned human rights in the welcoming banquet hosted by  Premier Li Peng, but did not raise the human rights issue in  China at the official summit talks. Did you not raise the issue  out of some consideration?    [Hosokawa] You asked me about human rights in China. I  would like to answer your question by explaining why I mentioned  human rights at the banquet yesterday. Our substantial talks  began yesterday. From the outset of the banquet yesterday,  substantial talks without protocol have already begun. During  the substantial talks, human rights in China was raised for  discussion.    During the banquet, Premier Li Peng explained to me about  what he and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher discussed. In  response, I told him that each nation should make its own  efforts to deal with the issue of human rights which has  universal value, and I do not think China has objection in this  respect. You asked about the issue between the United States  and China, but I would like to refrain from commenting on it.    You asked if violations of human rights exist in China. I  think you asked the question with China's recent detention of  dissidents in mind. I also would like to refrain from making  any comment about that.    [Shimada] I am Shimada from NHK. I would like to ask you  about China's military expenses. ASEAN member nations and other  neighboring countries of China are expressing their concerns  about continuously growing Chinese defense budget. China is  explaining that the inflation and other matters are the causes  of the increase. However, some people point out that Japan's  economic cooperation will be consequently linked to the  expansion of or be used for defense expenses in China. Do you  feel that the concerns were dispelled by the series of meetings?    [Hosokawa] The question is about the trend of China's  military expansion. Probably, the Chinese military expenses  grew due to the current state of its military equipment,  inflation rate, and foreign exchange rate. Improvement of  military personnel's living standard may be involved in it, too.  Replacement of old military equipment was the main cause of the  increase. I do not think it will immediately become a threat to  Japan. At any rate, the most important thing is that China  should make efforts to increase openness of its military  programs and this will lead to assuring a sense of security and  improving trust in China in the international community. I  believe it is very important for China to disclose its military  programs to the rest of the world. In this regard, I believe  the Chinese leaders and I share the same understanding.    The reporter, who asked the question, also pointed out that  various types of aid from Japan may be used for military  expenses. Regarding the economic cooperation, I have candidly  explained to the Chinese leaders that in connection with the  outline of its recent official development assistance, the  Japanese people are increasingly interested in China's  increasing defense expenses. I believe that the Chinese leaders  understood this point.    [Unidentified Japanese official] Three Japanese reporters  have asked questions so far. Now, we will give Chinese  reporters a chance to ask questions. Since all the faces look  alike, I will ask Japanese reporters not to raise your hands.    [Unidentified Chinese reporter] Earlier, you referred to the  Sino-Japanese economic ties. Judging from the recent movement,  various European and American businesses are rapidly making  inroads into the Chinese markets. Also, China is planning to  build five subway systems, three bullet train systems, and the  Sanxia dam. What are your views of these projects? Can you  explain not as a representative of industries but as a  politician. Also, can you tell us what kind of relations do you  want to establish with China in the future?    [Hosokawa] I had discussions with Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji  during a lunch with him this afternoon. At that time, Deputy  Premier Zhu said that economic power of Japanese industries has  become weak. Premier Li Peng pointed out the same thing during  a dinner last night. I myself felt the same. I frankly told  them what I felt when I arrived in Beijing. There are so many  Volkswagens in Beijing. I told them that I felt Japanese  companies may not be exerting enough efforts to sell Japanese  cars in China and that because of that, Japanese companies may  need to do some soul searching. Anyhow, I think Japanese  companies need to exert efforts.    The amount of trade between Japan and China was about $37.8  billion dollars last year. This is about three times as much as  that of 1972. The amount of Sino-Japanese trade changed  significantly each year in the last 10 years. on average,  however, it increased by more than 10 percent each year. Amount  of bilateral trade will exceed $70 billion in 2000 and reach  $190 billion in 2010 if the trade between Japan and China  continues to grow at the current rate. Deputy Premier Zhu  Rongji said today that the amount may become more than that.  However, the figures I have just quoted were results of  calculations based on the current growth rate. Moreover, the  total amount of Japanese investments in China was $5.170 billion  as of the end of September last year. More than third of that  amount was invested after 1992. This tells us that the scale of  economic relations between the two countries is larger than  bilateral ties between any other countries in the world. I  believe that it will be very important for both countries to  maintain such large trade relations.    Economic relations between Japan and China have changed from  vertical ties [suichoku kankei] of the past to horizontal  cooperative ties [suiheiteki kyoryoku kankei]. Both countries'  ties with international economy became stronger than before. It  is very important for Japan and China to promote cooperation as  responsible partners for the world economy. I am confident that  the future of economic relations between Japan and China will be  bright.    [Reporter] I am Sun Dongmin from RENMIN RIBAO. I would like  to ask about relations between China and Japan. The purpose of  your visit to China is to foster future-oriented relations  between the two countries. It is often said that answering the  question on how to handle and perceive historical problems  between the two countries is the starting point to establish  friendly ties. To establish future-oriented relations, how  should the two nations handle historial problems? Or how should  they make efforts to resolve them? I would like to ask you  about these.    [Hosokawa] When I took office last August, I disclosed my  views on historical problems between the two countries in my  inaugural speech to Diet. At my meetings with Premier Li Pend  and President Jiang Zemin, I said that I will make further  efforts to nurture future-oriented bilateral ties on the basis  of self-examination of the past history. In response, the  Chinese leaders expressed their approval. I am fully aware that  Chinese people still have negative feeling. As I said at the  outset, I have been talking about this feeling since last year.  [Live coverage ends with the news conference in progress]</p>

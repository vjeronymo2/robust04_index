			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / OECD says coal closures will cut fuel costs THE planned closure of coal mines should lead to cheaper energy and cut environmental costs, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. The latest OECD survey of the UK economy says taxes on fuel should be more closely related to the amount of pollution they cause. In a special section on the environment, the survey says there are 'inconsistencies' in the tax treatment of specific fuels which act against goals of reducing pollution. It adds: 'Removing artificial barriers to fuel substitution and conservation and establishing energy prices which better reflect potential environmental damage are likely to be the most cost-efficient means of protecting the environment.' The OECD suggests measures to relate taxes and other charges on vehicles more directly to road use, rather than ownership of cars or lorries. As well as reducing pollutants such as nitrogen oxides from vehicle exhausts, such 'road pricing' mechanisms could help reduce traffic congestion and energy use. The study says Britain's heavy dependence on burning coal for electricity generation contributes to the large volumes of carbon dioxide and sulphur oxides entering the atmosphere from the UK, at rates above the European Community average. It welcomes the projected rapid substitution of natural gas for coal in a new power stations. Distortions in environment-related tax and pricing mechanisms highlighted by the OECD include: Household energy use is exempt from value added taxation, while investment in energy saving is subject to VAT at the normal rate, factors which do nothing to encourage energy saving. Public transport receives relatively low government subsidies, while private parking provided by employers is exempt from taxation as a benefit in kind. Few households have meters to control the water supply, which may promote profligate use of water. OECD urges tax rise, Page 8</p>

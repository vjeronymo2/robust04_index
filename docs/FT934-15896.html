			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Palestine scores a winning state debut NEVER mind secret talks in Norwegian farmhouses, White House handshakes or the Cairo summit. The real process of Palestinian self-determination began yesterday at a Jericho football stadium, a grassless dust-bowl set in the rolling reddish-brown hills outside the city. The Palestine national football team took to their home field for the first time in almost 50 years to play a French national side. True to the dawning spirit of West Bank enterprise, a light aircraft buzzed overhead trailing a banner advertising the services of a building contractor in the neighbouring town of Nablus. The French fielded a team packed with veterans from their 1980s glory years, with Michel Platini, once one of Europe's finest players, still the cultured maestro in midfield. The Palestinians, typically, had their side chosen by committee - the players picked from their West Bank and Gaza leagues. 'This is more than a soccer match,' said Mr Saev Erakat, the Palestinian peace negotiator who acted as master of ceremonies from a wobbly wooden stand at one end of the pitch. 'This marks the beginning of the state.' 'For the first time in most of our lives,' added Mr Nabil Abu-Znaid, a Hebron university official sitting nearby, 'we can today carry our national flag, sing our national anthem, cheer our national team. This is the kind of event that turns people's minds from the depression of the occupation to the optimism of state-building.' Inevitably this 'meeting of sport and peace', as it was billed, under the distant 'patronage of president Yassir Arafat', was a chaotic affair. But it was good-natured chaos. The ground is supposed to hold 4,000 spectators, but there were many times that number present, pushing right up to the touchlines. An attempt by the Palestinian players to loosen up before kick-off prompted a pitch invasion. Locals dragged players away for hugs, kisses and photographs. The team beat a hasty retreat to the dressing rooms. Half-an-hour after the scheduled kick-off time Mr Erakat and his cohorts at the microphone were still appealing for the crowd to clear the pitch, but the drum and bagpipe bands marched on and small posses of Palestinian youths circled the ground under huge PLO flags. Finally, to tumultuous applause, the French team appeared, their blue shirts printed with a special 'Jericho 93' insignia. Mr Erakat insisting that the chaos did not augur badly for the organisational challenges Palestine will soon face. The final score, despite Mr Platini's artistry, was a 1-0 win for the Palestinians - the French probably the victims of their good manners and the heat. Asked before the game whether he thought his team would emerge victorious, Mr Erakat had replied, with a sweeping gesture over the milling crowds: 'We have already won.'

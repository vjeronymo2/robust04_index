			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] BEIJING, March 22 (AFP) -- Bao Ge, the Shanghai  dissident who was picked up by police for questioning Monday,  said Tuesday he had been released after 22 hours of  interrogation.    "I was released Tuesday around 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT), but I  am  still under constant surveillance by the police," he said by  phone from Shanghai.    Bao had published a letter to Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, calling on him to apologize for Japan's  wartime atrocities in China and pay reparations to survivors.  Since last Friday -- the day Hosokawa arrived for a three-day  visit to China -- Bao has been watched around the clock by the  authorities and had his home telephone cut off. His detention  coincided with Hosokawa's visit to Shanghai, which lasted  several hours.    Bao, 31, has fought for years for reparations from Japan,  and  has already been to prison several times for his campaign.  China officially abandoned its demands for war reparations in  1972.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (3): New products to hold the line - US exchanges' share of world trading shrink US COMMODITIES exchanges, once pre-eminent in the world futures industry, are fighting to stem erosion of their world market share. As futures trading has spread globally and foreign exchanges have blossomed, American markets have seen their slice of trading shrink. Last year, US exchanges captured just 53.2 per cent of world trading, down from 58.9 per cent in 1990, according to figures from the Futures Industry Association. A decade ago, American exchanges cornered virtually all trading. 'We had 100 per cent of the volume. That doesn't leave a lot of room to go up,' said Les Moucher, chief of the Chicago Board of Trade's new products committee and second vice-chairman of the exchange. US exchanges say their slide was to be expected as the inevitable result of the growth of futures - a process that they themselves encouraged. But they are trying to hold the line against any greater loss with a flock of new and innovative products and the introduction of off-hours electronic trading. At the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the oldest and largest US exchange, two of the industry's most novel new products are in the offing: insurance and pollution futures. Although scepticism about insurance futures has dogged their development and the regulatory hurdles have been many, the exchange says it will launch property and casualty (better known as homeowners') insurance futures and health insurance futures this year. Pollution futures, or clean-air futures as the CBOT prefers to call them, will be based on the pollution permits issued by the US government under a provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Industries can trade in these permits in order to adjust how they comply with the law's new standards. The futures are likely to be launched in early 1993, when the first auction of permits takes place. These two ideas may break new ground for the futures industry, but their success is by no means assured. Roughly, only one in four futures contracts succeeds and, unfortunately for the CBOT, it has had its share of flops lately. The most significant of these failures are the three-year and five-year swap futures, launched with a fanfare last year. This was the first straightforward attempt by an exchange to attract off-exchange business in products similar to futures. The increase in off-exchange derivatives trading is cited, along with foreign competition, as a barrier to more trading on US exchanges. But CBOT officials say that swap dealers are boycotting the contracts because they perceive them as directly competitive. The exchange argues they are not substitutes for swaps, and faults itself for not having marketed the contracts better. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where volume rose by 5 per cent last year, has in contrast been on a roll. It has already launched two interesting new products this year: futures and futures-options on the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap Index, and non-dollar settled Deutsche Mark/yen cross-rate futures and futures-options. It also is planning to expand its equity index offerings with contracts on the FT-SE 100, Eurotrack 100 and Eurotrack 200, and the Russell 2000 index of small capitalisation shares. It is looking, too, at contracts in Euroyen and EuroDeutsche Marks. While it is not breaking entirely fresh ground, it is having greater success building on its product bases in equities, short-term interest rates and currencies. If there is a cloud over the CME, it is Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system. Conceived by the CME, Globex is being developed with Reuters and the CBOT. Once heralded as the key to internationalisation of the futures markets, Globex has suffered three years of delays and is beginning to look more like an adjunct to that process - and perhaps not even the most technologically advanced one. Recent trials are said to have gone well, but start-up plans are still uncertain. The New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) may indeed beat Globex with its Access system, using technology from AT&amp;T. Given the global and round-the-clock nature of the oil business, Nymex's Access may stand a better chance of success in drawing in new international business than Globex will for Chicago. Nymex has also recently begun trading with modest success a sour crude contract, of special interest to far eastern traders. While 1991 was a bad year for US futures markets - overall trading volume dipped for the first time since 1968 - American options exchanges fared no better. In the two largest markets, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the American Stock Exchange (Amex), volume dipped 6 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively. The good news for the US futures and options markets is that 1992 is off to a flying start, with volume increases all round. This comes as an especially welcome development for options exchanges which have seen slippage since 1987. The CBOE has churned up substantial interest in its long-term options (LEAPs), both for the S&amp;P100 and 500 indices and for individual stock options. It also has FT-SE products coming up, is close to agreement on the Russell 2000 index, and is discussing the possibility of a Mexican market index. At present, some 15 per cent of CBOE's trading volume is from foreign investors, and it hopes that more foreign-based contracts, while largely for domestic consumption, could increase that business. The Amex has led US options exchanges in listing foreign equity derivatives, such as warrants on the Nikkei stock index, the FT-SE and France's CAC-40. It has also just launched the first US warrant on the British pound. The new derivatives have given the Amex some trading dynamism, but it hopes that the fresh interest in traditional options shown by investors since last October will continue. Both the CBOE and the Amex saw investors return to options after they had begun listing multiply-traded (that is, traded in two or more markets) options at the end of last October. They are also benefiting from the surge of money into equities since a drop in interest rates lessened the appeal of fixed income instruments. Each of the exchanges is also working on a bio-tech index.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    FUTURES AND OPTIONS VOLUME: THE TOP 10 EXCHANGES (CONTRACTS TRADED)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1990           1991       % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chicago Board of Trade        154,227,816   139,437,298   (9.59) Chicago Mercantile Exchange   102,988,293   108,128,616    4.99 New York Mercantile Exchange   42,458,651    40,786,714   (3.94) London International Financial Futures Exchange               34,169,529    38,583,877   12.92 Matif (Paris)                  28,056,573    37,129,032   32.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Osaka Ssecurities Exchange     22,776,790    33,478,949   46.99 BM&amp;F (Brazil)                   9,875,196    19,027,057   92.68 London Metal Exchange          13,352,954    16,937,909   26.85 Tokyo Stock Exchange           21,623,268    16,601,899  (23.22) Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange               14,450,989    15,152,964    4.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Futures Industry Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           PERFORMANCE OF ASSET CLASSES: ANNUAL RETURN (%)*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            US             International Managed Year     stocks1  Bonds2    stocks3     futures4 1980      32.13    3.06      22.55       78.35 1981      -4.91    7.26      -2.27       11.03 1982      21.11   31.10      -1.85       10.40 1983      22.37    7.99      23.69        0.43 1984       6.11   15.02       7.39       21.22 1985      32.03   21.30      56.17       20.33 1986      18.55   15.62      69.45       -0.51 1987       5.23    2.29      24.64       60.97 1988      16.82    7.59      28.26       11.75 1989      31.52   14.23      10.55        4.79 1990      -3.18    8.29     -23.13       16.35 1991      30.57   16.13      12.13       11.3 Average   17.36   12.49      18.94       20.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 US stocks: S&amp;P 500 index (dividends reinvested); 2 Bonds: Shearson Lehman Government/Corporate Bonds Index (over one year with coupons reinvested); 3 International stocks: Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) Index; 4 Managed futures: MAR Dollar-weighted CTA Index; *Based on monthly data on an annualised basis.

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: Losses not a pointer to pit viability Sir, You reported ('TUC challenges claim of losses at 10 pits', October 21) British Coal's statement that the 10 pits due for closure after the 90-day consultation period were making losses of Pounds 31m 'in the financial year since April' and that this debarred them from having 'a role to play under any economic scenario'. Two points should be made about this figure. First, there is a strong seasonal element (holidays etc). In the first quarter of 1991-92 pits in the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire coalfields recorded only 10 per cent of their profit ('operating cash flow') for the year; and in the first two quarters only 22 per cent. Partial results for an (unspecified) early part of the financial year are therefore not a reliable indicator of the year's results. Second, even if the pits were on the road to annual losses, this would not be a reliable guide to future prospects given variability in mining conditions. The experience of all 50 pits over the past five years reveals 36 instances of losses in one year being followed by profits in the next, and this has already happened in five of the 50 threatened pits. Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, repeated in the House of Commons on October 21 that what distinguished the 10 was that 'they are losing money now'. Even if this were true over the past few months for each and every one of them (which British Coal has refused to reveal), it would be a quite unreliable guide to their future financial prospects, let alone their potential economic contribution. The government and British Coal have given absolutely no justification for separating out the 10 and excluding the 9m tonnes they produce and the 7,000 miners who work in them from what is supposed to be a thoroughgoing review of energy policy and the position of UK coal.

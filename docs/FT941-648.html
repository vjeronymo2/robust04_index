			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Automated Security falls to Pounds 11.8m Automated Security (Holdings), the international electronic security systems company, turned in sharply lower full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.8m for the year to November 30, mainly reflecting the absence of a Pounds 30.3m profit on the sale of discontinued business the previous year. The group caused a furore last autumn when it went ahead with an enhanced scrip dividend in lieu of its 3.05p interim despite a sharp fall in its share price triggered by an earlier profits warning. It is now proposing an ordinary scrip issue in lieu of the final dividend. Under the terms of the scheme, shareholders are being offered one share for every 48 held in lieu of a 2.25p final. The shares closed up 1p at 109p. The pre-tax result compares with restated pre-tax profits of Pounds 45.1m which included the profit on the sale of the group's European security and specialist CCTV business. Earnings per share fell to 2.4p (25.8p.) Ash said pre-tax profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 9.6m.) Turnover from continuing operations increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 153.5m (Pounds 127.3m), including Pounds 10.1m from acquisitions. Total group turnover slipped to Pounds 160.8m (Pounds 173.2m), including Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 45.9m) from discontinued operations. The group said it experienced 'difficult trading conditions in the UK during the first nine months,' but noted that market recovery was reflected in a 23 per cent increase in fourth quarter operating profits to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 5.7m) on revenues which grew by 14 per cent to Pounds 44.1m (Pounds 38.7m.) Overall full-year operating profits fell by almost 28 per cent to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 26.9m) including Pounds 706,000 attributed to acquisitions but after a Pounds 4.97m loss (Pounds 5.35m profit) from discontinued operations. The UK operations lifted their contribution to operating profits by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 21m on revenues up 12.3 per cent to Pounds 110m spurred by the success of the group's new verification products and the acquisition of Telecom Security. During the year the group completed its restructuring with the consolidation of its two main operating companies in the UK. This led to restructuring and reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.38m, down from Pounds 3.73m in 1992. In the US operating profits increased by 34.6 per cent to Pounds 7.6m on revenues which grew by 48.3 per cent to Pounds 43.5m, helped by a strong performance by Sonitrol.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICKETING OF HOMES PROHIBITED;  </P> <P> PROTESTS: THE BAN BY SUPERVISORS APPLIES ONLY TO UNINCORPORATED AREAS. BOARD  MEMBERS FEAR PICKETS AT THEIR RESIDENCES AND HOPE CITIES WILL FOLLOW THEIR  LEAD.  </P> <P> Facing the possibility of protests in front of their homes by Los Angeles  County employees who do not want to lose their free parking privileges, the  Board of Supervisors on Tuesday passed a law that prohibits picketing of  "private residences."  </P> <P> The urgency ordinance, which took effect immediately, applies only to  unincorporated areas of the county -- where none of the five supervisors or  Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon live. But county officials said they  hope that local cities will follow their lead and outlaw the picketing of  homes.  </P> <P> The board approved the measure 4-0 without discussion. Supervisor Pete  Schabarum was absent.  </P> <P> County officials said they proposed the ordinance after members of Local 660 of  the Service Employees International Union threatened to march in front of the  supervisors' homes to protest a proposal that county employees who work in the  Civic Center pay for parking.  </P> <P> The parking fees are part of a traffic-reduction plan the county submitted this  year to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> Union officials have argued for several weeks against the proposal -- which  they said could cost clerical workers as much as $1,400 a year -- but they  denied threatening to picket homes of county officials.  </P> <P> "But if we want to do that, we believe that it is our right to do so. This  ordinance certainly won't stop us," said Local 660 general manager Sharon  Grimpe Correll.  </P> <P> She noted that Local 660 picketed Dixon's Burbank home in January in a dispute  over fringe benefits.  </P> <P> Union lawyers will consider challenging the new ordinance as a violation of  constitutional rights to free speech and public assembly, Correll said.  </P> <P> But the county counsel's office said a U.S. Supreme Court decision allows  prohibitions against the picketing of homes. In 1988, the high court upheld a  Wisconsin town's ordinance that made it "unlawful for any person to engage in  picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual."  </P> <P> In a case stemming from protests outside an abortion doctor's home, Justice  Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that "there is simply no right to force speech into  the home of an unwilling listener."  </P> <P> A picketing ordinance previously was discussed by the supervisors because of  protests but never voted on, said Frederick R. Bennett, assistant county  counsel.  </P> <P> In 1987, about 200 people marched in front of Supervisor Mike Antonovich's home  in Glendale to demand hospice care for dying AIDS patients. A year earlier, 150  animal-rights activists marched in front of Supervisor Ed Edelman's Westwood  home in an attempt to prevent the county Department of Animal Care and Control  from selling some shelter animals to researchers.  </P></p>

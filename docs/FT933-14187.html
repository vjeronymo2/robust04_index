			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Judgment against Crest Nicholson Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, yesterday received an adverse judgment in the High Court arising from its decision to rescind a contract to purchase development land at Ford's Farm, Calcot, near Reading, in 1988. The court held that Crest had wrongfully refused to complete the purchase of the land and awarded damages and interest amounting to Pounds 1.7m against Crest, which was also ordered to pay three quarters of the plaintiff's costs. Crest said the loss arising from the judgment, which is expected to amount to about Pounds 2m, would be charged as an exceptional item in the accounts for the year to October 31. Crest shares closed 3p lower at 59p.</p>

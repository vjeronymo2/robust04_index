			<p>BFN     [Text] Secessionist fortifications in the al-Dali' area  were blown up the day before yesterday [14 May]. Their  destruction was attended by a large number of people who  announced their rejection of the despotic and secessionist gang  that ruled tyrannically over the people of al-Dali' throughout  the period of the abominable totalitarian rule.    Many people arrived in al-Dali' city declaring their support  for the legitimate authority. They also declared that they were  joining with the forces of constitutional legitimacy that have  returned life to normal and provided them with all means of  security and protection from any threat posed by the remnants of  secession and apostasy, which have been completely uprooted from  the region.</p>

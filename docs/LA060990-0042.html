			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: ALEMANY'S ROSSELLI TO TAKE PART IN GIANT ROOKIE TRAINING CAMP  </P> <P> Joey Rosselli of Alemany High will leave Monday for a mini-training camp with  the San Francisco Giants' rookie-league team in Everett, Wash., after signing a  professional contract Thursday night.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-1, 180-pound left-handed pitcher was selected in the third round of  the amateur draft Monday.  </P> <P> He would not reveal his signing bonus but said it was about $100,000. In  addition, the Giants have provided a $40,000 fund for college if Rosselli  decides to return to school. In February, he signed a letter of intent to play  football at Arizona State.  </P> <P> Rosselli was 7-3 with a 1.12 earned-run average for the Indians and also batted  .425 with nine doubles, three triples, five home runs and 23 runs batted in.  </P> <P> John Jones, an offensive lineman at Kennedy High, has signed a letter of intent  to play football at Kansas. Jones signed after a three-day visit this week to  the campus in Lawrence, Kan.  </P> <P> The 6-2, 280-pound tackle anchored Kennedy's offensive line last fall and was  selected to The Times' All-Valley team. He chose Kansas over Cal State  Fullerton because of the Jayhawks' superior engineering program, according to  Kennedy Coach Bob Francola.  </P> <P> Mike Bruce, a catcher at Canoga Park High, was selected in the 19th round of  the amateur baseball draft by the Seattle Mariners. Bruce (6-1, 185 pounds)  batted .250 with four doubles in 44 at-bats.  </P> <P> Bruce said he has not decided whether to sign.  </P> <P> Pitcher Melissa Thatcher of Agoura High and catcher Julie Coert from Santa  Paula were named softball co-most valuable players in the Frontier League.  Nordhoff's Rick Mohney and Agoura's Linda Moule were co-coaches of the year.  </P></p>

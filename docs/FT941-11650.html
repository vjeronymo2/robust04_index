			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A risky strategy and threat to Japanese partnerships (1) Sir, BMW's acquisition of Rover is a bold and imaginative strategy to hit three birds with one stone: to acquire Land Rover 4x4 technology, products and markets, and to stuff its two principal global competitors, Mercedes Benz and Honda. If Rover can be successfully assimilated it will be a remarkable coup. However, it needs to be recalled that research demonstrates, and experience in this industry more than confirms, that the success ratio for mergers and acquisitions is no better than one in two. Also, BMW has got to where it is today by the successful management of organic growth, not through acquisition. Time alone will tell if BMW's top management can successfully manage this, its first, acquisition without squandering the opportunities it clearly presents or doing serious damage to Land Rover, one of the UK's incontestably world-class businesses. D R G Andrews, (chairman, Land Rover Group 1982-86), Gainford, Mill Lane, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 8BA</p>

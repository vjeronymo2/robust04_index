			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LABOR IS ON THE DEFENSIVE, KIRKLAND ADMITS, BLAMES CORPORATE RAIDERS  </P> <P> AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland conceded today that organized labor is on the  defensive but said "it's the only side to be on" when faced with an offensive  from corporate raiders.  </P> <P> Kirkland, joined at a labor rally by a host of labor leaders and hundreds of  trade unionists -- many of them on strike against Bell Atlantic, Pittston Coal  Group and Eastern Airlines -- decried the 1980s wave of entrepreneurs trying to  "loot, pillage, strip and dismantle" companies.  </P> <P> "Is labor on the defensive?" Kirkland asked. "Realistically, yes . . . because  a new type of company is on the attack. They are not just attacking trade  unions, they are attacking the basic principles on which the country was  founded."  </P> <P> Union officials estimated the crowd at 1,500, although police put the figure at  about half that.  </P></p>

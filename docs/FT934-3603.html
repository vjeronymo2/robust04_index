			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Resurrecting the wages fund Sir, So 'most economists subscribe to a core of theory - mostly micro-economic - that is useful and should therefore be heeded by politicians' (Michael Prowse, December 2, reviewing Alfred Malabre's book Lost Prophets). I am intrigued - what core of theory has he in mind? Given that the Treasury has now decided that the pay of all public sector workers over the next few years must be met out of an existing wage bill, and that therefore jobs must be traded for higher wages, which economists did the chancellor heed when resurrecting the 'wages fund' doctrine?

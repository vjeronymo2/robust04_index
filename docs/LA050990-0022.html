			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  </P> <P> I enjoy reading the Bible occasionally, but if the Christians, among others,  who believe in capital punishment had lived in the time of Moses and Jesus,  two-thirds of the Bible would never have been written.  </P> <P> The principal subject of the Torah, or Old Testament, was Moses and what  happened after he murdered the Egyptian guard before leading his people out of  Egypt.  </P> <P> Then, the New Testament was mostly written by Saul, who changed his name to  Paul, after aiding in murdering the young Christian, Stephen. Before these two  murderers would have had time to reform and be productive, California capital  punishment advocates would have put them in the gas chamber.  </P> <P> Christ said, "It is written an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but I  say unto you, love your enemies, do good to them who persecute you."  </P> <P> Christians do exactly the opposite in advocating capital punishment which  premeditates the murder of people who premeditate murder.  </P> <P> BUDDY PIPER  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

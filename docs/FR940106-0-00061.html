			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to the ABCs and Harvest Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1994 final ABCs are changed from the 1993 levels for the following species: Pacific whiting, shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, chilipepper, yellowtail rockfish, remaining rockfish, English sole, and petrale sole. These changes are based on the best available scientific information. Information considered in determining the ABCs is available from the Council (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and was distributed to the public in the Council's stock assessment and fishery evaluation (SAFE) document. The SAFE document, required under the guidelines for Fishery Management Plans at 50 CFR part 602, summarizes the best available scientific information concerning the past, present, and possible future condition of the stocks and fisheries being managed under Federal regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those species or species groups with harvest guidelines in 1993 will continue to be managed with harvest guidelines in 1994. As in 1993, no quotas are established. The harvest guidelines are changed from those for 1993 for Pacific whiting, jack mackerel, Pacific ocean perch (POP), shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, thornyheads, yellowtail rockfish, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  complex in the Vancouver/Columbia subareas, Dover sole in the Columbia subarea and coastwide, and new harvest guidelines are established for lingcod coastwide and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  complex in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes to the ABCs and harvest guidelines are described below. All other ABC and annual harvest guideline specifications announced in Tables 1 and 2 for 1993 (58 FR 2990, January 7, 1993) will apply again in 1994 and are included in Table 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lingcod. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The ABC for lingcod remains at 7,000 mt, but a new harvest guideline is established at 4,000 mt in 1994, approximating peak landings during the past 10 years. Landings ranged between 3,000 and 3,500 mt in 1989&hyph;1991. The ABC is based on historical landings rather than a scientific stock assessment, and has not been updated since 1986. A stock assessment for lingcod is planned for the near future. The Council was concerned that the new open-access fishery would expand its lingcod harvest. In order to discourage expansion pending completion of the new stock assessment, a harvest guideline was designated. Based on the harvest guideline, open-access and limited-entry allocations are being specified. If effort shifts into this fishery, trip limits may be imposed to keep landings within the allocations and/or harvest guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pacific whiting.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ABC for Pacific whiting in 1994 (325,000 mt for the United States (U.S.) and Canada combined) is substantially higher than in 1993 (177,000 mt) for several reasons. The 1992 hydroacoustic survey utilized new, more sensitive equipment, and extended further offshore and further north to better encompass the range of pacific whiting. As a result, the biomass estimate was more than double the previous estimate. In recent years, the Council has adopted a hybrid fishing strategy that combines the features of a constant fishing mortality (F) strategy at higher levels of biomass, and, at lower levels of biomass, a variable F strategy where fishing mortality for a particular year in proportional to the level of female spawning biomass. If this moderate harvest policy is applied to the new projected numbers in 1994, the potential yield would be 450,000 mt. However, the Council recommended a more conservative harvest rate for 1994, which provides a yield of 325,000 mt, to provide for cautious exploitation until further information can be obtained; the large increase in projected yield is due to a single survey estimate that will not be replicated until 1995. In addition, the Council felt it prudent to acknowledge the possibility of a combined U.S. and Canadian harvest in excess of the U.S.-Canada ABC as occurred in 1992 and 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These overages (15 percent in 1993) have not caused a biological problem, particularly given the large increase in the ABC in 1994. The Council recommended that the U.S. share in 1994 continue at 80 percent of the U.S.-Canada ABC, as was the case in 1993, providing a U.S. harvest guideline of 260,000 mt. If Canada continues to calculate its share in the same manner as in 1992 and 1993, the U.S. and Canadian total harvest would be 14 percent above the coastwide ABC in 1994. However, the total harvest would be lower than the overfishing level, and lower than the amount that would have been taken if the Council had chosen to use the moderate harvest rate level, as in 1993, in determining the ABC. If recruitment remains near the median level, a decline in annual yield is expected over the next few years, and will be slightly more severe if the catch exceeds the harvest guideline. Bilateral negotiations with Canada are expected to continue to resolve this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Jack mackerel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The ABC is maintained at 52,600 mt, the same level as in 1993, and the harvest guideline is adjusted upward to equal the ABC. In 1992, the harvest guideline has been set at 46,500 mt, lower than the ABC, to deduct the amount of jack mackerel that was expected to be taken beyond 200 nautical miles (nm). However, the fishery did not materialize and the Council recommended setting the harvest guideline equal to ABC in 1993. This change inadvertently was not announced with the 1993 specifications in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  so the correction is made for 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

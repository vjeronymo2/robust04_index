			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FAIRFIELD;  </P> <P> ELK HUNT PROTESTERS BLOCKED NEAR REFUGE  </P> <P> Protesters opposed to the hunting of Tule elk said eight demonstrators were  arrested during a weekend confrontation with authorities on a bridge to the  Grizzly Island wildlife area. Police were barring demonstrators from using the  bridge to reach the island, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Animal  Law said.  </P> <P> The group said it was protesting the killing of 30 Tule elk. In all, 26  protesters have been arrested during the three-week campaign against the  hunting, which the group said it has been protesting for several years. The  foundation said it intends to go to court to challenge the latest arrests on  grounds that only protesters were denied passage to the island. About 60  demonstrators were met by about 50 officers of the state Department of Fish and  Game and the Solano County Sheriff's Department, the group added.  </P></p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Bonn crusader shares vision of circular rubbish / Exploring a dramatic new chapter in Germany's environment laws GERMANY'S messianic environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, has a way with words. In his book, rubbish is not garbage: it is a secondary raw material. In his mind's eye he sees product cycles not as lines littered with ups and downs, but as near-perfect circles. This vision lies at the heart of his latest offering, tabled at the weekend. His 'circulation economy law', he said, 'will bring about a change in the behaviour of manufacturers, distributors and consumers' and spell the end for 'ecological subsidies in our way of life'. The aim of the new law - in reality a top-to-bottom amendment of existing legislation on the handling and treatment of rubbish - is to force manufacturers and distributors of all goods to take their products back at the end of their useful life. They must then either be re-used, recycled or burnt in power plant. Only those remnants with no possible use may be classed as 'rubbish' and dumped in the traditional way. The costs of collection and reprocessing should be included in the selling price, but must not exceed existing public authority charges for waste handling and disposal, he said. Transformation of today's throwaway society into the circulation economy would take 10 years or more. Part new, part recycled, Mr Topfer's initiative is a logical, if dramatic new chapter in a long-running series of environmental strictures from the Environment Ministry. Since December 1 last year, transport packaging of all goods has routinely been taken back for recycling. Since April, German shops have been kitted out with bins to collect outer-packs from self-service goods: items such as toothpaste boxes. From January 1 next year consumers will be able to drop off the toothpaste tube and other sales packs - cigarette boxes, yoghurt pots - on their shopping trips, and a 50 pfennig charge becomes payable on drinks cans. Virtually all supermarket goods are marked with a green spot, the sign that a levy has been paid to Duales System Deutschland (DSD), a joint company set up by industry and retailers, to pay for collection and recycling through private channels working in parallel with but independently of the public waste network. Half the packaging industry's 600,000-tonne annual demand for tinplate is recycled. By 1995, DSD says, the proportion will be 72 per cent. Or, in Mr Topfer's language, the circle will be 72 per cent complete.</p>

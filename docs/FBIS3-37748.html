			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe February 22 TASS -- A note of the Tajik  Foreign Ministry was sent to the Afghan consul in Dushanbe today  to accuse the Afghan authorities of interference in Tajik  internal affairs. The note to be passed over to the Afghan  leaders says the Afghan side violates the bilateral treaty on  friendship, cooperation and good-neighbourly relations signed in  December 1993.    In the opinion of the Tajik side, the accusations are  grounded with the assignment of Afghan border territories to  militants of the Tajik opposition, who systematically shell  Russian border posts and Tajik villages together with Afghan  mujaheddin not controlled by the official Kabul authorities.    Several populated localities of the border Shuro-Abad region  in the Tajik south were shelled on February 21 from Afghan  territory, says the document. A many-hour fighting was imposed  on the 12th border post of the Moscow border unit by a mixed  group of Tajik militants and Afghan mujaheddin who infiltrated  inside Tajikistan.    The Tajik government also has information on preparations  for  terrorist acts and acts of sabotage in the border Shaartuz,  Kabodien, Pyandzh and some other regions in the Tajik south.    The Tajik side demands that the Afghan leadership take the  most decisive measures to prevent hostile actions against  sovereign Tajikistan and the Russian border units, says the  document. Otherwise, the Tajik government preserves the right to  stop armed provocations up to destruction of Tajik militants'  bases on Afghan territory.</p>

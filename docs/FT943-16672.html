			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Nadir fails to lift court order:  Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former head of Polly Peck International, has failed in an attempt to lift the bankruptcy order in place on him in the UK The High Court yesterday extended the order indefinitely. It could otherwise have expired after three years. Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, said that to apply for the order to be lifted Mr Nadir would have to demonstrate that he had co-operated with his court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy, which was unlikely given that Mr Nadir failed to co-operate on a number of occasions.</p>

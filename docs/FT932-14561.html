			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Easter at Salzburg is changing its tune - The Wagner-and-verismo days are numbered THE SHADOW of Herbert von Karajan may have been displaced from Salzburg last summer by the explosive impact of Gerard Mortier, but it still hangs heavy over the Easter Festival. This is the private festival Karajan founded in 1967 for himself and his rich friends and admirers. Unlike the publicly-funded summer event, which had an identity before and beyond him, Karajan was the Easter Festival. Its 3,800 Forderer (supporters) paid an annual fee of up to Pounds 800 to attend one opera performance and three concerts, after each of which the standing ovation was as precisely orchestrated as the music. Since his death in 1989, the 'Karajan pilgrims' have continued to visit Salzburg at Easter to pay their respects. There is still an air of mourning  -exemplified this year by two performances of Brahms' German Requiem, preceded by a minute's silence, with no applause at the end. But the festival is finally being forced to look to the future and its long-term survival. Without Karajan, some festival-goers decided Salzburg was no longer worth supporting. Last year, the management had a nasty spat with the new regime at the Summer Festival, on whom it depends for co-production finance and set-building facilities. A power vacuum has developed. The Easter Festival is still a limited company controlled by Karajan's heirs  -his widow Eliette and their two daughters, who have shown no more than figure-head interest. The executor of the Karajan estate, the Swiss lawyer Werner Kupper, has a big say, but he is out of his depth in the arts. The festival administrator, Beate Burchhard, is not a strong personality in the Mortier mould. The artistic director for the past three years, Georg Solti, is a busy international conductor, not a native of Salzburg. The same can be said of his successor, Claudio Abbado, who shared this year's conducting workload. But there is enough support - and reserve cash - to make plans, all of which suggests this Easter may have been a watershed. Next year Abbado will conduct Herbert Wernicke's new staging of Boris Godunov. There is talk of Wozzeck in 1995 with Bryn Terfel in the title role. The rift with Mortier has been patched up and an agreement signed for co-productions until 1997. What matters now is the extent of Abbado's interest: whether he is willing to learn new operas (Lulu for example) and make the Easter Festival artistically, not just legally, independent of the Summer Festival. Whatever the outcome, the Berlin Philharmonic is eager to continue its 25-year association - conveniently so for Salzburg, because the orchestra's concert expenses are covered by the Berlin Senate. The Easter Festival's overwhelmingly conservative patrons may have to modify their traditional diet of Wagner-and-verismo, but at least the artistic standard will be maintained. Salzburg at Easter has undoubted charm. The city is less crowded than in summer, the weather more temperate, and there is just one daily performance in the early evening, which helps to work up an appetite. Audiences may be uncritical, but at least there is an air of concentration. Karajan knew what he was doing. This year's festival was a mixed success. In an all-Richard Strauss concert, Martha Argerich provided just the right blend of temperament and virtuosity to pull off the quirky Burleske, while Till Eulenspiegel found Abbado and the orchestra in superlative form. As for Solti, his endearing mannerisms and sheer energy at the age of 80 were fascinating  - he has never really mellowed. But he and the Berlin Philharmonic inhabit different musical worlds. Given anything other than extremely quiet or lyrical music, Solti just drives through, an amalgam of nervous torso jerks, attacking downbeats and wrist-flicking tics. The orchestra's inbred tonal warmth, by contrast, softens the edges of everything it plays. Last Saturday's programme of Beethoven's Second Symphony and Shostakovich's Fifth provided the stylistic battleground. The orchestra's strings won out in the slow movements of each, particularly in the meditative solemnity of the Shostakovich. But Solti refused to let the Beethoven breathe, and made the Shostakovich finale too triumphantly emphatic to hint at irony. Where orchestra and conductor did find common ground was in the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde, a perfectly-graded performance of breathtaking translucence, which crowned a star-studded charity concert for Bosnia on Easter Sunday. The Berliners sounded less at home in the pit for Falstaff, this year's new opera production. Where Verdi calls for a nimble spring-in-the-step, they offered symphonic mass and less-than-sparkling ensemble. Their Vienna counterparts, who have the opera in their repertory, will probably make a better job when the production is revived in the summer. It was, nonetheless, a Falstaff of high musical values. This was the work which introduced Solti to Salzburg in 1937, as a 24-year old assistant to Toscanini - who had played cello in the premiere 100 years ago. Now the same age as Verdi was then, Solti paced the music with guileless ease, a master of its mercurial moods. His cast included Luciana Serra's flirtatious Alice, Marjana Lipovsek's imposing Mrs Quickly and a delectable pair of lovers in Luca Canonici and Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz. Paolo Coni sang Ford with virile authority, while Kim Begley, Pierre Lefebvre and Mario Luperi made a well-contrasted trio of comic comprimarios. Jose van Dam's Falstaff was no buffoon, but a stubby, scruffy, cantankerous old terrier, capable of scuttling a Pistol twice his size, alternately outrageous, dignified and randy. The acting was all in the voice. The staging was by Luca Ronconi, with designs by Margherita Palli and Vera Marzot. Like so many before them, they were seduced by the monumental breadth of the Grosses Festspielhaus stage, diluting the opera's intimate atmosphere in decor of architectural vastness. Some of Ronconi's ideas were distinctly odd: the Garter Inn resembled a bottling factory; Falstaff was tipped into the Fords' garden fish-pond; the last scene was a nonsensical Midsummer Night's Dream, with Falstaff's bedroom sprouting the foliage of Herne's Oak. If this was Ronconi's idea of fun, then for once the joke was on the producer.</p>

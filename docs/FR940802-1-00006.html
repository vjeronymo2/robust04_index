			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Existing Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in section A of this notice, ASTM has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary standard for baby walkers, ASTM F977. This standard has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance requirements that address walker tipover and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural failure. Falls down stairs are addressed by a warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label. The CPSC staff's compliance program, also discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section A of this notice, indicated a high level of conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the stair warning label requirement of the voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, ASTM is not considering performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements to address the hazard of children falling down  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stairs in walkers. ASTM members are waiting for completion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPSC data collection, discussed above, to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate direction for any new requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A voluntary safety standard published by the Canadian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Juvenile Products Association, effective June 1, 1989, requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers to be constructed to preclude their passage through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simulated door opening 900 mm (35.4 inches) in width. In Canada,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this standard had the same effect as a ban of the sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers. Walker manufacturers apparently believed that the low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market sales of walkers in Canada (about 150,000 annually as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to 4 million in the U.S.) did not justify redesigning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their products. However, due to the much larger market in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States, and the fact that this alternative retains much of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mobility of a traditional walker, the Commission has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason to believe that a standard similar to the Canadian one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would eliminate the U.S. market for baby walkers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> F. Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHSA is the appropriate act for regulating risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with baby walkers or other articles intended for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by children that present a mechanical hazard. 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 1261(F)(1)(D). Section 2(s) of the FHSA provides:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> An article may be determined (by rule) to present a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanical hazard if, in normal use or when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse, its design or manufacture presents an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .&blank;.&blank;. (4) from moving parts, (5) from lack or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficiency of controls to reduce or stop motion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .&blank;.&blank;. (8) because of instability, or (9) because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other aspect of the article's design or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 1261(s). The Commission's current regulations for baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers were issued under the FHSA. 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(6),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1500.86(a)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2(s) of the FHSA provides CPSC with jurisdiction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over unreasonable risks of children tipping over in walkers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being injured by a walker's moving or collapsible parts, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling down stairs in walkers. However, the primary risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with walkers is that of children falling down stairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The design features that may be implicated by this particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk include, for example, the absence of an effective way to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit or stop the product's motion and its ability to fit through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a standard doorway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Declaring that all walkers, or walkers that fail to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified criteria, are a hazardous substance because they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present a mechanical hazard would trigger the banning provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of FHSA &sect;2(q)(1)(A). This section of the act provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term ``banned hazardous substance'' includes ``any toy, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> article intended for use by children, which is a hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance.&blank;.&blank;. .'' 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proceeding under the FHSA to determine whether baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers present a mechanical hazard is being conducted under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 3(f)&hyph;(i) of the FHSA. This involves a three-stage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, commenced by the publication of this ANPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next stage in the rulemaking proceeding will be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision either to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``NPR'') or to terminate the proceeding. If the Commission decides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to continue the rulemaking proceeding after considering responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the ANPR, the Commission must publish the text of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, along with a preliminary regulatory analysis, in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with FHSA section 3(h). 15 U.S.C. 1262(h). If the Commission then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishes to issue a final rule, it must publish the text of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule and a final regulatory analysis that includes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements stated in section 3(i)(1) of the FHSA. 15 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1262(i)(1). Before the Commission may issue a final regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it must make statutory findings concerning voluntary standards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relationship of the costs and benefits of the rule; and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden imposed by the regulation. FHSA sec. 3(i)(2), 15 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1262(i)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> G. Regulatory Alternatives Under Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is considering alternatives to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of injuries and deaths related to baby walkers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Performance or design requirement. For the reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, it appears possible that a performance or design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement can be developed that will reduce the risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children falling down stairs in baby walkers. The staff is aware  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the following product designs intended to address the hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of falls down stairs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Walkers with a diameter larger than the normal door  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opening to prevent access to stairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Walkers with a ``wheel-stop'' mechanism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Walkers with mobility limited to a confined space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Stationary alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission concludes that it is possible to develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance or design requirement that will allow the use of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more of these designs to address the risk of falls down  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stairs. These alternatives are discussed separately below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wide walkers. The results of the analysis of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPSC special study indicate that walkers with a 36-inch-diameter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base theoretically could address 82 percent of the stair and step  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fall incidents, including almost all of the severe incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (falls down basement stairs). A 36-inch requirement would add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 6 to 10 inches to the diameter of walkers currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the market. There may be a perceived or actual loss of utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such a product in terms of actual use by a child if it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not fit between furniture in most households. Also, there would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a loss of convenience if the walker is too large for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convenient storage or for transporting to other locations by car.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

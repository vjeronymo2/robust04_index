			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Steel aid THE CRISIS in the European steel industry is coming to a head. Tomorrow the European Union's Council of Ministers meets to decide whether to approve hand-outs to state-owned steel companies in Italy, Germany and Spain. Today the European Commission is due to agree its line for the meeting. Both the Commission and governments from liberal states such as the UK, Holland and Denmark should hang tough. State aid is distorting the steel market by giving inefficient government-owned companies an unfair advantage over efficient private-sector groups which are already suffering from a severe recession. Moreover if subsidies are waved through without tight conditions in this case, there is a danger of a knock-on effect in other sectors, such as airlines, with the result that the whole single market programme could be brought into disrepute. The wrangle over steel subsidies has dragged on for almost a year. Over that period, Mr Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner, has sought to cajole recalcitrant governments into scaling back their hand-outs and closing loss-making mills. So far, he has reached deals with the Spanish and German governments. This has involved compromises on both sides. The Commission has provisionally approved more aid than competition purists would have liked; the governments have had to face the unpopularity of shutting factories. But Mr Van Miert has been unable to cut a deal with Italy. The government has said it will reduce the capacity of Ilva, its steel group, but not to the equivalent extent agreed with Spain and Germany. Mr Paolo Savona, the country's industry minister, has even threatened to go ahead without Commission approval and fight the issue in the European Court of Justice. The Commission must not slacken its resolve. Not only could further concessions to Ilva undermine the deals with Germany and Spain. Liberal countries, unhappy that the Commission has already compromised too much, could veto the whole package. If Italy can be brought into line without further concessions, the liberal states should go along with the restructuring plan. Though far from ideal, it would open the way for private sector steel groups to make matching capacity cuts and so help restore the industry's health. But if more compromises are made or Italy fails to reach agreement, other governments should have no qualms about voting the package down. Such toughness, of course, could mean there is no deal tomorrow. But no deal would be better than a bad deal. It is also possible that Italy, faced with the prospect of isolation, would draw back from the brink. If it does not, a postponement of the council until next month might be necessary. Thereafter, the Commission might have to use sanctions to resolve the deadlock.</p>

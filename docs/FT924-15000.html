			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Management: Fast forward on the disaster front at the BBC / A look at plans to test the new Producer Choice policy to destruction Greg Parston's main role in life is to encourage executives to fail - particularly in the public sector. In the past, he has persuaded senior managers from the East Anglia Regional Health Authority to make a muck of NHS reforms. Tomorrow, he will give BBC executives the opportunity to make serious errors in the implementation of Producer Choice, the Corporation's controversial new policy that will allow producers to buy services from the outside market. The simulated disasters are designed to help managers to avoid failure in the real world. As executive director of the Office For Public Management, set up to help public sector managers, he has developed simulations to help hard-pressed public service managers cope with rapid change and the often conflicting demands of quality, competition and maximum efficiency. 'We want to help managers explore in advance, without guilt,' says Parston, an American specialist in organisational behaviour who has also worked in healthcare management in the US. Because managers usually play themselves in the simulations and face real problems, Parston believes that management learning of the highest order occurs. 'They are using their knowledge to play out what could happen,' he argues. His first simulation in East Anglia, code-named The Rubber Windmill, revealed serious potential flaws in heath service reforms. Managers cheated on quality to balance their budgets. The experience led to the setting of standard quality objectives. Above all, Alisdair Liddell, general manager of the East Anglia authority believes the simulation demonstrated that regulation was needed to stop managers behaving in a way that could damage the organisation and also that purchasers of services had to collaborate behind a set of agreed objectives. The exercises have become annual events and the most recent suggested that the health service reforms were doomed to collapse within the next four years into cosy, bureaucratic arrangements that militate against change, unless action was taken. If anything similar is likely to happen with the BBC's Producer Choice initiative, Michael Starks, the executive responsible for introducing the policy, hopes to start finding out about it this week during two days of intensive horse-trading at a hotel in Kent. The BBC exercise, called Fast Forward, will bring together 80 players - senior managers and those experienced in commercial broadcasting, including independent producers. They will use Monopoly money to pay for the commissioning and making of programmes and to buy and sell services such as camera crews and editing time. And it will all happen very quickly. Each 15 minutes of the exercise will represent a month of real time. Every year will flash by in two-and-a-half-hours, and if everyone plays their part, the BBC should, by lunchtime on Friday, have accumulated three years worth of knowledge on what can go wrong with the new policy. 'The trial is not designed to see whether Producer Choice will crash. It is designed deliberately to crash it. It will enable the BBC to pinpoint and correct any weaknesses and help us to make sure we get it right when Producer Choice comes on line (in April),' says Starks. A dry run involving just 12 people, with consultants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand representing outside suppliers, threw up one clear conclusion - that the BBC executives were more entrepreneurial than the consultants. One of the main potential problems is double spending - that the BBC will be paying for a high level production base at the same time as producers are buying more services from the outside market. More than 90 business units have already drawn up detailed plans to identify the expected level of demand and prices based on market rates. The scheme has already led to redundancies as the individual business units have slimmed down. As the Monopoly money changes hands this week, the BBC should start to find out whether the unleashed trading instinct of producers and managers set a reasonable balance or crash through budgets and undermine the production base of the Corporation.</p>

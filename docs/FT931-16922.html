			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Distance learning MBA launched A NEW TYPE of distance-learning master of business administration degree for financial specialists is to be offered worldwide by a company set up by the University of Wales at Bangor and Manchester Business School. The degree - which the two institutions say is unique - has been designed for English-speaking managers in sectors such as banking, insurance, accountancy, building societies or corporate financial control. The MBA will be awarded by the University of Wales but be run by the company, which is called the Institute of Financial Management. The course has been designed by Manchester's Centre for Banking and Financial Services and Bangor's School of Accounting, Banking and Economics. A network of study support centres around the world will enable students to take the degree from anywhere in Australia, Africa, India, South America, the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia or the Far East. The course, which is spread over 30 months, will contain several short periods of full-time study, but most work will be done part-time in parallel with a normal job. It is open to graduates or people with equivalent banking, insurance or building society qualifications, or relevant management experience.</p>

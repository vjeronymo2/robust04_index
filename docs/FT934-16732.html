			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Geneticists have just identified the learning gene which brings a little nearer the day when it may be possible to ask the doctor to make your child a Kasparov. Public awareness of genetic engineering, both its possibilities and the attendant ethical dilemmas, is growing fast. Cracking the Code (BBC 2, 9.30), the series devoted to genetic engineering, strikes me as something of a missed opportunity. Cracking the Code is worthwhile and its American presenter, Dr David Suzuki, is a good communicator. However, it tends to underestimate viewers' sophistication and at times even a layman has the feeling that it is out of date. Furthermore, it is irritating to find yet another medical series which concentrates on the North American picture. If you found last week's two-hour opening instalment of Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (C4, 10.00) slow and insipid, I would agree. However, this series does build up momentum as it goes along. Strongly in its favour is Olympia Dukakis's performance as the surprising Mrs Madrigal, enchanting enough to make it worth it.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts (Openings): Salzburg Gerald Mortier has saved the biggest gamble of this year's festival until the end - a staging of Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex and Symphony of Psalms, which receives the first of three performances tonight. The production, occupying the vast expanse of the Grosses Festspielhaus, is directed by American enfant terrible Peter Sellars and designed by an avant-garde firm of German architects.</p>

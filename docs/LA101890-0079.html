			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEFED PROFIT SINKS; CITICORP PLANS BIG LAYOFF;  </P> <P> BANKING: BESET BY A BAD REAL ESTATE MARKET AND A SLOWING ECONOMY, FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS EVERYWHERE ARE HURTING.  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp. on Wednesday joined the ranks of large thrifts and banks  reporting poor third-quarter profits linked to a worsening real estate market  and an slowdown in the national economy.  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp., the San Diego-based parent of HomeFed Bank, the nation's  sixth-largest thrift, reported that net income for the third quarter ended  Sept. 30 fell 92% to $1.9 million from $23.9 million a year ago.  </P> <P> Separately, UnionFed Financial Corp., a medium-sized thrift based in Brea,  restated its earnings to reflect a loss of $30.9 million in its fourth quarter  ended June 30. The thrift, parent of Union Federal Savings Bank, previously  reported that it lost only $1.7 million in the quarter. Regulators forced the  thrift to write off or lower the value of troubled commercial real estate  loans.  </P> <P> Besides HomeFed, other major financial institutions reporting lower earnings  Wednesday included Glenfed Inc., NCNB Corp. and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group  Inc.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, New York banking giant Citicorp warned in a meeting with securities  analysts that it will lay off thousands and that the cost of the layoffs has  yet to be recognized in its earnings. The analysts said the job cuts in the  continuing program will likely total 5,000, at a cost of $100 million.  </P> <P> This has been a terrible week for banks and thrifts, as major institutions  throughout the country posted weak earnings or losses. Earlier this week, such  major institutions as Great Western Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills, Security  Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles and Citicorp reported sharp declines in earnings  stemming from real estate-related problems and the softer economy.  </P> <P> HomeFed was hurt by having to set aside additional money for possible losses on  loans and reduced income from real estate operations. While the thrift  experienced continued weakness in its commercial real estate and apartment loan  portfolios, HomeFed was also hampered by a statewide slowdown in single-family  home construction, Chief Executive Robert F. Adelizzi said.  </P> <P> While HomeFed continued to be plagued by its commercial real estate loan  portfolio, the San Diego-based S&amp;L's performance was "in line" with third  quarter reports by other major banks and thrifts in California, said Gary  Gordon, a Paine Webber Inc. analyst in New York.  </P> <P> "It's a case of misery loves company," Gordon said. "There's a clear problem,  no question about it, in the commercial real estate market. It's been growing  outside of California and now it's a growing problem within California."  </P> <P> Although down, earnings for Glenfed, parent of Glendale Federal Bank, were  better than most. Its profit fell 9.6% in the third quarter from a year  earlier, when the thrift had substantial gains on the sale of fixed-rate loans  a year earlier. The Glendale-based thrift said earnings in its basic business,  which excludes the sale of loans and investments, rose from $9.9 million to  $34.2 million.  </P> <P> Elsewhere across the country, NCNB, the nation's seventh-largest bank holding  company, said its third-quarter earnings fell nearly $87 million due to problem  loans and deterioration in the economy. The bank reported net income for the  quarter of $57 million, down from $143.6 million a year earlier. Fleet/Norstar  Financial Group, based in Providence, R.I., reported earnings in the third  quarter of $38 million, down from $96 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Granelli contributed to this story.  </P></p>

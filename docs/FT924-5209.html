			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Developers resist PNG plan to boost gold mine stake THE AUSTRALIAN and Canadian joint venture partners in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea yesterday said they would resist government plans to acquire an extra 20 per cent of the project. The government owns 10 per cent of Porgera under a 1979 agreement with Renison Goldfields, Highlands Gold, a PNG-registered subsidiary of MIM Holdings, and Placer Pacific, a 76 per cent subsidiary of Placer Dome of Canada. Mr Paias Wingti, the prime minister, said he expected an amicable settlement with the Porgera partners. 'PNG has always been a reasonable negotiator and partner in all its resource projects, and will continue to (be) so,' he said. However, the proposal follows government claims that PNG officials have been misled by the joint venture partners about the profitability of the project, which is one of the world's largest gold mines. Mr Masket Iangalio, the mining minister, has said that PNG restricted its holding to 10 per cent because the joint venture partners convinced the then government that the mine would be a marginal project. Porgera began production in September 1990. It is expected to produce about 900,000 ounces of gold a year until 1996, but is likely to produce 1.4m ounces in the current year. Mr Lawrie Reinertson, managing director of Placer Pacific, said the joint venture partners viewed the government's proposal with 'considerable concern'. He said it was 'clearly contrary' to the 1979 agreement, which put a 10 per cent ceiling on the government stake. Mr Reinertson said the partners rejected suggestions that they had misled the government on the size of reserves and potential production when the Porgera agreement was negotiated. 'This is simply not true. As the project moved ahead, a number of factors combined to contribute to Porgera's better-than-projected performance. The PNG government was kept closely informed at every step along the way of the progress being made,' he said. The joint venture partners say that 60 per cent of profits from Porgera are distributed in PNG through the government's equity interest, taxes and royalties. Mr Campbell Anderson, Renison Goldfields chief executive, said he was 'disappointed' by the government's plans. 'We will meet with the government of PNG to put our response and why we don't think any change in the equity is appropriate,' he said. The Porgera dispute reflects the increasingly tough approach being taken by the government in its dealings with overseas mining companies, some of which say privately that they are deeply concerned by events in PNG. Mr Iangalio yesterday delivered a scathing attack in parliament on CRA, the Australian mining group, over its involvement in a dispute at Mount Kare, not far from Porgera. Mr Iangalio said he had been advised that CRA's conduct of the dispute might be in breach of the Australian Trade Practices Act, which regulates competition. He said he would ask the corporate authorities in Australia to investigate. Mr Iangalio also praised the Perth-based mining companies Ramsgate Resources and Menzies Gold, which have angered CRA by funding legal action against the group by a faction of Mount Kare landowners. CRA has offered to hand over its 51 per cent of the Mt Kare alluvial mine to the landowners, but wants to retain the rights to explore for hard-rock gold deposits in the area. Mr Iangalio claimed CRA had distributed false statements by landowners, which included forged signatures. 'There is strong evidence that CRA has been engaging in deceptive and misleading conduct,' he told parliament. CRA denied any involvement in the allegedly forged statements, and dismissed Mr Iangalio's claims as 'without foundation'.</p>

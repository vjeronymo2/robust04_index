			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mercury Asset advances 15% despite provisions MERCURY ASSET Manage-ment, the fund management group 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, achieved a 15 per cent rise in pre-tax profits last year despite substantial provisions on two investments. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 56.4m to Pounds 65.1m, reflecting the group's success in holding down costs. While turnover jumped by Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 154m, costs rose by less than Pounds 1m to Pounds 99.6m. Mr Peter Stormonth Darling, chairman, said that investment in systems in previous years to make the group's back office operations more efficient had accounted for the low cost increase. However, the group announced provisions of about Pounds 5m on two investments at March 31, holding back its advance. Some Pounds 3m of this was a write-down on its investment in Jupiter, a fund management group in which MAM bought a 27 per cent stake for Pounds 7m last year. About half of that provision might be written back because the value of MAM's holding had recovered since the year-end, Mr Stormonth Darling said. A further provision of more than Pounds 1m was made against a holding by MAM in Isosceles, which it had taken on to its own books when unable to place the shares with investment clients. Funds under management rose by Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 40bn. The Pounds 2bn of new money under management, down from the record Pounds 3bn taken on the previous year, reflected the slower rate at which cash was flowing into UK pension funds. Earnings were 25.4p (22.8p) basic and 25.1p (22.1p) diluted. A final dividend of 8.9p is proposed, for a total of 11.5p (10p adjusted).</p>

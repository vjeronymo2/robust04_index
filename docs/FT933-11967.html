			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Observer: Field's field day It is difficult to imagine Joe Public doing anything other than uttering a loud cheer at the insurance industry's latest round of difficulties. First the Treasury launches an assault on its sales practices by calling for an even bigger clean-up than the one proposed by the Office of Fair Trading. Now, the Commons Social Security Committee has taken a tilt at its reluctance to pay up. The committee, chaired by the increasingly terrier-like Frank Field, complains in its latest report on the Maxwell pensions saga that the insurers operate 'a gentleman's agreement philosophy' when issuing and renewing policies, but turn horribly legalistic when the poor old pension fund trustees put in their claims. The locus classicus is the largest of the Maxwell policies, known as the crime policy, providing Pounds 40m of cover for the dishonest misappropriation of assets by the employees of the Maxwell companies. If that's not what the late Cap'n Bob was up to, what on earth was it that he perpetrated? Aha, say the insurers, but since he failed to disclose the fraud to the insurers at the renewal date - likely one, that - the policy is voidable. Along with a string of other excuses, they even manage to argue that since Maxwell and his aides were directors of the company, they were not employees as such. The industry explanation is that the whole concept of insurance is based on the idea of utmost good faith. What that means, apparently, is that the insurers are prepared to hand back the premiums. But Field is not impressed. When it comes to Robert Maxwell, his committee remarks, the insurance companies 'can be added to the growing list of organisations and individuals who were only too willing to accept his money and equally willing to ignore his track record'.</p>

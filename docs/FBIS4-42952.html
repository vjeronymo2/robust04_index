			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--In the opening speech of the Emergency State  Coordination Council meeting held in Ankara at the Gendarmerie's  social complex on Monday [6 June], Interior Minister Nahit  Mentese said, "Turkey is being manipulated by foreign centers of  power." Mentese stressed that all ethnic groups living in  Turkey have equal rights. "People who talk of a Kurdish entity  or equal political rights are playing with words. Whose  identity or political rights are we talking about?"    Criticizing the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK),  he  said, "The PKK terror organization has diverted the issue and  has been operating behind a false claim, mainly that the  fighting is being conducted for the sake of the Kurdish identity  and the freedom of the Kurdish people."    The interior minister blamed the creation of a "Kurdish  problem" on certain centers of power, which he said have  intentionally projected this image to the public based on  unfounded and groundless claims.    Mentese emphasized the tolerant atmosphere in the country by  claiming that "there is no differentiation between Kurdish,  Turkish, Circassian, Bosnian, and Albanian citizens of Turkey.  Everybody is free to choose his or her profession freely and  the same is true for our Kurdish citizens." He concluded that,  "Therefore, these accusations result from games played by  foreign centers of power."    During the speech, Mentese also said that people who murder  babies, women, children and the elderly without any hesitation,  hiding behind the cover of "fighting for the salvation of the  Kurdish people," cannot be tolerated and accepted.    Referring to the harsh living conditions in the Southeast,  Mentese said: "The current situation in the Southeast cannot be  interpreted as a `Kurdish problem.' The problem is the  geographic nature and position of the region. Due to this,  neither the government nor the private sector has been able to  make investments to reverse the existing economic conditions or  to assist in the creation of jobs in the region. Necessary  measures will be taken to upgrade the living standards in the  region."    The interior minister assured the audience that necessary  socioeconomic measures have already been taken to encourage the  development of the region and attract investors.    As the purpose of the gathering was to seek ways of  establishing an environment of peace and security in the  Southeast, many government officials from a variety of  ministries attended the meeting. Attendees included the  undersecretaries from the ministries of Foreign Affairs,  National Security, Justice, Finance, Education, Agriculture,  Forestry, Public Works and Housing, Labor and Social Security  and Transportation. The undersecretary of the National  Intelligence Organization (MIT) also participated in the event  as did the Higher Education Council (YOK) president, the general  director of the Youth and Sports Ministry, the undersecretary of  the Emergency State Coordination Council and a representative  from the general staff of the Turkish Armed forces.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mbabane April 17 SAPA -- A tribal Swazi chief has  claimed that Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front--AVF] cadres  are being trained in northern Swaziland. Chief Prince Mnikwa  told SAPA's correspondent in Mbabane he had informed the Swazi  military of the activities of the AVF, but so far nothing had  been done. Chief Mnikwa did not say how he come to the  conclusion that the people he had "seen in the mountains" were  AVF cadres, but he feared these people would attack his subjects.</p>

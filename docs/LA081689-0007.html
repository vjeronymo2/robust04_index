			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: A DECOY TO THWART CAR-STEREO BURGLARS  </P> <P> Here's the latest wrinkle in the car stereo security department: RadioGard,  developed by a Manhattan Beach inventor who came up with the device after his  Porsche's stereo was stolen three times. Staring at the tangle of wires hanging  from the dash where his radio had been, Gerald Levinson decided that if it  looked that way all the time, the stereo never again would be ripped off.  </P> <P> So he designed the decoy Radio-Gard, which attaches with Velcro-type adhesive  over a car stereo. A mass of wires protruding from the black cover creates the  illusion that the unit already has been stolen. No two of the devices are  alike, because he varies the colors and thicknesses of the wires and terminals.  </P> <P> "There are 10 different colors of wire used in radio installation, so when we  put in the wires at random, each unit produced is different," he explained.  "There are so many cars on the street that already look like this that the  thieves -- most are what I call the 'Three D's,' derelicts, drug addicts and  delinquents -- can't tell whether the radio has really been stolen or not.  Professionals can't either. I've tested prototypes for the past year on the  streets of New York and Los Angeles."  </P> <P> RadioGard costs $9.95, plus $2.05 for postage and handling, and comes with a  money-back guarantee. It can be ordered from Radio-Gard Systems, 3408 Manhattan  Ave., Manhattan Beach 90266.  </P> <P> Portable Air Cooler  </P> <P> Summer heat getting to your family? Consider a new air conditioner that is  portable and that cools a room using two condenser systems, one run on water,  the other on air.  </P> <P> The Pinguino, introduced by DeLonghi America Inc., Europe's leading  manufacturer of household appliances, automatically switches condensers for  maximum efficiency, a DeLonghi spokesman said. It has a 3.7-gallon water tank  that can keep the main condenser cool for about eight hours, "easily cooling a  12x15-foot room." When the water runs out, it shifts to an air-cooled  condenser, similar to those in regular air-conditioning units; it uses  fan-forced air to cool the system and dehumidifies as it works.  </P> <P> The unit is mounted on four wheels. It weighs 97 pounds and is 28 3/8 inches  high, 22 inches wide and 14 1/2 inches deep.  </P> <P> It comes with an extendable plastic hose that is connected to an included  window bracket, which is secured when the window is closed on it. It also can  be installed permanently with the 3 1/2-inch vent fixture provided.  </P> <P> Suggested retail for the unit is $1,250. In Southern California, it is  available at Chung's Appliances in Los Angeles. If you can't find a store in  your area that carries the unit, write DeLonghi America Inc., 625 Washington  Ave., Carlstadt, N.J. 07072 or call (800) 322-3848. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

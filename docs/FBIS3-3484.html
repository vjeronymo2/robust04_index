Is this good  or bad? This has been a controversial, hot topic for a long  time. During the current sessions of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] and the Eighth National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], this  topic has not only remained hot but has also become a more  serious one. NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members  have linked the proper handling of the rural labor force to the  work to improve peasants' lives and to stabilize the overall  situation.    The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members  believe  that the "tide of workers" is a sign of the historical progress  of China's traditional agricultural society being transformed  into a modern one. They said: In a sense, the trend is  reasonable as well as inevitable. However, while the flow of  workers has created huge material wealth, it has brought with it  or given rise to some social problems. To properly solve the  employment problem of the more than 100 million surplus workers  currently in rural areas, we cannot simply set our eyes on  moving them to cities -- we should simultaneously organize  peasants' migration and provide them with jobs in their  hometowns, and we should come up with new ideas and develop  various industries and trades.    "The homeland is as good as the outside world," said Deputy  Shen Zhifeng, who is mayor of Shijiazhuang city. Over the last  few years, Shijiazhuang has encouraged peasants to develop  high-yield, good-quality, and highly efficient agriculture.  Currently, the city has 1 million mu of high-efficiency cash  crops and more than 12 million chickens, rabbits, cattle, and  pigs. Last year, the per capita income of the city's peasants  increased 100 yuan over the previous year. Shen Zhifeng said,  "Once there are more opportunities in rural areas and people's  incomes are higher, who will be willing to leave their dear ones  at home and go to cities to take their chances?"    Hebei Province is only one example. Deputy Shao Qihui, who  is governor of Heilongjiang Province, said: In the northeast,  thousands or tens of thousand of peasants now have become better  off by breeding fish, raising hunting dogs or deer, or growing  flowers, and some of them have made tens of thousands of yuan or  even hundreds of thousands of yuan a year. To properly solve  the problem of the surplus work force in rural areas, we must  take into consideration the entire rural economic development  situation and broaden the scope and increase the depth of  agriculture.    Deputy Tian Chengping, who is governor of Qinghai Province,  considered the development of village and town enterprises as a  "huge water reservoir" for absorbing the rural labor force. He  said: The economic gap between the eastern and western parts of  the country is the cause of the outflow of peasants from the  central and western parts of the country, and it is also a  potential solution to the problem of the surplus rural work  force. If the source areas of the "tide of workers" can quicken  the pace of village and town enterprise development, taking the  local reality into consideration, and starting from developing  relatively simple industries that require little investment and  yield quick results, then they not only can boost local economic  development but also can create millions of jobs.    By dealing with rural problems through another approach, we  will be able to see that even now there are many opportunities  for success in rural areas. It is clear that as long as one can  meet the demands of the market, can come up with new ideas, and  is willing to work hard, peasants also can find a way to become  better off in their own home areas.</p>

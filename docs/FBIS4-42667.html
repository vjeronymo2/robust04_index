			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the UN  secretary general's Cyprus report is prejudiced.    Cetin was replying to reporters' questions at Ankara  Esenboga  Airport on his return from visits to Ukraine and Moldova last  night. He stressed that a forced solution will never be accepted  in Cyprus. He added: The UN attitude is one of forcing one of  the sides -- the Turkish Cypriot side -- to accept the package  the other side accepts. A forced solution will never be  accepted. In that case, there would be no solution.    Cetin stressed that the fact that there exist two sides on  the island must be accepted. He pointed out that Denktas'  contribution in turning the Vienna talks into a forward step is  an important development.</p>

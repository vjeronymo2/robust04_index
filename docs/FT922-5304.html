			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (4): Political maturity needed - Foreign Affairs The lessons for small nations are written large in the history books. Kuwait, Croatia, Sri Lanka, Cyprus. The roll call of lost independence, civil war, foreign domination, even worse. And Singapore? This rich, satisfied society of ours? Can we expect it all to last forever? SINGAPORE'S anxious perception of itself as a rich but vulnerable mini-state among neighbouring giants is clear from the words of the government newspaper advertisement above. The text goes on to warn against complacency and to emphasise the need for vigilant armed forces and compulsory national service. Singapore's achievements, the advertisement says, are 'worth a few days' mud and sweat'. The government went out of its way to underline that message in February by commemorating the 50th anniversary of the ignominious British surrender to Japan's invading army, allowing the older generation of Singaporeans to remind the young both of the atrocities committed during the Japanese occupation and of the dangers of unreadiness. With its Israeli-style strategy of 'Total Defence', involving a core of professional servicemen and a pool of reservists, Singapore is immeasurably better equipped than Kuwait to resist an invader. But like Kuwait, Singapore knows that small countries sometimes need skilful foreign policies and powerful friends from far away. For all its hawkish anti-communism, Singapore therefore viewed the end of the Cold War and the partial American retreat from the western Pacific with concern, fearing that a military vacuum would eventually encourage regional powers such as Japan and China to flex their muscles. Singapore concluded that it would benefit from a closer military relationship with the US, although it had to tread carefully to avoid provoking anti-western rhetoric in Malaysia or Indonesia. In November 1990, the US and Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding allowing US forces limited access to Singapore's military facilities. In January this year, US President George Bush announced plans to extend that agreement by moving a naval logistics unit for the US Seventh Fleet to Singapore from the Philippines, where the Subic Bay US naval base is about to close. Both sides have taken pains to play down the move, insisting that it falls under the provisions of the 1990 memorandum. The US says only 135 staff are assigned to the unit, known as Commander Task Force 73, and Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Singapore Prime Minister, said at the summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in January: 'There's no need for anybody to be alarmed.' Brig-Gen Lee Hsien Loong, deputy prime minister and minister for trade and industry, spelt out Singapore's worries about Washington's re-evaluation of its role in Asia in a speech to foreign journalists in February. 'As against the cold war tensions, the new superpower alignment is incomparably a change for the better,' he said. 'But we cannot assume that things will automatically work out right for our region. A smooth evolution from the current state of affairs is necessary, to give the region time to adjust and find a new equilibrium. This will avoid tensions which would otherwise put off investors, divert resources and hinder growth.' Sure-footed on economic affairs and on the part to be played by the superpowers in south-east Asia, Singaporean diplomacy has proved slow to respond to the violence in Burma, despite Singapore's repeated statements about the importance of regional stability for economic development. The six-nation Asean summit, held in Singapore, reached agreement on mutual tariff reductions leading to an Asean free trade area, but ignored the atrocities being committed by the ruling Burmese military keeping Burma off the summit's agenda now looks like a hollow victory. A mere six weeks after Mr Goh answered a question about Burma by saying: 'We do not interfere, we just have our bilateral contacts', Mr Najib Razak, the Malaysian defence minister, declared that Asean should take a unified stand against Burma for mistreating its Moslem minority. Indonesia also expressed its concern about the flight of Burmese Moslems into Bangladesh. Singapore, which sells weapons to Burma and acts as a broker for other arms manufacturers, seems to have been the last Asean country to see that the flood of refugees from the country and their stories of persecution at the hands of Burmese troops were bound to be seen as a threat to regional stability and a provocation for Islamic activists. The European Community had already begun to take a tougher line on human rights and environmental issues in its trade negotiations with Asean. Western officials remain unimpressed by the Singapore argument that the West is trying to impose its political views on Asia. The issue of basic human rights, they say, should not be confused with arguments about the relative merits of different political systems. 'What we're talking about is the UN charter,' says one Western diplomat in Singapore. 'It's got nothing to do with democratic institutions.' Foreign critics believe that Singapore has yet to find the political maturity to match its economic prowess and its growing international responsibilities. At one moment, the Singapore government refuses to confront the issue of its relations with Burma, declining to comment on the internal affairs of another country; at the next, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister and Senior Minister to Mr Goh, is giving Singaporean journalists a forthright lesson during a trip to Pakistan on the failings of the adversarial Pakistani political system. 'There's constant sniping, barrage after barrage,' he told them in Islamabad last month. 'After the sniping is over, then endless feuding.' True, no doubt, but not the sort of critical tone which Singapore is yet prepared to welcome from a foreign visitor commenting on its own affairs.</p>

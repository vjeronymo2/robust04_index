			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Bank of France trims overnight rates THE Bank of France yesterday made a slight reduction in the cost of short-term borrowing  - a sign of growing confidence that pressure on the franc is abating. Yesterday's changes include a cut in the overnight interest rate from 12 per cent to 11.9375 per cent. The 5 to 10 day rate, suspended last month, has been reintroduced. It was set at 12 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in January. The overnight and 5 to 10 day rates are the mechanisms with which the Bank of France influences money market rates. When the franc came under pressure in January the bank suspended the 5 to 10 day rate to reduce liquidity in the markets. However, this also left the French commercial banks, most of which have held base rates at 10 per cent since mid-December, with higher borrowing costs. Some of the smaller regional banks have already raised base rates to around 11 per cent. The authorities are increasingly concerned that larger banks will follow. The central bank hopes that the commercial banks will interpret yesterday's slight cut in short-term rates as a signal that they should hold base rates steady in expectation of further reductions.</p>

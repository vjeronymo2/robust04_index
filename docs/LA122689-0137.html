			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LANGE'S ROLES APPEAL TO HER  </P> <P> Actress Jessica Lange has become accustomed to working in movies that are not  commercial films.  </P> <P> "So if one of them does become that, it would be a real surprise to me," she  said.  </P> <P> "It's just because I'm attracted to things that are somewhat out of the  mainstream," she said in an interview in the January issue of Premiere  magazine.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old Lange's latest roles are in Costa-Gavras' "Music Box," in which  she plays a Chicago lawyer contesting charges that her father is a Nazi war  criminal, and in Paul Brickman's "Men Don't Leave," in which she plays a newly  widowed mother.  </P> <P> "The roles and the stories that make it interesting for me to spend six months  or three months of my life involved in the playing of are maybe not what's  going to appeal to the majority, which is fine," she said.  </P> <P> Lange lives with actor-playwright Sam Shepard, and they have two children. She  has a third child by dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov.  </P></p>

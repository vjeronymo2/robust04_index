But it is virtually  identical to the rise of Yeltsin. Like Yeltsin, Rutskoy rose to  prominence alongside the head of state. His policy was based on  criticizing the president's entourage, but not the big man  himself. In the same way, Yeltsin criticized the CPSU elite for  a long time, while stressing that he and Gorbachev only differed  with regard to reform tactics. The Army was also sympathetic to  Rutskoy. According to one survey, he was supported by one-third  of the officer corps. Not bad for a beginning.    Boris Yeltsin did not immediately win the sympathies of the  military. Their friendship grew as resentment grew against  Gorbachev, who unequivocally "betrayed" the Army: After the  events in Vilnius, for example. Yeltsin, on the other hand,  promised to show concern. It is clear from the fortunes of many  of today's generals that he kept his promise after the  Belovezhskaya Forest Agreement. But the number of dissatisfied  military men is, of course, far greater. Rutskoy could  perfectly well count on them to improve his rating.    Admittedly, he did not really have a ramified political  structure to fulfill agitation and propaganda functions, if only  along the lines of "Democratic Russia." The "Free Russia"  People's Party (FRPP), only nominally headed by Rutskoy, was not  noted for its organization. "Civic Union" hesitated to nominate  him as its leader, and, moreover, was actively engaged in  infighting.    The opposition's support was not so much unconditional as  desperate. The hardliners still had not nominated a leader.  Indeed, they could not. Only in propaganda folklore is it  possible to firmly unite monarchists and communists. In real  life they could only reach a compromise. Rutskoy proved to be  the bridge they needed. But, as his popularity grew, these and  many other factors moved into the background.    Two or three weeks before the tragic events at the White  House, the "Public Opinion" Foundation carried out a survey to  establish the degree of popular support for the various  political blocs. The results were stunning. Particularly  considering the election results. "Civic Union" emerged as the  undisputed leader. It was even several steps ahead of  "Democratic Russia" and "Russia's Choice." But, while placing a  high degree of trust in "Civic Union," contrary to the true  state of affairs, the population linked it to Rutskoy's name.  On the other hand, at that time 71 percent of respondents were  negative about Yeltsin's activity.    The conclusion is obvious: Aleksandr Rutskoy was very  successfully ousting the Russian president from the public  consciousness. If there had been simultaneous early elections,  the idea of which was being actively discussed at the time, the  result would have been predetermined. The events around the  White House could not have come at a better time. One can  understand the irritation of some radicals that Rutskoy did not  shoot himself.    Was Rutskoy still a rival to Yeltsin? There are politicians  who, thanks to their courageous behavior, have gone straight  from jail into palace apartments. However, there are also those  who have voluntarily left politics. But it is a fact that  Rutskoy is not forgotten. According to the "Person-93" poll  carried out by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public  Opinion, he confidently holds fourth place in the popularity  ratings. His name largely helped V. Lipitskiy's victory in the  election campaign. The FRPP, on the other hand -- neatly blended  into the "Future of Russia-New Names" bloc, which no one had  ever heard of -- suffered defeat. The FRPP now intends to take  part in elections to local bodies of authority under its own  identity and with Rutskoy's name.    However, was it worth Rutskoy's while to undertake such a  dangerous venture as setting up an independent political party?  After all, his fortunes could have turned out quite well. He  was the first official in Russian history -- and, according to  the now abolished Constitution, the last -- to be publicly  declared as successor to the president. He had gained some  popularity among the people, uttered a few words of criticism,  and consequently distanced himself from Yeltsin, so all he had  to do was sit patiently by, not thrust himself forward, and bide  his time in order to smoothly make the transition to the  president's chair.    Yes, but in that case the person would have to be a  political  sophisticate, rather than a military man like Rutskoy.  Moreover, the traditional pattern of ascent is not in itself a  guarantee of success. However the contender for the post of  president may maneuver, whatever parties he may form, and  whatever deals he may make even with the Army, he will  nevertheless come up against the wall that is the elite. He  could break through, of course. But that would require a  revolution -- even if it is a velvet revolution -- or a military  coup d'etat. A peaceful outcome is only possible in one case:  If the contender reflects the interests of the elite.   <H5>    Zhirinovskiy -- A Shield For the Elite? </H5>   However paradoxical it may seem, Zhirinovskiy is exactly the  candidate for president who plays entirely by the rules of the  present elite. His views are its views. His interests are its  interests, that is, the interests of big capital. That is the  main point. Zhirinovskiy's criticism of the policy of reforms  goes no further than criticizing its tactics. This kind of  condemnation can be continued for a very long time with  absolutely no harm to the policy itself.    As far as his bellicose plans are concerned, the "rush to  the  south," they are more a tribute to tradition. India attracted  the attention of Peter I. Paul I could not restrain himself:  He dispatched the Don Army to wage war on India, soon after  which he was killed. The expedition ended there. The famous  General Skobelev nurtured global ideas of uniting all the Slav  lands....    Why should Zhirinovskiy not recall all this, and our elite  as  well? With its chameleon-like abilities, it is perfectly  capable of speaking in a patriotic bass, even if it does concern  such details as the color of television presenters' hair and  eyes.    Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy himself understands perfectly  well  that, without the elite, he has no real road to power: Support  for him is not so very great, which is why some extraordinary  measures and Russia's desperate plight are needed. Is the  lawyer's son capable of taking all this upon his shoulders?    The elite's position is no better: It has no one in reserve  for the role of president. The opposition is breathing down its  neck. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy has taken his seat next to  Yeltsin and Filatov for all to see. He has already done the  elite quite a service by supporting the Constitution. In his  own interests, of course. But it is ludicrous to expect  altruism of a politician. Finally, no one before Zhirinovskiy  has shown such staggering loyalty to power: to Gorbachev, the  State Committee for the State of Emergency, Yeltsin himself, and  even those in the White House. Having condemned the Lefortovo  prisoners' opposition to Edict No. 1440, he now advocates  releasing them. Zhirinovskiy treats power like a sacred cow,  thereby guaranteeing the survival of the elite and its property  in the event of his victory.    The process of adapting to each other's characters and  interests is now under way. Zhirinovskiy impetuously  demonstrates what he is capable of doing. The elite reflects.  Zhirinovskiy says something coarse. The elite frowns in  disdain. But it will also smile if it has to.   <H5>    The Leader's Name Is Compromise </H5>   Of course it has been offensive to watch the new elite  scheming against "outsiders" and trying to fashion a new leader  for the last year or so. We can do little more than lament the  fact that our elite is bad. But if we were to stage another  revolution, we would get an elite no better than the last, and,  moreover, with the same qualities and resources at its disposal.  Why each successive reproduction should be distinguished by  this permanency and how we can limit its growth is another  matter. But the elite's job is to supply leaders great and  small; intrigues cannot be avoided.    Another irritating feature is that a course rejected by  society is being dictated to the incumbent president.  Persistent efforts are being made to ensure that others  continue this work. Not only various political institutions,  such as the Army, are being approached for their support.  History is also being brought into service. Lavishing praise  on autocracy, attention is focused on the "strong hand" with  which it so gloriously held Russia. However, the present power  has forgotten the monarch's main concern: To try to achieve a  balance between the passions of the elite and the people.  History also teaches us that when the autocrat listed toward  one side, the other side hatched conspiracies, rebelled, and  sometimes carefully removed him or swept him aside.    Nothing has changed since then. The White House tragedy  and the failure of reform stem from a disregard of experience.  Having begun his political ascent from ruin, Yeltsin does not  realize that the historical imperative has gone. The leader's  task today is not to show superhuman qualities, but to master  the art of compromise.    The theme of compromise is not new. From the moment it was  formed, "Civic Union" reiterated the need for compromise in  politics and the need to seek ways leading to accord. There is  progress in this respect among some members of the opposition.  Even the president has expressed a desire to cooperate with all  forces in the Federal Assembly. It can be said that attempts  are being made to get along with one another. The only  exception in this is the main participant in the process, the  ruling elite itself. So far, its backbone in the State Duma  intends to demonstrate the principles of the noncontamination of  the democratic ranks by the influence of extreme forces.  Although, as is well known, the stance taken by extreme  elements changes with time.    It is not just caprice, of course. These are the torments of  Tantalus. After all, behind every compromise lies the need to  moderate one's appetite in the consumption of power and make  room for others in these very ranks.    But there is no going back. No less than 40 percent of the  electorate in our country are romantics. The 40 percent who did  not turn up to vote. The "left wing" and the "right wing" are  in a hurry to enter them in their assets. A futile exercise.  These people are not yours. Most of them say: "We do not  trust anyone." So they are waiting.... They are waiting for  the right person to come along. In a country which still has  open wounds left by the destruction of a great state. They  wait, scornfully observing the petty intrigues "above." They  wait, with no future, soaring prices, and rocketing crime. They  include a vast mass of people who know from experience how you  have to go about begging for something. Where is the guarantee  that this wave of desperation, fearlessness, and need will not  one day surge through the country, sweeping aside everything in  its path, to the impassioned appeals of the latest spokesman for  the aspirations of the masses?    If the present elite is really an elite, its direct duty is  to make room for others, cultivate a leader capable of balancing  on the cutting edge of the interests of all strata of the  population, and promote a figure on whom the main political  forces will agree. Only then will they have to bury their vast  talent -- their ability to make our life hell.    If the elite does not do its duty, the time of noble heroes,  the Minins and Pozharskiys of this world, will come. How do we  know who they are? Where are they now: In the crowd jostling  at the throne, on the barricades, on the firing lines of our  divided country? There is no answer to these questions. These  people will come like lightning, like a sword. When the time  for compromise has run out. Or been let slip by arrogant  rulers. When the country is not simply on the brink, but in the  abyss.    Incidentally, Prince Pozharskiy was a Ryurikovich. With his  services to the fatherland, he had every right to the throne.  But, for the sake of peace in Russia, he spoke out in favor of  Mikhail Romanov, a figure of compromise who suited the hostile  boyar families.    To this day, historians cannot say with certainty where  exactly this great man is buried. Moreover, doubts arose even  during the reign of the Romanov dynasty.    Is this coincidence or the revenge of the elite: To wipe out  every trace of an example offering the key to compromise?</p>

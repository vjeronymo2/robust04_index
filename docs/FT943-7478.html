			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Observer: Hello, Dolly And now, Observer proudly brings you the sentimental quango. No, not a soft-centred version of the tango, but the Highways Agency, set up earlier this year to take over direct responsibility for the UK government's road building programme. When established, the quango promised 'the best possible service to those affected by roads'. Presumably its latest press release - four pages on the case of Dolly Watson, 93 - is all part of that service. Watson lives in the path of the extension to the M11 motorway, now under construction in east London and the subject of fierce protests from opponents - including Dolly, as the press release likes to call her. She collapsed five days ago with a suspected mild stroke and is still in hospital. But the agency rebuts claims that Watson has been badly treated. It says it's appointed an officer to maintain personal contact with her; has offered to provide a car so she can visit her replacement home; and will not evict her while she is making visits to alternative accommodation. If only the protesters had not prevented them, agency staff would have explained all this personally to Dolly, says the release. Sounds a bit like Highway Fobbery.</p>

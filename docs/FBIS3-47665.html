			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kagoshima, Jan. 15 KYODO -- The coalition government  of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will compile the fiscal 1994  state budget around February 10, a senior ruling party official  said Saturday.    Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Secretary  General Wataru Kubo told reporters the Finance Ministry will  reveal its budget plan on February 5.    Parties in the ruling coalition have already agreed on the  budget schedule, said Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDP, the  largest among the seven ruling parties.    Kubo also said the government needs to prepare a third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 in parallel with the  compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget.    Japan's fiscal year starts April 1 and lasts through March  31  the following year.    In Japan, the government makes it a rule to compile budgets  in late December. But this time, Hosokawa's cabinet put  priority on the passage of political reform bills and postponed  compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to February.    Kubo reiterated the SDP's argument to implement an income  tax  cut as part of efforts to shore up the long sluggish Japanese  economy. He called for issuing short-term, deficit-covering  bonds to finance the tax reduction.    Kubo said the Hosokawa cabinet may resign en masse if it  fails to gain Diet approval of the political reform bills during  the current extraordinary Diet session ending January 29.    "On my forecast, the possibility of (the cabinet's)  resigning  en masse is strong," Kubo said.    The package of bills, designed to introduce single-seat  electoral districts and impose antigraft measures, have been  pending in the House of Councillors since November.    Hosokawa has staked his premiership on enacting the bills  before the end of the current extended session of the Diet.</p>

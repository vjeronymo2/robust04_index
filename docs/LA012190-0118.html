			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSTS ANONYMOUS NOW OUST GORBACHEV  </P> <P> To become known as an expert on perestroika -- or to discuss it intelligently  at cocktail parties -- you must begin by picking a date, any date, for Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's fall. Resist logic.  </P> <P> A prediction is especially effective when delivered in a nonchalant but certain  tone: "He won't last through the year." Avoid exact dates, such as Nov. 7 or  the 18th of Brumaire.  </P> <P> Announcing the fall of Gorbachev within six months is unsatisfying. The public  should be forced to wait. The Gorbachev fall within three years is unsatisfying  as well. Americans don't plan that far in the future.  </P> <P> If Gorbachev fails to fall after your deadline, advance the projection without  losing pomp: "I have underestimated the lethargy factor inherent in the Russian  soul and the Soviet society."  </P> <P> Stress that more than anything the Western World needs a comprehensive strategy  in dealing with the Soviets.  </P> <P> When offering such a strategy, employ cascades of run-on sentences placing  verbs in uncustomary positions, a la German, employing a large number of  manufactured terms such as "Sovietism."  </P> <P> Study the publishing field like a professor hunting tenure. To attain the best  results, find a reputable scholarly journal willing to accept gibberish under a  pseudonym.  </P> <P> In choosing a pseudonym, opt for any letter that comes late in any alphabet.  </P> <P> The pseudonym "Z" was recently taken by an author in Daedalus, journal of the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  </P> <P> Z was a clever tactical choice, avoiding Y (which could be interpreted as a  question) and forcing other authorities to look for other pseudonyms in their  alphabet soup. X had been used years earlier by George F. Kennan, a true  visionary, who explained the Cold War under covert identity.  </P> <P> Given the interest generated by the Z piece in the U.S. media, your analysis  will bring new hordes of reporters scavenging outside the homes of the usual  suspects -- Henry A. Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. The more enterprising  journalists will rummage through the garbage of these wise and good men,  searching the compost of yesterday's dinners for discarded rough drafts.  </P> <P> While the search continues, sit still. Wait for your historic moment. As soon  as reporters cease to root in Glad bags, come forward and say proudly "I was  'Zed,' " (you brightly opted to become the continental Z), leading to talk  radio, perhaps even MacNeil-Lehrer and surely boosting the size of future book  advances.  </P> <P> Don't admit worry about being right. Events in the Soviet Union outpace public  memory. Any proposal becomes obsolete -- therefore unassailable -- almost  immediately.  </P> <P> Your broadcast efforts need not acknowledge complexity, the existence of 286  million (if you still count Lithuania) people who make up Soviet society.  Reduce discussion to three topics: Gorbachev, the Communist Party and the  Soviet economy. Then proceed without doubt: "Gorbachev won't last a year, the  Communist Party won't surrender monopoly of power without a fight and the  Soviet economy is a mess." You may make references to the Soviet  "intellectuals" as a small group that wants democracy and therefore makes up  Gorbachev's power base. Do not be deterred by any election results in asserting  that only intellectuals want democracy while everyone else wants food.  </P> <P> Nationalist groups such as Pamyat are good targets of opportunity. When  discussing this loosely knit right-wing association, feel free to picture a  powerful hate group uniting millions of people intent on reviving the days of  the pogroms. Or, by contrast, describe Pamyat as nothing but a small band on  the lunatic fringe. Audiences like conflicting reports.  </P> <P> But they do not like complexity, so avoid the problem of nationalities. Just  call that whole collection of disparate peoples a "challenge to the Kremlin"  and let the Uzbeks distinguish themselves from the Kazakhs and the Tadzhiks.  </P> <P> Accounts of conversations with Moscow taxi drivers are indispensable. Drivers  in Moscow, like Moscow intellectuals who have become cab drivers in New York,  will tell you without hesitation that Gorbachev cannot last another year.  </P> <P> U, too, can be a seer.  </P></p>

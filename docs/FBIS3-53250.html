			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Dahlan, member of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Taba talks, by Gay Bekhor in Taba on 11  January]    [Text] "In the meeting Amnon Shahaq and Jacques Neriya had  with me and Jibril Rajab in Rome a `gentlemen's agreement' was  reached on a cease-fire between the Fatah Hawks and the Israeli  Government. It was agreed that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  and the Fatah Hawks would not fire at each other, and the  agreement has so far been honored. It was also agreed that the  Fatah Hawks would not keep firearms, which would only be held by  the Fatah apparatus in the Gaza Strip."    These remarks were made yesterday by former Fatah Hawks  commander Muhammad Dahlan, in an interview with HA'ARETZ.  Dahlan is now one of the leaders of Fatah Tunis' security  apparatus, after being deported from the Gaza Strip by Israel.  Dahlan and other Fatah leaders are expected to receive  significant control on the ground when the withdrawal agreement  is implemented.    [Bekhor] Dahlan, let us assume a Palestinian terrorist  commits murder in Israeli territory and escapes to territory  under Palestinian control. What will be his fate?    [Dahlan] It seems to me that we would try him, but that is  something that still has to be negotiated. There are hundreds  of similar questions, such as the area of jurisdiction, which  will be discussed in the negotiations.    [Bekhor] The delegations are now discussing the upcoming  withdrawal from Gaza, and a central issue, such as the area of  jurisdiction, has still not been resolved?    [Dahlan] I am sure that such issues can be solved within two  hours. Anyway, we already have a plan to safeguard the roads  within the Palestinian area.    [Bekhor] What about intelligence coordination with the Shin  Bet?    [Dahlan] That has still not been discussed, but is due to  come up in the respective committee. Cooperation between the  Israel Police and the Palestinian police has already been  discussed, but how to deal with terrorism has still not been  worked out. We are divided on the basic issue of what  constitutes terrorism.    [Bekhor] How do you plan to deal with the problem of  collaborators?    [Dahlan] They all belong to the underworld: pimps and drug  dealers who found refuge in Israel, so take them. This is our  decision and the decision of Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]: Take  them, and we, for humanitarian reasons, will take only their  women and children. In the past a decision was made to  liquidate the collaborators, but after the signing of the  agreement in Washington in September, the approach changed.  That was also the leadership's decision.    [Bekhor] In the past there were rumors that you had ordered  the extermination of Fatah activist Muhammad Abu-Sha'ban.    [Dahlan] They are only rumors. The Fatah Hawks have no part  in murders. Had Fatah done it, it would have been known. I was  a friend of Muhammad's.    [Bekhor] How do you think the Palestinian security system  will deal with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists?    [Dahlan] I can tell you that we agreed that there would be  no terrorism between the Palestinian entity and the Islamic  elements.    [Bekhor] The bad relations between the nationalist regimes  and the Islamic streams are, in fact, a regional problem.    [Dahlan] In the Palestinian camp it is different. Hamas and  Islamic Jihad are anti-Israeli and not anti-Palestinian. They  are not opposed to us.    [Bekhor] What is the security outlook that will guide you on  your return to the Gaza Strip?    [Dahlan] The way we see the security issue is different from  how the Shin Bet views it. Their concept is built on threats,  revenge, and undermining, while we will base our policy on four  things: First, forging a link between the Palestinian people  and their security apparatus. Second, building a security  system that will be accompanied by economic and social moves,  which will reduce the level of pressure on the Palestinians.  Third, we intend to employ young men with a security background  in our security system, nationalists with whom others can  identify.    [Bekhor] In other words, men on the wanted list?    [Dahlan] You can call them that. Fourth, there will be  cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli systems. We  will use all the Shin Bet and IDF installations, which will be  evacuated when the withdrawal starts. We agreed between us that  the Army and police will not destroy any installations but will  transfer them to us.    [Bekhor] Have the commanders of the Palestinian police force  and the security apparatus already been appointed?    [Dahlan] No names have not been finalized. There is a  security committee in Tunis, of which I am a member, and the  commanders will be chosen from among the members.    [Bekhor] Who will appoint the commanders?    [Dahlan] Abu-'Ammar does the appointing. Who else makes  such appointments in the Third World?</p>

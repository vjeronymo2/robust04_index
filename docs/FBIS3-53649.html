			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read introduction followed by correspondent </F> reports]    [Excerpts] We now move on to the reports U.S. envoy Dennis  Ross brought to Jerusalem after the Clinton-al-Asad summit  meeting. Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq met with Ross this evening  and discussed the possibility of an IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, including the possibility of  a withdrawal in stages and the leasing of land. In the  meantime, it has been learned that President al-Asad hinted to  the U.S. President that he would not insist on mutual  demilitarization. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen  updates us:    The Americans know how to do things dramatically. The U.S.  peace team arrived last night from Geneva and went straight to  the prime minister's residence. The briefings continued this  morning, first at the Foreign Ministry, and then again at the  prime minister's bureau. Dennis Ross is reporting to Israel  about a different al- Asad, one who promises personal assistance  in gathering information on the MIA's and Ron Arad, and who says  openly: I do not believe the Israelis, but I also understand  when they do not believe me.    Four main points surfaced in Ross' report: Al-Asad is ready  to enter into serious negotiations even before a Rabin  declaration on a withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It has  always been said that al-Asad is in no hurry, but he now  believes that time is not in his favor and wants peace. Al-Asad  is ready for full peace and normalization, but he will not say  so publicly until Rabin says he will withdraw. Security issues  were deliberately not discussed in Geneva, they are being left  for the negotiations in Washington. Jerusalem says that Rabin is  under pressure, since the American are expecting quick answers.  The immediate solution is to keep low, something Shim'on Peres  supports, but Yosi Beilin does not.    [Begin recording] [Peres] I still think that the details  and the significance must be verified in negotiations.    [Beilin] I think that we are now in a different situation  than we were in yesterday or the day before. It is some sort of  new era in relations between Syria and us. There is no doubt  that based on the U.S. reports, there is now a Syrian commitment  on a level that did not exist in the past to make peace with  Israel. [end recording]    Whichever way we look at it, the Golan Heights are on the  negotiating table. [passage omitted]    Is the government serious about holding a referendum on the  Golan Heights? Minister Hayim Ramon announced that the cabinet  will vote against the National Religious Party's Knesset motion  on Wednesday to make it mandatory to hold a referendum on the  area's future.    Despite Deputy Minister Mordekhay Gur's remarks about a  referendum, ministers believe that the prime minister will  prefer early elections prior to an accord with Syria.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 17 January  reports: "Cabinet ministers made it clear that Deputy Defense  Minister Mordekhay Gur read out the announcement on a referendum  from the Knesset podium using the exact words decided on at the  prime minister's bureau this morning. The ministers told our  correspondent Hayim Hecht that the announcement on a referendum  was presented to the Knesset after consultations were held at  the prime minister's bureau and the final wording had been  approved by the prime minister. Minister Yosi Sarid earlier  said that the Knesset announcement on a referendum did not have  cabinet approval."]    Our party affairs correspondent Yaron Deqel reports on the  political map prior to a possible agreement with Syria:    Yitzhaq Rabin did not come to the Knesset tonight to talk  about the Golan Heights. Cabinet ministers say that the  government can only lose by holding a referendum. Even if the  government wins the referendum, the cabinet will continue to be  based on the same tiny majority in the Knesset. [passage  omitted]    How will the political parties respond to an agreement which  includes a withdrawal? The right wing will definitely be  opposed, but the Likud was taken by surprise when three of its  Knesset members abstained in the vote recognizing the PLO. The  position of United Torah Jewry, which voted for the Camp David  accords and against the PLO agreement, is unknown. Most of the  SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] faction is opposed to  withdrawal, but as usual it will decide at the last minute.</p>

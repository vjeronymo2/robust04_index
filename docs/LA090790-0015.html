			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL LAW TO BACK UP THE WILL OF THE WORLD  </P> <P> As somebody who lived under Hitler, it amazes me to hear serious people suggest  that the President was dead wrong in sending troops to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Assume for a moment that Congress had followed President Wilson into the League  of Nations, and that George Bush had been President in April, 1939, when Hitler  marched into Czechoslovakia. He would have sent troops into Poland, the obvious  next target on Hitler's list and spurred the League of Nations into action and  World War II would not have taken place.  </P> <P> WOLFGANG KAUPISCH  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

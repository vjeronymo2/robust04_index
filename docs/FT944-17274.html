			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Delegates urged to remember history Mr Larry Whitty, party secretary, urged delegates to 'remember your history'. He said in his last speech to a party conference as general secretary: 'Remember the history of the broader Labour movement and the trade union movement. Remember those people who through the bad years have voted for you through bad times and through good. 'And remember that in progress in life and in politics you have to take the people with you. And in that context let us always remember that the trade union base of this party is its greatest strength and not its weakness.' People did not join the party because of what was said at conference or because of a slogan or a logo, said Mr Whitty. 'They join because they are angry. They join because they want change. And we can redraft our aims and constitutions as much as we like - and I believe we should. But the essence of this party is that it stands for radical, redistributive change within our society.' He warned that the party and the unions had to move together 'otherwise we fail together'.</p>

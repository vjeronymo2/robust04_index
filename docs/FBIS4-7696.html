			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Poland has no chance to join NATO in the  near future. This is an opinion expressed by Longin Pastusiak,  deputy chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission, who  returned from Washington a few days ago. According to the  professor, the Partnership for Peace program can be treated as  the last stop before NATO.    [Begin Pastusiak recording] The program does not provide  guarantees of security for us. Consequently, Article 5, the key  article of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares that  aggression against a NATO member state means aggression against  the entire NATO organization, will not apply to Poland.  However, the states that will be included in the Partnership  for Peace program will be covered by Article 4, which envisages  that, in a situation of conflict or when Poland's security is  threatened, the NATO countries would hold a meeting and carry  out consultations. Such consultations might lead to military  action, but it is not said clearly. [end recording]</p>

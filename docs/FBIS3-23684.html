			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. L. Zaytsev, A. G. Sokolskiy, O. R. Rzhiga, A. </F> S. Vyshlov, A. P. Krivtsov and V. A. Shubin; UDC  621.396.96:523.6]    [Abstract] Precise radar observations of the asteroid 4179  (Toutatis) were made on 8 and 9 December 1992 when the asteroid  approached the Earth to within a minimum distance of 3.6 million  km. The asteroid, discovered in 1986 by French astronomers, can  be identified with 1934 CT, discovered in 1934 but then lost.  The angle between the orbital planes of the Earth and Toutatis  is only 0.46 and it constitutes a potential danger to the  Earth. Radar measurements of the Doppler shift of echo signals  made possible a substantial improvement in the orbital  parameters, an increase in the reliability of prediction of  orbital motion and an evaluation of the degree of danger of  collision during its periodic approaches to the Earth. The  supplementation of the 136 optical observations of the asteroid  made between 1934 and 1992 by recent radar data reduced the  prediction error for 29 September 2004 when the asteroid will  approach the Earth to a distance of 0.01 AE. An analysis of the  spectra of reflected signals revealed that this is a double  asteroid consisting of approximately equal bodies which are in  close contact. An estimate of the period of asteroid rotation  made using measurements of the spectral width of the echo signal  on the assumption that the axis of rotation is normal to the  line of sight suggests rotation with a period 5.7...6.5 days.  The radar albedo of the asteroid is 0.08 if its radius is 2 km.  Its surface characteristics were determined, as were the  polarization ratio and radar cross section. The asteroid will be  within the limits of accessibility of national radar apparatus  at the time of successive approaches in 1996, 2000 and 2004.  Figures 5; references 12: 5 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

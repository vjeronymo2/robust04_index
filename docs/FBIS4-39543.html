			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 8 Jun, in the  "Novosti" newscast, carries a report on Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev's arrival in Armenia. Speaking on his latest  proposal on the introduction of Russian peacemaking forces in  the Azeri-Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone, Grachev makes the  following comment:    "The agreement--which I consider a good one--should  definitely be signed if the sides want peace. On 11 June I will  go from Georgia to Azerbaijan for a few hours. I will plainly  tell Azeri President Geydar Aliyev that I support the agreement  signed in Moscow. I will tell him that if Azerbaijan does not  agree to it I will simply walk away from this issue."</p>

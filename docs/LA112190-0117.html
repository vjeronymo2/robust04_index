			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> Mideast Is Missile Showcase: Raytheon of Lexington, Mass., looks healthy in the  wake of military cutbacks because its two major products -- the Patriot missile  and the Hawk air-to-air missile -- have been widely deployed in America's  Middle East operation, capturing the attention of allies. Israel likely will  buy the Patriot next year, and Saudi Arabia reportedly is speeding up its  purchases.  </P> <P> Turkey, Great Britain and Egypt have expressed interest in one or both systems.  Last year, the Patriot accounted for 15% of Raytheon's $8 billion in sales.  Toronto Globe and Mail  </P> <P> New Metric Incentive: Anticipating that a united European market in 1992 will  discriminate against U.S. companies that have not converted to metric  measurements, the U.S. government will require in September, 1992, that nearly  all its contracts be drawn to metric specifications. It tried to push the  country toward the metric system in 1975 with the U.S. Metric Conversion Act,  but the law was voluntary and few companies complied. Those that did, including  most auto companies and the liquor industry, say they saw big savings. They  added that the system is more logical, simple and exact. Tampa Tribune  </P> <P> Tobacco Exports: Although Japan's liberalized tobacco import laws helped  cigarette sales increase in 1989 for the first time in five years, the  percentage of the population that smokes continues to fall. In the past 24  years, the male smoking population has decreased more than 20%. Although  imported tobacco continues to gain a bigger share of the shrinking market,  opposition to imports is growing. Anti-smoking groups have protested cigarette  commercials on television and cigarette companies' sponsorship of sports  events. They want heavier tobacco duties and higher cigarette prices.

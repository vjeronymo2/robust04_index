			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Trade News: US anti-Gatt lobby steps up campaign THE Uruguay Round of trade talks will 'sabotage' US law on consumer rights and the environment, according to American anti-Gatt groups. The anti-Gatt lobby in the US - including environmental, consumer and farm groups - have stepped up their campaign this week to coincide with President Bush's declared Trade Week. They claim the support of 162 Congressmen for a resolution warning the president against Gatt legislation which jeopardises US environmental, consumer, health or labour laws. The resolution has the backing of Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader. Gatt rules would prevail over national standards and the anti-Gatt lobbyists argue that negotiators must ensure that a Gatt agreement would not undermine US standards on issues such as consumer rights and the environment. The anti-Gatt forces are seeking public support in full page newspaper advertisements which claim that 'the only thing free about free trade is the freedom it gives the world's largest corporations to circumvent democracy and kill those pesky laws that protect people and the planet.'</p>

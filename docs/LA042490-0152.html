			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WINS $1,600 AWARD  </P> <P> A new program to encourage academic achievement recently brought Handy  Elementary School a $1,600 grant from the California Educational Initiatives  Fund. The school was one of 13 in the region to receive awards for innovative  educational programs.  </P> <P> Under Handy's new program, first- through sixth-graders don't have to be  straight-A students to earn a "varsity letter" in academics. Doing homework and  reading extra books can earn them the 100 points they need to receive a Handy  varsity letter -- a red-and-white H -- for academic achievement.  </P> <P> The first winners will receive their letters and a certificate of merit at a  special assembly at the end of the school year. Students who continue to  fulfill requirements will win a gold bar for each year, Principal Andrew Fisher  said.  </P> <P> "Not everyone can throw a touchdown pass and not everyone can get all A's, but  everyone can read 50 books if they put their minds to it," Fisher said.  </P> <P> The award is part of $780,000 to be distributed statewide this year by the  California Educational Initiatives Fund. Awards for innovative programs were  distributed to schools in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.  </P></p>

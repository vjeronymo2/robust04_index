			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Feb -- More than 300 Ukrainian servicemen  attempted on Friday to seize the territory of a military unit of  the Black Sea Fleet in Nikolayev (southern Ukraine). Around 10  of them were armed with automatic weapons, an ITAR-TASS  correspondent was informed by phone today by the fleet's press  center. Only restraint on the part of the command of the  brigade of ships under construction and of a hospital, which the  attackers penetrated, prevented a more serious incident from  occurring.    It says the Ukrainian side regarded as justification for  these actions the fact that three officers and five warrant  officers of the hospital base submitted applications with a  request to serve in the Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, these  Black Sea servicemen intend to move under the jurisdiction of  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry together with material resources,  equipment, and weapons.    "The position of the Black Sea Command remains invariable:  we  are not going to impede those who want to serve in the Ukrainian  Navy," an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the fleet's press  center.    However, all units, bases, ships and other military  installations belonging to the fleet remain under the  jurisdiction of the Black Sea Fleet command, as follows from the  Yalta agreement signed by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine.  Only the signatures of the two presidents can authorize any  actions with regard to the fleet.    The press center voiced its regret that the unwillingness to  understand this undermined the authority of the representatives  of the command of the Ukrainian Navy who have been lately  talking with increasing frequency about their desire to conduct  a dialogue with the fleet's command.</p>

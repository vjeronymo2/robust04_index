As a group of Russian journalists accompanying Kozyrev were  told by Mikhail Belyy, director of the 1st Asian Department of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, in  Moscow it is thought that the development of relations with  China is in keeping with Russia's basic national interests. The  parties' positions "are close or overlapping" with regard to  many international issues. In particular, Moscow and Beijing  hold similar views concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons on the Korean peninsula. But, as the diplomat put it,  there are "nuances": China is categorically against the  application of international sanctions against the DPRK while  Russia sees them as an extremely undesirable but possible  measure.    SEGODNYA commentary. In terms of foreign policy China  emphatically practices nonintervention in the internal affairs  of other countries, actively resists attempts at intervention in  its own, and avoids becoming involved in international  conflicts. Thus, for example, Beijing, a permanent member of the  UN Security Council, showed no interest in regulation in  Yugoslavia, and Spain took its place in the "Yugoslav Five."    It is very important to Russia that the PRC strives to  maintain stability on its northern borders, particularly in the  Central Asian region, and also that Beijing is concerned about  possible disturbances within the Russian Federation. China is  refraining from short-term "advantageous" actions involving an  active struggle for political influence in Central Asia, from  attempts to crowd Russia out of this region, from encouragement  of separatist tendencies within the Russian Federation itself,  and also from support of opposition forces in the political  battle at the federal level. All this predetermines the limited  nature of political contradictions between Russia and China and  the possibilities of cooperation of the two countries as  guarantors of stability in the vast border region. This is why a  drastic change in the current pragmatic leadership in Beijing  would not be in Russia's interests, since any other leadership  would focus primarily on nationalism, which would lead to an  aggravation of the situation in the border regions and relations  with Russia as a whole.    Trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC is  developing at rapid rates. In 1993 its volume reached $7.2  billion, and Russia has an active balance of $2 billion. China  occupies second place after the FRG in Russia's trade turnover.  But there is also the Russian clearing indebtedness from  commercial credit granted by China during 1990-1991.    But the exchange remains unequivalent: Russian fertilizer,  metal, and machines--for extremely poor-quality Chinese goods of  light industry and the food industry. Such a practice is  encouraged by the Chinese not only at the provincial but also at  the governmental level through the publication of the  corresponding statutes. The volume of "shuttle" trade, according  to Chinese figures, was $614 million. The Russians consider  shuttle operations to be a negative aspect since they contribute  to the outflow of hard currency from Russia.    Moreover, the fixed exchange rate of the Swiss franc (this  is  the currency in which the mutual settlements are transacted) is  artificially reduced with respect to the Chinese yuan (1.8  francs per yuan, while the black market rate is 0.1 francs per  yuan).    Weapons are one of the most profitable items of Russian  exports to China. As an example Mikhail Belyy mentioned the sale  of two SU-27 squadron fighters and the S-300 antiaircraft  missile complex (delivery volume not specified).    It is known from other sources that Beijing also purchased  two SU-31 squadron interceptors and an unestablished number of  T-72 tanks, and they are also showing an interest in Russian  missile targeting systems. The British weekly JANE'S DEFENSE  WEEKLY reported another delivery of SN-27's; the representative  of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on  the publication. There have been reports that the Chinese are  conducting negotiations for the purchase of the Varyag aircraft  carrier which is under construction. Taking into account China's  claims to the Spratly archipelago and its desire to dominate in  the South China Sea, such a transaction can hardly contribute to  maintaining stability in Southeast Asia.    The diplomat noted that weapons trade with China is a  "completely normal phenomenon" and when engaging in it Russia is  guided by a number of principles, namely: not to harm its own  security, nonproliferation of nuclear technologies, and  transparency.    Mikhail Belyy denies the existence of territorial problems  in  Russian-Chinese relations. In his assessment, border  negotiations are proceeding successfully enough. An agreement on  the eastern section of the border was signed in May 1991.  Demarcation work was begun on this section in May of last year.  The Kazakhstan segment of the Western section was finally agreed  upon a couple of days ago. "There is nothing crucial or  explosive about this issue," the diplomat noted.    At the same time he admitted that there were problems with  maintaining border procedures.    The number of border violations by China on the eastern  section tripled during the past year. Contraband operations and  poaching in Russian waters have become widespread (in May 1993,  as we know, a unilateral Russian moratorium on pollack fishing  took effect in the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk).    Local Russian authorities are also disturbed by the  demographic situation in the border regions of the Far East. We  have no precise information on this. The estimates of the number  of Chinese now living in the Far East range from 300,000 to 1  million, and the overall number of Chinese citizens living  permanently (frequently illegally) in Russia amounts 2 million,  and in Moscow--50,000. The number of Chinese reported to be  living in certain regions of the Far East exceeds the number of  local residents. Thus in Partizanskiy Rayon of Maritime Kray,  according to the results of a special surprise inspection, the  ratio was 14,000 to 7,000. The crime situation on the border is  getting worse; it was for this reason that the crossing point  from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, where Minister Kozyrev recently  visited, was closed.    During the course of the negotiations, Mikhail Belyy stated,  it is intended to sign a bilateral agreement on border crossing  points so as "to make the process controlled." At the present  time 21 crossing points have been opened on the Russian-Chinese  border, 19 of which are in operation. What with the  unprecedented growth of border trade, border and customs  officials are unable to keep up with their work. For example,  last year the border was crossed by a total of 2.5 million  people. The Russians, in Belyy's words, adhere to the principle  "better fewer but better." On 29 October of last year on  Russia's initiative an international agreement on visa  conditions was signed. As for crime, there is an agreement on  legal assistance between Russia and China, Mikhail Belyy stated,  which the Chinese propose to augment with an agreement on  turning over criminals. At one time it was the Chinese who  refused to include the corresponding articles in the agreement  on legal assistance.    Russia's position on the Taiwan problem is determined by the  president's edict of 15 September 1992: Relations with the  island will be conducted exclusively on an unofficial, nonstate  level. These, Belyy stated, are the "rules of the game which the  entire world follows." In the recent past, he said, there has  been a "naive euphoria," largely from the Russian side. But it  is with extreme caution that capital is invested in Taiwanese  business. The volume of Russian-Taiwanese trade now, the  diplomat reported, is about $500 million.</p>

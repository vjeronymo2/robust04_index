			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENIOR PUTTS TO AUSTRALIAN OPEN LEAD  </P> <P> Australian Peter Senior took a three-stroke second-round lead over Nick Faldo  of Britian and Jeff Woodland of Australia with his second 66 in the $400,000  Australian Open golf tournament today.  </P> <P> Senior, who has improved his touch on the greens by switching to a long-handled  putter, has played 36 holes without a bogey.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to jump up and down just yet," Senior said. "There are a lot of  good players on the leader board. I've tended to rush things before, so I'm  going to take my time and think about my game over the next two days."  </P> <P> First-round leader Curtis Strange and Mark Calcavecchia are four shots behind  Senior at 136. Strange, the U.S. Open champion, followed his course record  tying first round of 65 on the 6,847-yard, par-72 Kingston Heath course with an  inconsistent round of 71 that included seven birdies and six bogeys.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to say," Strange said of the round that began with four  consecutive bogeys and then four straight birdies. "I can't remember playing a  round like that. I made a number of birdies, but I never felt in control of my  game. I was never comfortable, but I kept fighting."  </P> <P> Calcavecchia, the British Open champion and defending Australian Open champion,  added a 69 to his first round of 67.  </P> <P> "If I can keep shooting scores in the 60s, I'll be there at the end,"  Calcavecchia said. "I'm kind of hanging around and I'm playing well, so I'm in  good shape. I'm putting well, which takes a lot of pressure off the rest of my  game. The greens are fast, but I like them that way. The faster the better."  </P> <P> Faldo shot a 67 in the second round to tie Woodland, who had a 69.  </P> <P> "It's quite tricky judging the wind direction and the strength of it, but I  made some good guesses," Faldo said.  </P> <P> Australian Greg Norman, seeking his fourth Australian Open title, followed his  opening round of even-par 72 with a 70 and is 10 shots off the pace.  </P> <P> "I had a chance to get into contention and I let it slide on 16 and 17, and  that's basically it," Norman said. "I played a lot better than I did yesterday,  but if you're going to be in contention, you've got to make a lot of putts, and  I missed a lot of makeable putts."  </P> <P> Scotland's Colin Montgomerie equaled the course record of 65 held by Gary  Player, Ronan Rafferty and Strange to move into contention at 137.  </P> <P> Australian Chris Gray had a hole in one on the par-3 10th but was unable to  claim a $32,000 automobile because of his amateur status.  </P></p>

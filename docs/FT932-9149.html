			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Osprey shares suspended at 26p Shares in Osprey Communications, the advertising and marketing services group, were yesterday suspended at 26p. Rumours that a bid for the group was in the offing have lifted the shares from January's low of 7p. It is thought that it is the target of its third reverse takeover in 10 years  - this time from SMS Communications, a privately-owned advertising concern, headed by Mr Jack Rubins.</p>

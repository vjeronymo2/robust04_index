			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISTIANI'S PLEA FOR CONTINUED MILITARY AID  </P> <P> Cristiani praises himself for participating in U.N.-mediated negotiations with  the FMLN, and for signing a human-rights agreement. However, he fails to  mention that he unilaterally declared the military a non-negotiable item.  </P> <P> Everyone knows that the military, not the FMLN, has committed a countless  number of human-rights violations during the past 10 years of civil war.  </P> <P> He criticizes the FMLN for demanding the expulsion of 200 military personnel.  He never says that the reason the FMLN wants these officers expelled from the  military is that they are all accused of committing gross human-rights  violations against the people of El Salvador.  </P> <P> Cristiani also fails to mention the fact that everyone in El Salvador from  students, to campesinos, to businessmen, and other political parties supports  the FMLN's demands.  </P> <P> KRISTIN WORTHMAN, Northridge  </P></p>

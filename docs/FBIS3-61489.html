			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. V. Konyayev, E. A. Leont'yeva, and E. G. </F> Morozov, Acoustics Institute]    [Abstract] On the basis of data relating to currents  obtained in the Mesopolygon experiment, which was conducted in  the tropical part of the North Atlantic in 1985, the authors  made a statistical examination of an internal wave field, with  particular emphasis on inertial and tidal waves.    It was found that the chief anomalous features of inertial  and tidal waves were their increased intensity, and that the  intensity depends on the depth of the horizon, as well as on  frequency and time. At the same time the intensity of the waves  decreased considerably towards the ocean's surface.    Conclusions which could be drawn from the above were first  that inertial and tidal waves are generated locally in the lower  levels of the ocean, and secondly that on the average they lose  their energy as they rise towards the surface.    On the basis of similarities between some of the data  obtained in the Mesopolygon experiment and data obtained in  other regions, the authors speculate that the generation of  inertial and tidal waves in this area may be caused by an  intrusive lens of Mediterranean waters.</p>

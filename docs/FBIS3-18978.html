			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F> lower house floor leader, by Alberto Gentili; place and date not  given: "The League Fires Berlusconi" -- first two paragraphs  are IL MESSAGGERO introduction]    [Text] His close friends say that in his house in Gemonio,  [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi is having a big laugh.  He is laughing over [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi who  let himself "be led by the nose." He is laughing at the  politicians and commentators who still believe in an alliance  between the Northern League and Forza Italia and consider his  intemperances as being the internal squabbles of the phantasmal  "pole of freedoms." Nothing could be further from the truth.    For the Senator [Bossi nickname], the alliance with His  Broadcastness [Berlusconi nickname] is already over. It lasted  only one day. On 12 February when he officially shook hands  with Berlusconi in Milan. The Northern League secretary wanted  to keep the Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] candidates from  entering the field in opposition to the Northern Leaguers in the  uninominal constituencies. And this is what he got. He wanted  to present "at least 280 Lombard people with excellent  possibilities for success in the lower house and the Senate."  And he succeeded. Since then he has one principal enemy:  Berlusconi. And he demonstrates this in every way. He calls  him a "Craxiano" and an "heir of the five-party coalition." He  threatens that which is dearest to him: "his TV stations." He  even denies him votes and orders the League members "not to  support or present Forza Italia candidates." An unscrupulous  game that has been revealed by Roberto Maroni, the Richelieu of  the Bandwagon [League nickname], the man that concretely put  down the electoral accord between Bossi and His Broadcastness in  black and white. Let us listen to what he says.    [Gentili] Honorable Maroni, the pact with Berlusconi is over  then?    [Maroni] It depends. Some are still thinking in terms of  proportional representation. They think that everything works  like it used to before, when electing candidates depended on the  party organs. Now instead, with the majority system, any  aspiring senator or representative must personally have the  strength and credibility to get himself elected.    [Gentili] What does this mean?    [Maroni] That we will now see if our militants are right  when  they say: "The Christian Democrats put forward by Berlusconi  will not be elected." Or if Forza Italia and the Christian  Democrats of Mastella and Casini are right when they reply: "Do  not run under the flags of the League and Forza Italia to be  elected."    [Gentili] Who do you think is right?    [Maroni] Our militants. Moreover, we cannot force the League  members to carry out an election campaign for a former Christian  Democrat.    [Gentili] You are not even trying to.    [Maroni] You cannot ask for miracles.    [Gentili] Is it not instead because Bossi already considers  the alliance with Forza Italia as finished? He has succeeded in  keeping Berlusconi, his most dangerous rival, out of the North.  And now he is saying: "Enemies like before."    [Maroni] I agree. It is more or less like this.    [Gentili] Bossi's was a masterly stroke.    [Maroni] Are you sure that such an astute maneuver was made  by Bossi?    [Gentili] By whom then?    [Maroni] Think well. Somebody else who works with Bossi did  this.    [Gentili] You?    [Maroni] Good. Do not make me say it.    [Gentili] Try to draw up a balance sheet.    [Maroni] We have reached our objective. We have succeeded in  guaranteeing the League a very strong parliamentary  representation which would not have been possible if we had set  ourselves against Forza Italia. If everything goes as planned we  should bring no less than 200 representatives to parliament.  And this is a lot: triple the number we currently have.    [Gentili] And what is more, you have your hands free.    [Maroni] Right. And I will give you an example: How many  chances does Berlusconi have of governing with the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left]?    [Gentili] You tell me.    [Maroni] Zero point something. While it is much more likely  that the League will enter into an accord with an Occhetto  government. We are a political animal whose objective is the  realization of federalism. With anyone.    [Gentili] And, as you will maintain, you are no doubt closer  to the federalism of the PDS than that of the MSI [Italian  Social Movement]. Is this not so?    [Maroni] This is so.    [Gentili] So, do you confirm that the accord with Berlusconi  is definitively over?    [Maroni] I would say that the only thing that remains  standing is an electoral accord.    [Gentili] You forget that Bossi's election campaign is a  revolt against Berlusconi rather than against Occhetto...    [Maroni] Berlusconi is taking care of the PDS.    [Gentili] For Bossi, who is a potential ally in government,  [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli or Occhetto?    [Maroni] Let us not exaggerate. The Knight for us is  something more. We will first try to attain federalism with  him. But if he says "no," or if he forges an alliance with the  fascists [MSI], well then, we will consider ourselves free to  look for other partners.</p>

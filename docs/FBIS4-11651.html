			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Argentine President Carlos Menem at the Closing </F> Ceremony of the G-15 Summit in New Delhi -- live, in Spanish  with simultaneous translation into English]    [Text] Mr. Prime Minister of India, Mr. Prime Minister of  Malaysia, Mr. President of Nigeria, delegates of the Group of  15, ladies, gentlemen: I would like to use this opportunity to  confirm our commitments to the targets and principles of the  group, which, according to our conviction, has been strengthened  and matured in the course of the years, and also to repeat the  willingness of our country to host in 1995 this summit meeting.  Furthermore, on behalf of my people and the government, I would  like to thank very sincerely for the cordial welcome, the  affection, the kindness that has been shown to us in these few  hours of our presence in this beautiful country and congratulate  you for the organization of this meeting. We are convinced of  the importance of the cooperation among our countries as a  fundamental instrument in our struggle for development and  welfare of our people.    Success that we noted in the processes of reform in the past  years in many countries that form part of this forum shows  clearly which benefits countries can expect that are ready to  undergo processes of liberalization and the economic opening. I  believe that the traumatic experiences shared by the countries  present here are some of the most valuable ones offered by the  contemporary world. Sharing this experience among us will help  us to face future challenges and strengthen the achievements  already attained. In this respect, I would like to express my  great personal satisfaction over the results obtained in many of  the cooperation projects the group has already implemented. In  particular, I would like to underline the success of the meeting  on exchange of information on national economic policies, which  focus on the issue of privatization. It is an example of the  activities aimed at strengthening and consolidating the work and  functioning of this group. At the same time, it is a clear  example of the constructive form of a high-technical component  in which the South-South cooperation can be made increasingly  effective. I am convinced that the strengthening of our group  through a program of technical cooperation cleared of  ideological contents, which are survivors from, or vestiges  from, passages already overcome, and a solid scientific support  constitute the best possible way to sensitize the most developed  countries regarding the needs of a free international trade.  The different sectors of our countries, without prejudice, will  help us to create a favorable international environment, in  which the benefit of free trade will be distributed in a just  manner among all of the nations of the world.    Luckily, the days are already gone by when the probable,  alleged culprits of all our problems were sought in the  developed world. Today, we know that the main responsibility of  our countries is to achieve the necessary structural  transformation to maintain the course of full economic and  social development. The genuine economic development, stemming  from this process of sincerity, will constitute the best basis  for the universal consolidation of fully democratic regime  founded on the sovereignty of the people whose authorities act  in strict conformity with the laws sanctioned by the  representatives of the people without discriminations and with  full respect for the human rights. In other times, these  subjects were considered to be the exclusive domain of each  state outside of the interference of other members of  international community. Today, we know to which extent it is  in the interest of everyone that democracy be effectively  adopted by all nations. Recent history and also the events we  have to face everyday in the different regions of this world  show us that as long as this does not occur, a Damoclean sword  will continue to hang over world peace and over the material,  moral progress of our people, as well as the effective sharing  of the benefit of civilization by all human beings.    Argentina has systematically sustained the need to realize a  role of international organizations of all kinds as a dominant  force and a useful instrument in trying to achieve international  peace. In this framework, an active commitment to the values of  democracy, pluralism, rule of law, and the protection of human  rights, is the best contribution we can make in order to promote  all the other objectives of the Group of 15.    I would like to repeat my thanks, very warm gratitude, at  the  fact that we have been allowed to be in the last moments of the  meeting of the Group of 15 and to be able to repeat the offer of  Argentina that in 1995 we will be able to meet again in our  country in order to continue our deliberations there. One of  the most fundamental topics Argentina is going to propose, and  that has already been dealt with in the framework of the United  Nations, is the creation of an organization termed White Helmets  in order to make sure and support the struggle against poverty  on our earth. I think we cannot be talking of justice and peace  as long as there are poor people on this globe. I think we have  reached an unavoidable and inescapable commitment of all  countries, especially those that have greater possibilities, to  be involved not only on the diplomatic level in a preventive way  but fundamentally in the diplomacy of cooperation, solidarity.  The White Helmets that the Republic of Argentina proposes do  not mean to try and achieve only food and similar help for our  brothers on this earth that need it, but to achieve a way of  teaching man to work, teaching man to make use of the resources  available on the earth to make sure that on the basis of his own  efforts, he may have a more dignified life. We will continue to  insist on this issue and we will make sure that in 1995, the  White Helmets will be present in those countries and those  places where marginal poverty is specially hard until we may in  this way bring warmth and affection to those people who really  need to be alleviated of the sacrifice they are subjected to.  Thank you very much and we see you soon. [applause]</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROKERAGE IN FLUOR HEADQUARTERS SALE AWARDED $6 MILLION BY JURY  </P> <P> After three days of deliberation, an Orange County Superior Court jury  Wednesday awarded an Irvine brokerage at least $6 million as a commission for  its role in the 1985 sale of Fluor Corp.'s headquarters to a Texas developer.  </P> <P> The jury ruled in favor of Lee &amp; Associates in the closely watched,  5-year-old lawsuit filed against Fluor, the large Irvine-based engineering and  construction firm, and Trammell Crow Co., the Dallas-based office builder.  </P> <P> The case, which went to trial in late July and continued intermittently until  Friday, drew widespread attention because of the corporate names involved, the  large sums of money at stake and the complex issues in question.  </P> <P> Lee was seeking a $9-million commission. The finding of fraud allows the firm  to make a claim for punitive damages.  </P></p>

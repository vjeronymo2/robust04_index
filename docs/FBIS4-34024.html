			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and </F> Cuban President Fidel Castro at the Mexican Embassy in Havana on  13 June; from the "NTV" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Salinas] Comrades, Cuban friends: This is an  especially important visit. A visit to Cuba can never be  considered a mere stopover en route to other nations, even for a  Mexican president. It is a vital visit. Just being here makes  a statement. I want this visit to be deep and broad in content  and not just a formal visit. In summarizing what has been  discussed and agreed upon over this long and intense period, I  would said that two essential elements turned this visit into a  very important state visit for the Mexican president.    First, we have reaffirmed what is clear to many: No one  should forget the affectionate, lasting, and permanent  relationship between the Cuban and Mexican peoples, a  relationship that is neither affected nor diminished by  circumstances or events. [applause]    Second, the intensity, depth, and significance of this visit  have translated into specific results in the effort to  strengthen ties. Cuba and Mexico have established economic,  financial, and commercial ties to their benefit. On this  occasion, I am pleased to note that we were able to realize what  took months of intense talk and negotiation among several  Mexican businessmen, namely a Cuban- Mexican association. This  alone is a great step forward and shows that we can build this  relationship with solid brick, on a strong foundation and with  deep roots. There will always be a place in the Mexican  people's heart and mind for the beloved and respected people of  Cuba.    [Castro] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, esteemed  Mexican and Cuban brothers: I knew I was not going to get out of  having to speak. [laughter] We are true slaves to the clock and  must stick strictly to the agenda. This is why I will only say  that we have broken several Olympic records here. First, this  is the shortest official visit we have had. This must be noted  in the Guiness Book of Records. Second, many things have been  accomplished during this visit. President Salinas' ability to do  things quickly is truly admirable. Third, another Olympic record  involves the friendship, warmth, trust, and brotherhood which  President Salinas has given to every issue and aspects he has  already explained.    This is not a stopover. A stopover is what I am doing here,  at the Mexican Embassy, before moving ahead. [laughter]    This outstanding official visit has been very good and  productive. Visiting Cuba today is an act of courage, given the  magnitude of the campaign against Cuba. Therefore, the Mexican  president and his delegation have carried out a courageous and  admirable act. [applause] We will always remember and be  eternally grateful.    Looking at the clock, we will have to run as fast as we can,  without getting ourselves killed, to meet the agenda and be at  the airport by 1700. [laughter] Another record has been set: I  have delivered my briefest speech ever. Thank you. [laughter,  applause]</p>

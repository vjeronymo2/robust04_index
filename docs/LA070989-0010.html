			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BECAUSE THE ONES I WORK FOR  </P> <P> Because the ones I work for do not love me, because I have said too much and I  haven't been sure of what is right and I've hated the people I've trusted,  because I work in an office and we are lost and when I come home I say their  lives are theirs and they don't know what they apologize for and none of it  mended, because I let them beat me and I remember something of mine which not  everyone has, and because I lie to keep my self and my hands my voice on the  phone what I swallow what hurts me, because I hurt them --  </P> <P> </P> <P> I give them the hours I spend away from them and carry them, even in my sleep,  at least as the nag of a misplaced shoe, for years after I have quit and gone  on to another job where I hesitate in telling and I remember and I resent  having had to spend more time with them than with the ones I love.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From "Who Whispered Near Me" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: $14.95; 66 pp.).

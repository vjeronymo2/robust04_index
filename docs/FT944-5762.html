			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Greece leads EU food stakes Greeks spend more on food, drink and tobacco than anyone else in the European Union, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office. The French, reputedly connoisseurs of food and drink, actually spend less on these pleasures than the British. And the Irish spend more than other Europeans on having fun. Eurostat says spending on food, beverages and tobacco fell to 19.1 per cent of total EU household consumption in 1992 from 20.8 per cent during the late 1980s. The Greeks spent 36.7 per cent, followed by the Irish on 34.8 per cent, the Portuguese on 33.6 per cent and the British on 21.6 per cent. The French spent 18.6 per cent - lower than the EU average. The Dutch spent less than anyone else in the Union: 14.9 per cent. As far as recreation, entertainment, education and culture are concerned, the Irish expended 12.1 per cent of household consumption. The British, Danes and Dutch all spent about 10 per cent. Luxembourg spent least at 4.1 per cent.</p>

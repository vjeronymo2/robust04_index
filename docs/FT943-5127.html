			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: VW to import light trucks to Europe Volkswagen is to import light trucks from Brazil for sale in the European market for the first time, writes Kevin Done. The introduction of the Brazilian-built 7.5 tonne truck, the L80, is aimed at closing a gap in the VW range of light commercial vehicles caused by the termination early last year of its previous light truck joint venture with MAN, the German truck and bus maker. The L80 was originally developed by Autolatina, Volkswagen's majority-owned Brazilian subsidiary, for the South American market. Volkswagen said that it was planning to sell around 2,500 trucks in a full year in Germany, where the L80 will go on sale from the start of next year. It will be launched a year later in several other European markets. The L80 truck will be supplied from Brazil as a chassis-cab with Brazilian-produced engines supplied by a local subsidiary of MWM, a German engine manufacturer. VW said that it was seeking eventually to expand its presence in the west European commercial vehicle market to include trucks up to 10 tonnes in addition to its present range of German-built vans, light trucks and pick-ups.</p>

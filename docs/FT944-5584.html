			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Borden to discuss rival suitor's plan Borden, the troubled US food group that has agreed to a Dollars 2bn takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, yesterday agreed to discuss an offer from a rival suitor, Mr Paul Kazarian. The company said it would meet Mr Kazarian on Sunday to hear more about his plan to arrange a restructuring of Borden that would involve buying back 30 per cent of its stock at Dollars 17 a share. That figure represents a significant premium to the KKR offer of Dollars 14.25 a share. Borden, however, said Mr Kazarian's proposal was 'silent' on many important details, and Wall Street expressed its scepticism about the plan by marking Borden's shares down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 3/4 . Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster consumer products group, runs a Rhode Island investment firm called Japonica Partners. He has been trying to present himself as a white knight for Borden. In his latest letter to Mr Frank Tasco, Borden's chairman, Mr Kazarian has offered to help finance a Dollars 430m share buy-back by the company, and has also suggested spinning off its dairy and packaged food businesses. However, Borden yesterday appeared to pour cold water on the plan, pointing to a number of potential weaknesses.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TEA TIMES;  </P> <P> FORGET EVERYTHING YOU EVER KNEW ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL TEA PARTY. TEA HAS GROWN  UP, GAINED SOPHISTICATION AND GONE INTERNATIONAL  </P> <P> The three martini lunch is passe. The cocktail party is in decline. These days  the truly trendy invite their friends in to take tea.  </P> <P>  But if tea conjures up old-fashioned images of proper people sitting around  with their pinkies raised, think again. Tea has changed.  </P> <P> When artist Merle Miller decided to give her very first tea party, she was  faced with two challenges: How to give her contemporary home a romantic teatime  atmosphere, and how not to overwhelm her male guests with too many frilly  foods.  </P> <P> But Miller was determined. Inspired by a recent trip to London, her tea  featured a patio counter covered with splashy batik cloths to highlight  champagne glasses and berry baskets, and sofas and chairs draped with rich  heavy throws. At the flower mart in downtown Los Angeles, she found some wide  French-tapestry-wired ribbons and natural fiber ribbons, which she wove around  her teapot, along with some old lace.  </P> <P> And so it was on a beautiful sunlit Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock, teatime,  that Miller's sprawling Bel-Air home, full of post-modern furniture and tribal  art, was transformed into an eclectic tea parlor. Caterer Kay Kramon brought  freshly baked currant scones and orange mini-muffins, and a harpist was hired.  </P> <P> To avoid what Miller termed "sensory overload," she placed the food, tea  services and floral centerpieces (pots of exotic orchids and cheerful spring  bouquets) at various stations inside the house and around the patio. Arranging  the food with a painterly eye for balance and color, she mixed and matched the  trays, china, platters and baskets used to serve each item. Wild twig baskets  contained Parmesan toast; a green marble slab held parsley-trimmed sandwiches.  Miller put plates of sugar-sprinkled brownies and strawberries on a metal  kitchen rack decorated with French ribbon. Vegetable sandwiches garnished with  orchids and delicate bamboo sprigs were set on a blond wood tray.  </P> <P> As for the beverage itself, Miller feels that "A lot of teas are boring -- they  have no flavor." She favors Darjeeling from New Delhi because "It's very fresh,  musty and earthy." She's also a fan of designer teas -- "I love apricot."  </P> <P> And how did the men get along? Miller said she was thrilled by their response.  There is, however, one thing she discovered: "Men don't really like little  sandwiches," Miller said. "Next time, I'll serve bigger, heavier ones."  </P> <P> Free-lance food writer Judith Pacht's version of high tea was done in the style  of the Southwest.  </P> <P> She served small tostadas filled with tequila-marinated flank steak. Pacht  dreamed up another variation on the traditional tea sandwich in the form of  quesadilla wedges with sun-dried tomatoes and chiles. (These can be assembled  ahead and heated just before serving.) They were accompanied by fragrant lemon  and cinnamon teas served in multihued Luna Garcia-designed cups.  </P> <P> Cornmeal-pinon tartlets, a spinoff of a cornmeal pie idea, were filled with  toasted pine nuts in buttery caramel. And a spicy hint of chile was the  surprise twist in her fudgy Sandia chocolate-chile squares, named for Sandia  Peak in New Mexico. To drink, Pacht often pours good quality green tea. "It has  an essence that is so fragrant and subtle," she said.  </P> <P> Pacht served her casual tea in the living room, on top a grand piano lushly  draped with a geometric black-and-white weave; a Southwestern-style fireplace  warmed the room. "The important thing," Pacht said, "is to keep the food  simple. Also, to make the party easier for the host or hostess, it is better to  invite just a few people, at most six to eight. Otherwise go to Trumps and have  a terrific time."  </P> <P> "When I was little, everybody had teas," said Barbara Cheatley, a Claremont  store owner. "I grew up helping my mother make sandwiches for tea. Usually we  didn't sit -- we just walked around and balanced our plates. We all thought we  had to be ladies."  </P> <P> From the Georgian through the Victorian era, many little girls in high-button  shoes had Nursery Tea in the afternoon. It was served on a miniature tea  service; dolls were generally the honored guests.  </P> <P> Our modern Nursery Tea was conceived by caterer Kay Kramon and offered warm  cocoa mixed with orange-flavored tea and miniature marshmallows.  </P> <P> For adult appetites, she suggested a menu to go with herbal or fruit teas:  traditional Marsala-laden scones with creme fraiche and fresh berry jam; lemon  curd tartlets (adapted from Martha Stewart's book "Entertaining"); orange pate  with Grand Marnier, and crisp endive with salmon roe. And just to prove that a  tea can be held anywhere, this one was served in interior designer Marcella  Bade's upstairs bedroom, overlooking the Hollywood hills.  </P> <P> The following recipes are from Judith Pacht and Kay Kramon. For assorted  mini-sandwiches, Kramon suggests different combinations of thinly sliced  cucumber, tomato, white and red radishes, watercress, dill, chives and parsley,  and various sprouts with herbed mayonnaise or tarragon butter. Use very thinly  sliced crustless white and wheat breads. Flavored breads, such as the anise or  fig breads from La Brea Bakery (or your own banana or date nut bread), make  wonderful tea party fare when spread with cream cheese.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A SOUTHWEST TEA  </P> <P> Tequila Flank Steak Tostaditas Quesadilla Wedges With Sun-Dried Tomatoes and  ChilesMexican Wedding Cakes Sandia Chocolate Chile Squares Lemon, Green and  Mango Teas  </P> <P> </P> <P> TEQUILA FLANK STEAK TOSTADITAS  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound) flank steak  </P> <P> 1/3 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup tequila  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons dried oregano, crushed  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 6 (6-inch) corn tortillas, cut in quarters  </P> <P> 2 avocados  </P> <P> 1/3 cup grated onion  </P> <P> 1 cup finely diced tomato, drained  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons (or to taste) jalapeno sauce  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Few drops lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups finely shredded arugula or romaine lettuce leaves  </P> <P> Place flank steak in non-metal flat dish and add soy sauce, tequila, garlic and  oregano.

Refrigerate at least 1 day  before serving. Makes about 3 2/3 cups.  </P> <P> Note: Garnish with criss-crossed slivers of orange zest, orange blossoms and  leaves. Serve with fresh, sliced French bread, if desired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRANT SCONES  </P> <P> 4 1/2 cups sifted flour  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut in pieces  </P> <P> 1/2 cup Marsala wine  </P> <P> 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cups whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 cup currants  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and sugar into large mixing  bowl. Combine 1/2 flour mixture with butter and process until mixture resembles  coarse meal. Remove from processor and add to remaining flour in bowl.  </P> <P> Mixing lightly with fingers, gradually add Marsala wine and enough whipping  cream (1 to 1 1/2 cups, larger amount makes for softer richer scones) until  dough holds together. Mix in currants. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill about 30  minutes.  </P> <P> Roll dough into 3/4-inch thick circle. Using 2-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter,  cut out scones. Beat egg lightly with 1/4 cup cream. Brush scones with egg  glaze and arrange on buttered baking sheet.  </P> <P> Bake at 375 degrees, or until golden brown and puffed, about 13 to 15 minutes.  Makes about 10 (i-inch) scones.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with creme fraiche and fresh berry jam, if desired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEMON CURD TARTLETS ("Martha Stewart's Entertaining Cookbook")  </P> <P> 2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 12 egg yolks, lightly beaten and strained  </P> <P> 1 cup lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 cup unsalted butter  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons grated lemon zest  </P> <P> Tartlet Shells  </P> <P> Raspberries, optional  </P> <P> Combine sugar and egg yolks in medium saucepan. Gradually stir in lemon juice.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture coats back of spoon and  registers 168 degrees on candy thermometer. Do not boil.  </P> <P> Remove from heat, whisk until slightly cooled. Stir in butter and lemon zest.  Cool completely. Fill Tartlet Shells with lemon curd and decorate with  raspberries.

Cut butter into small pieces  and add to flour. Process quickly until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add  water by droplets, mixing just until dough holds together when pressed with  fingers (dough should not be wet or sticky).  </P> <P> Remove dough from bowl of processor and press into flat round. Wrap in plastic  wrap and chill 20 to 30 minutes.  </P> <P> To form tartlets, use twice as many tartlet pans as projected number of  tartlets. Lightly spray insides of 1/2 pans with non-stick vegetable coating.  Roll out 1/2 pastry on floured board into round about 1/8-inch thick. Place  tartlet pans on pastry and with sharp knife, cut pastry into pieces slightly  larger than pans.  </P> <P> Place pastry in prepared pans, pressing firmly. Cut off excess pastry with  thumb. Press unbuttered pan into each pastry-lined pan to act as weight. Place  shells on baking sheet and chill 30 minutes.  </P> <P> (If necessary, place baking sheet on top of shells to hold down while baking.)  Bake shells at 375 degrees 10 minutes. Remove top sheet and bake additional 5  to 7 minutes until lightly golden. Remove from pans and cool. Makes 30 to 40  shells.  </P> <P> Resources:  </P> <P> Ladies afternoon tea photographed at the home of Marcella Bade, an interior  designer and owner of Design Connection Showroom, Los Angeles.

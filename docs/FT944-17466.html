			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Russia at a crossroads Russia has reached the limits of gradualism. For nine months, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin and his colleagues have done their best to find a middle way between economic 'shock therapy' and no treatment at all. But the lesson of transition elsewhere is that, in the long term, there is no middle way - only a choice between a Big Bang stabilisation and social and economic collapse. Unfortunately, there is nothing inevitable about Russia taking the route of stabilisation. The west may be able to weight the odds in favour of that option, but ultimately only Russia can decide. Other post communist states - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic - have already passed this turning point. But in Russia, the institutions of a civil and market society remain precarious. Privatisation, one of the success stories of the past two years, has helped to produce a new entrepreneurial spirit in many sectors of the economy. But without stabilisation and concerted legal reform, the zeal for profit will be more visible in fraud and organised crime than in the rise of a legitimate private sector. Political forces have conspired against a more concerted reform strategy. The centres of power of the old order are badly damaged, but can still command large constituencies. Increasingly, Mr Yeltsin himself seems to be leaning towards the more conservative of his advisers, who are ambivalent about reform where they are not downright hostile. Difficult truth The difficult truth is that the government's very lack of credibility doomed the gradualist approach from the start. Enterprises have not stopped borrowing excessively, because they do not expect inflation to stay low. In an effort to choke such borrowing off, the monetary authorities have had to impose exceptionally high real rates of interest, which, in turn, trigger more distress borrowing. As a result, the economy now teeters on a mountain of inter-enterprise debt. Even previously viable companies are likely to get sucked into the web, as long as they believe the government will eventually give in to the demands of indebted competitors. And over the past few months, the government has begun to do precisely that. There has been a relaxation of monetary controls, and renewed flows of credits to state enterprises. The upshot is the weakening of the rouble, which fell 20 per cent last month, itself a harbinger of renewed inflation. It is still falling: a further 5 per cent on Wednesday alone. How should the west respond? Whatever their differences, the IMF and all the Group of Seven countries must tell Russia that now is the time to make the decisive leap, and back up the advice with a firm offer of financial support if they do so. In Madrid this week, US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen reiterated what he told Mr Yeltsin during his visit to Washington last month: that very large sums of aid were available quickly, but 'only to support reform'. Active restructuring This means that, to obtain cash flows of up to Dollars 10bn from the international financial institutions this year, the Russian government must commit itself to a further round of credit cuts and much more active industrial and social restructuring than it has so far attempted. In the process it will have to tread heavily on interests which have so far been shaken, but not deeply stirred. Central to such a strategy will be stable prices. For all their political attractions, half measures simply cannot deliver stability in the long run. As Russian ministers know, gradualism allows them to ease their present burdens, but this only piles up the weight on future ones. Sooner or later, they would have to demand the kind of sacrifices from their people which they have not so far had to make. The better alternative is to make the commitment, now, to a to a fixed exchange rate, backed by a sizeable western stabilisation fund and adequate non-inflationary finance to cover the budget for at least a year or two. Above all, it is critical that the US and other western countries are true to their word: the fact that Russia has missed past reform opportunities owes something to western ambivalence. Before the west can help, however, the Russian government must make a leap of faith.</p>

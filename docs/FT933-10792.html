			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: ERM bowled by a wide Last night's decision to allow ERM currencies except the D-Mark and the guilder to fluctuate by 15 per cent on either side of their central rates amounts to a virtual admission that the system is dead and Europe is back at least temporarily to a free-float. But a more constructive attempt to repair the ERM was evidently rendered impossible by Germany's continuing refusal to cut its interest rates. France must now have some leeway to go its own way, especially since its currency would be clearly undervalued if it were to fall by the full amount of its new ultra-wide band. Hitherto even weak currencies whose prospects of survival in the system were doubtful have been allowed to fluctuate by only 6 per cent on either side of a central rate. By keeping a band of sorts in place, Europe has at least some protection against the most pernicious policies of competitive devaluation. Doubtless the exchange markets' initial reaction today will be to sell the franc, but France's fundamentals in the form of low inflation and a strong trade performance must eventually provide some underpinning for the franc. This could keep international money flowing into French bonds as short-term interest rates fall. Paradoxically the great loser might ultimately be the D-Mark. The ERM of which it has been the anchor is now barely recognisable. Investors have been deprived of motivation to hold funds in a currency that by objective standards should be weak. As they relate this to the bigger picture, foreign exchange markets might conclude that the long-awaited recovery of the dollar can begin in earnest. That together with a weak bond market may make it even harder for the Bundesbank to accelerate its rate cuts. All of this makes the recent rally in the Frankfurt stock market look decidedly overdone.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Newmont Mining combines assets with subsidiary Newmont Mining, the Denver-based gold company, and its partially-owned subsidiary, Newmont Gold are combining assets and operations in a complicated stock transfer that will make the two publicly-traded companies virtually identical. Together, they constitute the world's sixth-largest gold producer. The deal stops short of a full merger, which the company said could not be effected without creating a large accounting charge. 'It nevertheless is tax-free and satisfies the operating and financial purposes of a full merger,' said Mr Ronald Cambre, chief executive officer of both companies. Shares of the two companies will continue to trade separately on the New York Stock Exchange, but they should trade at nearly identical prices since they would have the same outlook, operating results and dividends. Analysts welcomed the transaction, which still must be approved by New-mont Gold's public shareholders. 'This should clear up a lot of investor confusion about what the differences are between the two companies,' said Phillip Martin, a gold company analyst at Gordon Capital. Newmont Mining, once highly diversified, has shed Peabody Coal and other mining operations since 1986, and is now a worldwide gold mining and exploration company that owns 90 per cent of Newmont Gold. Newmont Gold has 19.5m ounces of gold reserves, mostly in Nevada's rich Carlin Trend. Their combination will give shareholders in both companies ownership of the same properties worldwide. Their combined gold reserves will be approximately 26m ounces, and the company projects worldwide gold production will approach 2m ounces of gold annually by 1996. The plan calls for Newmont Mining to convey all its operating assets and liabilities to Newmont Gold, as well as 8.6m shares of Newmont Gold stock. The stock transfer is intended to balance the existing price difference between the two companies. Newmont Mining shares will then be split 1.25 shares for each existing share, bringing its outstanding common stock to 85.8m shares, equal to the number of common stock outstanding in Newmont Gold once the transaction is complete. After the combination, Newmont Mining's assets will be shareholder interests in Newmont Gold.</p>

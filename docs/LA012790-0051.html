			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMY AT A VIRTUAL STANDSTILL;  </P> <P> BUSINESS: THE QUARTERLY GNP GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ONLY 0.5%. BUT ANALYSTS  SEE AN UPTURN AND SAY THAT A RECESSION APPEARS UNLIKELY.  </P> <P> The growth of the nation's economy slowed virtually to a halt late last year,  the government reported Friday, but analysts said a recession still seems  unlikely and the economic expansion should pick up again soon, albeit at a  sluggish pace.  </P> <P> Commerce Department figures showed the economy's output grew at an annual rate  of only 0.5% during the final three months of 1989 after adjusting for  inflation -- down from a 3% rate during the previous quarter and the lowest  recorded since the spring of 1986.  </P> <P> For all of 1989, the nation's gross national product rose a moderate 2.9%.  </P> <P> The slowdown partly reflected temporary factors, such as the impact of the San  Francisco earthquake last October, the Boeing strike in mid-winter and the  unusually cold weather, which kept consumers indoors and interrupted barge  traffic and construction projects.  </P> <P> Michael Darby, the department's chief economist, estimated that without those  setbacks, the economy would have grown at a 1% rate during the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> And companion figures published by the Commerce Department showed that new  orders for durable goods rose 2.5% in December, another sign that some momentum  remains in the economy.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Friday's report seemed certain to fuel debate over whether the  nation is heading into a full-fledged recession, intensifying pressure on the  Federal Reserve Board to ease the tight anti-inflation stance that it has  maintained since last fall.  </P> <P> Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers,  sidestepped a potential opportunity to criticize the Fed during a briefing for  reporters Friday, but White House officials hinted as recently as last week  that they hoped the Fed would ease its credit policies.  </P> <P> Boskin said that he still believes a recession is "unlikely" and that the  economy "should be growing more rapidly than it is now" by midyear. Even so,  Boskin and Budget Director Richard G. Darman both have been pressing the Fed to  push interest rates down further.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle called the fourth-quarter figures disappointing.  "These numbers this morning were not what we had hoped for," he said.  </P> <P> Except for the strike impact, the fourth-quarter figures were in line with  expectations. Economists have been predicting for months that the economy would  slow markedly during late 1989 and early 1990 and then speed up moderately by  late spring or early summer.  </P> <P> Robert Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago,  proffered a view expressed by many private economists. "The basic message is  that the aggregate economy is sluggish, and it isn't going to stop being  sluggish in the current quarter," he said.  </P> <P> By far the most sweeping change in the economy in the last quarter came from a  slowing in consumer spending, which edged down by $800 million, or 0.1%, after  a rise of $36.4 billion, or 5.6%, between July and September.  </P> <P> The bulk of the decline reflected a falloff in auto sales. Spending on durable  goods plunged 12.9% during the period, after an 11.3% rise in the previous  quarter. Outlays for non-durables dipped only 1.4%, after a 5% rise during the  summer.  </P> <P> But the slowing was evident virtually throughout the economy. Outlays for  business fixed investment fell 3% during the quarter, after a 5.2% rise in the  previous period. And net exports, whose gains buoyed the economy during earlier  periods, slumped by $4.7 billion.  </P> <P> Even the gains seemed to mask signs of potential weakness. For example, the  figures showed a major source of strength in the economy was the buildup of  business inventories, particularly in apparel and other non-durables.  </P> <P> But Lynn Reaser, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles,  cautioned that the increase, which reflected sluggish sales, was actually "a  red flag" because it most likely would reduce orders in coming months,  exacerbating the weakness in the manufacturing sector.  </P> <P> At the same time, the figures showed that inflation continued its slow, but  steady rise. The index used in the report -- considered the broadest measure of  inflation -- showed prices rising at an annual rate of 3.8% during the period,  up from a 2.9% pace in the previous quarter.  </P> <P> The inflation rate for all of 1989 totaled 4.5%, up from 4.2% in 1988.  </P> <P> The December increase in new orders for durable goods was stronger than some  analysts had expected. The 2.5% rise, which followed a 4.9% increase the  previous month, brought the volume of new orders to $133.5 billion, up $3.2  billion from the November level.  </P> <P> But the bulk of the new orders was concentrated in aircraft, shipbuilding  equipment and electrical machinery. Orders of motor vehicles, non-electrical  machinery and primary metals all posted declines.  </P> <P> And orders for defense-related goods plunged $3.3 billion, or 29.2%, after an  18.9% gain in November.  </P> <P> The December rise brought the gain for all of 1989 to 5.9%, or $1.52 trillion,  the lowest increase since 1986. By contrast, orders soared by 10.9% in 1988.  </P> <P> The fourth-quarter figures on output brought the GNP, or total value of goods  and services that the nation produces, to $4.168 trillion, up from $4.069  trillion a year before. Friday's figures were preliminary and are subject to  major revision.  </P></p>

The resolution on the issue says that  the Cabinet is to be formed proceeding from provisions of  Yeltsin's decrees of October 22 and December 22, 1993 on  measures to improve the activities of local executive bodies of  power.    The staff of the administration head, which will exist in  parallel with the local government, is to be cut by 20 percent.    The similar two-level executive structure was first created  in 1992 by the former governor of the Sverdlovsk Region Eduard  Rossel, who was dismissed by Yeltsin's decree. Now Rossel is  the president of the Association of Economic Interaction of the  Ural Region. He is also elected deputy to the new Russian  Parliament.</p>

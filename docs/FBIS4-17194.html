			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The possibility of a  political solution in Bosnia does exist, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared today. Speaking to journalists  after the talks in Moscow with his Danish counterpart, Niels  Helveg Petersen, he called for support for the "Party of Reason"  in Serbia and for Russia, the United States, the United Nations,  and the EC to draw up a peace plan.    "We cannot condone the actions of those Bosnian Serbs who  carry out artillery bombardments of civilian installations,"  said the head of Russian diplomacy. "It is perfectly clear that  these people have embarked on a road that runs counter to  Serbian interests -- those of Serbia as a whole and of the  Bosnian Serbs -- in the most blatant manner. Russia cannot see  that road as being anything other than barbarism and a crime.  So what trust can there be with these people?"    "At the same time," the minister continued, "we think that  there is the possibility of a political settlement. There are  other Serbs, in Bosnia too, those whom I call `the Party of  Reason'. There is President Milosevic in Belgrade, with whom I  spoke for several hours on the night of 16-17 April. He has a  very rational approach, about which he and I talked when meeting  journalists after the conversation.    "The international community must now help those Serbs who  are really concerned for the interests of Serbia and for the  interests of the Bosnian Serbs, and put forward a peace plan.  That, unfortunately, has not yet been done," Kozyrev emphasized.    He spoke in favor of a joint plan drawn up by Russia, the  United States, the EC, and the United Nations aimed at resolving  the Bosnian problem. That is precisely what we are seeking from  our partners, the Russian foreign minister indicated. "While  they are working on a war plan in NATO, we want to work on a  peace plan with them," A.Kozyrev said. "Otherwise it may happen  that, in a day or two's time, there will be a war plan, worked  out in detail inside NATO, but there won't be a detailed joint  peace plan. It seems to me that that would be a defeat for the  international community."</p>

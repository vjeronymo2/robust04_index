			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang said on Tuesday [26 April] that cross-strait  economic and trade ties put on hold in the wake of the Qiandao  Lake disaster are anticipated to resume as before.    Chiang called the incident an isolated happenstance, and  said  that now that Beijing has concluded its inquiry into the case,  the barrier that has blocked cross-strait ties for more than  three weeks should be partly removed.    Beijing announced last week that three suspects had been  seized for robbing and killing 24 Taiwan tourists, two mainland  guides and six crewmen aboard a cruise boat touring the lake,  which is in the eastern province of Zhejiang.    Beijing's handling of the incident included a cover-up  attempt and the restriction of the victims' relatives' movement,  and prompted the government to put a brake on bilateral ties.    The Ministry of Economic Affairs earlier in the month  suspended screening applications for mainland-bound investments  and said it would not continue to raise the quotas for mainland  raw materials and semi-finished products allowed into Taiwan.    Chiang said the purpose behind the ministry's decision was  to  call attention to the high risks Taiwan investors face on the  mainland. Now that this has been accomplished, he said,  mainland investment and expanded import of mainland materials  can continue, as long as the Mainland Affairs Council approves.    Chiang's remarks are seen by many here as a gesture of eased  tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Just after the disaster,  President Li Teng-hui was indignant, saying the mainland was  ruled by a group of "bandits" who should be overthrown by the  people.</p>

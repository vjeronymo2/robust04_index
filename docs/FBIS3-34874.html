When asked about the Indian threat of a  limited war on the Line of Control, the defense minister  observed that wars are never limited, but I am confident that  there is no real danger of an India-Pakistan war at this time.    The defense minister also expressed his view on  Pakistan-U.S.  relations and expressed the hope that some ways and means will  be found to repeal the Pressler Amendment. We have paid $658  million for F-16 aircraft and $1 billion in total and we are  still hopeful that a way will be found to supply these aircraft.  We are, however, also considering acquiring aircraft from other  sources to strengthen our Air Force, the defense minister added.    The defense minister's view that there is no danger of an  India-Pakistan war at the moment is encouraging. Pakistan,  nonetheless, needs to be more vigilant in view of Indian  designs. Just the other day, Indian Home Minister S.B. Chavan  told a news conference in New Delhi that if the law and order  situation in Kashmir does not improve, it will lead to serious  consequences. He ruled out any negotiations with the Kashmiris  to resolve the struggle. The fact is that the Indian attitude  is becoming more and more aggressive, with an increase in  tension in Kashmir. Recently, Indian President Shankar Dayal  Sharma made a personal attack on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,  ignoring all diplomatic protocol. Two members of the Indian  Cabinet have also attacked Bhutto personally. These incidents  can help one easily assess India's thinking and attitude. Under  these circumstances, Pakistan cannot overlook its defense even  for a moment.    Pakistan has been continuously striving to resolve its core  dispute with India peacefully. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif  Ahmad Ali also said today that he wants to resolve the Kashmir  dispute with India through peaceful means. He disclosed that  during the recent meeting of the Nonaligned Movement, he met  Indonesian President Suharto and proposed that the Nonaligned  Movement play the role of mediator to resolve the Kashmir  dispute. He also told Suharto that if India were to nominate  him as mediator or agreed to set up a committee, either of the  above would be acceptable to Pakistan. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali  said that even though bilateral disputes cannot be discussed at  the platform of the Nonaligned Movement, he has suggested that  the organization find a way to help resolve the basic dispute  between the two member-states -- India and Pakistan. The  Pakistan foreign minister's observations make it amply clear  that we are ready to go to any possible extent to resolve all  our differences with India peacefully.    In her recent interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto revealed that she helped Rajiv Gandhi contain the  insurgency in Punjab and she did this because she did not  consider interference in internal affairs of any other country  appropriate. At that time, the movement of the Sikhs was  continuing with all its intensity and it could have resulted in  anything. An independent Khalistan state could have also come  into being in east Punjab. It is possible that certain circles  inside Pakistan may make Benazir Bhutto a target of their  criticism in the wake of her aforementioned revelation, but it  reflects that Pakistan is always willing to go to every possible  extent to normalize relations with India and to eliminate the  causes of tension. Unfortunately, the Indian Government has  never responded to Pakistan's gesture of goodwill with goodwill  and has rejected all Pakistani proposals to resolve the Kashmir  dispute through peaceful means.    Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has done well to declare that Pakistan  will not withdraw its resolution on Kashmir from the UN Human  Rights Commission; and if the resolution is not approved there,  Islamabad will not desist from taking it to UN General Assembly.  The foreign minister's declaration makes it clear that while  Pakistan will continue to do everything possible to achieve a  peaceful settlement, it will also remain firm on its principled  stand and will not show any slackness in raising the Kashmir  issue in international forums. Pakistan is not indulging in a  confrontation with India, but in view of our bitter experiences  of the past, we should remain vigilant and cautious against  Indian designs and run our foreign policy in a manner in which  the veracity of our stand is revealed to more and more nations  and international public opinion continues to support our  legitimate stand.</p>

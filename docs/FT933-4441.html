			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Brussels tightens Italian aid curbs THE European Commission yesterday reinforced its increasingly tough line on state aid in Italy when it attached strict conditions, applicable to all Italian state holdings, to its authorisation of payments to creditors of Efim, the liquidated state industrial holding. Yesterday's decision follows a preliminary deal reached in July between Mr Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition, and Mr Beniamino Andreatta, Italian foreign minister, which allowed for repayment of half the bank loans. Efim was put into liquidation in July 1992 with total debts of nearly L18,000bn (Pounds 7.49bn). Financial institutions were owed L9.3bn of this, including more than L3,500bn to foreign banks. The loans were guaranteed by the state under Italian law, and Rome argued it was obliged to honour what amounted to sovereign debt. The Commission accepted this argument, but in effect held up the deal as part of a wider effort to bring Italian state aid under control. At the time of the July understanding between Brussels and Rome, the Italian government withdrew its plan to write off debts worth Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.08bn) run up by Ilva, the steel group. The two sides are still negotiating the size of the write-off against Commission demands for a sharp reduction in steel capacity, due to be discussed at a special Council of Ministers meeting in two weeks' time. Now, as part of the definitive agreement on Efim, the Italian government will have to: Impose a freeze on debt at state-owned companies by the end of 1993; Reduce this debt to levels in equivalent companies in the private sector by the end of 1996; Revoke the government's loan guarantee arrangements to state-owned companies immediately afterwards; Agree to the Commission's joint monitoring of the whole process. 'We have to ensure that in a few years' time the (Italian) state won't come back to us with the same arguments,' a spokesman for Mr Van Miert said. The remainder of Efim's debts, largely to suppliers, will be dealt with under normal state aids procedures, the Commission stated. The European Commission agreed a loan scheme yesterday to help steelmakers set up a Dollars 1bn restructuring fund, Reuter reports from Brussels. The plan is a key element in EC efforts to entice the ailing industry to shed 30m tonnes in excess crude steel capacity. The EC executive said it would provide loans to companies, grouped along three product lines, which agreed to pool funds to finance capacity cuts made by December 31, 1994. The loans would be paid back by the companies which did not cut capacity. Officials said the fund would earmark about Ecu 1bn (Dollars 1.17bn) to cover capacity cuts of 6m tonnes of hot-rolled coil and strip, 2m tonnes of plates and 2.5m tonnes of heavy section. The EC originally gave steelmakers until September 30 to present closure programmes to qualify for its rescue plan, which also includes money to cover layoffs and other social costs. However, that deadline is in doubt because the Commission has still not resolved steel subsidy cases critical to the restructuring effort. Steel subsidies will be discussed by EC industry ministers on September 21.</p>

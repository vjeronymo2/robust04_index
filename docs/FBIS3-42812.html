The government's unexpected reorganization opens up  definite opportunities for restoring civil peace and achieving  social harmony on the main social and economic policy avenues  for the sake of the population and the state.    It cannot be ruled out that this is the last chance which,  if  not used, will put us into the irreversible process of  unleashing an avalanche of social conflicts and the  disintegration of society.    The executive branch, which has put itself above society and  the law since September of last year, should take the first  step. Only one true avenue exists for this step and creates the  preconditions for achieving success. It is made up of the  following components.    First. The government should propose a program to  get the country out of its crisis -- a program that could become  the basis for achieving social harmony and consolidating the  efforts of a majority of the population's active layers. Such a  program should provide for concrete measures understood by  everyone and aimed at reviving economic activity and increasing  responsibility for effective management.    First of all, order should be introduced in the state  administration itself. It is necessary to establish control over  the management of state property, the use of natural resources  and state finances, the observance of foreign trade laws, and  the functioning of the infrastructure. Establishing control  assumes not only overcoming mismanagement and corruption but  also introducing clear-cut and rather strict responsibility for  the efficient use of state property and the proper performance  of state control functions.    Introducing order in the management of state property and  finances and establishing control over the use of natural  resources and the observance of foreign trade laws will permit  the state's income to be increased considerably and the  discipline of state expenditures to be raised. It will provide  an opportunity to understand once and for all the real  redistribution flows of resources and national wealth. This will  permit opportunities to be found for conducting an effective  policy in the area of stimulating the development of scientific  and industrial potentials and a social and structural policy.  Such a policy could include: determining the priorities in  structurally reorganizing the economy, adopting state programs  for their realization, establishing special financial  development institutions to stimulate investment activity, and  rationalizing the tax system and the existing social insurance  system.    This set of measures should replace the cellular  distribution  policy for preferential credits and budget appropriations, which  is extremely convenient for those who love to fish in troubled  waters and which is inaccessible to any honest examination.  Credit emission should be put in order and formalized so that  credits to finance the national economy will reach production  facilities and contribute to realizing the priorities of the  economy's structural reorganization and not whirl around in  commercial bank accounts, incredibly enriching the people  participating in their distribution.    A clear and sound structural policy should replace the  present vague practice of granting benefits and privileges to  court firms and branches and the administration of state  expenditures according to the principle: "We will give to this  but we will not give to that." State purchases and the granting  of benefits should be done clearly in accordance with structural  reorganization programs and in accordance with a clearly tested  and dependable procedure that excludes the arbitrariness of  bureaucrats.    Conducting an effective policy to revive the economy assumes  not only introducing order into the executive branch system but  also establishing the appropriate preconditions in industrial  production organizations.    The extraordinarily rapid and massive privatization of a  large part of the state enterprises has brought about the  destruction of the large production associations, which produced  complicated types of products, and the formation of an eroded  and extremely ineffective structure of property relationships.  Today, the country's economy consists of barely viable  production and economic units, which are poorly linked with each  other and which are being formed in place of large production  associations. They do not possess the production flexibility  required to survive on their own and belong to a nebulous group  of stockholders consisting of labor collective members, the  enterprise board of directors and the retainers of the local  bodies of authority.    If one considers that the overwhelming majority of banks  belong to state and privatized enterprises, it is not difficult  to diagnose -- as a result of the massive privatization, we have  received a property relationship structure that is closer to the  Yugoslav model of the 1970s than to that of a developed country  with a market economy. This model is characterized by economic  inefficiency (the eating away of profits, low investment and  innovation activity, strong pressure for an increase in credit  emissions, and high inflation) and political danger (the  economic foundation for separatist movements and the  disintegration of the country's economic space).    The set of measures required to rationalize the industrial  production structure and correct the violations in production  cooperation and the gaps in the technological chains for  manufacturing complicated products, which have occurred as a  result of the adopted privatization model, includes: eliminating  limitations on vertical integration and the reintegration of  related enterprises (including amalgamations, cross-ownership of  stock shares, liquidations, the organization of holding  companies, etc.), removing the ban on participating in the  privatization of enterprises with more than a 25-percent share  of state ownership, and stimulating the establishment of  financial industrial groups.    The same thing pertains to the state's import and export  operations. Strict implementation of already adopted decisions  concerning the competitive distribution of export orders for  state needs and the competitive determination of firms to  deliver centralized imports and strict observance of currency  laws and export control norms must be achieved. A situation  where government departments, which are responsible for  purchasing and distributing centrally imported goods, delay  transferring the earnings from their sale to the budget for  months, essentially concealing an embezzlement of state property  in enormous amounts, is intolerable at a time when the payment  of wages to doctors, scientists and teachers is not being done  and defense orders are not being paid for under the pretext that  there are not enough budget revenues.    There is no possibility here to expound in detail on  recommendations for forming a wise economic policy responsive to  the interests of the population and the state. Its elaboration  will take quite a bit of time; however, it is already important  to take decisive steps now that will demonstrate the executive  branch's firm intention to introduce order -- if only in its own  departments -- and to stop the embezzlement of state property  and violations of the law, which are prevalent both in the  machinery of the federal bodies of power and in the local areas.    Second. Along with the adoption of anti-crisis  measures and the introduction of order into the management of  state property and finances, the government should demonstrate  the ability and will to solve the more acute social problems.  This, first of all, concerns protecting the vulnerable layers of  the population against hunger and illness (especially children,  half of whom live in conditions below the subsistence minimum  and are malnourished), supplying the population with housing and  reconstructing available housing, preventing the destruction of  the secondary and preschool educational system, maintaining  large-scale medical support at an acceptable level, and  preparing for refugees from the former union republics. It is  also important to begin reforming the social insurance system  immediately.    Third. The state's leaders should formulate an  understandable idea of national rebirth, which is close to  everyone. The population cannot be satisfied with abstract ideas  of freedom and democracy and suffer appreciable losses for the  sake of implementing poorly understood reforms. In order to  achieve broad public consent and the consolidation of efforts to  overcome the crisis, a popular ideology is needed -- one which  would reveal the nation-wide goals of the social and economic  development which the state is following in its domestic and  foreign policy.    Along with the ideas of freedom and the welfare of the  individual, the following should be included in these goals:    -- the building of a powerful Russian state capable of  defending its citizens against internal and foreign threats and  pursuing in the world an independent policy to protect its  national interest;    -- the maintaining of Russia's leading position in the area  of scientific and technological development, industry, energy,  and agriculture;    -- the development of a national self-consciousness and the  rebirth of national culture; the acquiring of a sense of  national pride and historic continuity in the mass consciousness.    The state's leaders should demonstrate their devotion to  these goals and the ability to achieve them.    The Federal Assembly, in which all major political movements  and almost all subjects of the federation are represented today,  should take on the main work to achieve broad social harmony  regarding the prospective avenues for the country's social and  economic development and the extension of the reforms.    The main obstacle on this path is the ruling political  grouping's line for radicalizing public opinion and splitting  society, which has been in effect until recently. Right up to  the 12 December elections, this line helped the radicals in  government to maintain their power despite the evident failures  in the social and economic policy and the pauperization of a  large part of the population. The spreading of the myth of a  communist threat and the lack of an alternative to the policy  being conducted permitted the radicals to maintain power in  1993, successfully slip the referendum in and fire on a  parliament, which the people had elected, with impunity. The  elections, however, clearly demonstrated the development of a  social consciousness which gradually acquired an immunity  against the actions of political propaganda that would make a  fool of one. The next attempt to introduce a split in society by  intimidating politicians with a fascist threat also fell through.    The main threat to the country and its population comes from  continuing the adventurist and insufficiently considered policy,  which has given birth to chaos and discord and which has led to  an unprecedented drop in production and the lowering of the  standard of living in peacetime. It is clear to everyone, who  has not lost the ability to think soberly, that it is not the  resistance by some conservative political forces to the  progressive reforms but the inability to make these reforms  correctly and the errors in the economic, social, regional and  cultural policy that were the main reason for the swiftly  deepening crisis. In order to rein in this crisis and begin to  gradually extricate ourselves from the abyss, it is necessary to  stop looking for enemies, admit errors, eliminate animosity, and  unite the forces of all political and public organizations for  the sake of preserving the main thing -- a sovereign Russian  state and people. Today, the irreversible destruction of the  state and the degradation of the population really threaten  Russia. This process has already embraced a significant portion  of the country's scientific, industrial and cultural potential.  The sharpness of this threat is not a bit less than that of the  threat in the time of the Great Troubles during the 16th century  or, if one looks for analogies in modern history, during the  time of the civil war from 1918-1919 or the winter of 1941-1942.    Opposing this threat should be the main subject of concern  for all authority structures and political and public movements  today. The risk is too great to continue rocking the boat any  more and arousing social conflicts in order to maintain power.  It is necessary to extinguish political and economic radicalism  of any stripe and suspend heartless radicals, adventurists and  embezzlers of state property from making decisions in the  executive power structures. Then, the road will be open to  achieving national harmony on the general approach to carrying  out social and economic transformations in the interests of the  population.</p>

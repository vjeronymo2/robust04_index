			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A top Chinese securities  official said here today that China will expand issues of  B-shares in a bid to reactivate the sluggish market, and  strategically the markets of A-shares and B-shares will merge in  the future.    "We are adopting policies to allow companies to expand the  issue of B-shares, because the present B-share market is too  small to meet the enterprise demand for foreign fund supply,"  said Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC), speaking at the '94 China summit meeting that  opened here yesterday.    B-shares were devised in 1991 for overseas investors.  Denominated in Chinese yuan, the shares are traded in U.S. or  Hong Kong dollars only.    By the end of 1993 there were 42 companies issuing B-shares,  with a total capital stock of 3.01 billion yuan and raising 1.2  billion in U.S. dollars.    Liu did not disclose the projected issue volume of B-shares  in 1994, but sources close to the CSRC said that at least 50 new  B-shares will be listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year,  doubling last year's figure.    The securities authorities are also considering expanding  the  investor base by allowing enterprises with B-shares to issue ADR  (American depositary receipts), convertible bonds and other  stock-related paper to invigorate transactions and raise more  capital.    Liu acknowledged that the long-term division into A-shares  and B-shares of the country's securities could trigger many  problems.    "From the view of progress, the two markets should be  merged," said Liu. "However, the free convertibility of the  renminbi is the most essential prerequisite for the merger."    Liu noted that some foreign companies have expressed the  wish  to issue stocks on the Chinese securities market with some  planning to issue shares similar to B-shares and some preferring  A-shares.    "Right now our market is not open to foreign companies,  though in the long run it will be," said Liu. "But we are  studying schemes put forward by foreign firms."    According to the CSRC chairman, opening the Chinese market  to  foreign firms requires mapping out specific laws and regulations  to standardize the issuing and listing of foreign companies and  determining which accounting code foreign companies should adopt.    "We must specify what kinds of foreign companies are  eligible  to be listed in China and how to supervise them," he said.    He added, "the impending task is to study how to deal with  the problem of free flow of capital while the renminbi is still  not freely convertible and foreign exchange is still controlled."</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Robinson seeks 20% cuts at Granada MR Gerry Robinson, the new chief executive of the Granada group, has called for a 20 per cent cut in costs at Granada Television after inflation, in spite of being warned this could not be squared with the company's broadcasting licence obligations. In a strategy paper to the Granada board at the end of November, Mr Robinson said a 20 per cent cut in the nine months to September 1992 would increase Granada Television's profits from Pounds 22m to Pounds 54m. 'We believe that the cost base is high and something in the order of 20 per cent real reduction is achievable given the will to do so,' Mr Robinson argued. It was the call for such deep cuts, combined with a demand for 300 further redundancies in the 1992-93 financial year, that led to the resignation of Mr David Plowright, the distinguished chairman of Granada Television. He left the company on Friday after 31 years with no financial settlement yet agreed. The Robinson paper was written after Mr Plowright warned that a doubling of Granada Television's profits was unrealistic if the company was to meet the terms of its new broadcasting licence. In January Mr Plowright and Mr Andrew Quinn, the new chief executive of Granada Television, agreed to 100 job losses to save Pounds 6m a year. In the strategy paper Mr Robinson said that agreements with the Independent Television Commission should be honoured. He said that not only should Granada Television tackle its cost base, but everything possible should be done to reduce the cost of the national ITV network schedule. He has since been told that more than half the costs of ITV are fixed, including payments for the network, transmission and Independent Television News. Mr Robinson was seeking 20 per cent cuts overall, which would have had to come out of 40 per cent of Granada Television's spending. Mr Robinson's other targets for cost cutting include Granada Television's central Manchester studios and the group's trunk-road service stations and hotels. 'We have a huge site in Manchester that is on balance something of a liability because it is far in excess of our needs and is expensive to operate,' Mr Robinson said in the November paper. A move to smaller premises was advocated, although this could jeopardise Granada's theme park and studio tour. Mr Robinson believed Granada's motorway services will remain profitable. But on the more recent move into trunk-road services he said: 'The future of trunk roads and associated hotels is doubtful.' The chief executive praised recent improvements in Granada's computer services, argued that opportunities in ten-pin bowling were not being fully exploited and called for better margins and vigorous cost cuts in the television rental business. Mr Robinson and Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada chairman, come up for election at Granada's annual meeting tomorrow.</p>

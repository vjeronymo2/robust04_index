			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEN IS BACK IN AIRBORNE FORM;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OCT. 19, HE KEEPS TEAM IN PLAYOFF  CONTENTION IN 16-14 VICTORY.  </P> <P>  That old Southern California favorite, the long-grounded Air Marcus, lifted  off its Coliseum runway once more to keep an appointment with victory Sunday.  </P> <P> Will we ever see Marcus Allen in a Raider uniform here again?  </P> <P> Will we ever see anyone in a Raider uniform here again?  </P> <P> Only Al Davis knows for sure.  </P> <P> Allen, his teammates' selection as most valuable player in four of the past  five seasons, returned after a nine-week absence to score the Raiders' only  touchdown. He dived one yard in the 60th minute to beat the Phoenix Cardinals,  16-14, saving the Raiders' dreams of the playoffs.  </P> <P> Despite appearances, the Raiders still own the first of the two AFC wild-card  berths. They've scored two touchdowns in two weeks. They gave up a 90-yard  touchdown drive in the clutch Sunday to a couple of guys named Hogeboom and  Sikahema. They were grateful for any help on their last drive -- such as the  pass interference call against the Cardinals and the offsides by the Cardinals  blitzers on a key fourth-and-6.  </P> <P> "We'll take anything," said quarterback Steve Beuerlein after a 13-for-30 day.  "We're just happy to sneak out of there with a win.  </P> <P> "We've got a big game in Seattle next week. We've got to get a heck of a lot  better if we want to have a chance."  </P> <P> Early in the fourth period, the Raiders held a 9-7 lead when the Cardinals  drove 90 yards. There was a 35-yard pass from Gary Hogeboom to Ernie Jones, who  caught four for 97 yards. Jones was a reserve until J.T. Smith got hurt.  </P> <P> There were eight running plays -- seven up the middle -- for 32 yards. Finally,  on third-and-goal at the two-yard line, there was a clutch pass from Hogeboom  to tight end Jay Novacek, a fade pattern on which Novacek outjumped linebacker  Thomas Benson.  </P> <P> There was 5:10 left. The Raiders hadn't scored a touchdown all day and only a  touchdown would do now.  </P> <P> Vance Mueller returned the kickoff 49 yards down the left sideline to the  Cardinals' 46.  </P> <P> The Raiders' return game had suffered since Tim Brown was injured in the season  opener. Mueller was put back there after a recent injury to Timmy Ware.  </P> <P> "I knew we were going to kick their guys out on the left side," Mueller said.  </P> <P> "It was just perfect timing. They kicked them out just as I was hitting the  thing at a full run. It just opened up. I just tried to get through there as  fast as I could. The thing just opened up like the sea. It was great."  </P> <P> Beuerlein, however, was still struggling.  </P> <P> The first play of the drive was a routine hitch pass to Willie Gault, to take  advantage of the Cardinals playing off him, but Beuerlein threw the ball in on  a bounce. The Coliseum crowd that loved him so recently booed as if he were Jay  Schroeder.  </P> <P> The Raiders managed a first down at the 36. Moments later on third-and-six,  Beuerlein threw an out pattern behind Mervyn Fernandez. But the officials  called pass interference against cornerback Carl Carter.  </P> <P> The replay suggested minimal contact and a minimally catchable pass.  </P> <P> Fernandez said it "wasn't like it was a blatant call. It was a close play."  </P> <P> Carter took his helmet off, jumped up and down and protested, to no avail.  </P> <P> "It was a bad call," Carter said. "Did you see the replay? By the time I got  there, the ball was through his hands. We had them and then the ref really did  it to us."  </P> <P> Beuerlein then whipped a nine-yard pass to Mike Dyal to the 13.  </P> <P> Bo Jackson went around right end for nine yards to the Phoenix four, vaulting  four Cardinals on his way.  </P> <P> Moments later, on third-and-one from the four, Raider right tackle Bruce  Wilkerson was called for being offside.  </P> <P> An incomplete pass later, it was fourth-and-six and the nine, with the Raider  season riding on the next play.  </P> <P> The Cardinals took time out. The teams lined up, and the Cardinals planned a  blitz up the middle by free safety Lonnie Young and middle linebacker Eric  Hill.  </P> <P> Hill and Young both jumped offsides, crashing into the Raider backfield well  before the ball was snapped. The half-the-distance penalty made it  fourth-and-one at the four.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, we had it called on 'two,' " Beuerlein said. "They had it timed  out to come on 'one.'  </P> <P> "Technically, there are supposed to be adjustments made when they blitz, but  I'll tell you what, in that situation, fourth-and-six, with the whole house  coming, you'd like to have a little bit more time to think about things and see  what's going on. It was a big play for us. It gave us an opportunity to go with  Marcus over the top, instead of having to throw the ball in an obvious passing  situation."  </P> <P> Allen, who had been sidelined for nine weeks because of a torn ligament in his  right knee suffered Oct. 19, had been in for only a handful of plays Sunday. On  his first play, he ran onto the field unannounced and received a warm ovation.  He then caught a nine-yard pass for a first down.  </P> <P> On fourth-and-one, Jackson came out and Allen got the call, as in the old days.  </P> <P> "There's nobody better in the game going over the top," said Art Shell. "He's  the best there is going over the top of the defense."  </P> <P> Allen took the ball, leaped and came down at the one for a first down -- and  got kicked in the groin. He left the game, went to the bench and stretched on  the ground.  </P> <P> He stayed there for one play, on which Steve Smith was hurled back at the  six-inch line.  </P> <P> Allen returned for a last leap that carried him two yards deep into the end  zone with 50 seconds left.  </P> <P> "I've been kicked there before," Allen said. "It only lasts for a short time. I  didn't think they were going to come back with the same play, but I'm glad they  did.  </P> <P> "I was elated when they called my number, but I just wanted to go out there and  do the job."  </P> <P> He did.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> The Raiders are 8-6, tied with Miami, a half-game ahead of 7-6-1 Kansas City  and 7-6-1 Cleveland in the wild-card hunt. The Raiders lead the Dolphins  because of their better AFC record (6-5 to 6-6). . . . For the first time in  the four seasons of instant replay, the Raiders lost a touchdown on a review.  Replay official Bill Swanson ruled that Cardinal running back Vai Sikahema  failed to control a lateral making his second quarter fumble a muff, and Mike  Wise's 64-yard touchdown run null and void. Wise had to settle for a mere  fumble recovery. . . . Art Shell, on his offense: "We've gotten a little rusty.  We made some throws, we made some reads, we had a little trouble with pass  protection. It was just one of those days when the quarterback just wasn't in  sync."  </P></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Avant-garde ball for Cinderella - Vienna Festival The great, the good and the frankly pretentious from the theatrical avant-garde have descended on Vienna in equal measure this year. As Europe's showcase for radical drama, the Festwochen lays down no rigid themes, but over the days connections emerge: this time an emphasis on classic archetypes, from fairy tale to Shakespeare, controversially updated. The hot news from week one is that the new English production Cinderella, adapted by Tony Britten and Nick Broadhurst from Rossini's La Cenerentola, is star of the show and one of the most dazzling examples of contemporary revision which, through images drawn from our own social reality - the Ferrari, Essex Man - revitalises the essential myths love and forgiveness, power and control, survival - of the original. Britten and Broadhurst are founders of Music Theatre London, the opera ensemble which casts actors and singers, rather than opera singers, in witty new translations of opera-drama. Their Cinderella opening out-shocks Opera Factory's 1980s bikini Cos fan tutte: The ugly sisters, played i travesti by Simon Butteriss in a butch pink swimsuit and by William Renton in a froth of petticoats, lounge on the diving board of a pool and swap transvestite fantasies about Prince Ramiro's ball. Cinders flames the plastic red barbecue and fixes the sunshades on the Costa-del-Basildon villa guarded by a life-size ceramic Rottweiler. Dad, Don Magnifico, is Essex Man, floral braces, gold pyjamas, east London accent intact ('who was that bimbo who turned up?' he asks at the ball), boastful/deferential in his philistine sneering. In Tim Hardy's parody, comic yet menacing, the violence to Cinderella clearly stems from his own repression. His opposite is philosopher Alidoro, Oxbridge charmer (Kevin Colson), who offers himself as alternative father. Freudian implications, the girl's longing for her unattainable father, are thus embodied: Alidoro the ideal, Don Magnifico the monster. Interwoven is class warfare. Social disguise is the key in both Perrault and Rossini, where Ramiro swaps roles with his valet. Here Dandini (Harry Burton) is the chauffeur rigged up as HRH in a kilt, attended by tartanned royals. Ramiro (soprano Gaynor Miles), the 'choufleur d'amour' pondering his/her sexuality completes a kinky pantomime trio: the i travesti roles bring out sexual as well as social undercurrents. It is romance within a post-Thatcherite parable of the rise and fall of the self-made man. Flimsy as his Cindy-doll-by-the-pool home, Don Magnifico has no chance once pitted against the royals (his 'get yer arses down ere' evokes another classic English social satire, Eliza at the races in My Fair Lady). Revealed as a bankrupt, he is saved from repossession by Old Money when Cinderella, in a stream of quicksilver lyricism from Jan Hartley Morris, marries her prince. With an onstage orchestra of eight jazzing up Rossini, this is a vintage 1990s show, set in a broken golden arch it blazes with deconstructionist wit; Alidoro, a Prospero-Zarusthro figure, fashions paper hearts during the love duets and remote controls a toy Ferrari, driven by models of Ramiro and Dandini, across the stage to precipitate the denouement. The libretto/dialogue, sarcastic and slangy ('you watch your lips now/just get a grip now'; 'Am I dreaming? am I hell?/It's a setback, not an ending') is matched by yuppie slapstick - poolside dunkings, petticoats singed on the barbecue - and high camp hi jinks, and acted to the hilt by this talented young company. If Cinderella has 'British class obsession' stamped all over it, Katharina Thalbach's Macbeth is a quintessential Berlin export: a Brechtian interpretation which turns Shakespearean tragedy on its head and makes of the bloody male world of Macbeth a feminist triumph. Malcolm Rutherford saluted this production when it briefly visited London this winter, and I add my voice to his. With its grim illustration that power corrupts, Macbeth has of course the perfect Brechtian plot. Thalbach despatches the soldier-monarch in just over two shrill and breathless hours during which Marcus Vollenklee triples in size from hen-pecked weakling to a bloated, parody of kinghood. Gone are the long speeches, the philosophising: this is a Macbeth action-packed as a cartoon strip, bright with caricature and expressionist display. Thus when Guntbert Warns plays Duncan as a pastiche of Bernard Minetti, the 86-year-old Berlin actor who had his debut with Max Reinhardt in the 1920s, Thalbach is making a theatrical joke which later turns into a neat political point: the same actor, as Macduff, discovers Duncan's corpse - friend and foe, survivor or victim, are equally ridiculous in the game of war and heroics. 'Fair is foul and foul is fair', the witches scrawl on a wall. They are recast here as a cross between The Threepenny Opera's Tart-without-a-heart Jenny and Brecht's streetwise pacifist Mother Courage. They dance, hang above the stage on ropes like seductive spiders, then pamper Macbeth as in a brothel. Their dance of death is at once a showpiece and the last word: 'We don't need a new master, we don't need one at all', they chant in an almost exact quotation from Brecht's die Rundkopfe und die Spitzkopfe. Thalbach is an entertainer with the technical imagination to channel her subversive message into a coherent masterpiece of staging. At the other extreme of Shakespearean innovation, Vienna has Romeo Castellucci's Amleto, which with a cast of one plus a chorus of stuffed toys offers a futuristic Hamlet set in a man-size circuit board of tangled wires and flashing lights. I cannot report on the language of the production because, between electric shocks and toy pistol shots, Paolo Tonti stutters like an autistic Christopher Robin through a text where not one word is fully uttered. His father's ghost is a teddy bear, Gertrude is a kangaroo and Ophelia a wind-up doll. This is not a Spitting Image joke but a two-hour performance deadly serious, mightily pleased with its own metaphors of non-communication, and achingly dull. Heiner Muller's Hamlet Machine did this sort of thing properly at last year's Berlin festival; can the Festwochen organisers really not distinguish between copycat gibberish and original vital reworkings? Two further redrawn classics are to come to Vienna in June: Bruno Moderna's composition Hyperion, after Holderlin, and Needcompany's Antony and Cleopatra. On this showing, they will be either brilliant or beastly. 'Cinderella' is sponsored by Mobil; the Festival continues until June 4</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Kingfisher disappoints with 7.4% interim rise Kingfisher, the UK retailing group which includes B&amp;Q, Comet, Superdrug, Woolworths, and France's Darty, yesterday disappointed the market in spite of announcing a 7.4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 82m to Pounds 88.1m. The increase - at the bottom end of forecasts - was more than accounted for by a rise from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 35.7m in profits contribution from Darty, acquired by Kingfisher only two months before the end of the first half last year. Excluding Darty from both years, retail operating profits fell from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 47.7m. Kingfisher held the interim dividend at 4.4p, and the share price fell 3p to 487p. 'These results are less than satisfactory for Kingfisher', admitted Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman. 'However, each company is making significant progress in establishing a platform of real value for its customers.' He remained 'cautious' about UK retail markets, and said there were signs of recovery in France. Mr Alan Smith, chief executive, said Kingfisher's priorities were to improve ranges, value for money, and customer service. Cost-cutting would continue, and some job losses would result. He added it would take time to implement 'everyday low pricing' (EDLP) - that is, permanently lower prices - throughout the group. It could be introduced by each chain only 'when the total cost base of the business allows'. He said Darty already operated EDLP, and Comet and B&amp;Q were making progress in that direction. Woolworths and Superdrug needed to improve their supply chains before moving fully to an EDLP strategy. Group turnover increased 18.4 per cent to Pounds 2.17bn, including Pounds 441.6m from Darty. UK retail turnover rose 2.6 per cent to Pounds 1.70bn. The underlying profits fall resulted partly from an unexpectedly large loss of Pounds 6.9m at Woolworths (Pounds 2.1m profit). Comet dropped from a Pounds 0.7m profit to a Pounds 1.7m loss because of increased expansion and rental costs. The group interest charge increased from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 11.1m, including a Pounds 4m loss on Kingfisher's bond portfolio. There were brighter spots elsewhere. B&amp;Q, Superdrug and the Chartwell Land property division all increased their contribution. Earnings per share fell from 10.2p to 10p. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 25</p>

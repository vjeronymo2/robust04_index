			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan's Sanfu plans to set up China plant TAIWAN'S Sanfu Motors Industrial Company plans to set up a Dollars 20m vehicle assembly plant in China with France's Renault, a senior Sanfu official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei. The project, which has yet to be finalised, would be the first known investment in China by a Taiwanese carmaker. It would also appear to challenge a Taiwan government ban on such investment. The official said Sanfu would avoid violating the ban by making its investment in the name of Canadian citizen Lee Yung-yao, the son of Sanfu chairman Lee Shui-tu. Economics Minister Vincent Siew said last month that Taiwan's car industry was among a number of strategic sectors not permitted to invest in China. The ban was imposed to stop Taiwan transferring important technologies to Chinese competitors and exposing itself to political pressure from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the island. The Sanfu official said the government could not block its investment if it was made by a foreign citizen. A senior official at the government's Investment Commission also conceded that it would be very difficult to stop Sanfu. Sanfu would have a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture while Renault, which has a technical co-operation pact with the Taiwanese firm, would invest 40 per cent, the official said. The plant in the central province of Hunan would have an annual production capacity of between 10,000 and 20,000 vans or pick-up trucks, which will be sold both in China and abroad.</p>

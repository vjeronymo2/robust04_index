			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FURS' SOUND RESTYLED IN BASIC BLEAKNESS;  </P> <P> ROCK: RICHARD BUTLER SAYS HIS POST-PUNK GROUP HAS ABANDONED COMMERCIAL  SLEEKNESS AND REVIVED ITS EARLY, PRIMITIVE APPROACH.  </P> <P> In the band's seminal days early this decade, the Psychedelic Furs seemed  strongly influenced by David Bowie's avant-garde side, in their own unique  post-punk way. With their last and most successful album, 1987's commercial  breakthrough "Midnight to Midnight," some early fans thought the band had  followed Bowie's lead once more -- by selling out.  </P> <P> The new album "Book of Days" should assuage those fears. In the intervening  time, bandleader Richard Butler let the Furs fly, returning with a dark sonic  morass more akin to the early approach than the stuff of hits.  </P> <P> And instead of a big Rock Show at the Forum a la two years ago, this tour  they're playing what Butler promises is a moodier, less floodlighted show at  smaller venues -- including dates tonight at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim,  Wednesday at the McCallum Theater in Palm Desert and Friday and Saturday at the  Pantages in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The band's hit LP a couple years back "didn't feel natural enough," says  Butler. "It was too produced, and the chemistry -- not of the basic members of  the band, but the other members that we had with us at that time -- wasn't  right. Lyrically as well it's not the most mysterious thing I've ever written.  It didn't sound like this band somehow.  </P> <P> "And I think this record does. We felt it was time to just go in and make a  record that we liked without worrying about whether it sounded commercial --  having as little production on it as possible and getting it to sound quite  raw."  </P> <P> That kind of sound is increasingly allowable, with the Cure having had massive  success with a rather uncompromising album and the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain also  doing surprisingly well. But Butler says his decision to return to that  approach wasn't influenced by anyone else.  </P> <P> "England is a very fashion-conscious country, so at any one point you're likely  to be displaced. If you're worried about being out of fashion, we would  probably have been out of fashion in 1982 when the big ska/two-tone thing  happened. I don't think fashion makes much difference. You either write good  songs or you don't."  </P> <P>  The Psychedelic Furs play tonight at 8 p.m. at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E.  Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.  </P> <P> </P></p>

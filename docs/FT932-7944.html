			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / New face at unsteady helm: Christina Lamb weighs up the latest Brazilian minister of finance THE frequent changes of faces at the helm of Brazil's economy continued yesterday when Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso was named finance minister in a cabinet reshuffle. He is the fourth person in eight months to try his hand at stabilising Latin America's largest economy and succeeds Mr Eliseu Resende, who lasted a mere 80 days. However, criticisms of President Itamar Franco's inability to retain ministers were drowned by the positive reaction to Mr Cardoso's appointment as the best choice in the circumstances. Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a former finance minister, said: 'Fernando Henrique has all the qualities needed to improve the situation - he has support in Congress, is very respected by businessmen, economists and intellectuals, and he has international prestige.' In his first interview after being nominated, Mr Cardoso, who is 63, a Social Democratic party senator and a leading sociologist, said the president had 'given me liberty to act as I choose, but obviously within the constraints of the government programme'. He ruled out the possibility of shock plans to combat inflation: 'We have had enough of shocks. What we need is confidence and serious and honest hard work'. He also said that he intended to reduce interest rates 'gradually and within market conditions'. He announced that Mr Pedro Malan will continue as chief debt negotiator and that foreign debt negotiations will not be altered. Mr Cardoso had been foreign minister since September and won much praise for his performance. A former professor at the universities of Paris, Geneva, Mexico and Cambridge, he is the only figure in the Brazilian cabinet who carries real weight abroad and, despite his left-leaning tendencies, is thought to be the only person able to secure for Brazil a new accord with the International Monetary Fund. The financial markets welcomed the news of Mr Cardoso's appointment, the main Sao Paulo index rising 4.7 per cent by the lunchtime close. His considerable influence in Congress will help to pass government legislation and he is seen as one of the few people who can handle Brazil's temperamental president. Three finance ministers, two planning ministers and two central bank governors have toppled during Mr Franco's eight months in office. Some foreign investors were dismayed at the idea of yet another change. 'I have nothing printable to say about Brazil,' said one. Others saw it as more proof of Mr Franco's mercurial character and are already counting down the 18 remaining months of the Franco administration. Mr Igor Cornelsen, director of Chartered West LB in Sao Paulo, said: 'The real problem is the president, not the ministers. I ask to what extent will Fernando Henrique be able to do anything, or even attract people to work with him.' Mr Cardoso's nomination ended the uncertainty of the last fortnight over allegations that Mr Resende was favouring his former employers, the Odebrecht construction group, with cheap government finance. He has denied the allegations and said yesterday the scandal had reduced his ability to implement the government's economic plan, announced last month. Mr Resende's departure was part of a wider reshuffle which included the sacking of the ministers of administration and of agriculture, as well as the dismissal of the head of Funai, the federal Indian protection agency. General Romildo Canhim is the new administration minister. The new appointments are not expected to alter the government's strategy of stimulating growth through spending and interest rate reduction. Mr Cardoso was one of the authors of the government's economic plan and is a frequent adviser to the president. Mr Cardoso now has to try to bring down inflation from 30 per cent a month and plug an estimated budget deficit equivalent to Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.4bn). Mr da Nobrega said: 'It's a very difficult situation. There is no sign that inflation will fall and the plan does not tackle the real issues. The most he can do in the short term is avoid a grave acceleration of inflation.' In an interview on Wednesday, though, Mr Cardoso was more confident: 'Brazil is a viable country, the problems are well known and the solutions within reach.'</p>

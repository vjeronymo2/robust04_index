			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Halo slips on the raspberry bubbles: The reputation of Body Shop has been tarnished by ethical questions Why am I always measured against the standard of Mother Teresa - a standard by which even saints will fail - and not against those chairmen of companies who create huge corporate crimes?' pleaded Anita Roddick, founder of Body Shop International, when her company came under attack in 1992 over its environmental standards. She must have asked herself the same question this week. For the past 10 days the natural cosmetics company she founded 18 years ago in Brighton has been the target of intense publicity, amid claims that the high ethical and environmental standards it claims to uphold might be less genuine than it would like the world to think. What prompted the controversy was the revelation that Franklin Research and Development Corporation, a US ethical investment adviser which has more than Dollars 350m in funds under management, had sold its 50,000 Body Shop shares in mid-July and recommended its clients to do likewise. The result has been several days of claim and counter-claim trickling into the press, while Body Shop, Franklin and other ethical research organisations have been bombarded with calls from journalists. Several US and UK ethical funds are reviewing their position. Since Thursday a week ago, the company's shares have dropped from 242p to a closing price of 218p in London yesterday. The criticisms appear to pose the biggest threat to the company's squeaky-clean image since a 1992 documentary on Channel 4. Body Shop restored its reputation after that attack by winning damages of Pounds 273,000 against the programme makers in a High Court libel action last year. This week's events raise specific questions about Body Shop practices over the years, but also much broader ones about how essential a faultlessly 'green' reputation is to the company's success, and how the ethical investment sector operates. Franklin's advice to sell Body Shop shares was triggered partly by commercial factors that would be a consideration for any stock market analyst. First, it took the view that the company's stock price was already high for the retail sector at a time of growing competition. Second, it had seen research which was highly critical of Body Shop, written by Jon Entine, a US journalist, some of which was scheduled to appear in Minneapolis-based Business Ethics magazine at the start of next month, with more details scheduled to appear in other publications over the next few weeks. Franklin believed that - whether or not the allegations were true - they would cause the company's share price to fall. Entine's research questions issues such as where the idea for the Body Shop originated, the composition of the ingredients in its products, its record on quality control, animal testing, relations with franchisees, trade with suppliers in the Third World, charitable donations, environmental policy and staff working conditions. Franklin is currently researching the claims and talking to Body Shop about a piece it is writing for its own Insight newsletter next month, which will provide an assessment of the ethical standards of the company. It has not yet determined what its conclusions will be. However, it has told the Financial Times that it would not have taken the decision to sell Body Shop shares unless it believed there was a case to answer. It also stresses that it is still advising clients to sell their shares. 'We do not sell stock based on every short-term rumour,' said Mr Patrick McVeigh, senior vice-president. Franklin's move has brought to an end a long period in which Body Shop successfully generated a positive image. The tide now appears to have turned, causing Gordon Roddick, Anita's husband and the chairman of the company, to dub critics this week 'the zealots of cynicism'. Body Shop is frustrated that it has not been able to respond in detail because it has not seen the allegations. 'It is not fair,' says Angela Bawtree, investor relations manager. 'All we have seen are rumours of allegations. We have responded as fully as possible.' It all seems a far cry from the Body Shop of the 1980s, one of the most successful retail flotations. Its Stock Exchange listing in 1984 and subsequent rapid expansion proved well-timed, as it capitalised on the growing consumer demand for stylish and innovative products, coupled with increasing public awareness of environmental issues. While some similar niche retailers set up by entrepreneurs in the 1980s, such as Sophie Mirman's Sock Shop, later ran into financial difficulties, the progress of Body Shop has been spectacular. Profits increased from Pounds 1.04m in 1985 to Pounds 29.7m in the year to August 1994, on sales that have grown from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 195.4m over the same period. The company has achieved this success without advertising, instead using the growing fame of its articulate and energetic founder to sell its products. Anita Roddick personified the company, and rarely refused interviews. Newspapers and magazines devoted multi-page spreads to Anita's beauty tips, what she ate, how she decorated her home, even her favourite films. The other defining characteristic of the company was its 'green' image. It used recyclable plastic bottles and urged customers to refill their old ones rather than buy new ones; it campaigned against testing of products on animals; it plastered the olive-green interiors of its shops with posters telling customers to save the whale and the rainforest. Body Shop's attempts to maintain high ethical standards extend beyond its environmental policies. The group allows every employee half a day of paid time off each month to do voluntary work. It donated Pounds 230,000 to launch the Big Issue, the magazine sold by the homeless, who retain 60 per cent of its cover price. It has campaigned for all employers to provide child care, and opened its own 'workplace child development centre'. One of its most high-profile initiatives is the 'Trade Not Aid' programme of paying 'fair' market prices for its ingredients from people in developing countries. However, this idea has attracted the criticism of Mr Richard Adams, director of New Consumer, a campaigning group based in Newcastle, and the founder of Traidcraft, which has long specialised in selling food, clothes and handicrafts bought at 'fair' prices from the Third World. He argues that - despite the posters and other publicity for its programme - 'Trade not Aid' represents less than 0.1 per cent of Body Shop's trade. The company replies that it cannot quantify the amount, but that it is 'more than 1 per cent but less than 10 per cent'. There is little doubt that Body Shop is far more advanced in promoting ethical and green causes than most of its competitors - many of which have since emulated its lead. For example, it is one of a handful of companies to provide environmental data about its activities, through an annual 'green book' which complies with new EU guidelines on ecological management and auditing. But Mr Adam's disillusionment with the company has come partly because he claims it has repeatedly refused to provide him with the detailed information that would allow him to examine its claims thoroughly. The ethical investment movement needs more. 'People have taken a lot on trust,' says Mr Adams. 'The crux is to have independently verifiable information.' The company stresses that it is making improvements all the time. It has hired the former head of Oxfam's fair trading division in Canada to help develop its projects. It recently appointed non-executive directors. It is about to enshrine its 'values' in its official company memorandum of association. Yet the company's critics have a broader concern. It is not that it may have failed on any one of the individual claims made by Entine or other critics, but that the company persistently appears to exaggerate its involvement in worthy causes. 'They take every positive aspect and promote it to the maximum extent,' says Mr Adams. Body Shop also plays down any negative information. For example, when news emerged this week that Entine's allegations included the claims that there had been 'emissions' from its bottling and warehousing plant in New Jersey, Mr Roddick said there were, in fact, two spills of 30 gallons of shampoo two years ago, and the company notified the authorities immediately. However, Hanover Sewage Authority, the local body charged with cleaning the water and monitoring standards, says it traced three spills caused by Body Shop in 1992-93, totalling at least 62 gallons. In each case, the authority detected the leaks and told the Body Shop. What also irritates critics is the company's reluctance to accept any alternative point of view - and its eagerness to silence those who challenge it. The Channel Four libel action last year was one example. Much of the ethical investment community has appeared reluctant to criticise Body Shop, partly because the Roddicks have long been involved with the organisations set up to examine and promote ethical causes within the business world and beyond. 'One of the problems is the desire of the ethical movement to seek champions,' says Mr Adams. 'It was a role that Anita was eminently fitted for. But you need a balance between champions and the development of systems.' Will the recent events make much difference to investors outside the narrow confines of the ethical movement, or to Body Shop's customers and therefore ultimately its financial performance? Many observers say that adverse publicity about Body Shop's ethical standards may not drive away large numbers of customers. The overriding reason most shoppers buy Raspberry Ripple Bathing Bubbles and Camomile Shampoo is because they like the products - not because of Body Shop's environmental policies. Ms Hilary Monk of Verdict, the retail research group, says customers in a recent survey ranked Body Shop's product quality well above that of other health and beauty retailers, and said it was their most important reason for shopping there. But Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, says customers are reassured by the feeling that the products they are buying are environmentally friendly, and are prepared to pay more for them. 'Customers look through green-tinted spectacles at Body Shop's products. Take away the green specs, and you might have to take a bit of the price premium away,' he says. Any tarnishing of Body Shop's environmental image would make it more vulnerable to price competition. It would remove the group's main point of differentiation from imitators such as the 'natural' and 'global' collections launched by Boots in the UK, or Bath &amp; Body Works, the US natural toiletries chain which is expanding into Britain. When asked whether the company would be changing as a result of the criticism, Angela Bawtree said simply: 'It is business as usual.' Yet for ethical investors at least, Body Shop may never be seen in the same way again.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem and  Croat forces continued to violate the one-month ceasefire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb military sources said Thursday  [16 June]. Bosnian Moslem and Croat troops, whose political  leaders three months ago signed a U.S.-mediated federation  agreement, continued offensive action in numerous areas of the  former Yugoslav republic. Around the town of Orasje in the  Posavina region of northern Bosnia, joint units of Bosnian  Croats and regular Croatian Army troops made sporadic artillery  attacks on Serb positions.    Soldiers from the regular Croatian Army have been deployed  in  and around Orasje since the start of the Bosnian civil war in  April 1992. The Bosnian Serb forces suffered no losses in the  latest attack and did not return fire, Serb military sources in  Brcko said early on Thursday. Bosnian Moslem forces opened  mortar fire on Teslic, a town in northern Bosnia, wounding six  civilians, including two children, Serb military sources said.    The Moslems also launched attacks in a wide region around  the  northern Bosnian town of Doboj and the Borci region between  Kalinovik and Konjic in eastern Herzegovina. Heavy Moslem  artillery attacks were also reported around Kladanj in eastern  Bosnia. Bosnian Serb sources reported that Moslem units opened  fire in the Sarajevo region, firing mainly into Sarajevo's Serb  residential areas of Ilijas and Hadzici.</p>

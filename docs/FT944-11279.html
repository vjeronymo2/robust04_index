			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Singapore Press lifts earnings Singapore Press Holdings, the island republic's largest publishing group, has announced pre-tax profits for the year ending August 31 1994 of SDollars 403m (USDollars 269m), a 31 per cent rise on the previous year's figure. Group turnover was up 16 per cent to SDollars 767.5m, mainly due to a 17 per cent rise in advertising revenue and a 7 per cent increase in circulation revenue. Group investment income increased by SDollars 17m to SDollars 56m due to higher interest income and a SDollars 23m profit from the sale of securities. Among extraordinary items, SPH says it made a SDollars 13m profit from the sale of its stake in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper. SPH publishes most of the leading titles in Singapore, including The Straits Times, the Business Times, and the Sunday Times, leading Chinese and Malay newspapers, and a variety of popular magazines.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Goldcrest man faces charge MR John Quested, chief executive of film company Goldcrest, has been arrested and charged with conspiring to falsify accounts in connection with the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into Brent Walker, the property and leisure group. In a further widening of the prosecution more fraud charges were also brought yesterday against Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the company's former finance director. Mr Quested, who headed Goldcrest when the film company was a Brent Walker subsidiary, was charged with one count of conspiring with Mr Walker, Mr Aquilina and Mr Donald Anderson, a former Goldcrest finance director, to falsify accounting documents by over-stating profits and assets between 1984 and 1987. Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina were charged with the same offence when they appeared at Bow Street magistrates court yesterday. Mr Walker already faces four charges of theft of Pounds 12.5m and false accounting, and Mr Aquilina two counts of false accounting. The three men were remanded on bail until April 28. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Mr Anderson whose whereabouts are unknown. Mr Quested took charge of Goldcrest, the British company which made Oscar-winning films such as Chariots of Fire, in September 1987. His appointment heralded a move downmarket in the output of the company. Mr Quested also worked with Mr Walker when both were fellow directors of Trilion, a USM-quoted television production company. Both resigned from the board in February 1990. Goldcrest was sold off by Brent Walker in October 1990 with Mr Quested remaining as chief executive. Banks led by the TSB yesterday resumed their High Court bid to have Mr Walker declared bankrupt. They are claiming Mr Walker has breached his obligations under the voluntary arrangement reached with creditors in September to repay debts of over Pounds 150m. The hearing will continue next week.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UN censures Libya over Lockerbie PanAm bombing THE UN Security Council called unanimously on the Libyan government last night to answer fully official charges that its agents caused the 1988 Lockerbie air disaster and blew up a French airliner in West Africa. In its resolution, the council strongly deplored 'the fact that the Libyan government has not yet responded effectively' to requests for co-operation. It urged Tripoli to provide a full and effective response 'so as to contribute to the elimination of international terorrism'. However, the resolution proposed by Britain, France and the US stopped short of expressly blaming the Libyan government for destroying PanAmerican flight 103 in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives and the UTA flight 772 in Niger nine months later. That crash took 177 lives. None the less, the UN action was widely interpreted as a warning to Libya that it must turn over two alleged terrorists named by Britain and the US in the Lockerbie case or face a threat of economic sanctions. France has not requested the extradition of Libyans it suspects of causing the UTA crash. At the outset of the debate, Mr Jadallah Belgassem, the Libyan minister for strategic industries, termed 'completely baseless' evidence uncovered by British investigators. He said Libya's own inquiries had made no progress, because Britain, the US and France refused to reveal evidence in their possession. Libya had already co-operated and was ready to do so 'to the fullest extent', but in a legal context not the political one imposed by raising the question improperly in the Security Council. He cited the 1971 Montreal Convention for the protection of civil aviation and affirmed Libya's readiness to abide by it. Mr Belgassem called for neutral arbitration and referral of the case to the World Court if that failed. Sir David Hannay, UK delegate and Security Council president, replied that the convention was 'simply irrelevant' to the issue. Those accused of bombing the PanAm flight must face and receive a proper trial that, clearly, should be held in Scotland or the US. It was not practical for an international tribunal to conduct a trial and the World Court had no criminal jurisdiction. Representatives of Sudan and Iraq, which are not Council members, and the Arab League, supported the idea of arbitration and the delegate of Iran said Tripoli was not legally bound to turn over the accused Libyans.</p>

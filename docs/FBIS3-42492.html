			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Statement From the Black Sea Fleet Press Center"] </F>   [Text] Over the last 2 months the command of the Ukrainian  Navy has been attempting to unilaterally subordinate units of  the Black Sea Fleet's Naval Engineering Service located in the  fleet's remote garrisons.    After the recent unlawful actions in relation to the Odessa  and Nikolayevka departments of the Black Sea Fleet Naval  Engineering Service, another action was taken to encourage  personnel of the Naval Engineering Service in the Izmail  garrison to take the Ukrainian oath. This is already the fourth  provocation against Black Sea Fleet seamen serving in this  region in the last 2 weeks. The Black Sea Fleet unit stationed  there essentially found itself under economic blockade. With the  support of city authorities the Military Commissar of Izmail and  the Chief of the Officer Training School of the Ukrainian Navy  continue to exert pressure upon Black Sea seamen, resorting to a  practice of blackmail and threats.    In order to normalize the situation and preclude negative  development of events in Izmail, the command of the Black Sea  Fleet is once again asking the leadership of the Ukrainian Navy  and the city authorities to be reasonable, it feels it necessary  to await civilized solution of the Black Sea Fleet problem by  the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, and it is adhering to  agreements on the fleet reached at the highest level. The fleet  command has sent the corresponding documents on the situation in  Izmail to the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers.</p>

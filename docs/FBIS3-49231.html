			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, after almost four hours of consultations  among the members of the Chamber of Deputies Standing Bureau and  the leaders of the parliamentary factions, the Chamber of  Deputies met in session a short while ago and decided, by 155  votes to 89, with 13 abstentions, to suspend the extraordinary  session begun yesterday at the request of 118 opposition  deputies, our correspondent Ioan David reports. The suspension  remains valid until the Constitutional Court reaches a decision  regarding the way in which the chamber passed the draft bill  empowering the executive to rule by ordinances and contract and  guarantee foreign loans [during the parliamentary recess].    Also today, at the request of the chamber's Standing Bureau,  the Chamber of Deputies decided, by 167 votes to 3, with 84  abstentions, to summon an extraordinary session over 4-13  January. Among the draft bills scheduled to be discussed during  that extraordinary session we would like to mention the  ordinances issued by the government that have not yet been  passed by parliament, the draft bill on the setting up and  functioning of the Romanian radio broadcasting company and the  Romanian television company, the draft bill on Romania's  national defense, the draft bill on the extension of the housing  contracts concluded between the state-owned housing companies  and private tenants, the draft bill on the setting up of the  public corporation for irrigation, and the draft bill on the  value of real estate and the stock exchange. The session is  currently still in progress.    The Senate's special standing committees are in session  today. Our correspondent Victor Spirache has reported that  tomorrow at 1400 the Senate Standing Bureau is to hold a meeting  to examine whether it is necessary to summon an extraordinary  session of that parliamentary chamber as well.</p>

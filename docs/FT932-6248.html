			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Shangri-La Asia in HKDollars 735m flotation SHANGRI-LA Asia, the Hong Kong and China hotel arm of Malaysian-born tycoon Robert Kuok's property and trading empire, is to be floated on the Hong Kong stock market. It is raising HKDollars 735m (USDollars 95.2m) through a public offer which values the hotel operations at HKDollars 4.9bn. This will be the first big hotel flotation in Hong Kong since 1989, and reflects the industry's recovery from the impact on tourism of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the Gulf war. Shangri-La owns net tangible assets valued at HKDollars 6.8bn. They include two luxury hotels in Hong Kong and six hotels in China, along with a portfolio of office and residential property. The Kuok's Shangri-La hotel management business will remain privately-owned. Shangri-La is issuing 150m new shares, or 15 per cent of the company, at HKDollars 4.90 per share. Profits are forecast to increase by 64 per cent in the current year, to HKDollars 365m. This puts the shares on a fully-diluted price-earnings ratio of 13.4 times current-year earnings, which compares favourably with the other Hong Kong luxury hotel groups, Mandarin Oriental and Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels. The Kuok family will retain 59 per cent of the company after the flotation.</p>

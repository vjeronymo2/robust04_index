Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to  fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent  consultations between senior officers of their two countries.  The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated  agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific  Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an  unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people."    In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace,  Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to  the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed,  however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to  undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date  for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of  and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a  serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and  noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility  in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms.  They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade,  and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions.    To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between  their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal  from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between  senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through  periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating  in Bolivia and Paraguay.

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHYSICIAN'S HONESTY IS A POSITIVE STATEMENT  </P> <P> Three paragraphs into your Jan. 15 profile on Dr. German Maisonet ("SCLC Honors  Physician to the Poor"), he was quoted about how he tried not to be a "mixed-up  gay kid." Not meaning to downplay the significance of his great efforts in  treating and educating the poor about AIDS, I was also touched by his  forthrightness about his sexuality.  </P> <P> In this time when AIDS has so crippled the gay civil rights movement that such  opportunistic infections as bigotry and hate crimes are on the rise; when  police raid a valley bar on dubious charges; when a city in Orange County makes  anti-gay discrimination, in effect, legal; when more and more teens have turned  runaway out of sexual-orientation confusion and find few positive role models,  Martin Luther King's SCLC acknowledges a gay man whose worth is judged on his  kindness, generosity, compassion and human spirit.  </P> <P> Dr. Maisonet shows us that not only can one be gay and proud, but that a gay  can be a powerfully positive contributor to a society that so desperately needs  every one of its honorable and humane souls to stand tall.  </P> <P> Thank you, L. A. Times, for amplifying this man's contributions. Thank you, Dr.  Maisonet, for being a hero.  </P> <P> ANDREW O'BRIEN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

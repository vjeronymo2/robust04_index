			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with a SAKINFORMI correspondent,  Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze made the following  statement in connection with the bombing by NATO planes of  Bosnian Serb positions near the town of Gorazde:    This operation can be viewed not only as an isolated  incident  but also as the first serious attempt to counter the phenomenon  of war with force. This was a serious test for the principle of  establishing peace by force. The incident should serve as a  lesson to all aggressive and irresponsible parties, be it a  nationalist or separatist force.    It is necessary to honor obligations undertaken by an  agreement, especially if international organizations are  involved. In the event of the opposite happening, in the world  today there is a more powerful and just force, such as the  United Nations and NATO, which is capable of neutralizing an  aggression such as this.    It must be noted that in planning and carrying out such  major  operations, the practice of political consultation with leading  states, especially, the permanent members of the UN Security  Council, should not be ignored.</p>

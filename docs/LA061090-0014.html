			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: FOR KIDS;  </P> <P> JUNIOR ARTISTS  </P> <P> THE PRIDE IN A little boy's eyes when he presents a dinosaur he's decorated, or  a little girl's delight in unveiling a picture she's painted, can't be equaled.  Now there's a place devoted to such junior extracurricular artistic endeavors  where children can go to try their creative hand -- literally.  </P> <P> Kids 'N Paint is a great place to visit; and it beats messing up your living  room.  </P> <P> The budding artists are swathed in smocks, seated at long tables and given  brushes and paints. Staff members are always on hand to provide pointers and  help when needed. Kids 'N Paint also sells hundreds of plaster items for  children to paint -- from magnets to plaster hamburgers, and teddy bears and  elephants to banks shaped like cars and pigs. (The magnets sell for $1.50; the  average item, about $6.50.) You can even host a birthday party at Kids 'N Paint  for a $25 setup and cleanup fee, and a minimum of $5.50 per child.  </P> <P>  Kids 'N Paint, 19524 Nordhoff St., Northridge; (818) 349-5515.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

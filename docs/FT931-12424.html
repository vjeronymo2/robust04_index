			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Italian group sells warships FINCANTIERI, the Italian state shipbuilding group, has sold two of the warships ordered by Iraq but never delivered because of hostilities in the Gulf, in a Dollars 250m (Pounds 164.4m) deal with the Moroccan navy. The two corvettes formed part of a L3,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn) 1980 Iraqi order for four corvettes, four frigates and some support vessels. Though the order has been partly paid, the ships completed and Iraqi crews were at one time training in the military port of La Spezia, delivery was initially halted by the Iran-Iraq war and then by the invasion of Kuwait. The financial burden of the Iraqi order has weighed heavily on Fincantieri, which has reported steady losses as a result of the crisis in shipbuilding and interest charges on spending for the order. In 1991 it lost L174bn, a substantial proportion of which is believed to have stemmed from costs relating to the Iraqi order. Mr Enrico Bocchini, the company's chairman, declined to speculate on reports that the four remaining frigates would be sold to the Italian navy.</p>

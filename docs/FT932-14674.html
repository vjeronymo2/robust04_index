			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: A model with something important to say Sir, I would like to respond to Wynne Godley's letter about the use of macroeconomic models in forecasting and policy design (April 14). A model is not a 'monster', but a convenient way of setting out in formal mathematical terms the lessons you think you have learnt from experience. One advantage of doing this explicitly is that the basis on which you form your judgment is there for the public to see and to criticise. It makes economic forecasting less like soothsaying, and more like applied science. After the devaluation of sterling last September, we decided at the institute to back our model and to predict a significant economic recovery beginning in the early part of this year. In doing this we were using the relevant information about the way that the economy had responded to exchange rates and interest rates in the past. But we were going against the forecasting consensus and the gloomy mood of industry at the time. That mood has changed now, and it begins to look as if the model had something rather important to say.

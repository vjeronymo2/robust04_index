			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates an article to the 30th anniversary of the publication  of "On Improving the Work of the Youth League To Meet the  Requirements of the Developing Situation", a famous work of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Comrade Kim Chong-il in his work published on April 22, 1964  elaborated on the need to do substantial work with the young  people, firmly build up the rank of officials of the League of  Socialist Working Youth and enhance their role in view of the  practical demand in renaming the Democratic Youth League the  League of Socialist Working Youth [LSWY].    In a by-lined article headlined "Highly Important Work Which  Brought a Revolutionary Turn in the Work of the Youth League"  the paper says the work serves as a highly important guideline  in the development of our youth movement as it clearly indicates  the tasks of the LSWY, the political reserve unit of the  Workers' Party of Korea, and ways of their fulfilment.    For the validity and truth of the idea and theory expounded  in it, the work has displayed its great vitality to the full,  successfully applied to the work of the LSWY in the past 30  years, the article says, and goes on:    The significance and vitality of the work lie first of all  in  that it has helped improve the work with the young people so  that they could grow stoutly to be true revolutionaries of  chuche type and successors to the revolution who, firmly armed  with the revolutionary idea of the party and the leader, devote  everything to the party and the revolution, the country and the  people.    All the young people in our country today are growing to be  lifeguards and death-defying corps defending the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il with death on the forefront.    We cannot find in any other place such revolutionary young  people as ours who are unfailingly loyal to the leader, sound in  ideology and pure in morality. Our party and people deem it a  great pride to have such laudable and trustworthy young people  of new generation as the reserves of the revolution.    The significance and vitality of the work also lie in that  it  has helped firmly build up the ranks of officials of the LSWY  and enhance their role constantly and thus make the LSWY  organisations to be virile organisations.    The dear leader's work is an immortal banner which makes it  possible to improve and strengthen the LSWY work and stoutly  rear all the young people as reliable successors to the  revolution, stresses the article.</p>

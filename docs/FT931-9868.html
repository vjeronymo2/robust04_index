			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Woody the wizard - Cinema SHADOWS AND FOG (15) Woody Allen OLIVIER OLIVIER (15) Agnieszka Holland THE LIVING END (18) Gregg Araki STAY TUNED (PG) Peter Hyams Woody Allen's deliciously strange Shadows And Fog is about the Known and the Unknowable. Part tragedy, part comedy; part human puppet-show, part charabanc tour through the dark night of the soul; it is a fantasy prelude in film noir tones to the later Husbands And Wives. In America many hated it: mainly because there are so many plots bubbling at once that it is like being in a mad wizard's kitchen. We have Allen himself as Mr Kleinman, the bumbling coward roped into a posse hunting a mass killer in a European town. We have circus sword-swallower Mia Farrow, flouncing out on husband John Malkovich after he has slept with trapeze artist Madonna. We have the star-packed brothel (Kathy Bates, Lily Tomlin, Jodie Foster) where Farrow spends a fugitive night. We have Farrow-smitten student John Cusack; mad doctor Donald Pleasence; neighbour Kate Nelligan . . . Whoah. Enough, you cry. How many films are being reviewed here under one title? But the multi-story skittishness of Shadows And Fog is its charm. If Husbands And Wives gave us the first great film from a new, free-associating Woody - conventional style and structure splintering under the power of improvised emotion - Shadows And Fog is like a gentler dressage for that drama of deconstruction. Across the dinky squares, through the picture-book fog and darkness, lope the funny-mysterious Lilliputians. In style the film is a toy-theatre spoof on German Expressionism, doing for Lang and Murnau what Love And Death did for Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. But Shadows And Fog is also about good and evil, destiny and predestination. Herr Kleinman - Allen with specs and nervous soliloquies - knows he has been 'chosen' but cannot figure out what for. Farrow's runaway circus girl leaps into her fated midnight and finds a fated self-fulfilment. (She links up with Allen in what may be their last and most touching boy-meets-girl vignette.) And Doc Pleasence, pondering a morgueful of corpses, gazes straight and steely-eyed into the heart of life, death and the beyond. Though Carlo Di Palma's black-and-white photography mimics a gloom-laden cine-Europe of 60 years ago, the film is also free-spirited enough to throw in some prime Woody repartee. (Farrow: 'I slept with one man for money. Does that make me a whore?' Allen: 'Only by the dictionary definition.') And a classically deft scene of romantic misunderstanding between Cusack and Malkovich shows that the director does not save all the good laughs for himself. But Shadows And Fog is best when comedy balances on a knife-edge of the macabre; when the inquisitive despair that Allen over-formalised in his Chekhov-Bergman pieces (Interiors, September) is given the true texture of filmic malaise - human fear and defiance glittering in the shadows of the unknowable. When a film comes to a sudden narrative pause and flashes up the title 'Paris, six years later,' we fear the worst. Either the characters who were children will have grown up to become unrecognisable adults. Or those who were grown-ups will be the same actors with a wisp of grey hair and a look of telegraphic disenchantment. But Agnieszka Holland's powerfully imaginative Olivier Olivier skips over every lurking trap. In part one nine-year-old Olivier disappears from his rural home - never seen again after leaving to take food to Granny (yes, shades of Red Riding Hood) - and parents Francois Cluzet and Brigitte Rouan are split apart by sobs and recriminations. In part two 15-year-old Olivier is tracked down by Paris cop Jean-Francois Stevenin and restored to his ecstatic parents and startled sister. But is it Olivier? The questionable resemblance of new actor to old has the audience clucking scornful scepticism: only to be out-clucked by the movie itself as it sows doubts in the midst of delight and then delivers a knock-out denouement. Taken from a newspaper item, the story grows its own reality like a cutting newly planted in rich soil. One-time co-screenwriter with Wajda (Man Of Iron, Danton), Agnieszka Holland has learned the art of more-comes-from-less. The film never stops to 'explain' its characters. The stormy father, the besotted mother; the enigmatic sister with her sacrificial rites and mystic powers (from self-inflicted cigarette burns to telekinesis); the teenage Olivier's moody inconsistency of recall. The characters are 'givens' who create their own human weather system, as alien and yet as recognisable as the sirocco. And domestic trivia, from a squalling cat to the musical beds of sleepless children climbing in with sighing adults, become the meteorology of changing emotion. Gregg Araki's The Living End is an AIDS-era road movie and as dotty as that sounds. Two HIV-positive Californians, bookish Jon and hellraising Luke, throw themselves into each other's arms and then onto the open road in this film that resembles a cross between a gay Badlands and a Wild At Heart for sexual militants. Casual murders; lots of outlaw lyricism; and a sense of two people narcissistically narrating their own lives as they glide attitudinisingly towards death. Jon (Craig Gilmore) is a film critic writing a thesis on the 'Death of Cinema'. (No comment.) Luke is a drama queen with bronzed pectorals who wants to blow his brains out during a final dazzling orgasm. When not giving screen time to these tinpot tragic heroes, debut director Araki branches out into caricatured women. These range from two loudmouthed lesbians scripted for penis-envy dialogue to a Bette Davis lookalike with pillbox hat and kitchen knife. This last floats into an early love scene between Luke and a pick-up, delivers the line 'This isn't the Seventies any more, you know' and stabs the pick-up to death. Reality? Fantasy? Comedy? Horror? Who knows. Who, alas, cares. Mark this down as the first, worst film of a director who may improve when he empties his system of gay special pleading and camp melodramatics. Stay Tuned is, if possible, worse. Married couple John Ritter and Pam Dawber, Faustians of the hi-fi age, have adventures in a nightmare TV-land run by Satan figure Jeffrey Jones. Sucked into this 'other world' via a giant satellite dish, they become actors in spoof shows like The Golden Ghouls, Meet The Mansons and Northern Overexposure. The cod titles are the funniest thing. Elsewhere this is fast, frenetic, fun-free tripe: scripted by ex-advertising duo Tom Parker and Jim Jenewein and directed by Peter Hyams. To conjure the true spirit of comedy this week requires necromancy. The late Buster Keaton, greatest of silent comics, unlocks his stone-faced splendour in a season at the Barbican. Sherlock Junior is joined by two classic shorts, The Love Nest and The Playhouse, in a programme no connoisseur of mute mirth should miss. (But be warned: the odd sound effect has been added to Sherlock). The opposite of a comedian who never speaks is a film-maker whose characters never shut up. A sad farewell to Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who died last Friday. He spent his life wiring great film stars for sound, plugging them in and then standing back to watch the mixture of noise, sparks and explosions. He twinned Brando and Gielgud in Julius Caesar. He set Olivier and Caine at each other's larynxes in Sleuth. And in All About Eve, starring Bette Davis and a famous line about bumpy nights, he made the most glorious impostor among movies. It pretends to be a film; it is really a stage play with a camera breathing down its neck. But who objects? No movie ever matched its glittering, sideswiping dialogue or its showman's wisdom about show business.</p>

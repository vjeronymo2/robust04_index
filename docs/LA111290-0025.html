			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Myths in the Making: Martial-arts movie star Steven Seagal seems to have  trouble separating myth from reality. He recently appeared on Arsenio Hall's  talk show and said that he spent a lot of his youth in Brooklyn, but his  mother, Pat, told People magazine that he was born in Lansing, Mich., and lived  outside Detroit before moving to Fullerton, Calif., when he was 5.  </P> <P> Seagal also has portrayed himself as an urban street kid, but his mother says  he suffered from asthma and was "a puny kid back then." The People story also  casts doubt on Seagal's claim to have studied in Japan with Morihei Uyeshiba,  the founder of the aikido form of martial arts, who died in 1969. Sources  familiar with the CIA also say Seagal's claim to have been a CIA adviser is  improbable. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

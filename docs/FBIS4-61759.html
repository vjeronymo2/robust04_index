			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F. Arnfolgu: "Investigation Completed"] </F>   [Text] On the even of the second anniversary of the fall of  Shusha a briefing was held in the republic procuracy.  Procurator General of Azerbaijan Ali Omarov reported that the  investigation of the case of the betrayal of the city of Shusha  to the enemy had been completed. More than 4,000 witnesses had  been questioned and more than 400 expert appraisals conducted.  The accused are the former defense minister, Ragim Gaziyev, the  regimental commander Nail Kyazimov, and self-defense battalion  commanders Fakhraddin Safarov and Tofig Oguz and another  individual whose name A. Omarov refused to give.    R. Gaziyev is being accused of abuse of power, appropriation  of state property in especially large amounts, and also illegal  acquisition of weapons. N. Kyazimov and F. Safarov are being  accused of insubordination and willful departure from their  positions during combat actions. The last two are no longer  living.    The investigation established that on the eve of the seizure  of Shusha half of the 1,500 personnel of the Azerbaijan army  were absent. To the question of who gave the order to withdraw  the combat equipment from the city the leader of the  investigatory group, an investigator of especially important  cases under the Procuracy General, Medzhid Khasyyev, answered:  "The technical equipment was not withdrawn from the city, it was  in unfit condition."    A. Omarov stated that he deliberately did not use the word  "treason" because he does not believe that anyone could betray  the Motherland. In his opinion, the city fell as a result of  the cowardice and negligent attitude toward their duties on the  part of individuals responsible for its defense. But in society  there has long been the conviction that Shusha and Lachin were  victims of betrayal and political intrigues.    As M. Khasyyev noted, the seizure of Shusha and Lachin must  be regarded in the context of the events and processes taking  place in the republic at the time. He suggested that  journalists ask the question why the parliament had not yet  given a political-legal assessment of the occupation of these  regions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Chiang and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 31 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan and  South Korea are meeting here to discuss resumption of bilateral  fruit trade, which has been suspended since the two countries  severed diplomatic ties in August 1992.    Chen Wu-hsiung, head of the Taiwan delegation to the  meeting,  said Taiwan is willing to import Korean pears and apples in  exchange for Korea's importation of its bananas, oranges and  litchis.    Chen, a department director of Taiwan's Council of  Agriculture, arrived in Seoul Sunday [29 May] for the talks,  which began Monday. Chang Shao-chun, Taiwan's deputy  representative in Seoul, also took part in the negotiations.    Li Yong-le, director of the Farm Produce Distribution  Bureau,  is heading the Korean delegation to the talks.    Pressured by its fruit growers, South Korea is eager to  resume fruit trade with Taiwan.    Before Seoul switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing,  Taiwan allowed imports of a specified amount of Korean pears and  apples annually in exchange for Korea's purchases of a similar  amount of its bananas.    "We hope to include our oranges, litchis or mangoes in  future  fruit exchanges," Chen explained.    The two sides reached consensus on some basic principles  during Monday talks. They will discuss technical details  Tuesday. If all goes smoothly, Chen said, a formal agreement  will be signed at the end of the talks.    Diplomatic sources here said south Korea hopes to resume  fruit trade with Taiwan as soon as possible. Taiwan used to be  Korea's major apple and pear market. The Korean Government also  hopes the resumption of fruit trade can pave the way for the  re-opening of direct airlinks between the two countries, which  were also suspended following the breakup of diplomatic ties,  the sources said.</p>

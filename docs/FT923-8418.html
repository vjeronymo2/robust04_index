			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries gain in cautious trading US Treasuries followed through from Friday's gains with further advances yesterday, although trading was cautious ahead of this week's injection of new supply. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/16 at 107 19/32 , to yield 7.358 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/16 at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.099 per cent. The scene was set for a firm opening in New York after Treasury prices had risen in overseas markets amid a general flight-to-quality following yet another big fall in Tokyo equities. With the Nikkei index at a six-year low, investors in Japan and Europe viewed US government securities as the safest available haven. This week the Treasury will sell Dollars 36bn in new issues, starting with an auction Dollars 15bn in three-year notes this afternoon. With such a large amount of new securities coming to the market, dealers and investors were understandably cautious in their trading yesterday. UK government bond prices ended mixed with medium and long-dated issues closing lower due to funding concerns while short-dated issues ended slightly higher. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.06 and drifted down to 97.02 but volumes in the futures market were well below average at around 14,000 contracts. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening level of 115 5/16 to 115 5/32 , yielding 9.43 per cent. However, dealers said prices for shorter-dated issues remained fairly firm with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 inching up from 100 1/2 to 100 9/16 by late afternoon to yield 9.64 per cent. The weakening in prices for medium and longer-dated issues has led to a slight flattening in the gilt yield curve. Dealers expect longer-dated gilt prices to remain depressed in the run-up to the next auction, even though the economic data due to be released this week is expected to be positive for the market. The Bank of England announced on Friday that it plans to auction stock with a maturity of 15 years or more on August 26. JAPANESE government bonds ended the day firmer with dealers reporting good demand for medium-dated issues. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.025 per cent and traded in a range of 5.005-5.045 per cent before closing at 5.015 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract opened at 104.50 and ended at 104.60. Volumes in both the cash and futures markets were below average, which dealers blamed on the holiday season. GERMAN government bond prices ended the day lower with the Liffe bund futures contract moving from its opening of 87.35 to end at 87.24, just above the low price for the day. Dealers said the European government bond markets will be focusing on two main areas in the immediate future - the next set of German money supply figures and the opinion polls in the run-up to the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. The German money supply figures for July are not expected until next week and bund dealers said they will be waiting to see whether M3 growth is showing any sign of slowing down.</p>

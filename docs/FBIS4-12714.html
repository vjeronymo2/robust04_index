			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dispute Between 'Udayy and Iraqi </F> Transport Minister Over Agreement To Establish Company With  Sudan"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The establishment of a  joint transport company between Iraq and Sudan is expected to  lead to the removal of Iraqi Transport Minister Ahmad Murtada  because of a dispute between the Minister and 'Udayy Saddam  Husayn, son of the Iraqi president, over who should run land  transport operations in this company.    Iraqi sources have said that 'Udayy attacked the transport  minister for agreeing to sign a contract with an Iraqi merchant  whom he described in the BABIL newspaper as "an opposition  figure living abroad." He also attacked Transport Ministry  Undersecretary Jamil Ibrahim, who was following up the  contract's implementation in Amman last week.    The sources pointed out that 'Udayy had been hoping to win a  contract to carry out the company's operations and use the land  fleet he owns in carrying out all transport operations between  Iraq and al-'Aqabah and vice versa.    Ahmad Murtada was appointed transport minister in the latest  cabinet reshuffle some nine months ago. He belongs to the group  loyal to Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil al-Majid, the Iraqi  president's son-in-law. He also held in the past the post of  director general of the Military Industrialization Organization.    As for Transport Ministry Undersecretary Jamil Ibrahim, he  comes from the town of Tikrit. But he belongs to the Mukhlis  family, a number of whose members were executed last year on  charges of hatching a plot to topple the regime.</p>

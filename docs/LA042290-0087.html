			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNS, HOTELS, B&amp;BS IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST  </P> <P> The Pacific Northwest is a natural delicacy with rocky coastlines, verdant  mountains and fertile farmlands. At times its exterior can appear gray, its  climate sober, its waters chilled and its mountains temperamental. But at other  moments it is warm and sunny and frosted with wildflowers under constantly  changing skies and crystal-clear air.  </P> <P> There are many wonderful places to stay. The inns, hotels and bed and  breakfasts that follow are a few of its treasures.  </P> <P> April Point Lodge: P.O. Box 1, Campbell River, B.C. V9W 4Z9, Canada (about 100  miles north of Vancouver on Quadra Island), (604) 285-2222; double rooms start  at $99 a night. This is not roughing it. April Point Lodge is perhaps the  finest fishing lodge in the Northwest and not just because the knowledge the  fishing guides have is based on generations of experience. Cabins are  attractive, with large fireplaces, and food is outstanding. You must fly or  take a ferry in.  </P> <P> Columbia Gorge Hotel: 4000 Westcliff Drive, Hood River, Ore. 97031 (about an  hour east of Portland), (503) 386-5566 or (800) 345-1921; double rooms start at  $135 a night. On a cliff overlooking Columbia Gorge, just above where hundreds  of windsurfers zip back and forth across the river. If you're going to stay in  this handsome hotel, a gorge-side room is a must (otherwise you may find  yourself overlooking and overhearing Interstate 84). A seven-course breakfast  comes with an overnight room. It's so big it's frightening.  </P> <P> Four Seasons Olympic Hotel: 411 University St., Seattle, Wash. 98101  (downtown), (206) 621-1700 or (800) 223-8772; double rooms start at $190 a  night. Seattle's most elegant hotel, it's not as luxurious as you might expect,  but refreshingly simple. The service is gracious and the hotel exhibits  four-star touches.  </P> <P> Hastings House: P.O. Box 1110, Ganges, B.C. VOS 1EO, Canada (halfway between  Vancouver and Victoria in the Gulf Islands), (604) 537-2362; double rooms start  at about $200 a night, including breakfast and afternoon tea. A remarkable  place in part due to the surroundings amid fruit trees, gardens and rolling  lawns that overlook a peaceful cove on Salt Spring Island. A dozen suites in  four renovated farm buildings. Our favorite is the Hayloft with its bay window  seat, Franklin stove and folk art. The service is especially prompt and  efficient.  </P> <P> The Heathman Hotel: 1009 S.W. Broadway, Portland, Ore. 97205 (downtown), (503)  241-4100 or (800) 551-0011; double rooms start at $125 a night. The place to  stay in Portland, it has afternoon tea each day, an exquisite marble bar for  the evening, elegant rooms and one of Portland's finest restaurants. You feel  well taken care of but not fussed over.  </P> <P> The James House: 1238 Washington St., Port Townsend, Wash. 98368 (about 50  miles northwest of Seattle); (206) 385-1238; double rooms start at $60 a night.  Among the Northwest's first B&amp;Bs and Port Townsend's finest Victorian home.  James House has about a dozen antique decorator rooms, though the best ones  face Puget Sound. The main floor has two beautiful parlors, each with a  fireplace.  </P> <P> Mattey House Inn: 10221 N.E. Mattey Lane, McMinnville, Ore. 97128 (35 miles  southwest of Portland), (503) 434-5058; double rooms start at $55 a night,  including breakfast. The Mattey House stands behind its own little vineyard,  like a remote French manor. It's an 1890s Victorian mansion. It has nice extra  touches such as fresh flowers, plush bathrobes and, appropriately, a glass of  wine in the parlor. The hosts are enthusiastic guides to the Willamette Valley  wine country.  </P> <P> Mazama Country Inn: P.O. Box 223, Mazama, Wash. 98833 (185 miles northeast of  Seattle), (509) 996-2681; double rooms start at $58 a night. A spacious lodge  in the middle of pristine Methow Valley, where in the winter guests  cross-country ski over the 100 miles of groomed trails. In the summer they  explore the valley on horseback. The original inn was a converted farmhouse but  the new cedar building has a bit more charm. It's rural without being rustic.  Dining is family style.  </P> <P> Paradise Ranch Inn: 7000-D Monument Drive, Grants Pass, Ore. 97526 (about 200  miles south of Portland, about 61 miles north of the California border), (503)  479-4333; double rooms start at $83 a night. Imagine a working dude ranch  turned into a Northwest resort. That's exactly what you'll find here, with  activities ranging from trout fishing to tennis, swimming in a heated outdoor  pool to hiking. But best of all, it's not a sprawling resort. Having only 18  rooms makes it very peaceful.  </P> <P> Sylvia Beach Hotel: 267 N.W. Cliff, Newport, Ore. 97365 (about 114 miles  southwest of Portland); (503) 265-5428; double rooms start at $50 a night. In  this informal bluff-top hotel for bookworms, each of the 20 rooms is decorated  in a different literary theme. For instance, the Agatha Christie room is in  green English chintz with a tiled fireplace and items that served as clues in  Christie mysteries. The best part of the hotel is the library on the third  floor that has a fireplace, lots of comfortable chairs and a wide-open view of  the Pacific.  </P> <P> Tyax Mountain Lake Resort: Tyaughton Lake Road, Gold Bridge, B.C. VOK 1PO,  Canada (about 110 miles north of Vancouver), (604) 238-2221; double rooms start  at $98 a night. This place defines indulgence for the active minded. The best  way to get here is by float plane. It's right by a lake, though the key to fun  here is "heli" anything: heli-skiing, heli-hiking, even heli-fossil hunting.  You can stay in the large log lodge but if you arrive with a group try to  reserve one of the three chalets on Tyaughton Lake.  </P> <P> The Willows: 2579 West Shore Drive, Lummi Island, Wash. 98262 (about 100 miles  north of Seattle), (206) 758-2620; double rooms start at $90 a night. On  pastoral Lummi Island, the Willows has only four rooms but all are very  comfortable.  </P> <P> However, it's the Saturday night dinner, really a feast, that has won such a  following among locals. It begins at sunset on the porch to the accompanyment  of a harpist and guitarist and finishes five courses later in the sitting room  with a civilized glass of port. Dinner cost is $75. Reservations are required.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NASDAQ has evolved from a market of thinly traded companies in 1975 to one that today accounts for 42% of share volume and 29.2% of dollar volume in the U.S. equity markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  During that time, the Commission, together with the NASD, has attempted to implement rules that reflect increased investor interest in this market. The events which gave rise to the Manning case date back to 1984 and the Commission has been pressing for improved limit order priority since then.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 9, at 9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its order approving the recent NASD Interpretation, the Commission indicated that a further Commission rule might be necessary to ensure protection for all public limit orders in NASDAQ/NMS securities, should the NASD fail to do so. The NASD's Interpretation prevents a market maker from trading ahead of its own customers' limit orders, but does not prevent the same market maker from trading ahead of the limit orders of other firms' customers that are sent to the market maker for execution. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission believes that it is reasonable for customers to expect that the quality of the execution received will not vary from trade to trade. Under current NASD rules, the quality of the execution received could vary depending on whether the customer's firm or an affiliate makes a market in a security or whether that firm sends the order to another market maker for execution. Customers choose their brokers for a variety of reasons, including cost and integrity; whether the broker also makes a market in a security in which the customer may be interested should not affect the quality of the execution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with the conclusion of the Division of Market Regulation's Market 2000 Study that the adverse effects of trading ahead exist whether the customer's order is handled by the customer's firm or by another market maker. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Rule 15c5&hyph;1 would apply to customer limit orders, regardless of where the order is ultimately routed for execution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 9, at V&hyph;8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the principles of investor protection and market integrity would be advanced by a limit order priority rule. The lack of limit order protection results in inferior executions for customers and adversely affects the price discovery process for these securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at V&hyph;7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By providing a customer's limit order priority over the market maker's proprietary trading, more trade volume will be available to be matched with the customer's order, resulting in quicker and more frequent executions for limit order customers. In the past, customers may have refrained from placing limit orders because of the uncertainty of and difficulty in obtaining an execution at a price between the spread. A customer limit order rule will encourage dealers that accept customer limit orders to execute them in a timely fashion so that they may resume their proprietary trading activities. With the improvement in the quality of these executions, investors will have greater confidence in this market and trade volume from retail investors could increase. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In addition, customer limit order priority would improve the price discovery process in NASDAQ/NMS securities. Limit orders aid price discovery by adding liquidity to the market and by tightening the effective spread between the bid and ask price of a security, even though these limit orders would not be displayed in the market maker's quote. The practice of not executing a limit order until the inside quotation price reaches the customer's limit order price also impedes the price discovery process by preventing those orders from interacting with other orders. More expeditious handling of customer limit orders under the proposed rule could provide investors with a more accurate indication of the buy and sell interest at a given moment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> One of the problems with not giving customer limit orders priority is the cost to public customers in terms of inferior or missed executions for limit orders. It is currently impossible for customers to monitor these costs. The ability of a customer to monitor the cost of the transaction and choose a broker-dealer on that basis imposes a competitive discipline on the market maker to achieve the best possible execution for the customer or risk losing the business. Unlike institutional clients who are in a better position to negotiate their own protection with market makers, public customers have less viable alternatives in determining where their orders are ultimately sent for execution. Under these circumstances, market makers lack the same incentive to provide superior executions to public customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Market makers who oppose a comprehensive rule mandating limit order priority for customers do so in part on the ground that such a rule would reduce their return from market making. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Market makers are, of course, entitled to earn a profit from their service; A limit order rule could force market makers to recoup the cost of the transaction in ways more apparent to the customer, such as by charging a commission for handling the limit order. The Commission requests comment in the form of specific data regarding the potential consequences of the proposed rule for market liquidity and market maker capital commitment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from Frank Masi, President, Securities Traders Association of New York (``STANY''), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (March 29, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Description of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Limit order protection in the NASDAQ market is now required only of firms that execute their own customers' limit orders. Market makers still may trade ahead of the limit orders entered by customers of other firms that are sent to them for execution. Proposed Rule 15c5&hyph;1 would provide limit order protection to all customers in NASDAQ/NMS securities, regardless of where the order is ultimately sent for execution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

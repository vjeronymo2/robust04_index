			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Luther Campbell's Greatest Hit: "Banned in the U.S.A.," the new Luther Campbell  single with 2 Live Crew being released today by Luke Records, has garnered the  largest advance orders for a single in the history of Atlantic Records. Mark  Schulman, Atlantic senior vice president and general manager, said he expects  the single, which contains a melody of Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the  U.S.A.," to rapidly reach platinum record status. 2 Live Crew, whose last album  has been banned by federal court order in several Florida counties, went back  to court Monday to film parts of a video for the upcoming album, "Banned in the  U.S.A," which is due for release later this month. Also, formal charges were  filed Tuesday against three members of the Miami rap group who were arrested  after their adults-only performance on June 9 in Hollywood, Fla., and also  against a store owner who sold their "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album to an  undercover detective on June 8.

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> ANTISERUM WORKING ON 3 SICK HORSES  </P> <P> An experimental antiserum given to three horses suffering an illness that has  killed 18 horses in Southern California appears to be working, officials said  Monday.  </P> <P> Officials also were encouraged that no new cases of the illness surfaced over  the weekend at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center, where the  sickness was discovered on Oct. 28.  </P> <P> Nine horses have died in Orange County, and botulism has been blamed. Officials  believe that the toxin was in hay cubes manufactured in Utah and shipped late  last month to at least 60 stables from Ventura to San Diego.  </P> <P> State officials have issued a recall of more than 850 tons of the cubes  produced and distributed by Paramount Cubing, a Los Angeles County firm that  denies that its product led to the deaths of any horses. The recall should be  complete by the end of this week, said Stanley Buscombe, chief of feed and  fertilizer for the state Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Operators of the equestrian center, where 260 horses are boarded, stopped using  the hay cubes last Monday, switching to loosely baled alfalfa. The illness has  a five- to seven-day incubation period, thus officials are optimistic that no  more horses will be stricken.  </P> <P> The conditions of three horses apparently have stabilized, possibly the result  of the antiserum used to treat them since late last week.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Southern California, several other horses became ill over the  weekend, but none has died. The illness strikes the equine's nervous system,  apparently "short-circuiting" their nerve endings, causing their legs to quiver  uncontrollably. STEVEN R. CHURM  </P></p>

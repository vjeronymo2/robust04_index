			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE ATTACK PROTESTERS ON MOSCOW STREET  </P> <P> Helmeted riot police wielding truncheons repeatedly charged and clubbed  demonstrators Monday night after a candlelight vigil outside the headquarters  of the KGB security service in memory of Stalin's victims. Scores of protesters  were knocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into police buses.  </P> <P> About 40 people were detained, the Tass news agency said, in what was the  harshest crackdown on protesters in Moscow in more than 18 months. Tass said  the protesters were "trying to create as much disruption as possible, to  display anti-Soviet posters and shout anti-Soviet slogans."  </P> <P> The clashes took place on some of central Moscow's busiest streets and were  especially jarring because of the more permissive political climate instituted  under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wide-ranging reforms.  </P> <P> About 1,000 Soviets converged on KGB headquarters at Dzerzhinsky Square after  dusk to mark the unofficial "Day of the Political Prisoner" and mourn the  millions who were wrongly imprisoned or killed under Josef Stalin.  </P> <P> The hourlong protest, in which two rows of people holding flickering candles  lined up on three sides of the building, proceeded peacefully. It had been  organized by the Memorial Society, which seeks to commemorate those who  suffered unjustly under Stalin, and the Democratic Union, a self-styled  opposition to the Communist Party.  </P> <P> At the end of the demonstration, a splinter group of about 500 people, mostly  young men, marched off in the direction of Pushkin Square, a favorite rallying  site for human rights activists.  </P> <P> The protesters chanted "Shame on the KGB!" and "The KGB is the enemy of the  people!" They were confronted without warning by riot police two blocks from  Pushkin Square as they passed out leaflets to homebound commuters.  </P> <P> It was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstration in Moscow since  December, 1987, when about 200 burly men in civilian clothes roughed up a group  of Jews who staged a protest demanding the right to emigrate.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXPAYERS AND LOBBYISTS PICK UP TRAVEL TAB FOR LAWMAKERS  </P> <P> Many California legislators don't have to dream of faraway places. They've been  there.  </P> <P> To Paris and London, Brazil and New Zealand, Singapore and Bombay.  </P> <P> And what's more, they didn't have to pay. A variety of special interests are  willing to pick up much of the tab. State funds and campaign treasuries pay for  the rest.  </P> <P> In a detailed study of free travel by legislators during the last legislative  session, The Times found that:  </P> <P> * Legislative staffers on the public payroll solicited travel money for  legislators from private sources, including lobbyists, even though state law  prohibits lobbyists from making or arranging gifts to a lawmaker in excess of  $10 a month.  </P> <P> * The Senate two years ago set up an office to help arrange trips that took  dozens of legislators to places as distant as Cairo and Beijing. On most of the  trips, legislative employees planned the itineraries and acted as tour guides.  </P> <P> * Other travel by legislators, including leisurely fishing trips in Northern  California and conferences in Bermuda, was planned and paid for directly by  corporations or trade groups backing bills before the Legislature.  </P> <P> * The taxpayers helped foot the bill for a number of trips, including 25  outside the country to such faraway places as Australia, Hong Kong and South  Korea.  </P> <P> * Special-interest money for some legislative travel was distributed by private  organizations, in effect obscuring its true source.  </P> <P> Legislators defend the travel as helpful, even vital, to California but say  they need to turn to special interests for financing because taxpayers are  reluctant to pay the bill.  </P> <P> The costs are substantial.  </P> <P> In their financial disclosure reports for the 1987-88 session, lawmakers  reported receiving gifts totaling $744,000 for travel, an average of $6,200 per  lawmaker.  </P> <P> Most of that money came from private sources. But some of it, about $64,000,  came from foreign governments, which themselves have a stake in California tax  and trade policies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dependence on Special Interests  </P> <P> Critics and even some lawmakers say they are troubled by the Legislature's  dependence on special interests for travel expenses.  </P> <P> "In my ideal world," said Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los  Angeles), the state would pay for the travel. "But I'm an American politician,  I'm a California politician, and I have to recognize what my constituents think  is proper. And they love having international meetings, and I think they want  us to learn about the world, and they don't want to pay for it."  </P> <P> Roberti minimized the extent to which legislative employees have called on  lobbyists and special interests to cover the cost of legislative travel, but  defended the practice.  </P> <P> "What would be more improper would be to treat California as if it is a banana  republic or a backwater somewhere else," Roberti said. "I think that the  American people are pretty comfortable having private industry pay for certain  things if they think there is a reason for it."  </P> <P> At a press conference earlier this year, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco) upbraided a reporter for assuming that a free trip would influence  the voting behavior of legislators. "It is the ultimate in cynicism," Brown  said, "to assume automatically that it is (an attempt to buy a vote)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trip Funding Criticized  </P> <P> But others say that allowing special interests to pay for travel is troubling.  </P> <P> "Private money is not disinterested," said UCLA law professor Daniel H.  Lowenstein, the first chairman of the state Fair Political Practices  Commission. "Some private groups make these kinds of gifts in an effort to  create good will. It's not in the public interest to allow them to create good  will with public officials in that way. If we decide to save a few pennies by  letting them send our legislators all over the world we'll pay for it 1,000  times over."  </P> <P> In fact, the Legislature does pay certain expenses for lawmakers traveling out  of state or outside the country.  </P> <P> Over the last two years, Speaker Brown authorized state funds for five Assembly  members to travel outside the United States at a cost to taxpayers of $15,080.  By far the most expensive was a three-week trip by Assemblywoman Sunny  Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who talked to officials in Spain and Portugal about  the upcoming 500th anniversary of Columbus' first transatlantic voyage.  Mojonnier was reimbursed $6,648, including $4,374 for food and lodging,  according to Assembly records.  </P> <P> In the last two years, the Senate paid $50,424 for out-of-country trips by 14  senators, according to Senate figures.  </P> <P> The biggest beneficiary by far was Sen. Jim Ellis (R-San Diego), who received  $11,003 for trips to Australia and London. He made the trips last summer and  fall, despite the fact that he was already a lame duck legislator, having  announced many months before that he would not seek reelection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need for Outside Sources  </P> <P> However, tax dollars for travel were in relatively short supply during the  1987-88 session and many legislators looked to outside sources to pay for  trips.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Senate established the Senate Office of Protocol, primarily to  receive the hundreds of foreign dignitaries who visit the state Capitol each  year, Roberti said.  </P> <P> But the office's four state-paid employees also planned or helped arrange 17  trips that took about 40 legislators out of the country in a two-year period.  </P> <P> Employees of the office accompanied lawmakers on 10 of those trips, serving as  tour guides and taking care of such "nitty-gritty" problems as handling the  baggage, according to senators who went along.  </P> <P> When a delegation of senators and spouses held a dinner for Egyptian and  American diplomats in Cairo last November, the protocol office's associate  director, Chris Kockinis, paid for the meal with her credit card. A month  later, she sent bills totaling $1,008 to the California Optometric Assn. and  the California Retailers Assn., thanking them for hosting the dinner, although  no one from either group attended.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turned to Lobbyist  </P> <P> Last year, when the Senate wanted to send two of its members -- Republican Ed  Davis of Valencia and Democrat Milton Marks of San Francisco -- to Mexico City,  the protocol office turned to Dennis Flatt, chief lobbyist for the California  Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems for help. The association provided $1,892  to cover expenses.  </P> <P> But the state Political Reform Act specifically prohibits lobbyists from  providing gifts to a legislator in excess of $10 a month or from arranging or  acting as an intermediary for such gifts. Just what it means to "arrange" or  "act as an intermediary" is not always clear. Recently, the Fair Political  Practices Commission fined a lobbying firm $1,000 because it allowed a client  to use its offices and staff for a reception.  </P> <P> The hospital association's spokeswoman, Lori Aldrete, said Flatt merely passed  along the request for help on the Mexico City trip to the group's executives,  who are not subject to the $10 limit.  </P> <P> The Senate protocol staff has gone to other lobbyists as well in its search for  funds for trips. Responding to one of those requests last year, veteran  lobbyist George Steffes said he called on one of his clients, the California  Mobilehome Park Owners Alliance. Individual members of the group contributed  $2,000 to Sacramento State University's Hornet Foundation for a legislative  trade mission to India and Thailand.  </P> <P> Like other lobbyists who have passed along requests for funds, Steffes said he  avoids making or arranging such sizable gifts for legislators. "The fact that  it was going through Sac State made it different, made it an academic thing,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Funding Source Disputed  </P> <P> The director of the Senate protocol office, Susan Foreman, accompanied  legislators on several trips, including one to Israel in 1987. The legislators  on that trip reported receiving a total of $13,296 in travel expenses from  American Associates of Ben Gurion University. Foreman got $2,605.  </P> <P> But the true source of funding for the trip is in dispute. The current director  of the Beverly Hills-based group, Mark Friedman, said that his office did not  pay those travel expenses, although it did help coordinate the trip.  </P> <P> "We're in existence for the explicit purpose of raising money for the  university," Friedman said. "We would not be underwriting costs for a visit of  the sort you described."  </P> <P> The state's largest teachers union, the California Teachers Assn., helped pay  for other trips to Israel -- travel organized and led by the Democratic  chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, Tom Bane of Tarzana, and his wife,  Marlene.  </P> <P> Accompanying legislators on a Bane-led trip last November was Alice Huffman,  the teacher association's manager of governmental relations in Sacramento. "If  the implication is because we go on a trip we have an edge with a member, that  is a little shortsighted on both sides," Huffman said. "All it does is cause  one to have a better understanding of members."  </P> <P> Two legislators on that same trip -- Republican Assemblywomen Cathie Wright of  Simi Valley and Bev Hansen of Santa Rosa -- reported that the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles, a charitable group, paid all or part of their  costs. But Ron Rieder, a spokesman for the council, said that he believed the  Banes raised the money. "We arranged the trip but didn't fund it. The funds  were privately raised."  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Declined to Discuss Details  </P> <P> Assemblyman Bane refused to discuss the Israel trip in detail, but said that  his own costs were paid by his campaign committee, which reported paying $6,300  to the council last year.  </P> <P> Frequently, corporations or groups with a direct interest in legislation simply  paid for legislative travel outright. Among those who did were:  </P> <P> * Pfizer Inc., which last year paid $17,098 for a four-day trip to Bermuda for  three legislators, their spouses and two legislative aides. The trip came while  the Legislature was still considering a Pfizer bill that would have helped the  company ward off lawsuits from foreign citizens. The bill failed.  </P> <P> * California Co-Composting Systems Inc., which spent $18,600 to help send  Speaker Brown, Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. William A.  Craven (R-Oceanside) to Austria in 1987 to see highway sound and safety  barriers made out of a mix of sewage sludge and garbage. The trips came soon  after passage of a Craven bill requiring the state to test such products, which  have been in use in Europe for 30 years.  </P> <P> * Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which routinely pays  most of the expenses for legislators' trips to the Academy Awards ceremonies in  Los Angeles -- including hotel room, limousine service, tickets to the  ceremonies and, in some cases, air fare. Legislative leaders decided which of  their colleagues could go. The total bill for 20 legislators and their guests  over the past two years was $34,293. During the same period, the lobbying group  won approval of a measure assuring the industry of a sales tax break estimated  at up to $9 million a year. All 20 legislators voted for the measure.  </P> <P> * Pacific Telesis, which paid out $74,313 for legislators' travel, most of it  for a 1987 trip by Assembly and Senate utility committee members -- along with  their spouses -- to London and Paris. The committees control most state  legislation directly affecting the company and its subsidiary, Pacific Bell.  The chairs of the two committees, Assemblywoman Moore and Sen. Herschel  Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), decided which of their colleagues would be invited  on the trip, said company lobbyist Paul Henry. The phone company has been in  the middle of numerous legislative battles, ranging from yellow pages to cable  television.  </P> <P> Rosenthal was one of several legislators who contended that lawmakers who take  such trips often turn around and vote against the special interests that paid  for them.  </P> <P> "The trips are fruitful," he said. "They should be paid for by the Senate. . .  . At the moment there's no prospect of it."  </P> <P> In some cases, globe-trotting legislators say they have only a vague idea of  which companies are actually paying for their trips.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Atlantic Encounter  </P> <P> The most notable example is Atlantic Encounter, a mysterious European-based  group that provided $73,889 for travel to London, Dublin, Rome and Madrid for  eight Assembly members during the 1987-88 legislative session, plus $18,026 in  speaking fees.  </P> <P> Among those making these trips were several top Assembly leaders, including  Speaker Brown, Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), Thomas M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield) and  Frank Hill (R-Whittier).  </P> <P> Hannigan, the Assembly Democrats' floor leader, described Atlantic Encounter as  "an association of multinational organizations" that tries to inform policy  makers about issues affecting Europe. One of the companies was Mars Inc., he  said. The candy manufacturer reported spending $126,000 to lobby the  Legislature over the past two years.  </P> <P> When five top legislative leaders flew to Tokyo in 1987, their expenses were  paid for by the Japan Institute for Social and Economic Affairs, which is  funded by private industry. Sadami (Chris) Wada, a New York-based official for  Sony Corp. who deals with legislators, said he made recommendations on which  lawmakers should be invited, attended a Sacramento briefing for legislators by  the Japanese Consulate, and joined the travelers for part of a trip. The total  cost of the trips was reported at $36,950.  </P> <P> Senate leader Roberti went on one institute-paid trip. Defending such privately  financed travel as good for the state, he said: "There's always the presumption  that anything enjoyable is bad, and that's not true."  </P> <P> Republican Sen. Larry Stirling of San Diego agreed. "It may be trite and banal  to say it, but travel is broadening," said the senator, who reported a gift of  $2,000 from the Chinese People's Institute for a trip last year to China.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Noel K. Wilson and Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this  story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP TRAVELERS -- TOP CONTRIBUTORS  </P> <P> The following lawmakers received the most gifts of travel during the 1987-88  legislative session, according to their annual financial disclosure reports:  </P> <P> 1.

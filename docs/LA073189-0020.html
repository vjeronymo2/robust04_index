			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> INSIDERS;  </P> <P> THE MONEY BEHIND THE L.A. SLUMS  </P> <P> For more than a decade, many of Los Angeles' worst old slum apartment buildings  have been commodities on an insider's trading block.  </P> <P> While immigrant tenants live in squalor in the aging structures,  behind-the-scenes investors have developed sophisticated financial devices that  drain the buildings of thousands of dollars in cash rents and virtually condemn  them to further decay.  </P> <P> Those who stand to make the greatest profits do not need to step inside the  door. Often, they do not own the properties, at least not in their own names.  They own the mortgages on them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exceed Property Value  </P> <P> In a two-month examination of Los Angeles slum real estate, The Times found  that some lenders have heaped old buildings with high-interest mortgages that  often exceed the value of the properties. That leaves the titular owners to run  the buildings on little cash, face creditors, and assume the liability for slum  code violations.  </P> <P> Slum traders often "sell" buildings to their own dummy corporations, giving  themselves new "loans" each time and inflating the apparent value of the  buildings. They then sell the buildings to paid front men, or to  unsophisticated buyers who often do not realize their lenders are related to  each other. Because each transaction taken alone appears to be standard,  government agencies are unlikely to spot abuses.  </P> <P> And, there are abuses:  </P> <P>  -- The titular president of two slum trading corporations, Grover Black,  apparently is a dog once owned by Westside real estate agent William Leyton,  according to associates. Public records show that Grover Black has had two  offices, hired at least two attorneys, signed court records, and claimed an  interest in at least two major slum buildings.  </P> <P> Leyton declined an interview. His attorney, Milton Simon, who filed a federal  bankruptcy petition signed by Grover Black, said he "preferred not to comment"  on the identity of Grover Black.  </P> <P>  -- One of Los Angeles' busiest and most flamboyant slumlords in recent years  was a one-time Boston bank robber named Joe Fitzpatrick who financed his empire  of several dozen apartment buildings through numerous loans from friendly  bankers to what he himself described as "straws" and "shell" companies. One was  named MLUS Inc., an anagram of SLUM. A close associate of Leyton, he has been  accused in court of naming his dog president of one of his companies.  Fitzpatrick claimed that the company president, "Teluce Black," actually was  his gardener.  </P> <P> Fitzpatrick, who acknowledged in a court case last year that he had been  convicted of bank robbery about 20 years ago, left town last year after  declaring bankruptcy. But he managed to get back at least one of his old  apartment buildings by lying to the court about his relationship with his real  estate agent, Leyton, records show. He could not be reached for comment in Las  Vegas, where he has recently incorporated new companies.  </P> <P>  -- Inglewood lender Alexander Spitzer has financed many of the city's most  infamous slumlords for more than a decade, buying and selling slum trust deeds  among his own companies. While his companies have taken in profits from  high-interest loan payments, his staff has treated some of his borrowers -- the  slum owners of record -- as "managers," charges one borrower who is currently  suing him for fraud.  </P> <P> Asked about the frequent property transfers, an attorney for Spitzer said they  were "for business purposes." Through the attorney, Spitzer declined an  interview. Several of Spitzer's business entities have recently begun  defaulting on more than $90 million in bank loans and halted payments to  investors. One has petitioned to reorganize under Chapter 11 of federal  bankruptcy procedures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Civil Suit  </P> <P> Leyton, Fitzpatrick and Spitzer are among 142 defendants in a massive civil  lawsuit filed last March by the city attorney, the Legal Aid Foundation and  Litt &amp; Stormer, a private law firm that is representing thousands of  tenants. On July 12, the city settled its claims with 11 companies and  individuals related to Spitzer with an unprecedented agreement that requires  them to alter their lending practices and force their borrowers to make repairs  on substandard buildings. They are still being sued by the tenants.  </P> <P> The suit alleges fraud, conspiracy and racketeering by the defendants in  connection with their ownership roles in 11 selected slum buildings over the  last decade. It argues that lenders, through imprudent or insider loans, have  so much control over Los Angeles slum properties that they are de facto owners  and should therefore be held accountable for living conditions in the  buildings.  </P> <P> "At first we saw a conspiracy among record owners," said City Atty. James K.  Hahn. "Then there was a whole other level underneath it that we were completely  unaware of, and that was the lenders. . . . The lenders were essentially using  these people as fronts . . . uncredit-worthy people who could come in the back  door and get exorbitant loans you and I could never get."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unanswered Questions  </P> <P> There are a number of questions surrounding the alleged schemes that Hahn and  the other plaintiffs hope will be answered in court: How many of the defendants  know each other? To what extent do slum lenders violate existing law, if at  all? Why is it that some buildings seem to travel a slum circuit, passing from  one trader to the next and falling deeper into disrepair with each new sale?  </P> <P> A review of hundreds of real estate records, as well as other public documents  and interviews, indicates numerous links between certain slum traders. Many use  the same attorneys, the same notary publics and, in some cases, the same  offices. This story focuses on one "owner" and his financiers.  </P> <P> Robert Rooks is a small film company owner who got into the slum trade as many  owners do, hoping to profit from an investment that required little money down.  In 1986, he bought a 47-unit slum apartment building at 3972 W. 9th St. from a  man who had defaulted on his loans and was headed into foreclosure. He said he  got the property with no cash down in exchange for agreeing to assume the  existing loans.  </P> <P> "I thought I'd buy this property and fix it up," Rooks said in an interview. "I  didn't know what I was getting into."  </P> <P> Like many owners of slum properties who think they are getting a good deal, he  did not order a title check. That, he now acknowledges, was a "big mistake."  The $1-million loan he had agreed to pay turned out to be a "wraparound" trust  deed, which contained payments to several other note-holders whose identities  were not disclosed to him at the time, he said. Over the next year, he said,  new notes on the property kept surfacing until there were "about 11."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Note Is Sold  </P> <P> At first, he made his mortgage payments to William Leyton, who controlled a  real estate investment company called Zimo 5 Inc., at an office just south of  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Then, he said, Leyton told him he had sold the notes to his longtime business  associate, Alexander Spitzer, who owned several industrial loan companies at  160 S. La Brea. Over time, Rooks said, he developed a relationship with Spitzer  and his staff that was so close he spoke with Spitzer's staff daily and  consulted them on major repairs he was making.  </P> <P> "Spitzer told me he liked me because I was 'workable' and I could deal with  Hispanics," Rooks said. "(He told me) how blacks weren't good to have (as  tenants) because they knew their rights more than Hispanics who don't have  their green cards, and pay on time."  </P> <P> Black women "with lots of kids in their apartments (who) had welfare checks . .  . and no husbands so they couldn't just move out" were also acceptable tenants,  he said he was told.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Debts Increase  </P> <P> To help repair the apartment building, he took out two new loans and put up his  $300,000 Monterey Park home as collateral. Spitzer told him that other  buildings would become available from time to time if he wanted to take them  over.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, his debts increased and he couldn't keep up with all the repairs on  the building.  </P> <P> "There was a pipe under the building with about 20 patches on it," he said. "It  would have been cheaper in the long run to put in a new pipe." But, he said, he  couldn't get enough cash to do so.  </P> <P> "I asked to lower the (mortgage payment) to fix the building and put it back  into shape. But they wouldn't do it," Rooks said.  </P> <P> The city began prosecuting Rooks for slum violations. He installed new fire  sprinklers required by the city, he claimed. Then, he said, one of Spitzer's  business entities foreclosed and took back the building, claiming he was in  default.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suit Alleges fraud  </P> <P> Rooks is now in court, suing several companies owned by Spitzer and Leyton for  fraud in what he claims was an illegal foreclosure. In court records, Spitzer's  attorneys argue that the case is a straightforward example of a lender  foreclosing on a borrower who didn't pay his debt.  </P> <P> "Finally I figured it all out. . . . I was an employee rather than an owner,"  Rooks said in an interview. "They run the loans up to the market value of the  property. You collect the money and give it all to them. You take all the  punishment. Mr. Spitzer didn't take the (slum) violations, I took 29 counts --  and then after you fix it up, they take it back."  </P> <P> In all, Rooks said, he paid $10,000 in fines for his slum-related violations,  lost his building and nearly lost the home he put up for collateral. His old  building is now owned by another major slum investor who has taken over many of  the buildings financed by Spitzer's A &amp; B Loan Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wonderful Dog'  </P> <P> The president of one of the companies holding a $1-million note on Rooks'  property was one Grover Black. Several sources, including Michael Medved, a  television talk show co-host, said Grover Black was Leyton's dog.  </P> <P> "Grover was a really wonderful dog," Medved said in an interview. "A black  dog."  </P> <P> Grover Black's corporate address was a rental post office box on Wilshire  Boulevard.  </P> <P> According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, there is no Grover  Black licensed to drive in the Los Angeles area. And there is no registered  voter named Grover Black in the area. Asked how to reach Grover Black, Leyton's  attorney, Milton Simon, said: "That's a very good question. I don't know."  Asked to describe him, he answered, "I'd prefer not to." Asked point blank if  Grover is a dog, he answered: "I never met a dog. I don't think I can talk  about this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complicated History  </P> <P> Grover Black is still listed as president of Zimo 5 Inc., an active California  corporation. Zimo 5 transferred one trust deed on the Rooks apartment building  three times in less than one minute, according to attorney Abrams, who said the  real estate history of Rooks' property was the most complicated he had ever  seen.  </P> <P> "The way they tossed this note (loan) around . . . is amazing," Abrams said.  "You never knew from day to day who owned it. . . . They set up companies on  the left hand so they could turn money over to the right hand."  </P> <P> Such transfers are known in the slum trade as "churning."  </P> <P> "There are maybe 300 or 500 unreinforced brick buildings (in Los Angeles) that  are constantly churning," said Louis Scalise, a major investor in such  properties until the mid-1980s, when he said he left the business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clouded Titles  </P> <P> Churning is not real estate as most people know it. Properties get traded  often, sometimes every few months. Occasionally, in a series of preplanned  maneuvers, properties change hands several times within a minute. The  mortgages, too, are sold often, and sometimes used as collateral on other  buildings. Run-down old hotels that would appear to be worth next to nothing  wind up with six, eight, or 10 mortgages. One slum hotel was weighed down with  14 trust deeds.  </P> <P> Title to the buildings becomes so clouded that only the most gullible -- or the  most savvy -- of investors will touch them.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the owners of record, including "straws" who are paid or duped into  taking title, are slapped with code violations, utility bills and taxes. The  noteholder avoids the responsibility and takes in the cash, foreclosing  whenever he wants a new "owner."  </P> <P> A foreclosure sale wipes the slate clean of all debt, and the cycle can start  all over again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Likened to Insider Trading  </P> <P> "Churning is the real estate equivalent of insider trading, a method of  creating tax-free dollars," asserted Bill Wakeland, a former slum task force  member who witnessed it first-hand after he went to work as a consultant fixing  up old buildings.  </P> <P> "They buy distressed property and begin to manipulate its value by selling it  back and forth to each other. After a while, nobody makes payments. It gets  ready to go to foreclosure. Then the lender takes it back and resells it to the  same people under a different name."  </P> <P> Since 1980, when the city attorney's office formed its "slum task force" to  work with fire, health, and building inspectors, officials have seen frequent  transfers of slum buildings.  </P> <P> "Initially when we saw properties changing hands, we thought they were  transfers in avoidance of prosecution (for code violations)," said Deputy City  Atty. Stephanie Sautner, current head of the task force. "Later we realized the  transactions were a means of making a few people a lot of money, that they were  designed to inflate the property and take out all possible equity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cash Attraction  </P> <P> For both the record owner and his financier, the main attraction is cash -- up  to $50,000 a month from old buildings that are crammed with immigrants.  </P> <P> There are probably as many different variations on churning as there are  investors. Most are extremely complicated.  </P> <P> By selling a building often, its value rises artificially, giving investors a  larger tax base to use for depreciating the property and writing off their  large profits.  </P> <P> Scalise said some rents are collected in cash, permitting a further tax dodge.  </P> <P> "You can also say to the IRS that you're taking in $5,000 (a month) and you're  really taking in $20,000, so on paper you have a net loss," Scalise said. "I  never did it. And I really took a lot of money home from these buildings anyway  -- every month."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pecking Order  </P> <P> When the person in control of the building decides it is time for  profit-taking, the record owner is usually so delinquent on his many loans that  the financier can foreclose at will. His companies may hold the first note, the  third and the seventh. If he uses the third note to foreclose, the people who  own the fourth, fifth and sixth notes lose their money.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the buildings fall further and further into decay. The aging,  47-unit building owned by Rooks is an example.  </P> <P> A Leyton-related company submitted into the court record a balance sheet for  one month that it had owned Rooks' building. According to that sheet, the  company took in $13,524 in rents, paid virtually no maintenance costs, and  still listed a net loss.  </P> <P> According to the sheet, $136 was spent for elevator work, $80 for pest control  and zero for "maintenance." More than $9,300 was spent on mortgage payments.  About $2,200 went for overhead fees: "management," "legal," "sales" and "wages  and commissions." With utility costs, the result was a net loss of $949.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Writing Off Losses  </P> <P> Innocent investors write their losses off on their income taxes. And, because  the slum trader may have defaulted on a note held by one of his own companies,  he is probably in a position to write his "loss" off as well.  </P> <P> There is nothing illegal about creating one new company after another.  </P> <P> "There's nothing wrong with creating 100 new companies or 1,000 new companies,"  said Jim Reber, spokesman for the state Franchise Tax Board. "That's perfectly  legal. But if you don't file tax forms, they will be suspended."  </P> <P> Many of Leyton's companies are suspended for failing to file state income tax  returns, the public record shows.  </P> <P> Numerous Leyton-related corporations have filed for bankruptcy. In an apparent  violation of bankruptcy regulations, records show, Leyton failed to disclose to  the court on more than one occasion that he held a major interest in several  companies that previously filed for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flash in the Pan  </P> <P> One such corporation, PHC Finance Inc., was extremely short-lived.  </P> <P> According to state records, PHC Finance was incorporated on Jan. 24, 1985.  According to federal bankruptcy records, however, it "duly held and convened" a  meeting of its board of directors on Jan. 23, 1985 -- the day before it came  into existence. On that day, it decided to declare bankruptcy.  </P> <P> That means it went bankrupt before it was created.  </P> <P> On Jan. 25, it filed for bankruptcy, listing about $250,000 in debts on an  apartment building. Its president, the busy Grover Black, listed as his  "principal place of business" 1800 S. Robertson Blvd., Suite 384.  </P> <P> The "suite" is a rented post office box in a convenience store.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The strategic alliance between Northern Telecom and  Matra Group resulted in new developments concerning the Canadian  company's Meridian autoswitches and Matra's Matracom 6500s.  Envisaged among the joint developments will be the combining of  PABX (private automatic branch exchange) wireless operations and  Matra PABX systems in September, and adopting the QSIG (quality  standard inspection g?) interoperability standard for PABX  systems in early 1994. Differences in ATM strategies will stay  unchanged: Matra is interested in private networks, Northern  Telecom in public ATM networks. However, a common association  will be created for exploiting WAN (wide area network)  communications. For the "private" ATMs, Matra is relying on a  U.S.-produced component, based on a switch that is still under  development. This equipment should connect the Ethernet networks  and the ATM-card-equipped PABX 6500s by way of a 34-MBPS ATM  link.</p>

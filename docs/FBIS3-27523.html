			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb  military leader Ratko Mladic today accused the west of playing  power politics against the Serbs by demanding the opening of  Tuzla airport.    The commander of Bosnian Serb armed forces described this  demand as an attempt to deprive the Serbs of their right to  self-defense.    He told the "Krajina soliders" monthly that Western  countries  want the use of Tuzla airport because they intend to provide the  Bosnian Muslims with large supplies of weapons, ammunition, and  mercenary troops.    At the same time, the military leader said, Serbs are banned  from transporting the wounded, the elderly, and pregnant women.    He pointed out that as a matter of fact, the west does not  need the use of the airport because they are daily shipping in  everything the Muslims need over land routes.    The West's demand that the Tuzla airport be opened is meant  to put pressure on the Serbs, he added.    The Tuzla airport opening can be put on the agenda only when  the opening of a Serbian airport is also discussed, he stressed.    Mladic views the West as trying to shape the world only in  ways that comply with their own interests, saying "they have  torn apart (the former) Yugoslavia, and have been taking every  repressive measure against the resistance of our people. "    On the Sarajevo crisis, the military commander emphasized  that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had no right to  issue the ultimatum against the Serbs, who have not launched war  against anybody.    He criticized Western countries for authorizing themselves  to  decide which country can survive and how long it can live.    Mladic said Serbs will defend themselves if attacked even  though their heavy weapons are under United Nations control.</p>

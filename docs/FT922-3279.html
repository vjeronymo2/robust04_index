			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: Polish treasure - Fine art When young J-L. David was asked in 1780 by a rich, young Polish noble for a portrait, he produced a masterpiece which marked him out as the equal of any artist in Europe. 'Count Stanislaus Potocki' is a vast painting, no less than three metres high, an achievement in the mould of Velasquez or Van Dyck. Unquestionably, it is the jewel of an otherwise less than sparkling exhibition, Treasures of a Polish King, which is now at the Dulwich Picture Gallery. Unless you caught Count Potocki's portrait at the great David show in Paris in 1989, it is definitely worth trying to catch this appealing picture. David's inspiration was to reinterpret the pomp and circumstance of the equestrian portrait with its overtones of antique grandeur, for a fashionable world which had also come to value effects of studied informality. With doffed hat the count courteously greets us, his audience. Every inch the horseman, he sits rock-steady and needs barely to hold the reins, even though his mount is clearly disconcerted by the dog (is it a Dalmatian?) barking beneath its nose. The only touch of red in the canvas is on the dog's collar, placed there to draw attention to the artist's signature. What the photograph cannot convey is the gaiety of the colours. Yellow and white predominate, with eye-catching turquoise for the count's silk sash, his saddle, and the ribbons charmingly twined around his horse's ears and tail. Normally, this portrait hangs in the Wilanow Museum in Warsaw, which the cultivated Potocki himself founded. The exhibition itself is part of a two-way traffic between Poland and the UK: thirty paintings, among them some of Dulwich's most desirable, are now displayed in Warsaw. The idea for the double-exhibition is a nice one, to commemorate the cultural ambitions of a visionary Polish ruler, Stanislaus II Augustus. The Dulwich connection comes about because he had two agents in England, Noel Desenfans and Francis Bourgois, who put together a collection of paintings for his beloved project, a national museum in Warsaw. It took them five years and they lost their shirts on the venture; the king's abdication in 1795 meant the collection stayed in England. It was bequeathed to Dulwich College and in 1811, Sir John Soane's famous gallery was opened as the first public art gallery in the land. Adam Zamoyski's catalogue essay on Stanislav is a triumph, well worth Pounds 6.95. It evokes with real poignancy the rise and fall of this most attaching of Enlightenment rulers. Never go to bed with a Russian, might be the moral of his story. From being the adored lover of Catherine the Great, Stanislaus became a Russian poodle forced to watch first the partition, and then the extinction, of his country. One day no doubt there will be a grand exhibition about Stanislaus, who achieved things of enduring importance for Poland's self-image. However, such a show lies in the future. With the exception of the David portrait, the Dulwich show is distinctly low-key, and in my book a display of embroidered sashes did nothing to cheer it up. Admittedly, this is a chance to see a notable portrait by Mengs of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, the king's cultural guru, also two important views by Bellotto, one of which was used for the reconstruction of Warsaw after the Second World War, and a currently de-attributed Rembrandt portrait. A paltry group of architectural drawings do not go far to convey Stanislav's ambitions to build in a way which would symbolise the monarchy's, and Poland's, resurgence. He imported Neo-Classicism into the royal palaces. It is a pity there is only one drawing by the most distinguished of Stanislaus's foreign proteges; Victor Louis, architect for Port-Royal in Paris and the Grand Theatre in Bordeaux. Not only budgetary problems but political difficulties dogged Stanislaus's building ambitions. Here again, it is Zamoyski's contribution which is memorable. It appears that among the king's many difficulties was the existence of a wondrously daft 16th-century doctrine; Sarmatism. The Polish nobility believed it was descended from the Sarmatians, a barbarian tribe from the Black Sea who swept into Poland in the 6th century. This pleasing doctrine took firm root - small wonder since it taught that because the Polish peasantry were Slavs they were, quite literally, a race apart from their masters. Sarmatic sympathisers liked their architecture 'extravagant and fantastic'. Perhaps it was to appease them that Merlini's delightfully silly elevation for an Academy of Sciences married a pseudo-medieval crenellated tower to an immense classical facade. I found this one of the more memorable things in the exhibition; sad that Merlini was never able to build his hybrid. The journey to Dulwich (in south London) is now easier. Winner of the 1991 Prudential Visual Arts Award, the Picture Gallery has put its winnings into a bus service, running through the day, Tuesdays to Sundays. The service starts at 9.15 am and picks up from the Tate and then the National Gallery: for times ring 081-693-5254. Collections for a King, Royal Castle, Warsaw, ends August 12; Treasures of a Polish King, Dulwich Picture Gallery, ends July 26.</p>

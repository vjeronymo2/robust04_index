			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Bentsen seeks to fend off rate rise Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, yesterday said there was no need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates because inflationary pressures were under control. He spoke as figures from the Commerce Department confirmed a strong recovery in US house building. Housing starts rose 3.9 per cent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43m, the highest level in nearly four years. Building permits - a guide to future construction trends - also rose sharply last month, suggesting the housing market will remain buoyant. The figures for starts are the latest in a series of robust economic statistics pointing to an acceleration of economic growth to an annual rate of about 4.5 per cent this quarter. The faster growth has prompted calls for tighter monetary policy to prevent inflation creeping higher next year. Mr Bentsen said slack labour markets and excess industrial capacity had created a favourable inflation outlook. Earlier this week President Bill Clinton told the Fed it would be a 'mistake' to raise rates. Many economists believe the pace of economic growth will decline to about 3 per cent early next year because consumer spending has run ahead of personal incomes.</p>

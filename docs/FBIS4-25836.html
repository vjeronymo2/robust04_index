			<p>BFN     [Text] Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the provincial party  committee, and Governor Zhu Senlin met with a delegation of  persons in charge of the Hong Kong newspaper WEN WEI PO in  Guangzhou yesterday. Zhu Senlin gave an interview to the guests.    At the meeting, Xie Fei pointed out: We hope that Hong Kong  will have a smooth transition in 1997. Stability and prosperity  are in the interests of both Hong Kong and the mainland as they  have identical interests.    Zhu Senlin remarked: In the last 15 years of reform and  opening up to the outside world, Guangdong and Hong Kong have  established very close ties. He maintained that Guangdong and  Hong Kong can complement each other using their own strong  points. In the days to come, they can open up new avenues of  cooperation in two ways: One is that Guangdong and Hong Kong  can join hands to develop the international market and the other  way is that in finance, Hong Kong's strong point as a financial  center should be utilized to do an ever better job of raising  funds. This will help to raise funds promptly for Guangdong's  economic construction and provide support in funds for the  province's effort to set up enterprises abroad.</p>

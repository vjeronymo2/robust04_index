			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 4 (AFP) -- Cambodia's Khmer Rouge  [KR] guerrillas said Wednesday that they would accept a  ceasefire proposed by the king, but called previous ceasefire  proposals "poisonous tricks" aimed at destroying them.    King Norodom Sihanouk, speaking to an audience of monks at  the Royal Palace, said he had received the long letter from  Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan which criticized  previous ceasefire calls while at the same time saying the king  had a good idea.    "He did not say clearly whether or not he supports my  proposal," King Sihanouk complained.    The letter released here said the king's proposal was a good  one and that the Khmer Rouge fully support it. But it warned  that the previous ceasefires proposed by the Cambodian  government as a precondition for peace talks are "poisonous  tricks they used repeatedly" to get the guerrillas to stop  fighting so that government troops could capture more Khmer  Rouge territory.    It also pointed to the failure of the ceasefire dictated by  the 1991 Paris peace accords, formally ending Cambodia's civil  war and bringing a UN peacekeeping operation to Cambodia to  maintain the peace.    The United Nations blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of the  ceasefire violations during its 18-month mandate in Cambodia.  The war, still continuing primarily in the northwest, has caused  60,000 refugees to flee their homes.    "Phnom Penh is a place in the hands of the Vietnamese  communists, the entente, the Vietnamese puppets and the  two-headed (Cambodian) government, all of whom have a policy to  destroy (us) permanently," Khieu Samphan wrote.    "Therefore, a ceasefire or a non-ceasefire depends on the  situation," he said.    "The Vietnamese communists do not need a ceasefire, do not  need national reconciliation, unity and peace."    Khieu Samphan said he hoped peace talks also proposed by the  king could be organized abroad as soon as possible. The  Cambodian government has agreed to go to North Korea for the  talks, but only if the ceasefire is complete.    The Khmer Rouge maintain that Cambodia remains occupied by  the Vietnamese, who invaded to oust the Khmer Rouge regime in  1978 and ruled Phnom Penh for a decade.</p>

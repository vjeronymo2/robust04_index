			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Foued Allani: "Aid to Needy Families: A Program </F> Deserving Support"]    [Text] Covering 101,000 families since 1992, the National  Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN) has distributed an  average of 250 dinars[D] per family per year, i.e., 178 percent  more than in 1987.    Created in 1986, the PNAFN was designed to help needy  families living below the poverty level and whose purchasing  power may deteriorate now that staple product prices are being  adjusted.    This program "is part of the auxiliary measures provided  under the economic recovery plan in order to alleviate the  social impact of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) on poor  populations, living below the poverty level."    Thus, in 1986 and 1992, the PNAFN spent as much as D93.834  millions, and projected 1993 expenditures alone amounted to  D26.26 millions.    According to a Ministry of Social Affairs survey of 61,000  heads of households covered by this program, the recipients are  as follows:     -  57 percent are women;    -  52 percent are over 60;    -  17.5  percent are handicapped;    -  3 percent are covered by Social  Security;    -  18 percent had a paying job at the time of the survey  (15.2 percent on construction sites, 4.5 percent in agriculture,  and 1 percent in services).    That last figure, according to the speaker, reflected one of  the inadequacies of the programs, which suffers from some  problems in targeting recipients.    Therefore, since 10 May 1993, the ministry has undertaken an  exhaustive survey of the 101,000 families covered by the program  and of another 59,000 families eligible for aid, in order to  update and overhaul the program and set up local, regional, and  central files on poverty.    Since that program alone is not adequate to ensure the  social  advancement of needy families, the Ministry of Social Affairs  believes that it must be supported by additional efforts. For  his part, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of  Social Affairs, made the following suggestions:     -  "To make all participants aware of the social dimension of  any development efforts, and to improve the identification  capacity of social advancement projects."    -  "To finance social  advancement programs essentially through solidarity (private  efforts, especially foundations and non-governmental  organizations)."    -  "To associate nongovernment organizations to  the application and management of social advancement projects."    -  "To adopt a consensual approach as to which indicators are to  be used by the various participants."</p>

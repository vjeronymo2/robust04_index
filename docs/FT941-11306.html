			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: JCI lifts interim payout after 8% advance Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, the South African platinum and gold-mining group with significant diamond trading and industrial interests, has reported an 8 per cent improvement in pre-tax profit to R179.6m (Dollars 52.6m) in the half-year to December 31 from R165.7m a year earlier. The interim dividend is increased for the first time since 1989, up nearly 10 per cent to 46 cents a share. Sharply improved contributions from JCI's gold mines offset mixed fortunes at its platinum, coal and base metal businesses, which were hit by poor commodity prices. The mining house continued to rely on its industrial interests for the lion's share of its income, largely through minority stakes in the strongly-performing foods supplier Premier Group and South African Breweries. After-tax profit rose to R165.5m from R155.6m, after an increase in tax provisions to R14.1m from R10.1m. However, earnings at the equity accounted level climbed more than 10 per cent to R194.9m, as the group's share of earnings from associate companies jumped to R31.1m from R20.9m. Currency costs incurred with JCI's decision in 1993 to increase its interest in Minerais, a Luxembourg-based metals trading company, led to a R10.4m extraordinary charge taken below the line.</p>

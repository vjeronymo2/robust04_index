			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN END TO CHARITY  </P> <P> In their Nov. 5 letters, Elizabeth Gaines and John Termini expressed disgust at  the treatment of animals in the filming of "The Bear." I agree completely with  them.  </P> <P> I was glad to learn from an editorial note at the end of their letters that the  Fund for Animals and the Wildlife Fund had endorsed this film; I am now closing  the trust funds I have established for each of these supposedly humane groups.  I regret that for 30 years I have contributed generously to both.  </P> <P> I have been in the motion-picture industry for 40 years and have witnessed the  way humane officers are dealt with on sets. The film makers simply tell him or  her to "take a walk" when they plan a cruel shot, so the humane officer does  not see it.  </P> <P> E. L. FULLERTON  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

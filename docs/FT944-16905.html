			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Worms helped by 44% rise at subsidiaries Worms, the French holding company, yesterday reported consolidated profits of FFr381m (Dollars 72.15m) for the first half of 1994, compared with FFr362m in the first half of last year. The contribution from the parent company was down to FFr11m from FFr106m. The reduction was offset by a 44 per cent increase in profits from subsidiaries, which jumped to FFr370m against FFr256m last time. Turnover at Athena Assurance, its insurance subsidiary, rose 11 per cent to FFr8.1bn, giving a profit of FFr277m against FFr217m. Largest growth came from increased life assurance business. Profits at Demachy Worms, the group's banking holding, fell to FFr30m from FFr44m, which it said was explained by provisions in a subsidiary in relation to the declining financial markets. Compagnie Nationale de Navigation, its shipping unit, posted a loss of FFr69m compared with FFr41m.</p>

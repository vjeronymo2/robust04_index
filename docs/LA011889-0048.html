			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P>  The Price Co., the San Diego-based operator of 41 Price Club discount  warehouses, plans to distribute dividend-paying preferred shares to its common  stockholders, the company said at its annual shareholders meeting Tuesday in  Phoenix.  </P> <P> Subject to approval by shareholders and federal regulators, the distribution as  planned would be one share of preferred stock for each five shares of common  stock owned, or about 9.9 million preferred shares.  </P> <P> Each share would pay an annual dividend of $2.50 per share of preferred.  </P> <P> Chief executive Robert Price said payment of the dividends are subject to  certain profit goals of the company but unpaid dividends would cumulate for  subsequent payment.  </P> <P> The distribution itself will probably not be taxable to shareholders, although  cash dividends on the preferred will be taxable as would sale of the preferred  shares, Price said.  </P> <P> Price said the creation of the preferred stock "effectively separates  participation in an annual yield from participation in the ongoing future of  the company."  </P> <P> "Many of our shareholders have wanted us to pay a dividend for some time,"  Price said in a prepared statement. "But we have long felt that a common stock  dividend was not appropriate for a growth company like ours. This procedure  will provide for the equivalent of an annual dividend of 50 cents per common  share, but shareholders who aren't interested in a dividend can sell the  preferred and keep the common stock."  </P> <P> A special shareholders meeting to vote on the stock issue will probably be held  in March with the distribution, if approved, to follow in late March or April,  Price said.  </P> <P> Price Co. stock closed up $.75 at $38.75 a share in over-the-counter trading  Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTWOOD;  </P> <P> GROUPS SPONSOR ART SHOW  </P> <P> A coalition of Westwood merchants, homeowners, UCLA and the Hammer Museum are  planning a fine arts show to replace the traditional Los Angeles Business  Council-sponsored show pushed out of the village and into Westwood Park last  summer amid complaints that it was too big and tacky.  </P> <P> According to Scott Regberg, president of the Westwood Village Merchants Assn.,  the show, set for June 2-3, will be strictly limited to fine artists.  </P> <P> There will be no booths featuring clothing, jewelry or other works generally  considered crafts, Regberg said. Craft booths were a major component of the  traditional fair that was held on the streets of Westwood for 20 years but  moved to Westwood Park last fall.  </P> <P> The merchants' group spearheaded opposition to the traditional semiannual arts  and crafts fair, complaining that it had grown so large it was hurting business  by blocking people's entry.  </P> <P> The merchants and homeowner groups were also critical of what they called the  show's "tacky" quality, which they contended did not attract the upscale crowd  they sought.  </P> <P> Because property owners have to agree before the city permits a street to be  closed, the merchants were able to prevail.  </P> <P> When her show was under fire, Los Angeles Business Council President Dori Pye  said the merchants and homeowners agenda was to mount their own show.  </P> <P> Regberg said in a telephone interview that his group had tried to persuade Pye  to scale down her event and upgrade the art but that she refused. He said that  he does not expect profits, but that if there are any they will be used for  community upgrades.  </P></p>

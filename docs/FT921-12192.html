			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Plan for Pounds 350m freight park on PowerGen site POWERGEN, the electricity generator, plans to turn the site of a coal-fired power station into a Pounds 350m freight park. The station, Hams Hall in Coleshill, Warwickshire, is still active, but due to close this year as part of the company's strategy of replacing coal stations with gas plant. The freight park, to be built on part of the 800-acre site, would include a link to the Channel tunnel and handle more than 1m tonnes of freight a year. The proposed development is a joint venture with Trafalgar House Business Parks. PowerGen has not yet decided what it will do with the station and the land it occupies. Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, recently proposed that PowerGen and National Power, the other large generator, should offer power stations for sale when they close them down to allow competition a chance to enter the electricity market.</p>

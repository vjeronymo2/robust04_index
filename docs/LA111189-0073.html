			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMAGE DOCTOR TAKES VIDEO CHARIOTS TO VILLAGERS;  </P> <P> INDIA: VANS WITH BIG SCREENS, CASSETTES MAKE A POWERFUL IMPRESSION. THEIR  INVENTOR SEES A WAY TO GARNER VOTES.  </P> <P> The first time DrK. Jain's Video Chariots came blaring into the remote,  backward villages of south India earlier this year, many in his largely  illiterate audience thought they were watching black magic.  </P> <P> The villagers had no electricity. They still made furrows in the fields with  their bare feet, and their idea of irrigation was praying to the Hindu rain  god. Many had never even heard of television, and, certainly, none knew a TV  screen could be the size of a truck.  </P> <P> Yet suddenly, right in the heart of their own village of dust and straw, there  was Dr. Jain's sleek, Japanese-built van, opening up to reveal an  eight-foot-square screen, back-lit by a high-powered 600-lumen projector,  attached to a state-of-the-art videocassette player and powered by its own  portable generator.  </P> <P> The program for the night: politics -- specifically, an entertaining campaign  video in their own local dialect that is part of a high-tech, electoral  revolution taking place in the largest democracy on earth.  </P> <P> It is the latest wrinkle that reflects Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's  five-year effort to transform ancient and moribund India into a modern state --  "to fuse," as Gandhi pledged when he took power five years ago, "the wisdom of  our seers with the insights and artifacts of science and technology. To build  an India of the 21st Century."  </P> <P> But, with a passionate personal dislike for the prime minister and more than 30  video chariots to carry his message home, Jain is using his ultra-modern  recording studio in New Delhi and his mobile image machines in ways that may  not be exactly what Gandhi had in mind.  </P> <P> As campaigning began nationwide this week for the most hotly contested and  unpredictable general elections in Indian history, Jain has launched his own  campaign to turn Gandhi's high-tech revolution against him.  </P> <P> Using a computerized collage of what he calls "electronic posters,"  "psychedelic symbolism" and "a cheerful revolution of high technology," Jain, a  surgeon turned image-maker, is providing India's now largely unified political  opposition with an alternative to Gandhi's own video campaign on the powerful,  state-run national television network and taking that message to rich rural  vote banks where not even government television can reach.  </P> <P> "The government has a monopoly on television in this country," Jain said. "But  technology is nobody's monopoly. And what we are offering, no television  network in the world can: portable theaters that can target captive markets  right in their own back yards."  </P> <P> On the surface, Jain's video campaign -- and indeed, Gandhi's own slick, video  assault -- appear to be something of a mutation from the progressive prime  minister's original high-tech vision.  </P> <P> When the then-largely apolitical Gandhi was swept to power on a sympathy wave  after his mother's assassination in 1984, he pledged to use high-tech as a tool  of development, not politics; to harness satellites and computers for locating  underground drinking water, not for identifying hidden vote banks; for  immunizing millions of children, not politicizing millions of voters.  </P> <P> In fact, Gandhi's Administration has used advanced technology successfully to  help rural India. His high-tech initiatives have doubled the success rate for  finding and digging drinking wells. They have helped to cushion the country's  830 million people against a devastating drought two years ago. They have  brought life-saving vaccines to millions in remote regions. And they have  vastly improved India's telecommunications system, once among the world's  worst.  </P> <P> But such advances have not made much of an impression on a campaign full of  such sexy political issues as corruption, religious communalism and rising  prices, and the technology through which they were achieved is still at several  removes from the Indian masses.  </P> <P> To Sam Pitroda, Gandhi's American-trained high-technology guru, the failure has  not been in the government's use of technology, but in the presentation of it.  </P> <P> "We have mismanaged the concept of high-tech," said Pitroda, who gave up his  U.S. citizenship to join Gandhi as his personal adviser on technology five  years ago. "Whenever we talk of high technology, we assume it is urban, elite,  foreign, exotic, fancy and sexy. We don't project the image that technology is  just for problem-solving. And, really, that's all it is."  </P> <P> As a result, the Indian public has equated Gandhi's high-tech boom with  computer toys, electronic gadgetry and video-cassette recorders, all of which  have taken the Indian middle class by storm but remain far out of the reach of  rural villages, where as many as 80% of all Indians live.  </P> <P> Referring specifically to Jain and his video-on-wheels enterprise, Pitroda  smiled and said, "That's only petty, little stuff. High-tech isn't just TV.  </P> <P> "But this is the price you pay in a democracy. With a lot of good, some misuses  are bound to go on."  </P> <P> Obviously, that is not the way Jain sees his multimillion-dollar enterprise.  </P> <P> In fact, he said, Jain Studios also entered the world of high technology  initially to help open the doors of development to his backward nation. But, in  the overly politicized and polarized context of today's India, not even  technology has been spared. Jain insisted that he was locked out of access to  the mass media.  </P> <P> "I first got involved in all of this because I wanted to go into medical  television," he said. "I produced videos aimed at the illiterate villagers on  family planning, sanitation, primary health care and similar subjects.  </P> <P> "I had hoped to sell these videos to Doordarshan (India's state-run television  network). But they sort of black-listed me."  </P> <P> Jain is a long-standing, ranking member of the opposition Bharatiya Janata  Party (Indian People's Party), and he claims his videos were blocked simply  because of his strong and outspoken political affiliation. So he charted a  course of high-tech revenge.  </P> <P> "I said we should make better videos and even better programming than  Doordarshan and target them to specific districts," he said.  </P> <P> Jain and his wife went on intensive buying trips to Japan and America, and,  under Gandhi's liberalized import policy for technology, Jain built his  state-of-the-art studio here, complete with 3-D computer graphics machines,  dozens of editing and display consoles and a staff of 400 engineers, among them  a core group of young, American-trained computer hackers.  </P> <P> Still, Jain is the first to concede that his video chariots will have little  nationwide impact on the upcoming elections. In a sprawling nation of more than  100 dialects and 400 million voters that more resembles a continent than a  country, the image doctor hopes only to sway key, critical races where the  opposition has hired his services.  </P> <P> "I have only made an idea become a reality," he said. "And regardless of the  outcome of the election, win or lose, I really hope only that this experiment  will lead to a more productive use of the technology.  </P> <P> "I have, for example, about 20 family planning videos that have never been  shown. They're based on folklore and traditional music, combined with  state-of-the-art computer graphics. I know they will work. And, well, maybe if  the opposition comes to power, perhaps I can even get them on the air someday."  </P></p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / People: George Cox to take on Unisys Unisys, the US-based information technology group, has appointed George Cox as chief executive of its UK subsidiary in succession to John Perry, who has taken early retirement for personal reasons. Cox, 54, is currently chairman of P-E International, the management consultancy. His appointment marks a further stage in Unisys's transformation from a traditional computer manufacturer selling mainframe and minicomputers to an information management company offering a broad range of computing services. Cox will report to Malcolm Coster, who was appointed president of Unisys Europe-Africa earlier this year. Coster was formerly head of international business development at the management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The transformation of Unisys, now trading profitably after several years of losses, is credited to James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, who has been seeking top management consultants to run strategic areas of the business. Cox was a co-founder with David Butler of Butler-Cox, based in London, which was sold to Computer Sciences Corporation in 1992. He became head of P-E International where he worked on focusing the company's development, cutting away non-core activities and improving its financial strength. Last year he negotiated a merger with Cray Electronics of the UK. Cos says his immediate job is to develop a marketing approach to help establish Unisys's new image with the public; most of the restructuring has been done; drastic action is not required.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / DUP rejoins talks on Ulster's future THE Democratic Unionist party yesterday resumed its place at the talks on Northern Ireland's political future. The Rev Ian Paisley, DUP leader, joined Irish and British government representatives and delegations from the Ulster Unionists, Social Democratic and Labour party and Alliance parties at the Stormont talks. It was not clear how long he would stay after boycotting last week's three-day session in Dublin because sufficient priority had not been given to the issue of the Irish government's constitutional claim over the province.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  LET'S EAT OUT: ADRIANO: EVEN THE DAILY SPECIALS CAN BE SPECIAL  </P> <P> Adriano Ristorante in Santa Ana gives a feeling of warmth and sureness the  moment you enter. And the waitress was not too far off when she claimed,  "Everything we serve is wonderful," and, she could add, a good value.  </P> <P> Janina Musci, owner and hostess, sets the tone with her friendly greeting, her  inquiry: "Is this your first time here? How did you hear about us?" And on my  second visit, she said, "Nice to see you again." You can sense the teamwork in  this restaurant, where service is friendly and attentive. (Yes, they could and  did time dinner so we'd get to the not-too-distant Performing Arts Center on  time.)  </P> <P> In addition, Adriano, hidden away in the Target shopping center, looks pretty,  with its pink lace curtains, burgundy carpet, chairs and canopies over the  espresso bar and kitchen opening. Pastel murals of the Italian countryside  soften the walls, and fresh flowers brighten cloth-covered tables.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Something Special  </P> <P> Almost everything we tried from the regular menu was good, though I'd mark down  the calzone, which was slightly burned. But the samplings from the day's  specials were special. (Chef Tony Musci, Janina's husband, was born in Bari on  the Adriatic coast of Italy, but he creates both northern and southern  cuisine.) Clams with linguine starred fresh steamers, tender and sweet; the  sauce was flavorful with broth, plus a pleasant hotness and a hint of Pernod.  </P> <P> Fresh salmon, sauteed and served with fresh tomatoes, capers, green onions and  a touch of rosemary, made such a hit with our resident 10-year-old gourmet that  he was reluctant to give the rest of us a sample. A fork easily cut the veal  medallions, delectably crowned with baby asparagus, pimiento and mushrooms.  Rigatoni with a delicate cream sauce enhanced both dishes.  </P> <P> Other popular specials include a Milanese-style osso buco, fettuccine with  scampi in a creamy sauce and a lightly breaded boneless chicken breast topped  with fresh spinach, provolone cheese and a light mushroom-wine sauce.  </P> <P> The house salad is crisp and fresh, if not remarkable, but the insalata  Adriano, brimming with romaine, artichokes, mozzarella, mushrooms and black  olives, is almost a meal.  </P> <P> There is a lot more to consider on Adriano's menu, from some 20 pastas  (including two gnocchi dishes) to homemade sausage in wine and tomato sauce, 11  different pizzas and the more predictable chicken and veal dishes.  </P> <P> Prices top out at $16.95 for dinners, which include salad or soup (a comforting  chicken with tortellini on both my visits). Hot, crusty rolls can't compete  with Tony's own focaccia, which proved addictive for our children and myself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homemade Tiramisu  </P> <P> Of the desserts, which include a respectable cheese cake, only the tiramisu is  homemade. It's served pudding style, heavy on the Amaretto, and arrived at the  table frozen. As it thawed, the flavors balanced better.  </P> <P> A better choice to top off dinner, I think, is a frothy cappuccino, available  decaffeinated, nicely topped with chocolate and cinnamon, served with a crisp  wafer.  </P> <P> At lunchtime, specials of fresh pasta, veal, chicken and fresh seafood, $7.95  to $10.95, supplement the regular menu. There's a small wine list with Pinot  Grigio and Chianti available by the glass.  </P> <P> Tony and Janina, who were partners in D'Angelo's in Laguna Hills, opened  Adriano Ristorante a year ago. A few months ago they doubled its size --  obviously a wise move, because they had a full house the Thursday I was there.  </P> <P>  Adriano Ristorante, 3314 S. Bristol, Santa Ana; (714) 957-6909.

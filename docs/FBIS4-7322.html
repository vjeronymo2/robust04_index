			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 24 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The center of the  Mongolian capital today witnessed a major antigovernment  demonstration for the second day running. According to various  sources, between 3,000 and 5,000 citizens took part in it. The  demonstrators, chanting slogans demanding the resignation of the  Cabinet of Prime Minister [Puntsaqiyn] Jasray, have blocked the  entrances to the building where the government is sitting. In  view of the peaceful nature of the demonstration, the security  forces units that came to the square have not interfered.    The latest demonstration in central Ulaanbaatar has become  yet another move in the campaign of pressure exerted by the  opposition on the government which its opponents call "corrupt."  Active protests began two weeks ago when several dozens of  mainly young Mongols went on a hunger strike, not expecting,  according to them, to achieve their aim -- to make the  government surrender -- by other means. However, while the  conflict developed those on a hunger strike inclined toward a  compromise, trying to achieve not the resignation of, but only a  meeting with, the prime minister. They also want to receive  from the government a document promising to carry out effective  socioeconomic reforms. Among the demands is the need for  decisive measures in the fight against crime and inadmissibility  of the further impoverishment of the population.    According to Jasray, head of the Mongolian Government, he  has  no reason to resign. Meanwhile, an official investigation has  been started into the accusations of corruption made by the  opposition. Mongolian legislators appeared alongside government  officials in them. Competent bodies promise to finish the  investigation within two weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by Ute </F> Bruessel; place and date not given: "Mr. Ruehe, What Will  Happen With the Bundeswehr?"]    [Text] [Bruessel] Mr. Ruehe, how many soldiers will the  Bundeswehr have in the future?    [Ruehe] My precisely formulated proposal has been presented.  In it, I concretely mention a reduction to 340,000 men, whose  number, however, can be increased to an internationally  stipulated maximum strength of 370,000 men in the structures.    [Bruessel] Will military service be reduced to 10 months?    [Ruehe] We want to differentiate here. For service in the  main defense forces, a compact basic military service of 10  months without service compensation time like in France is  useful and sufficient. However, for voluntary service in the  crisis-reaction forces, at least 12 months are required.    [Bruessel] Will the Bundeswehr still be operational in the  future?    [Ruehe] Only with my approach will we get the financial  scope for the strengthening and modernization of the armed  forces.    [Bruessel] Does Chancellor Kohl approve of your concept?    [Ruehe] I discussed my ideas with the chancellor at a very  early stage, and we agree on the outlines of the Bundeswehr's  further development.</p>

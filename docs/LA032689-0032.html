			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THREE MILE ISLAND;  </P> <P> CONFLICTING REPORTS STOKED FEAR IN NUCLEAR ACCIDENT;  </P> <P> CONFIDENCE IN AUTHORITIES EVAPORATED DURING CRUCIAL 7 DAYS OF DOUBT  </P> <P> By the fourth day of the Three Mile Island accident, a stream of conflicting  statements was in full torrent.  </P> <P> The power company was saying the crisis was over, but the company had lost its  credibility.  </P> <P> Minutes later, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned that a hydrogen bubble  in the reactor was potentially explosive and blocked efforts to cool the  uranium core.  </P> <P> The NRC in Washington said the bubble could reach an inflammable stage within  five days.  </P> <P> NRC officials at the scene said that detonation would be impossible for at  least nine days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disjointed Information  </P> <P> It took seven days to get a clear story from all involved. By the time the NRC  confirmed that the hydrogen bubble was gone and gave a plain account of what  had happened, everything that had gone before seemed disjointed.  </P> <P> Scores of reporters, carrying radiation detection badges with their pads and  pens, rushed the office of Gov. Dick Thornburgh. "They were no longer  interested in the story. They feared for their own safety," Paul Critchlow,  then an aide to the governor, recalled.  </P> <P> Reporters by trade are detached observers, but during the nation's worst  commercial nuclear accident, they were as personally involved as the people who  lived in the shadows of the huge, hourglass-shaped towers.  </P> <P> The vanguard of a press invasion about 400 strong came from the state capital,  Harrisburg, 10 miles away, where a new governor was in his 71st day of office  and the Legislature was debating the sorry condition of the state's roads.  </P> <P> Three Mile Island overwhelmed everyone. Reporters found themselves trying to  cover a nightmare of confounding technology, contradictions, feverish emotions  and limited access to information.  </P> <P> The near-calamity lacked any visual evidence. There were no flames, funnel  clouds, floodwaters or wreckage. The most popular photograph was of the huge,  concrete cooling towers. Reporters had to learn quickly about the extremely  complex workings of a nuclear-powered generator.  </P> <P> At 4 a.m. on March 28, 1979 -- a Wednesday -- Three Mile Island was working  like a giant tea kettle, producing steam for electricity from its reactor. Then  a balky valve caused two pumps to shut off, halting a steam turbine and  interrupting the chain reaction within the reactor.  </P> <P> As 100 tons of uranium sizzled in the heat of decay, a pressure-relief valve  opened and the emergency cooling system flooded the reactor with water. But the  valve stuck and stayed open for two hours, draining vital coolant water and  letting radiation escape into the air.  </P> <P> The operators checked a faulty gauge and mistakenly shut off the emergency  cooling system. The core was uncovered and the top half of it melted. A bubble  of hydrogen formed.  </P> <P> Still, no one had a clue as to what was going on.  </P> <P> There was nothing in the operators' manuals about a bubble. It was as if they  had been given history books to study for an algebra test. A computer used to  measure core temperatures spit out only question marks, the machine's  equivalent of scratching its head.  </P> <P> The nuclear power industry, which touted its product as cleaner than coal and  cheaper than oil, had bragged that such an accident could never happen.  Metropolitan Edison Co., the plant's operator at the time, downplayed the  gravity of the situation.  </P> <P> The first word from Metropolitan Edison came from its headquarters in Reading,  55 miles away. "There have been no recordings of any significant levels of  radiation, and none are expected off site," Blaine Fabian, spokesman for the  utility, said.  </P> <P> At 11 a.m., Lt. Gov. William Scranton III told reporters: "Everything is under  control." As he spoke, unknown to him or the reporters, radioactive steam was  escaping from the plant.  </P> <P> An angry Scranton returned at 4:30 p.m. to say: "Metropolitan Edison has been  giving you and us conflicting information."  </P> <P> Later, when he was asked why reporters had not been told about the leak,  Metropolitan Edison Vice President Jack Herbein said: "They didn't ask."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rosy Statements  </P> <P> The power company wasn't alone in making rosy statements. A Nuclear Regulatory  Commission staffer said that the accident "wasn't close to a catastrophe."  </P> <P> The next day, Metropolitan Edison President Walter Creitz said the plant had  been safely shut down. In reality, it was still leaking radioactivity and  remained stubbornly hot.  </P> <P> All trust disintegrated with a new burst of radiation Friday, and the public  was prompted to flee a nuclear accident for the first time.  </P> <P> Mothers left dishes in the sink and clothes in the washer after Thornburgh  advised that pregnant women and young children should not remain within five  miles of the plant. In Harrisburg, an unauthorized Civil Defense signal wailed  eerily.  </P> <P> "We are operating almost totally in the blind," NRC Chairman Joseph Hendrie  said that morning. "It's like a couple of blind  </P> <P> men staggering around making decisions."  </P> <P> A reporter on the story could attend a Metropolitan Edison news conference at  American Legion Post 594, head down the street to hear the NRC's report, then  drive back to Harrisburg to get the state's version.  </P> <P> At one of these antsy sessions, with reporters standing on chairs and shouting  questions, Herbein said: "I don't know why we need to tell you each and every  thing we do."  </P> <P> Desperate for information, Gov. Thornburgh turned to President Jimmy Carter and  the White House sent in Harold Denton of the NRC. Denton's Southern drawl and  knowledge of reactors helped to soothe nerves. The White House also put a gag  order on Metropolitan Edison, so that only one story would come out. On Sunday,  President Carter visited the area to reassure a jumpy populace, while  technicians worked to eliminate the bubble.  </P> <P> The next day, Metropolitan Edison said the bubble was gone. A company official  had to repeat the news over the phone to four reporters before they felt  comfortable with the information. On Tuesday, the NRC confirmed that the bubble  was gone. Six days later, the agency declared the crisis to be over.  </P> <P> There were interviews with jittery residents who had hung radiation detectors  on their back yard shrubbery.  </P> <P> In a quiet rural area where Amish farmers still use horses to pull plows,  Middletown Mayor Robert Reid ordered the police to shoot looters.  </P> <P> A church service in the Susquehanna River town of Goldsboro drew just four  worshipers, along with a reporter and two photographers.  </P> <P> Then came the salt and pepper shakers shaped liked the cooling towers, signs in  stores of "We don't sell Pennsylvania milk," and weather jokes about it being  partly cloudy with a 40% chance of survival.  </P> <P> The swarm of out-of-town media found this note from the locals in the newsroom  of the state Capitol:  </P> <P> "If you must go out on the streets of Harrisburg and see they are dark and  empty, this is not -- repeat, not -- because of the accident at Three Mile  Island. That's the way they always are."  </P></p>

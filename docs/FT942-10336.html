			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / People: Des Wilson takes off for Heathrow BAA, the privatised UK airports operator, is enlisting Des Wilson, one of the country's most experienced lobbyists, to strengthen its hand in the public inquiry over the company's controversial plans to build a fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport. A former president of the Liberal Party and the party's campaign director in the 1992 general election, Wilson founded Shelter, the national campaign for the homeless, as well as a former chairman of Friends of the Earth UK and ran CLEAR, which campaigned for lead-free petrol. He is currently vice-chairman, public affairs, worldwide, of Burson-Marsteller, one of the leading international public relations firms. He has also been a columnist for the Guardian and Observer, a deputy editor on the Illustrated London News, and head of public affairs for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Wilson will join BAA at a time when the airports operator is preparing itself to fight a long and difficult planning inquiry for the construction of Heathrow's fifth terminal estimated at between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m. The inquiry is expected to start in spring 1995 and to last about three years. BAA claims the new terminal is critical for the future of Heathrow, the world's busiest international passenger airport and one of the most congested. Wilson is appointed director of corporate and public affairs and will become a member of BAA's top management team reporting to chief executive Sir John Egan; he joins in September on completion of Burson-Marsteller's recently won contract to re-launch the TUC, and replaces Terry Morgan who next week becomes managing director of BAA's Stansted airport.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Miramar Hotel joint bid lapses BEIJING-controlled Citic Pacific and Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong have conceded defeat in their joint HKDollars 9.65bn (USDollars 1.24bn) bid for Miramar Hotel and Investment. The offer, which lapsed on Friday, received acceptances equal to only 13.7 per cent of the company's shares and 9.2 per cent of its warrants. The result of the bid for Miramar, which owns property assets on the Kowloon peninsula, was a rare defeat for Mr Li and Mr Larry Yung, head of Citic in Hong Kong. Henderson Investment, another Hong Kong property group, sealed the fate of the joint bid after it bought a 35 per cent stake in Miramar from its founders and gave little indication that it wanted to deal with Mr Li and Mr Yung.</p>

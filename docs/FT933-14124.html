			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel market likely to overcome current problems, analysts say ABOUT one-quarter of the western world's primary nickel capacity is suffering losses at present London Metal Exchange prices, according to the AME Mineral Economics consultancy group. However, AME and other analysts suggest that longer-term prospects for nickel are good, despite the short-term problems. The outlook 'is probably better than for any of the other major base metals, with the possible exception of aluminium', says Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Commenting on the immediate outlook, Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, suggests in its latest nickel report that prices are likely to drift down to Dollars 4,800 a tonne or Dollars 2.18 a pound. That is because the rate of exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States can be expected to increase but production of stainless steel, the biggest consumer of nickel, is likely to fall in the second half of 1993 after a strong first-half rise of 5 per cent. AME points out that at Dollars 2.60 a lb - the price at the end of 1992 - seven of the production units it monitors would have been operating at a cash break-even point or worse. According to AME, the highest-cost operators in 1992 were the Brazilian ferronickel producers with cash costs of Dollars 3.56-Dollars 4.01 a lb, followed by Larco in Greece at Dollars 3.45 and Societe Metallurgique le Nickel's Sandouville refinery in France at Dollars 3.00. Glenbrook's Riddle operation in the US had cash costs of Dollars 2.78, and those at Empress Nickel's Eiffel Flats refinery in Zimbabwe were Dollars 2.70. Costs at Queensland Nickel's Yabulu operation in Australia were Dollars 2.56 a lb. The lowest-cost product was nickel oxide from the Matsuzuka refinery in Japan at Dollars 1.14 a lb. The refinery was supplied by Inco's Ontario mines and the Copper Cliff smelter. Among the big producers, the lowest-cost producers last year were Western Mining in Australia with estimated cash costs of Dollars 1.60; Inco's Canadian Thompson smelter at Dollars 1.71 and Copper Cliff at Dollars 2.06; and Clydach UK at Dollars 2.23. Falconbridge of Canada, at Dollars 2.10, was the highest-cost producer among the five big producers. AME's study predicts that refined nickel output in the western world should bottom out at 550,000 tonnes this year, after 592,000 tonnes in 1992. Demand is expected to rise to 630,000 tonnes this year, up from 617,000 tonnes. Analysts believe net imports to the west from the eastern bloc - mainly from Russia but also from Cuba - will continue at a relatively high level. AME suggests those imports will total 95,000 tonnes this year, down from 112,000 tonnes. In its latest study of the nickel market, Billiton points out that new imports from the eastern bloc accounted for 18 per cent of total consumption in 1991 and 1992. 'While we believe that, for a variety of reasons, exports from the CIS to the west will decline over the next few years, we nevertheless conclude that they will remain substantial in volume for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, exports from the west to China will probably continue to increase. On balance, however, the west will remain a significant net importer of nickel.' Billiton says primary nickel production in the west will fall by 30,000 tonnes from its 1992 record of 595,000 tonnes but, because of the imports, a supply surplus will remain. Billiton forecasts an average price of Dollars 2.60 a lb for 1993, Dollars 3.25 for next year and Dollars 4.00 for 1995. Rudolf Wolff expects CIS exports to be about 80,000 tonnes this year and to lead to a supply surplus of 10,000 tonnes. It suggests prices above Dollars 5,300 a tonne (Dollars 2.40 a lb) are likely to be 'capped' by this surplus supply.

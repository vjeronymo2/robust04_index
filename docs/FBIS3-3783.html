Chairman Hsiao went on to say: It  is possible to choose Central and South Africa as the  destinations of President Li's second round of vacation trips.  The CEPD can furnish information for use as reference to the  Foreign Ministry at any time.    Speaking in the Legislative Yuan yesterday, Chairman Hsiao  Wan-chang said: The countries that President Li wants to visit  most on vacation are the United States and Japan, which he  mentioned emphatically during the news conference upon returning  from his southern tour. Hsiao Wan-chang said: The two nations  are our country's largest and second largest economic and  trading partners; their relations with our country are both the  closest and the most complicated. Hsiao Wan-chang added: The  CEPD and the Foreign Ministry also have been working hard to  plan President Li's next round of overseas vacation trips for  diplomatic purposes. However, it is inappropriate to announce  the trips before the time is ripe. He also said emphatically:  On top of its policy of turning southward, the government is  actually moving in all directions to expand and strengthen  relations with foreign countries. Any region could be a target  of its diplomatic efforts.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (2): First, understand the three varieties - Choosing a stockbroker / The decision is more of an art than a science, says Philip Coggan. It's difficult, but a useful guide may by provided by the performance of any unit or investment trusts that your prospective broker runs FOR SOME people with 'old money', the family stockbroker is like the doctor and solicitor, a faithful adviser whose wisdom is passed from generation to generation. But those who have acquired their wealth more recently face the problem of finding a broker for the first time. There is perhaps a natural suspicion that the wrong choice may result in the loss of a hard-earned fortune - that the quickest way of becoming a millionaire is to give a stockbroker Pounds 2m to invest. The first step in choosing a broker is to understand that there are three types of stockbroker: Execution-only Execution-only brokers will buy and sell shares on your behalf, without giving any advice. Their chief attraction is that their commissions are lower than those charged by other brokers. Rivals sometimes claim that execution-only brokers fail to get the best price in the market for their customers, and that this negates the commission saving - but this argument is hotly disputed by the execution-only sector. Advisory Advisory brokers, as their name suggests, will give clients advice on which shares to buy, and at what price. However, the overall responsibility for decisions remains with the client. The brokers receive their payment in the form of commission every time the client deals. Discretionary Discretionary brokers take full charge of the client's portfolio. They may charge a fee for this - based on a percentage of the amount of money managed  -or they may earn their return in the form of commissions. In recent years, there has been a tendency for advisory brokers to get squeezed out by the other two types. Charging a fee to manage a portfolio creates a stable source of income for the discretionary broker; cut-price dealing services attract a mass market (and high volumes) for the execution-only broker. The advisory broker must rely on clients who may only decide to deal once or twice a year. But the differences between the three categories are becoming increasingly blurred. Sharelink, for example, is an execution-only broker but it produces low-cost information packs on companies, designed to help investors to pick shares. Choosing a broker is rather more an art than a science. If one opts for an execution-only service, it is slightly easier, since it is mainly a question of opting for the lowest commission rate. (Nevertheless, wealthy investors should take care. Some execution-only brokers slant their rates towards the smaller investor). Judging an advisory broker is also difficult, because it is virtually impossible to quantify the value of advice. And even discretionary brokers are hard to judge, because they will rarely be able to produce figures for the 'average' client, on the grounds that each client has different needs and a different level of tolerance for risk. One useful guide can be provided by any unit and investment trusts run by the broker. They have a published record, which can be checked in publications such as the FT's sister magazine, Money Management. If the unit and investment trusts have not performed well in their sectors, that ought to say something about the firm's investment management skills. But qualitative, rather than quantitative, measures may be important. You may well wish to be able to speak regularly to a named broker; you may want the firm to handle all your dividend payments and associated tax credits, and to deal with your capital gains tax planning. You should certainly expect regular, and easy-to-understand, portfolio valuations. Where might you expect investments to be made? Mercury Asset Management describes a typical portfolio, for a UK client, as: UK shares, 60 per cent; cash/bonds, 17 per cent; European shares, 8 per cent; US shares, 7 per cent; Far Eastern shares, 4 per cent; and Japanese shares, 4 per cent. Some brokers offer money market accounts, which pay competitive rates of interest on cash held by clients as they move between equity investments. And services can be a lot more sophisticated than that. Prudential Bache Securities, for example, has a Luxembourg-based private bank, which will lend customers money against the value of their stock portfolios. A good broker ought to have no problems in buying and selling overseas shares, or indeed in offering services in other major currencies such as the US dollar. Nor do you need to rely on the investment skills of one broker alone. Pru-Bache also offers Managed Assets Consulting Services which gives investors the choice of a range of top money managers, whose services might not be otherwise available for individuals. A similar concept is provided by the Optima fund, a Bermuda-registered fund run by Dixon Boardman, formerly of Kidder Peabody, which selects the 12 best managers of US mutual funds. The minimum investment is Dollars 500,000. For some, all these additional services may be irrelevant; all they want is a broker that they can rely on to be careful with their money. The recommendation of a friend or colleague may well be the best guide. But for those who want to find their own broker, a list can be obtained from the Association of Private Client Managers and Stockbrokers, 5th floor, 20 Dysart Street, London EC2A 2BX.  ---------------------------------------------- Dealing only: best buys  ---------------------------------------------- MINIMUM CHARGES  ----------------------------------------------                                 Pounds James Brearley &amp; Sons               6* Capel-Cure Myers                   10 Central Stockbrokers               10** Killick &amp; Co                       10 Sharemarket                        10 The Share Centre                   10  ---------------------------------------------- ON A DEAL OF POUNDS 5,000  ---------------------------------------------- KIllick &amp; Co                       10 Griffiths &amp; Lamb                   25 The Share Centre                   44 Sharemarket                        45 BCP                                50 Central Stockbrokers               50 Fidelity                           50 Sobhag Stockbroking                50 Walker Crips Weddle  Beck (Investorlink)               50 Westons Securities                 50 Wilkinform Stockbrokers            50  ---------------------------------------------- ON A DEAL OF POUNDS 25,000  ---------------------------------------------- Killick &amp; Co                       10 Sharemarket                        45 Waters Lunniss                     75 ShareLink                          76.25 Fidelity                           85  ---------------------------------------------- * Sales only  ** Privatisation sales  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Investors Chronicle, August 20-26, 1993  ----------------------------------------------</p>

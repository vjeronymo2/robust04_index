			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fung Wai-kong] </F>   [Text] The Legislative Council [Legco] will be committing  suicide if it calls Beijing's bluff and passes the Governor's  political reform bill, according to Sir Percy Cradock, the  former foreign affairs adviser to the prime minister.    He said Legco would be signing its own death warrant. "It  would be wound up, extinct, in 1997."    Sir Percy, who made the remarks in Hong Kong yesterday, is  on  a business trip that also takes in China.    He has met the Director of Xinhua (the New China News  Agency), Zhou Nan, but declined to reveal what was discussed.    "Mr Zhou is one of those who can brief me on how Hong Kong  is  developing under the present confrontation between Britain and  China," Sir Percy said.    But he emphasised Mr Zhou was "no friend or sparing  partner".  [as published]    Sir Percy remained critical of the current British policy on  Hong Kong and maintained that it was entirely  counter-productive, harming rather than helping the development  of democracy in the territory.    He also argued that the British Government rather than Legco  was responsible for the well-being of Hong Kong, even after  1997, and so it had a responsibility to halt the collision  between Legco and Chinese authorities.    "They (Legco) are being encouraged, indeed driven, into a  situation which is a legislative charge of the Light Brigade.  It seems to me that a responsible government would be rolling  them back, pulling them back from that conclusion."    If the confrontation continued Hong Kong would be doomed,  especially in the constitutional arena, Sir Percy said.    "In the central area which is about democracy, the rule of  law, continuity of administration then I am afraid Hong Kong is  shooting itself in the foot," he said.    Sir Percy said he would not be meeting Governor Chris Patten  during his visit to the territory as he had not been invited.</p>

In statements published by the Yemeni newspaper 26  SIBTIMBAR,  the Yemeni president said the vice president, the prime  minister, and other ministers from the Yemeni Socialist Party  should return to Sanaa and resume their duties after signing the  document. He noted that no party can implement the document  without the other parties of the government coalition.    President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih noted that he will not object  to Arab and foreign envoys attending the signing ceremony in  Amman, stressing that the Yemeni parties cannot impose anyone on  the host country.    Regarding the role played by the Kuwaiti regime and the  Saudi  authorities in agitating the current Yemeni crisis, the Yemeni  president accused a Kuwaiti paper of calling for spending the  last $1 billion in Kuwaiti coffers to partition Yemen. He said  such an idea provokes all Yemenis.    President Salih revealed that the Saudi regime has paid  large  amounts of money, estimated at millions of Saudi riyals, to  agitate the Yemeni crisis. He said: The fact that Saudi  Arabia has paid such huge amounts of money arouses suspicions  about the Saudi role in the Yemeni crisis. President Salih said  this Saudi conduct is considered interference in Yemeni domestic  affairs, particularly under the current circumstances.    He noted that Yemen opposes all forms of terrorism and  stressed that the recent explosions and assassinations in Yemen  were carried out by hired elements that oppose Yemeni unity and  have been opposed to Yemeni unity ever since it was established.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Speech given by FSLN Commander Tomas Borge at FSLN assembly </F> in District IV, Managua]  <H5>  [8 Feb p 7] </H5>   [Text] In any political party--and the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN] is no exception--there are agreements  and disagreements. I think it is necessary to determine where we  are in agreement and where we are in disagreement.    It is said that some want reform and others do not, and yet,  when it comes time to talk about reform, everyone is in  agreement. No one in the Sandinist Front disagrees with the  internal reform of the Sandinist Front; if anyone does, let them  say so, because no one has said anything about it so far.    Who does not think there should be currents of opinion in  the  Sandinist Front? What happened in the true socialist countries?  They forced party members to think in unison. You shouted in the  town plaza, "National Directorate, give us your orders!" In  other words, you had the same opinions as the National  Directorate. Now you are beginning to doubt, to question, to  agree; and this thing called doubt, questioning, and agreement  is democracy, the real possibility for each of us to express our  own views.    The majority opinion should prevail, and that is what is  called democracy. Therefore, we all agree on the need for  political currents; that is another area of agreement. There is  a framework for defining terms, and reference was made to it  here. That framework is the program. The members of a party--and  we are no exception--are members of the party to the extent that  they agree on a program.  <H5>  Political Program </H5>   What is our program? A framework of interpretations that has  boundaries. We cannot go beyond the boundary if we want to be  members of a party. Nevertheless, there are different shades of  meaning and criteria in different subheadings that can only be  reconciled by means of a political program.    A draft revision of the program is now being discussed. It  must be discussed, and once we approve it, it will be our guide.  Those who agree with that program may be members of the  Sandinist Front; those who do not, may not. This discussion  should not be based on intrigue, invective, or even praise, but  rather on political differences.    What is contributing to these differences of opinion? People  are promoting candidacies for elections to be held in the year  19-whatever, and the promotion of candidacies is causing  individual alienation.    Promoting candidacies at this juncture may be damaging, and  in fact it has been. In large measure, the consequences of this  individual alienation are reflected in what has happened in the  last few days. This should be another point we can agree on.    Candidacies for the National Directorate or the Sandinist  Assembly should be promoted, not those for the presidency of  Nicaragua or for deputy seats. Now, when we discuss who should  be the candidate and how they should run, "we must think it over  carefully." We are not going to nominate a candidate who will  lose, but a candidate who will win. We must select the candidate  who can assure us of victory at the time, but it must also be a  candidate who shows respect for the revolutionary principles for  which so much blood has been shed.    Now, are there political contradictions within the Sandinist  Front? Yes, there are. There always have been. They used to be  resolved in the National Directorate. Sometimes we were not  satisfied. There was a certain balance of power that favored  some and hurt others; that was true, but differences were  resolved within the National Directorate.    If there are personal differences, we can resolve them  through political discussion, and it will not be difficult to  resolve personal differences. Are there ideological differences?  Yes, there are. Is it legitimate or not that there are  ideological differences? What is the framework of ideological  differences within the Sandinist Front, and what are its  parameters? Our ideological differences with the liberals, for  example, are extremely clear. It is undoubtedly more difficult  to delineate ideological differences within a party that claims  to be revolutionary.    There are revolutionary ideas and, apparently, ideas  approximating social democracy. Sometimes, however, we succumb  to subjective assessments and we call some people dogmatic and  others social democratic. But where there is smoke, there is  fire, and in this ideological reign there is smoke.    If there are, perchance, social democratic tendencies in the  Sandinist Front, we might ask, "What is social democracy?"  Social democracy split off from revolutionary socialism in the  last century, from the communist and socialist parties of the  time. The social democrats said these parties were obsolete.  They said we needed a profound reform, and we must also abandon  political violence. We needed to give absolute priority to  parliamentary debate.    This contradiction between social democracy and revolution  in  the new conditions in the world leads us to ask, "Is social  democracy moving toward revolutionary positions, or is social  democracy moving toward liberalism?" Are there areas of  agreement and disagreement between social democracy and  revolution? Are there areas of agreement and disagreement  between social democracy and liberalism? Where does social  democracy fit on the ideological dial, on the left or on the  right?  <H5>  [9 Feb p 11] </H5>   [Text] It appears that there are center-left social  democrats and center-right social democrats. Social democrats  have a fascination with the semantics of the center; either they  are center-left or center-right. If they are not left or right,  we must conclude that they are in the center.    So is the Sandinist Front social democratic or not? I would  say that the Sandinist Front is not social democratic; the  Sandinist Front is the Sandinist National Liberation Front  [FSLN], with its own revolutionary ideas. But what happened,  aside from stating that we are friends of social democrats, they  have shown us solidarity and we are grateful to each and every  party and to the Social Democratic International?    I think that although we are friends, we are not social  democrats. We have not been until now. But I say, what mistake  did we make? We asked to join as full-fledged members of the  Socialist International. The Socialist International is the  organization that brings together all social democrats. Our rank  and file did not like the idea. Nevertheless, we insisted on  becoming full-fledged members of social democracy. In the end,  and wisely, I think, the social democrats realized that we were  not social democrats and did not accept our application for full  membership; they left us as observers.    They were wiser than we were. But what were the consequences  of that? It led to confusion, and some sectors of the Sandinist  Front felt encouraged to move closer ideologically to social  democracy. Since 1979 this faction has always existed, and it  never has had an opportunity to express itself.    This situation has resulted, in my opinion, in a controversy  that may lead us to make subjective judgments. Historically,  social democracy was considered to be in the center. Social  democracy has historically advocated moderation--they have  called themselves moderates--and they have historically  advocated the reform of dogmatic parties. They have called  themselves reformers, regardless of the fact that we have all  been in favor of reform in this party. Perhaps that is why they  have claimed that label exclusively for themselves. Those who  feel that they are reformers here do not think that others are.    This situation must be discussed; we must ask our comrades  to  define their positions, because if they are social democrats or  sympathize with social democracy, we are not going to expel  them; they have a right to have their own ideas, just as others  have the right to have other ideas.  <H5>  Reform and Controversy </H5>   The prevailing ideas will be those of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front. Within the context of these possible  ideological differences, serious errors were made. The memory of  fallen comrades was insulted, comrades who had always been  respected in the ranks of the Sandinist Front. I am referring to  Rogelio Ramirez, whom we knew personally, a comrade who shone  with his own light, who served the Sandinist Front years before  the social democrats became Sandinists. We must respect him,  just as we must respect all comrades, and not just those who are  dead but also those who are alive, but especially those who are  dead.    Sometimes the enemy makes up stories that we own businesses,  motels, and this and that, and afterward everyone repeats the  enemy's stories as if they were true, when they are made up to  discredit the leaders of the revolution so that they will lose  their authority. And if they lose their authority, the Sandinist  Front deteriorates.    It is legitimate, therefore, to have differences of opinion  and to discuss them. We should not be afraid of differences. I  am more afraid of homogeneity in opinions, because only sheep  think the same way, perhaps because they do not think. And I was  telling some comrades on the directorate, and I tell everyone,  "What happens if I want to be the secretary general of the  Sandinist Front and the congress says no? Will I go off and form  another party?"    What happens if I want to run for president of Nicaragua and  the congress says no, and nominates someone else? Will I go off  and form another party? Do I have the right to divide the  Sandinist Front because my individual aspirations were not  satisfied?    And what is true for me is true for everyone. What do we  want? To be deputies? To be political secretaries? To be  secretary general, president of Nicaragua, or members of the  FSLN? We cannot have the slightest doubt: We are members of the  Sandinist National Liberation Front.    No one can take that away from me, no sir, because we may  not  have the honor of being president--the person who is nominated  for the presidency will have that honor--but the greatest honor  for us is to be members of the Sandinist Front. And those who  would leave the Sandinist Front because they are not chosen to  run for the presidency or a high-ranking office, secretary  general or deputy, let them leave. But they are turning their  backs on the greatest honor we have as Nicaraguan  revolutionaries: being members of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, April 1 (XINHUA) -- The Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region in northwest China has attracted an increasing  amount of investment from Taiwan over the past four years.    The region now has a total of 53 Taiwan-funded enterprises,  with a total investment of 86.75 million U.S. dollars and a  registered capital of 33.27 million U.S. dollars. Of the total  agreed investment, 33 million U.S. dollars have been put into  actual use.    Enterprises involving Taiwan investment are mainly engaged  in  real estate, electronics, telecommunications, foodstuffs,  textiles, garments and shoe making, as well as advertising,  forestry, agriculture and the service trades.    Eight of them each have an investment exceeding two million  U.S. dollars.    The flow of more Taiwan capital has helped boost the  exploitation of the region's rich natural resources such as oil,  coal, fruit, cotton and animal husbandry products.    They have also contributed to growing exports. Products such  as textiles, fruit drinks, building materials, arts and crafts  and computers from the region have entered the world market,  especially the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

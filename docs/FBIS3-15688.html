			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian Ambassador to the United States Ojars  Kalnins presented a note to the U.S. State Department asking for  a clarification of statements by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher relating to Latvia, made by Warren Christopher to a  subcommittee of the U.S. Senate at the beginning of the month.  The note says Latvia is perplexed by what was said by the head  of the U.S. State Department, that almost a million Russian  speakers in Latvia are deprived of the right to vote. The  Foreign Ministry recalls that 278,000 out of 722,000 ethnic  Russians living in Latvia are citizens of the Republic of  Latvia.    It is noted that Warren Christopher accepted Russia's right  to provoke Latvians to extend the circle of citizens and grant  the voting right to Russians who want to live in Latvia. The  Latvian Foreign Ministry is worried that Russians will interpret  these remarks as acceptance of the effort to (?fix) Latvia's  citizenship and naturalization policy. The document emphasized  that the Foreign Ministry wants to clarify Warren Christopher's  comments on the withdrawal of the Russian Army from Latvia and  the Skrunda radar base. The U.S. Secretary of State (?had twice  noted) the necessity of preserving the Russian troops at  Skrunda, while hitherto Latvia has been convinced that the U.S.  supports its efforts to demilitarize the Skrunda site. The  remarks by the Secretary of State make one think the opposite.    The Foreign Ministry urges a meeting of diplomatic  representatives of Latvia and the USA to clarify their stances  on the issues referred to, and to avert any possible  misunderstandings.</p>

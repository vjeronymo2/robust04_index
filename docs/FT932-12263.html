			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Budget national insurance bill could face delay LEGISLATION to implement one of the most contentious elements in last month's Budget - the 1 per cent increase in national insurance contributions  -could be delayed until the next session of parliament, even though the rest of the Budget measures will have passed into law before the summer. Ministers say that because the increase, taking employee contributions to 10 per cent, does not take effect until next April, there would be time to take a bill through parliament in the new session which begins in November. The Maastricht bill, on which there are two more days of detailed debate next week, is still the priority for the government's business managers in the current session, and they are not keen to take on another difficult measure, at least until the final hurdles in the Maastricht legislation have been cleared. Other controversial aspects of the Budget will, however, be debated and voted on by the Commons as a whole in the week after next. The extension of value added tax to domestic fuel, the changes to the North Sea tax regime, and the changes to income tax have been singled out for the three days of detailed debate on the finance bill. But the political sensitivity of the issue, both for the government and for Tory backbenchers will be lessened, since the Commons debates will not be held until immediately after the Newbury by-election and the county council elections. The first of the three days of more detailed debate on the finance bill will be devoted solely to the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel. The reform of petroleum revenue tax, on which ministers could face a rebellion from some Tory backbenchers, will be the main element of the second day, on which there will also be a separate debate on small businesses. The third day will be dominated by the income tax changes and there will also be debates on charities and on capital allowances. Less politically contentious elements of the bill will be taken in a 36-strong cross-party committee of MPs. The committee will begin its detailed consideration of the bill in the following week, and is not expected to have finished its work until early July.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ruling military government of General Sani  Abacha in Nigeria has announced that it is beginning the gradual  withdrawal of its troops from the ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force in  Liberia. Nigeria's decision to withdraw from Liberia follows  the release of an embarrassing satellite-recorded account of the  physical and partial involvement of Nigerian ECOMOG troops in  the Liberian conflict against the interest of peace and the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia].</p>

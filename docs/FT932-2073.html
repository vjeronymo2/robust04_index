			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (9): How Denmark is odd man out - Financial supervision ONE OF the requirements for success as bank industry supervisor, says Mr Eigil Molgaard, the director for the past six years of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, is 'a hand which does not tremble when when one comes face to face with some of the most powerful people in the business community.' He speaks from experience. Within the past year he has been the person primarily responsible for the departure of the chief executives and chairmen of three of Denmark's largest financial service institutions, Unibank, Hafnia and Baltica. Foreign bankers who are well acquainted with the Danish scene regularly emphasise that the standard of supervision exercised by the Danish financial supervisors is one of the reasons why Denmark has been able to avoid the dramatic crises which have occurred in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Mr Molgaard concurs in this assessment. The Danish economy went into recession in 1987, and has not yet recovered. In the six years since then, Mr Molgaard's agency has handled financial crises in 107 institutions, of which 75 have closed 'We have been kept busy without a break,' he says, 'handling new crises at the rate of one and a half a month'. Mr Molgaard lays down five main criteria for assessing the quality of a given banking environment: sound and up-to-date legislation; an efficient supervisory body, with sufficient resources; a generous and high-quality capital base; provisions policy which provides the banks with large reserves against which losses can be written off; and satisfactory and stable earnings from primary banking operations. Measured against these criteria, Mr Molgaard says, the Danish banks themselves, as well as the supervisory authority, operate under satisfactory legislation. A factor in ensuring that the legislative position has remained satisfactory, he says, is the country's membership of the European Community since 1973, forcing Denmark to keep up with EC requirements and providing it with laws which meet the needs of the time. EC membership also exposed the Danish banks to international competition early on. 'Being geared to competition in a larger banking environment has given us strength,' he says. The capital base of the Danish banks is one of the most important reasons why the Danish industry has avoided the serious problems that have affected banks elsewhere in Scandinavia, despite provisions averaging about 2 per cent of loans and guarantees in 1990 and 1991, and rising to 2.6 per cent in 1992. As a result partly of 1930's banking law and partly the supervisory authority's practice over a long period, the average capital adequacy of the Danish banks was 14 per cent in 1990, when the ratio was recalculated on the basis of the so-called Basle rules, which set an international minimum ratio of 8 per cent. The Danish legal minimum ratio was set at 10 per cent in 1990, but came down to 9 per cent this year and will fall to 8 per cent in 1995. Mr Molgaard personally thinks that it would be just as well if the Danish ratio was fixed at a higher level than the international minimum ratio. The Danish supervisors' approach to provisions is closely connected with their long-standing policy of visiting every bank and savings bank, large as well as small, at regular intervals to assess the quality of each bank's assets. This gives the supervisors an intimate knowledge of the banks, their customers, prospects, management and culture. 'We can see a potential problem before the banks themselves can,' he says. The supervisors will often call on the banks to make larger provisions than the banks think necessary, which does not make the supervisors popular. 'But if a bank does not follow our instructions, it costs, because we force them to follow up, and it affects the bank's profits.' There are several former bank chief executives who rue the day that they failed to take the supervisors' advice at face value.</p>

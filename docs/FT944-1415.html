			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Danisco exceeds expectations Danisco, Europe's fourth largest sugar producer, lifted pre-tax profits in the half-year to October 31 by 25 per cent to DKr568m (Dollars 92m) from DKr453m, better than the company had predicted. The group forecast a rise in profits of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent for the full year, an upward adjustment of earlier forecasts. Group sales increased 10.5 per cent to DKr7bn from DKr6.33bn. The group has interests in sugar, distilling, snacks, frozen pea production, food ingredients and packaging. All did better than last year, according to the interim report. Food and beverages sales increased to DKr4.2bn from DKr4.07bn and operating profits rose to DKr504m from DKr394m. Sugar sales were strong in the first half, but are expected to dip in the second half because the beet harvest was below normal. The group said Sweden's decision to join the EU would have a positive impact on results. Danisco acquired Socker Bolaget, the Swedish monopoly sugar producer, two years ago and is in a position to consider structural changes in the Swedish industry, the interim report said. In Germany, rationalisation at factories in eastern Germany has been completed. Danisco's EU sugar quota in Denmark is 425,000 tonnes. The group said production would exceed this but would not reach last year's 521,000 tonnes. In Germany, the quota was 126,000 tonnes, but production this year would not be more than 105,000 tonnes. In Sweden, production this year is expected to be about 330,000 tonnes, about 50,000 tonnes less than in 1993-94. Grindsted Products, the food ingredients company, which produces enzymes for food processing, increased sales to DKr1.10bn from DKr999m and operating profits to DKr165m from DKr152m. The packaging division increased sales to DKr1.72bn from DKr1.27bn.</p>

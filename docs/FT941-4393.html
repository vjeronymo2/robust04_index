			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Saying it with narcissi For the ultimate spring present there is little to beat the personalised daffodil. Horticultural Research International is inviting bids for 10 new double-flowered narcissi which buyers will be able to register with a name of their choice. Research on the new bulbs, begun 30 years ago at the UK's ministry of agriculture, resulted in production of the 10 new breeds in commercial quantities this spring. HRI: UK, 0205 722391.</p>

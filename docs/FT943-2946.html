			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sectors need regulation - not industries Sir, Your editorial, 'Who regulates?' (September 14), substantially misrepresents the proposals in the Institute for Public Policy Research's new report, 'Regulating Our Utilities', of which I am one of the authors. You say that we want to replace individual regulators with 'regulatory commissions representing 'stakeholders' such as suppliers and employees', and that this would weaken regulation by opening it up to lobbying by special interest groups. If we were proposing that, no doubt it would; but we are not. We argue for regulatory bodies for sectors such as energy and and communications rather then industries such as gas and electricity, or telecoms and posts - because of the need for a coherent approach to these areas. The role which separate regulation played in last year's coal crisis illustrates this need. We argue for regulatory commissions rather than individuals because sectoral regulation demands a range of expertise and because the personalisation of regulation has undermined the quality of decision-making. Nowhere do we suggest that such commissions should include representatives of vested interests. On the contrary, we think that would be wrong. We suggest it 'might be possible to include individuals with other relevant public policy expertise, for example of having represented consumers in the industries concerned, though they should not be currently involved in doing so'. We want expertise added to the process, not lobbyists. Utility regulation is vitally important to the UK's infrastructure and to citizens' lives. Our proposals aim to improve the quality of regulation - distinguishing ministers' responsibility for medium-term policy in sectors such as energy, communications and transport, while strengthening regulators' executive independence in achieving these democratically determined objectives.

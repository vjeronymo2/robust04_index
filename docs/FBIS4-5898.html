			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korea, U.S. Begin Whole New Ball Game With North Korea -- </F> by Yi Tong-min"]    [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington  began a whole new ball game against North Korea Friday with  changed star players and match strategy.    South Korea announced it will no longer demand an envoy  exchange with North Korea as a precondition to the next  Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. In effect, Seoul has cut  itself out and left North Korea and the United States to deal  with the nuclear problem.    Reactions are split on whether Seoul made the right call.  Some say it is a correction of what was a wrong-headed policy.  Others say Seoul threw in the towel when there was no need to.    Critics point out that inter-Korean dialogue was not the  real  stumbling block to resolving the nuclear impasse. There is no  guarantee that North Korea will open its nuclear program to  outside inspection just because Seoul withdrew the dialogue  demand, they insist.    Furthermore, the Kim Yong-sam administration has lost face  by  rescinding the principle held for years by his predecessors that  for North Korea, "the road to Washington goes through Seoul."  What Seoul risks with Friday's decision is that much greater.    The critics have a point when they say Pyongyang succeeded  in  cornering Seoul to get what it always wanted -- dialogue with,  and only with, the United States that takes South Korea  completely out of the picture.    But Seoul was more concerned with steering the nuclear  problem away from a tense situation at the United Nations.  Officials here explained they no longer felt an envoy exchange  would help defuse the controversy and decided to let it go.    "Envoys were a means to a solution, not the final  objective,"  said Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of North Korean nuclear  affairs.    Defenders of the new strategy say this was the only  available  incentive Seoul could give to North Korea to break the stalemate.    China, North Korea's staunchest ally, made clear to  President  Kim Yong-sam at last month's summit that it would exercise its  veto power, not even abstain, if a resolution on imposing  sanctions against Pyongyang came up at the security council.    In the face of such blatant opposition from a country whose  support is the pillar of coordinated international action, Seoul  had no choice but to yield in order to prove that it had done  all it could to solve the problem diplomatically.    The government's tone has softened considerably compared to  just last month when it kept talking about UN sanctions and  hard-line action. High-level officials were declaring that  Washington had to "show Pyongyang at least something" to make it  comply with nuclear inspection demands.    "We can't say 'do this, do that.' We have to offer some  incentives," said Kim, suggesting that Seoul and Washington were  ready to make conciliatory gestures.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is considering  an early-May deadline for North Korea to permit additional  inspections. Friday's announcement will significantly quicken  the pace to meet that deadline.    The IAEA's first move is to propose negotiations to North  Korea on discussing checks of facilities where access was denied  during last month's visit.    Meanwhile, the United States will reopen contact with North  Korea to discuss holding the next round of high-level talks.    Once the inspections and high-level talks are agreed, Seoul  will propose a new form of inter-Korean dialogue. The type of  dialogue will depend on the progress of nuclear negotiations.    Officials say the prime ministers' talks, suspended because  of the nuclear row, or the inter-Korean joint nuclear control  commission are favorable channels.    North Korean-U.S. high-level talks are also expected to gain  speed. There are specific sites the IAEA wants to see -- those  closed off to inspectors at last month's visit and the two  nuclear storage sites. The IAEA also has to be present when  North Korea changes the nuclear rods at its five-megawatt  reactor.    In return for the above, Washington will take various steps  toward improving relations.    It will take some time before the two sides can agree on  diplomatic normalization. Washington is reminding Pyongyang of  other stumbling blocks such as human rights, return of the  remains of missing American soldiers from the 1950-53 Korean war  and terrorism.    In any event, various stages lie in between -- a liaison  office for one, a formula that Washington applied with China.</p>

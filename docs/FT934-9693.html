			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (8): Head east for value and comfort - Gillian Upton offers practical advice for getting around in south-east Asia from Japan to Indonesia - will equal that of the US and total about four-fifths that of the European Community. No one doubts the might of the region even now, as western businesses shift their focus of operation eastward in an effort to tap rich opportunities. Culturally, it is a colourful area in which to do business. Most Asian nations practise their own brand of capitalism which is a mix of industrial policy and freewheeling competition. But it is also a corrupt continent. Corruption is endemic except for one nation, Singapore. It is probably at its worst in China and Vietnam. In terms of creature comforts, however, only superlatives will do. Hotel accommodation in the region is among the best in the world and offers far better value for money than Europe due to its much lower labour costs. The exceptions to this rule are the emerging nations - Laos, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Cambodia, Vietnam and parts of China - and here you will need guidance. Domestic flights within these embryonic countries still leave a lot to be desired, but western joint ventures will lessen the discomfort and danger in time. What is absolutely essential is flight reconfirmation as overbooking is rife; do it as soon as you enter the country. Brushes with chicanery are most commonly found with taxi drivers in Vietnam and Cambodia but less so in China. In Hanoi, it is common practice to overcharge the foreigner who seeks a ride downtown in one of the minivans that sometimes double as taxis; in effect, the foreigner pays for all the locals who squeeze in after him. It is a safe bet to halve whatever figure is suggested. The hour-long journey to downtown Hanoi should not exceed Dollars 15 but be warned that it will usually be in ancient and non-airconditioned vehicles. In Ho Chi Minh City, by contrast, taxis are usually modern, Japanese cars but the much shorter distance - just 4 1/2 miles - will still cost Dollars 10, but no more. Getting around in either the federal or commercial capital is by taxi or cyclo (bicycle taxi) but the latter are not really practical if you want to turn up at an appointment in suitable condition as they take the many potholes particularly badly. And attempts by the drivers to keep you dry during the frequent heavy rainstorms are usually pointless. Staying in Hanoi, Vietnam's federal capital, is usually necessary on a business trip in order to get licences, contracts and the like rubber-stamped. The choice is easy as only one hotel is up to western standards. The Metropole is managed by the French-owned Pullman chain; it offers western facilities such as direct dial telephone, air-conditioning, satellite TV channels, in-house videos, mini-bar, laundry and dry cleaning and a swimming pool. Rates start at Dollars 130. The hotel also offers an airport shuttle bus. In Ho Chi Minh City there is more choice. The older properties with a sense of history and character, such as the Continental, Cuu Long Majestic and the Rex, are more than adequate and it is worth upgrading to junior suites in each case for a nominal premium rate. Deluxe rooms are around Dollars 70 in each of these properties and suites from Dollars 90-Dollars 130. The two modern properties are Saigon Floating hotel (all mod cons but small rooms) and the Century Saigon on the main street, Nguyen Hue Boulevard (bookable through Utell). But they are also more expensive, at about Dollars 150-Dollars 175 for singles and Dollars 260-Dollars 350 for suites. If business takes you to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, then, like Hanoi, there is only one sensible choice, the Cambodiana on the edge of the Mekong river. It is not cheap but is the only clean, western option. Taxi rip-offs are commonplace. In China, western standards of accommodation are easier to come by, especially in Beijing and Shanghai. The country's economic boom means that booking well ahead is essential to avoid disappointment. Doing business needs patience; this is not a place to make a quick dollar. And punctuality is vital; better to turn up early than late. In the sprawling capital city, it is essential to choose your hotel by location if you are to avoid Beijing's notorious traffic snarls. Among those centrally located are China World, its three-star sister property Traders, the Palace and Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza. To the north-west are the Shangri-La and ANA Beijing New Century hotels and to the north-east of the city centre - towards the embassy district and en route to the airport - are a cluster of hotels of note, namely Kempinski Beijing Lufthansa Centre, Swissotel and Sheraton. Rates range from Dollars 120 to Dollars 240. One locally-run hotel worth noting is the centrally-located Jianguo Beijing, where rates are around the Dollars 100 mark. Always allow extra time to get to appointments in Beijing; traffic volume (both cars and bicycles) will infuriate you. Cab drivers often have difficulty finding your destination and few of them speak English. Have the hotel bellman write the address in Chinese and give the driver specific directions. Long journeys will not necessarily cost you a fortune as cabs are cheap; from Y2 per km and with a minimum fare of Y12 (Pounds 1.40). Your best transport option downtown from the airport is the hotel bus. Allow around an hour for the trip and a fare of Y70. The extensive construction work on this stretch of road should now have materialised into an expressway linking Beijing capital airport with the town centre so the journey time should now be less than an hour. Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial city, is an altogether more compact city, which makes walking to appointments viable when the traffic is at a standstill - and it often is. The Portman Shangri-La is the best hotel option in Shanghai; a huge combined office, apartment and hotel complex with good western standard restaurants. The Sofitel Hyland, Hilton, JC Mandarin and Shanghai International Equatorial are also good options. The airport, some 14 km away, can be reached in 30 minutes on a good day, but allow plenty of time as the queue for taxis is often horrendous. The fare in an hotel car is Y200 but in a taxi only Y40-Y70 (depending on whether it is a small or large taxi).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Telephone calls from abroad  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Easiest country to make calls from  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                   Number????      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                           294       49.5 France                        46        7.7 Germany                       42        7.1 Singapore                     34        5.7 Netherlands                   28        4.7 Hong Kong                     19        3.2 Belgium                       16        2.7 Japan                         16        2.7 Switzerland                   14        2.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Worst country to make calls from  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Italy                         54        9.7 India                         48        8.6 Russia                        41        7.4 Spain                         32        5.7 Nigeria                       27        4.8 US                            26        4.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ????Corporate travellers were asked which country was the easiest to telephone from and which country was the worst.

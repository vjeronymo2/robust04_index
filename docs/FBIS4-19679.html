			<p>BFN     [Text] Greek and Albanian delegations met in Ioannina today  for an initial examination of issues under their authority ahead  of a meeting between their foreign ministers. The delegations  included representatives of the Public Order and Foreign Affairs  Ministries of the two countries. Correspondents report that the  meeting dealt with events at the Ano Episkopi Military Camp and  the issue of the Albanian illegal immigrants, whose number at  the Greek-Albanian border has increased.    Yeoryios Kirousis, our correspondent in Ioannina, reports  that most of the arrested North Epirus Greek-Albanians, members  of the organization Omonoia [Greek-Albanians Association], have  been taken to Tirana. No one knows how many Omonoia members  have been arrested from Sarande, Delvine, Himare, Gjirokaster,  Tepelene and (Premetis). Omonoia President Sotirios Kiriazatis  also went to Tirana for meetings with government officials to  discuss the persecution of the Greek minority in Albania. The  latest mass arrests and strong police presence in the towns and  villages of North Epirus have reportedly created fear among the  Greek minority. The residents of the area avoid moving far from  their homes and stay indoors after sunset.    Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed that the Greek  Government condemns and protests the profound and continuous  persecution of the Greek minority by the Albanian authorities.  The foreign minister made his statement after the mass arrests  of Omonoia members in Gjirokaster yesterday. These actions, he  said, violate basic human rights and personal liberties.  Papoulias added: The Greek people, who generously welcome and  host thousands of Albanian citizens, question and feel offended  by the Albanian authorities' behavior against the Greek minority  in Albania. The foreign minister stresses that the government  will take all the necessary steps and make representations to  protect the Greek minority's internationally safeguarded rights.</p>

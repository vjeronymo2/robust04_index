			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Miras could provide boost Sir, I believe there is an opportunity for the government to intervene in the housing market's current problems. Miras currently costs the exchequer several billion pounds a year. If the government took the average UK mortgage life of about five to 10 years' worth of Miras and paid this all in one year, thereafter abolishing Miras entitlement, it would be equivalent to a massive reduction in mortgage interest rates for at least one year. And the extra economic activity that should result would increase the government's tax revenues. While leading to one year's increased PSBR, it should not be seen as extra borrowing, as it is only bringing forward already committed and budgeted tax relief. The scheme might persuade many first-time buyers to try to qualify for the payment/tax-credit. The increased activity might compensate for any small drop in house prices.

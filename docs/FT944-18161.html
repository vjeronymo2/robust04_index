			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Clarke holds out hope of tax cuts Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday held out the prospect of tax cuts but insisted that they would only come when the economy and public finances were in good health. In his speech to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Mr Clarke repeated that talk of tax cuts in November's budget 'is hopelessly premature'. But he added: 'As the economy strengthens further and public expenditure is brought firmly under control, tax cuts can come back on to the agenda.' Mr Clarke warned, however, that the stock of debt in the UK was already far too high. 'I have no intention of adding to that stock by more than I have to. Therefore, tax cuts can only take place and will only take place in the context of healthy recovery and healthy public finances.' The chancellor stressed that it was 'a matter of judgment' to decide when tax cuts would help to sustain economic growth rather than impair it. Mr Clarke admitted to journalists that he was already thinking ahead to his speech to next week's Tory party conference. Taking a swipe at the Labour party, he told a press conference that his speech was to show Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, that there were economic policies that lay 'between post-classical economic theory on the one hand and meaningless empty ramblings on the other'. In a move to deter speculation that the PSBR is falling faster than forecast, he revised the written version of the IMF speech that was released in Madrid and London. Whereas the text spoke of a budget deficit 'set to exceed Pounds 30bn this year' Mr Clarke said the figure should be Pounds 36bn, and so in line with the Treasury's forecast.</p>

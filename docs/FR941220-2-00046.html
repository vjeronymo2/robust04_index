			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paragraph (1) of Rule 414 requires that, where 25 percent or more of the value of an underlying index stock group is represented by securities of United States issuers, the calculation of a stock index warrant's settlement value must use the opening prices of those securities on the U.S. markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplementary Material .30 to Rule 405 is amended to cross-reference Rule 414 and to delete (a) the statement that the suitability requirements of Rule 723 apply to stock index warrants and (b) the recommendation that the account approval requirements of Rule 721 be applied to stock index warrants. Paragraphs (f) and (h) of Rule 414 supersede those notions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange proposes to amend those portions of the Rule 431 margin requirements that apply to margin on foreign currency options and options on broad index stock groups so as to apply the same margin requirements to currency warrants and stock index warrants, respectively, and to establish currency index warrant margin requirements. For example, stock index warrants will follow broad index options in requiring margin of (A) 100 percent of the current market value of all ``long'' stock index warrants and (B) in the case of ``short'' positions in stock index warrants, (1) 100 percent of the current value of the option plus (2) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying index stock group multiplied by the applicable index multiplier. The Exchange proposes that its margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange proposes to amend Para. 703.15 of the Listed Company Manual, which currently provides listing standards for foreign currency warrants, to cause it to apply to currency index warrants. The Exchange also proposes to amend Para 703.15 and Para. 703.17 of the Listed Company Manual (A) to change the issuer ``substantiality'' requirement for $100 million in assets to $150 million in tangible net worth, (B) to specify that the issuer is expected to refrain from issuing warrants where its aggregate currency and index warrant offerings exceed 25 percent of its net worth and (C) to require in-the-money currency and index warrants to be automatically exercised at expiration if not otherwise exercised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In listing new stock index warrant or currency index warrant issues for trading on the Exchange, the Exchange would submit a proposed rule change only where a warrant issue overlies an index on which warrants or options are not already listed, whether on the Exchange or on another self-regulatory organization. Thus, an Exchange would list for trading index warrants on indexes that already underlie listed options or warrants without further Commission review and approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the NYSE and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Telephone conversation between Vincent Patten, NYSE, and Stephen M. Youhn, SEC, on December 8, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1'').

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Rouble zone faces more breakaway pressure THE disintegration of the Russian rouble zone appeared to be gathering pace yesterday after officials in Uzbekistan said they intended to issue a joint currency with Kazakhstan in an attempt to merge their economies and break away from Moscow's fiscal control. Mr Fakhtiyar Khamidov, Uzbek vice-premier, speaking in Tashkent, said that talks with Moscow to create a new rouble zone were now 'deadlocked,' forcing the republic to develop its own currency. 'The conditions of Russia are enslaving. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are now planning to introduce a new currency,' Mr Zafar Ruziev, foreign ministry spokesman, was quoted as saying. The Kazakh government in Alma Ata yesterday denied that any concrete plans had been agreed with Uzbekistan for a new currency. But in the wake of a bitter attack by Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president, on Russia's rouble policy, the republic appears to be moving closer to breaking away from the rouble zone. Earlier this week Turkmenistan, the gas rich central Asian republic, became the fifth republic to formally issue its own currency, joining the Baltic states and Kyrghystan which have broken out of the rouble zone over the last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Fridman: "Russian Mines Prepared To </F> Reduce Gold Production"; first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] If the situation develops unfavorably, gold  output may, according to the estimates of miners themselves,  drop to 30-40 tonnes compared to more than 70 tonnes in 1993.    The situation will be unfavorable if cooperatives of gold  miners do not receive traditional interest-free advances in  preparation for a new season.    The fact is that a large share of gold in Russia -- up to  60-65 percent of the total -- is obtained in the third quarter,  and the first half of the year is spent on preparation for the  season, i.e., the provision of equipment, fuel and food, the  stripping of deposits and the mining of ore and underground  sands, which requires money that was formerly paid to gold  miners in the form of interest-free advances. Now the state  proposes to advance these funds, which amount to half of the  cost of gold mined in Russia -- more than 600 billion rubles --  at an annual interest of 120 percent.    This variant, however, will, in the opinion of Viktor  Tarakanovsky, head of the Council of the Union of Gold Miners'  Cooperatives, make gold mining profitless even if the price of  gold increases. Miners themselves predict that the price of one  gram of gold may rise from the present 17,400 rubles to  41,000-42,000 rubles by the end of the year.    The price of gold in Russia is fixed every month on the  basis  of world prices recalculated into rubles at the Central Bank's  current exchange rate.    Gold miners take advances for eight months, till the end of  the third quarter, and are thus obliged to repay by this time  the 300 billion rubles of advance and almost as much interest.  Taken together this will amount to about 21 percent of the cost  of the gold mined by them. Taking into account 30 percent of  expenses and the total taxes levied at 55 percent, the  expenditure on gold mining will exceed its cost.    In order to resolve the problem gold miners propose to  return  to interest-free advances pointing out that it is in fact not a  credit but a prepayment for the precious metal. The Union of  Gold Miners' Cooperatives guarantees that advances will be  issued only to enterprises which really mine gold. These  guarantees are all the more necessary since, according to some  estimates, during the last two years advances for mining of  about six tonnes of gold were given to organizations which did  not intend to mine it. During the year they "turned over" the  money as they saw fit, then apologized for the absence of gold  and returned the advance, pocketing, naturally, all the profit  from it.    Now the state, unwilling to issue free credits right and  left, rejects altogether the system of interest-free advances.  In the second half of January Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin  instructed the Ministry of Finance to work out a new mechanism  of financing gold production. The time limit of the instruction  ended on February 1, and it was officially proposed to miners to  borrow advances at 120 percent annual interest. At the same time  it was hinted to slow-witted miners that anyone in their  position would elementarily take advantage on the difference of  this rate and that of commercial banks which is now at least  100-120 percent higher.    But Viktor Tarakanovsky believes that miners would not be  able, even if they wanted to, to "turn over" the money received  since the preparation for the season should begin practically  immediately. It should be pointed out that, should miners have  agreed to such terms at the end of the last year when the time  of the issue of advances came, they might possibly have greater  freedom of manoeuvre now. It should be taken into account,  however, that during the preparation for the season the world  price of gold offers no advantages since miners are forced to  buy many materials at prices much higher than world ones; in  particular, the price of fuel for them in some regions reaches  800,000 rubles a tonne, which is almost four times above the  world level.    Gold miners' cooperatives pinned some hopes on the  president's December decree on the liberalization of the gold  market, which provided for the setting up of a "gold exchange"  and the granting to some commercial banks of the right to  conduct operations with gold. In this case gold-mining  enterprises could agree with a concrete bank on mutually  advantageous terms of cooperation. But the numerous delays in  the implementation of the decree, of which not only miners  complain, suggest the conclusion that the actual issue of  licences to banks and operations at the gold exchange cannot  start for several more months.    Nor will miners be able to benefit by the growth in the  domestic price of gold when it will be determined at the  exchange. Although the domestic price may prove considerably  higher, according to some estimates -- by 1.2-1.3 times -- than  the world price (since the demand for gold as a means of  preserving capital will probably be very high) any organization  interested in obtaining gold can, if it makes proper efforts,  buy it abroad.    Several major state gold-mining associations, first of all  the Yakut and Magadan ones (which account for about half of all  mined gold), already demand that the price of gold should be  raised to 60,000 rubles a gram. In these conditions the exchange  price of gold will be altogether unpredictable, especially at  the beginning.    The Union of Gold Miners' Cooperatives does not consider  such  conditions acceptable but, since it is not a rigid structure,  cooperatives themselves and their associations in regions may in  some cases agree to such conditions (they will most probably be  joined by state enterprises), especially since some cooperative  leaders stated already at the end of last year their intention  to maintain the volume of output even if the state takes the  most rigid position in relation to them.    But the problem of credits remains all the same, since they  can be taken, if gold miners refuse to do so, by other  commercial structures which are least of all concerned about the  mining of gold. Perhaps the only thing left to count on is a  repetition of late 1992 and the beginning of 1993 when  practically everyone also spoke about unbearable conditions and  the inevitable reduction of gold mining in 1993 as a result gold  production remained at the 1992 level, just exceeding 140 tonnes.

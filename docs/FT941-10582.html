			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Carsberg slams revised banking code Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday described the revised code of banking practice as a wasted opportunity. The code was published yesterday and his attack was the first of many criticisms which came from, among others, the Consumers' Association and National Consumer Council. Sir Bryan said that banks and building societies had 'wasted an opportunity to make a step increase in consumer protection'. He added that the code 'ignores major areas of consumer concern' by failing to introduce a self-regulatory requirement to give 'best advice' to customers being offered a range of financial services. The code, accepted voluntarily by more than 280 banks and building societies, is a second edition of the guidance that was issued two years ago and imposes some fresh obligations on those who sign up to it. These include requirements to give customers at least 14 days' advance notice of charges and interest; not to pass customer information to other companies in their group without the customer's express written consent, and not to make giving this consent a condition of providing basic banking services. Sir Bryan was among those questioning the code's timetable, which gives organisations until the end of 1996 to introduce pre-notification. Mr Chris Lendrum, chairman of the working party of representatives from banks and societies which drew up the changes, said that very complex system changes were involved in the new arrangement, and that competitive pressures might well contribute to earlier implementation of the change. Some banks and societies already give customers advance notice of charges and interest. There was also confusion about the impact on existing customers of the new requirement for express written consent for passing personal account details within a bank's group of companies. Barclays Bank, which used to make giving such consent a condition for customers applying for new accounts, credit cards or loans, said it would seek 'clarification' of whether and how the new code would apply where consent had already been given in those circumstances. Mr Maurice Healy, a member of the committee which reviewed the code and made recommendations to the joint working party, said that the committee envisaged that other companies in a group should not be able to use such information until the customer had consented again. Nor does the code resolve two issues affecting customer confidentiality on which banks have not reached agreement with the data protection registrar. These are 'host mailing', where an institution posts to its customers information from another organisation, and the form of customer consent required for passing on certain information to credit reference agencies. Other changes in the second edition include an obligation to ensure that customers and staff are aware of internal complaints procedures, and a requirement to make information about the rates on interest-bearing accounts readily available. The new code will to come into effect in late March. The review process is likely to start again in two years' time, with a further edition being published in 1997.</p>

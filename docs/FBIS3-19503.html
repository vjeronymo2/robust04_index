			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with French Airbus Chairman Jean </F> Pierson by Edoardo Borriello; place and date not given:  "Alenia, Beware of the United States" -- first four paragraphs  are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- When, late in February, the partners in the  European Airbus consortium learned that Finmeccanica [Mechanical  Engineering Finance Corporation] had decided to purchase a 10-20  percent share in the McDonnell Douglas aircraft division -- thus  laying the foundations for a closer alliance between Alenia and  the American aviation group -- their sole reaction was a dry "no  comment," which, however, did little to conceal their serious  disappointment.    The French of Aerospatiale, the Germans of DASA [Deutsche  Aerospace], the British of British Aerospace, and the Spanish of  CASA [Aeronautic Constructions Company] -- the consortium's  shareholders -- would have preferred Alenia to intensify its  involvement, including financially, in the Airbus programs,  rather than aim at a closer partnership with the Americans.    The Italian company is not part of the European consortium,  but -- through a 10-year agreement, signed in 1990 -- it is  involved in Airbus's most recent program for the development of  the so-called A-321 -- the new 185-seat airliner which is about  to join Alitalia's fleet. Alenia builds two of the fuselage  component sections. This amounts to a contract worth $150  million.    Now, barely three weeks later, the "Pyrenees bear" (as Jean  Pierson, the sanguine French chairman of the Airbus consortium,  is nicknamed by his friends) broke the silence and, in the  course of a telephone interview, said that he understood the  reasons which had led Finmeccanica to approach McDonnell  Douglas. At the same time, however, he advised Alenia to "leave  the doors open," and ensure that the handshake with the  Americans does not become "binding."    [Borriello] Mr. Pierson, do you have any counterproposals to  make to Alenia?    [Pierson] No. At present the Airbus consortium has no  counterproposals to make to our Italian colleagues. We are well  aware that Alenia's staff is oriented toward McDonnell Douglas  for reasons of operational continuity, given that they have been  working for the American group for some time now, and also for  employment reasons, since Alenia needs to obtain work  immediately for its plants.    [Borriello] Why, then, do you have some reservations  concerning the alliance with McDonnell?    [Pierson] In the first place, because, in order to guarantee  more work for Alenia, the American group must win a greater  share of the commercial airliner world market. Will it manage  to do so? Currently it is the third manufacturer, after Boeing  and Airbus. Also, I ask myself: By acquiring a share in  McDonnell Douglas, is Alenia strong enough today to refuse a  binding agreement in terms of strategic options? In my view,  both problems are closely interconnected.    [Borriello] Could you expand on this, Mr. Pierson?    [Pierson] If, in order to maintain certain manufacturing  lines, Alenia is "forced" to sign this agreement with McDonnell,  then it will have little freedom of choice within the American  group's activity sector, and it may therefore find itself  excluded from many European initiatives.    [Borriello] Which, for instance?    [Pierson] You know that Alenia is one of Aerospatiale's  partners in the ATR program for developing regional transport  aircraft. Should Aerospatiale decide to build a 90-seat  jetliner, the project would enter into direct competition with  McDonnell Douglas's similar project, called MD-95. At that  point, Alenia would be forced to give up the Aerospatiale  project.    [Borriello] What if Alenia is not "forced" to sign the  agreement with McDonnell Douglas?    [Pierson] In such case, it would be well advised to leave  the  doors open to new agreements. However, today McDonnell Douglas  is in no position to impose many limitations on its partners,  and therefore whether or not any doors are left open will depend  on the negotiators' ability.    [Borriello] Open to a partnership with the Airbus  consortium?    [Pierson] Already some 10 years ago we offered Alenia the  possibility of joining our consortium with full rights, and  therefore taking part both in our ongoing and in our developing  programs. At that time, however, Alenia preferred to work with  McDonnell Douglas. Now that the need is being experienced to  reorganize the consortium's production lines and shareholding  structure, again the Italian company appears to be siding with  the Americans.    [Borriello] But you are also conducting negotiations with  the  Americans. What stage have the talks between Airbus and Boeing  reached?    [Pierson] The same stage reached by the negotiations  conducted some 35 years ago between Sud Aviation Francaise,  which was then manufacturing Caravelle airlines, and Douglas, in  order to work out a cost-sharing agreement in relation to the  development of Caravelle. Those talks never moved beyond the  statement-of-intent stage, and it proved impossible to translate  intentions into practice.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: 'Prodigal Son' marks Kent Opera's return - Spitalfields Festival It is five years since the Arts Council decided to close down Kent Opera by withdrawing its grant, but some companies refuse to take their final curtain. Its founder Norman Platt is determined to keep the company name alive, even if it means starting again from scratch. He intends to keep up pressure on the Arts Council for a new grant, but in the meantime has raised the finance for a rebirth of Kent Opera from other sources. The list of contributing organisations, public and private, including local authorities and charitable trusts, is too long to list here. The sensible decision on Platt's part was to have chosen for his relaunch a modest work that could be mounted on a limited budget. Britten's Church Parables involve just a small band of instrumentalists and a handful of singers. They are a favourite with small-scale opera companies who can perform them in churches without the need for any scenery, but for some reason the third of them - The Prodigal Son - has been neglected at the expense of the other two. Kent Opera has been touring it around the English summer festivals and arrived this week at the Spitalfields Festival in East London. In its heyday the company made a name for itself enticing young theatre producers into the world of opera (Jonathan Miller and Nicholas Hytner were among its recruits). Platt wanted to continue that tradition and chose Tim Carroll from the Northcott Theatre in Exeter for The Prodigal Son. What he did with the piece took it a long way from the Japanese Noh-play formality that Britten had in mind, but the result was strikingly theatrical. The performance was dominated by Howard Haskin as the Tempter, whose destructive force tears apart a family. Gwion Thomas sang strongly as the Elder Son. Alan Watt might have found more paternal warmth as the father, but James Oxley was affecting as the repressed younger son. Only Britten could equate the evil temptations that he faces with a chorus of boy trebles. Under Timothy Dean's musical direction this third parable made a vivid impact. While money is short, perhaps Kent Opera might consider building up the complete trilogy. Spitalfields Festival continues until June 29.</p>

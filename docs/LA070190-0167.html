			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDBERG, CHANG RALLY TO PREVAIL IN FIVE SETS  </P> <P> How does Stefan Edberg play Wimbledon?  </P> <P> Very quietly. It seems as though the only sound he makes here comes from the  ball meeting the strings of his racket. But this is routine stuff for the  silent Swede, who is once again slipping almost unnoticed through the  tournament.  </P> <P> On a blustery Saturday, Edberg blew both hot and cold, yet arrived in the  quarterfinals relatively unscathed with a 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-2, 9-7 victory over  Amos Mansdorf of Israel.  </P> <P> Edberg's opponent in the next round is Michael Chang, who also took the long  road in his third-round match. Chang came from two sets down to defeat Mark  Kratzmann of Australia, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> Chang, who is 6-1 in five-set matches, explained how he does it: "You never  know."  </P> <P> Edberg was able to shine some light on his ability to creep through the draw  without drawing much attention. There are two reasons why he can do this,  Edberg said. They are Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker.  </P> <P> Although the majority of the attention has been reserved for Lendl, seeking his  first Wimbledon title, and Becker, a three-time winner, Edberg cruises along at  his own pace.  </P> <P> He drives from his home across the Thames in Kensington, beats somebody, then  goes out to dinner with his Swedish girlfriend, Annette Olsen, and coach Tony  Pickard.  </P> <P> In the last three years, Edberg has reached at least the semifinals, winning it  all in 1988 and losing in the finals in 1989. In that period, neither Lendl nor  Becker has a better record at Wimbledon, although they both are always more  publicized.  </P> <P> "That's always the case, isn't it," Edberg said. "It's not a big surprise. I  guess that's the way I like it. I just take it as it is.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are talking about Lendl because he has put in a big effort to  win this one," he said. "Becker, of course, there is always a lot of talk about  him when Wimbledon comes up. I'm sort of somewhere behind there.  </P> <P> "It is sort of a good position to be in," he said. "I don't feel I've got too  much pressure. Now I'm in the second week and I know that if I play well, I can  go all the way."  </P> <P> Darkness prevented Lendl from getting a step closer to his goal. His match with  Bryan Shelton of Huntsville, Ala., was halted at one set apiece at about 7:15  p.m., English time.  </P> <P> That was about a half hour after police evacuated about 10,000 people from  Centre Court because of a bomb scare. No bomb was found, but police have been  extra vigilant because a terrorist bomb exploded Monday at a posh London club,  injuring nine people. Saturday's bomb scare forced the suspension of a doubles  match in which Jim Grabb and Patrick McEnroe led Ken Flach and Robert Seguso,  6-1, 3-4.  </P> <P> During the bomb scare, the Lendl-Shelton match continued on Court 1 with Lendl  winning the first set, 7-6 (7-2), and Shelton taking the second, 7-6 (7-4).  </P> <P> Both will be completed Monday, as today is an off-day.  </P> <P> In other action, Brad Pearce of Provo, Utah, who had never won three matches in  one pro tournament, chose a good time to do it. Pearce, 24, a 5-foot-9 former  UCLA star, defeated 6-8 Milan Srjeber of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.  </P> <P> Pearce's Wimbledon experience has not always been so glowing. He lost in the  first round of 1986 and failed to qualify the last three years. To celebrate  his victory, he plans to take today off and spend time with his wife, Cindi,  and 18-month-old daughter, Jordan.  </P> <P> "Maybe a little picnic, Kentucky Fried Chicken," Pearce said.  </P> <P> But if Pearce emerged in the fourth round, the hopes of three other Americans  were deep-fried.  </P> <P> Ninth-seeded Jim Courier of Plant City, Fla., lost to Mark Woodforde of  Australia, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4, Jim Grabb of Tucson lost to Christian Bergstrom  of Sweden, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2, and Alex Antonitsch of Austria defeated David  Pate of Las Vegas, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).  </P> <P> For a while, Edberg's progression was interrupted by Mansdorf, who scored a  service break in the first game of the third set. Edberg drilled an easy volley  into the net and kept running to his chair, where he threw his racket to the  ground in disgust.  </P> <P> Mansdorf's one-set lead didn't last. His serve was broken twice in the fourth  set, which Edberg won quickly. But in the fifth set, Mansdorf's serve returned.  </P> <P> At 7-7, Mansdorf speeded his own downfall by double-faulting, and then Edberg  made the most of a single break-point opportunity. Mansdorf looked at a softly  hit volley right at him, nudged it into the net, then buried his head in a  towel.  </P> <P> Pickard pumped his fists. "It was brilliant," he said. "He had only one chance  and he took it."  </P> <P> Edberg quickly closed out the 3-hour 3-minute match on his serve. Then he  pronounced the match a complete, if quiet, success.  </P> <P> "I think a match like this is probably going to do me a lot of good," Edberg  said. "It's good to get one of these matches out of the way, where you really  have to fight. He gave me only one chance and I was lucky to take it."  </P></p>

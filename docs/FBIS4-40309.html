			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service  (FCIS) Sergey Stepashin is in favor of extraordinary measures to  combat crime.    Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday in  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, he pointed out that "a real war of criminal  clans is beginning in the country now. They use the most  advanced technical means of destruction. That's why there has  appeared an urgent necessity to adopt extraordinary measures,"  he stressed commenting the presidential decree on strengthening  the fight against crime.    Asked about the situation concerning espionage, Stepashin  said that his department is especially concerned at the activity  of the special services of North Korea. He mentioned the recent  deportation of five North Korean citizens from Russia who tried  to find information on the components of nuclear weapons.  According to Stepashin, three days ago several Korean citizens  were detained in the Primorye Territory for similar reasons.    Having noted the active work of the US special service,  Stepashin expressed his opinion that "the present level of  openness is damaging our country."    On Thursday [16 Jun] Stepashin intends to visit Vladivostok  and Nakhodka (Primorye Territory).</p>

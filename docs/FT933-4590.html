			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) slips to Pounds 8.2m PRE-TAX profits at Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, the Northampton-based housebuilder, property and construction group, slipped slightly in the first half as lower property profits offset gains at Wilcon Homes, the housebuilder. In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax figure declined from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 8.22m while group turnover grew by some 5 per cent to Pounds 102m. Earnings per share dropped to 2.9p (3.2p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.27p. Mr Lynn Wilson, chairman, said the half year results demonstrated the group's 'resilience,' and noted that the fall in interest rates 'has led to a slow, but at times faltering, recovery in the UK housing market.' Strong purchaser interest in the earlier part of the year helped the group sell 1,600 houses in the first half, up 28 per cent over the 1,250 homes sold in the 1992 period. The average selling price was unchanged at Pounds 54,000 although nationally, prices fell by about 5 per cent and as a result the group's margins remained under pressure. Wilcon Homes managed to increase profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 7.96m (7.44m) on turnover of Pounds 88.5m (Pounds 69.6m). During the period the group also purchased 2,400 plots, increasing its land bank with planning permission from 13,300 at the end of December to 14,100. Outside the core housebuilding business, Wilcon Construction's order book and profits were both reduced, reflecting the uneconomic level of prices obtainable by building contractors. Profits dipped from Pounds 262,000 to Pounds 221,000 on increased turnover of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 16.3m). Profits at Wilson Connolly Properties fell to Pounds 39,000 (Pounds 1.07m) on turnover down to Pounds 3.58m (Pounds 12.3m) but the chairman said business was'encouragingly active'. At the end of June the group had cash balances of Pounds 10m and gearing, including land creditors, stood at 10 per cent. COMMENT The 'lumpy' nature of property profits makes for unflattering year-on-year comparisons despite the solid gains at Wilcon Homes. Although the construction business has been contracting and is unlikely to show any real improvement until 1995, brighter prospects for property in the second half should help lift full-year pre-tax profits to around Pounds 23m and earnings to about 8.2p per share. The shares slipped 7p to 192p yesterday, but still leave the company on a lofty forward multiple of 23.4.</p>

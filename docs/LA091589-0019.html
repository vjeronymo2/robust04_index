			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS BILL TO BUILD SUBWAY LINE INTO VALLEY  </P> <P> In a move cheered by San Fernando Valley homeowners, the state Senate gave  final legislative approval Thursday to a bill that would require a proposed  Valley extension of Metro Rail to be built underground through residential  areas in Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Studio City and Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> The bill was touted by its author, Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), as the only  politically palatable way to build the proposed Valley rail line. Homeowner  groups for years have strongly opposed an aboveground line, saying it would  split neighborhoods and create noise, congestion and safety problems.  </P> <P> Robbins' legislation passed the Senate despite opposition by the Los Angeles  County Transportation Commission, which argued that the state had no business  dictating the design of a locally funded transit project. The commission is  building a countywide commuter-rail network primarily with proceeds from a  half-cent sales tax increase passed by voters in 1980.  </P> <P> A commission lobbyist said the Legislature's action, if ratified by Gov. George  Deukmejian, may create legal problems for the transportation agency. He  suggested that the commission might therefore shy away from the Valley  extension, choosing instead to go forward with proposed South Bay or Los  Angeles-to-Pasadena rail projects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Possible Train Routes  </P> <P> County transit planners are studying two possible east-west routes through the  Valley, one paralleling the Ventura Freeway and the other following the old  Burbank branch line of the Southern Pacific railroad.  </P> <P> Robbins' bill would require that either route be constructed below ground level  in a densely populated, 3.6-mile stretch bordered by the Hollywood Freeway on  the east and Hazeltine Avenue in Van Nuys on the west.  </P> <P> In the central segment of that stretch -- between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and  Woodman Avenue -- the route would have to be dug at least 25 feet into the  ground.  </P> <P> The bill would require that any Metro Rail stop in the vicinity of Valley  College in Van Nuys be built on the campus itself, eliminating heavy commuter  traffic that might be created if the station were built in a nearby residential  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The Senate action was hailed as a major victory by neighborhood activists,  business interests and Orthodox Jewish congregations, which have several  synagogues and other facilities along the Southern Pacific route in North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "When you run something aboveground . . . through a neighborhood, you  necessarily have split that community," said Polly Ward, president of the  Studio City Residents Assn.  </P> <P> "There's no good way in a community that's built up -- which all Valley  communities are -- to avoid that. But if you run it underground, you have not  damaged the community."  </P> <P> Transit officials envision running a rail line about 16 miles from Universal  City to Warner Center in Woodland Hills. But Robbins said that due to the heavy  extra cost of subway construction with the planned funds, the route would have  to end near the Van Nuys-Reseda border, making it about seven miles shorter.  Express buses could take commuters to points farther west and north, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Local Opposition  </P> <P> If transit officials tried to build the line aboveground, local opposition  would be so fierce that the project could be tied up for years, Robbins said.  But as a subway, the line would enjoy widespread community support, he said.  </P> <P> The county Transportation Commission is drawing up an environmental impact  report that will evaluate the two routes, including whether the line should be  partly or fully aboveground.  </P> <P> But state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes  parts of Encino, complained that the subway plan would help some Valley  residents but contains no such guarantees for those to the west.  </P> <P> Transit officials argued that mandating a subway in advance of the report's  completion could be interpreted as state prejudging of the environmental  document.  </P> <P> That in turn could prompt lawsuits against the commission, giving it an  incentive to turn away from the Valley and begin building lines elsewhere, said  Tim Egan, commission lobbyist.  </P> <P> Robbins dismissed that assertion, saying the Legislature has the "power and the  right to protect the community."  </P> <P> He also suggested that acceding to residents' desires for an underground train  would make them more likely to support a $1-billion bond issue for highway and  transit projects slated for next year's ballot. Proceeds from those bonds could  be used to extend the Valley line from the Van Nuys-Reseda terminus, he said.  </P> <P> A Deukmejian spokesman said the governor had no position on the bill.  </P></p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar edges up on tensions THE DOLLAR traded firmly against the D-Mark yesterday as Washington appeared to be moving towards an attack on Iraq, but the US currency failed to break through crucial technical barriers, writes James Blitz. Political tensions in the world tend to be positive for the dollar, which is deemed a 'safe haven' currency. Reports that President Bush was planning an attack on Iraq pushed the dollar up to a high of DM1.6333 in European trading, after a previous close of DM1.6320. The US currency failed to make further headway. The market remains uncertain whether President-elect Bill Clinton will announce a fiscal package to stimulate the economy, because of indications that the US is already enjoying a recovery. Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London warned against buying the dollar as a result of the Iraqi situation alone. He said the start of the Gulf war in February 1991 was accompanied by a sharp fall in US consumer confidence, due to rising oil and commodity prices. If repeated, this would depress the currency again. The dollar closed in London yesterday at DM1.6325. In New York, however, it fell around 1 pfennig to end at DM1.6220. The D-Mark continued to soften against the French franc as the Bundesbank provided new indications that it might lower short-dated interest rates again. The Bundesbank added more liquidity to the German cash market in its weekly inter-vention than had been expec-ted. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, improved sentiment by saying that the central bank was prepared to show further flexibility on interest rates. The franc rose to another six-week high against the German currency, finishing in London at FFr3.391 to the D-Mark, after a previous close of FFr3.395. It was some 4 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark. Given the more accommodating stance of the Bundesbank, there are growing reasons to think the battle of the franc may have been truly won. But a question hanging over the French currency is whether the Bundesbank will ease monetary policy quickly enough to allow France to lower rates from their high levels. Mr MacKinnon said the Bundesbank will await the outcome of the talks on the Solidarity Pact and the January inflation figures before making any more decisions. But Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez in Paris was quoted yesterday as saying that another gesture on interest rates would probably be required from the Bundesbank before the end of the month, if tensions were to be allayed. A devaluation of the Irish punt would also focus attention again on the French currency. The Irish punt traded well above its ERM floors, but one-month Irish punts were still quoted at around 30 per cent at the end of the day.</p>

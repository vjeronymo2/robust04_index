			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FARMERS CREATE VACUUM IN A WAR AGAINST HARMFUL INSECTS;  </P> <P> DEVICES LIFT BUGS OFF CROPS, REDUCE NEED FOR CHEMICALS  </P> <P> The idea of zapping bugs by sucking them off crops instead of spraying them  with toxic pesticides is causing a proliferation of names playing on "vac," as  in vacuum.  </P> <P> It all started last year when Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc. of  Watsonville designed a machine called a BugVac that uses just enough suction to  remove lygus bugs from the tops of berry plants while not disturbing beneficial  bugs that congregate farther down the plant.  </P> <P> That idea helped spur Salinas-based Tanimura &amp; Antle Inc., the nation's  second-largest lettuce grower, to develop a machine called Salad-Vac to vacuum  bad bugs off lettuce.  </P> <P> Now comes VAC-US, designed by two Delano men for use on grapes and cotton.  </P> <P> The Delano device consists of a specially designed, five-horsepower hydraulic  fan that collects bugs in wire mesh bags after sucking them off plants, said  Harold Nelson, who designed VAC-US with Don Neumann, his partner in Daco Farm  Supply.  </P> <P> The 50-pound vacuum units can be frame-mounted in several configurations to  accommodate individual requirements of farmers, Nelson said.  </P> <P> He and Neumann have begun field tests of a six-unit, tractor-mounted implement  with three units on each side hydraulically positioned around a row of  grapevines. They think it could be profitable because the cost of about $20,000  for an eight-unit VAC-US is considerably less than other types developed so  far.  </P> <P> A VAC-US unit on top of the vines and one on each side can remove up to half  the flying insects on the plants as the tractor moves between rows, Nelson  said.  </P> <P> Even though it doesn't eradicate all flying pests in a single application,  Nelson thinks VAC-US will be valuable as another tool to let growers rely less  on pesticides.  </P> <P> "We're not a replacement for chemicals," he said. "We're a tool to help reduce  the amount of chemicals needed. People are looking at how to reduce pesticides,  and this is another concept."  </P> <P> However, Nelson thinks repeated vacuumings will remove most flying insects, and  the number of times a grower would need to vacuum plants depends on a  particular insect's life cycle. He estimated that a single application of  pesticides would cost about as much as three sweeps of a field with VAC-US.  </P> <P> It can be used to remove leaf hoppers, white flies, moths, weevils, thrips and  lygus bugs from strawberries, grapes and cotton, he said.  </P> <P> After flying insects are sucked off the plants, beneficial predator insects can  be introduced to eliminate mites and other bugs, Nelson said. The wire mesh  bags are designed with openings large enough to allow some surviving predators  to escape.  </P></p>

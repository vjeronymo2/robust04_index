			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food and Drink from Italy: Pigs, pasta and cheese / The belly of Italy, Emilia-Romagna Emilia-Romagna is a food lover's paradise. It is the belly of Italy, where rich alluvial soil yields some of Italy's finest ingredients and the cooks of the region, drawing on a historical mix of court grandeur and farm kitchen simplicity, produce exquisite recipes. Orchard fruits and soft wheat flourish here. So do all manner of vegetables and fungi. The area is famed for its egg-yolk yellow pasta, richly sauced or lavishly stuffed, and for balsamic vinegar, one of the most fashionable flavourings of our times. Above all else, this is the land of the pig and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Do not think, though, that Emilia-Romagna is famous only for its food. There are romanesque cathedrals, medieval abbeys, Byzantine basilicas, the ceramics of Faenza, the mosaics of Ravenna and paintings by Correggio. It is also the home of Ferrari, Maserati and Lamborghini cars. Bologna is the greedy capital and contains the oldest university in Europe, hence its nickname 'the fat and the learned'. It is a city of joyfully noisy, hotly competitive gourmandise - a legacy probably derived from medieval times when the rich demonstrated their power by giving gargantuan feasts and constructing towers bigger and better than those of rival families. Paolo Atti, near the basilica of San Pietrono, is never without a queue for its crusty loaves made half-and-half with wheat and maize, its heavyweight cakes that appear to be composed almost entirely of glistening glazed fruits and nuts, and its pastas. Huge and delectable tortelloni are stuffed with fresh artichokes or pumpkin. Little tortellini are stuffed with a mixture of fresh pork, chicken, mortadella, Parma ham, eggs and Parmesan, dextrously folded and twisted into rings (the shape was supposedly inspired by the navel of Venus). Served in a rich broth with globules of fat floating on the surface, or sauced with scalded cream, they epitomise the sumptuous glory of Bolognese cooking. Prize items in the herb and vegetable market on the morning I was there were porcini, brought in fresh from the woods. Their sight and smell drew crowds, and even those who did not buy relished watching others make their selection from the three grades on offer. For a late-night supper that evening at the Ristorante Diana in the via dell' Indipendenza, I succumbed to a potato, porcini and Parmesan gratin finished with a grating of truffle - not one helping but two. Elsewhere in the market there were chickens split to reveal the unlaid eggs inside them (it is their deep golden corn-fed yolks that give the local pasta its rich colour). Strings of little cacciatore salamis, suspended in rows, swung like bead curtains - dwarfed by mortadella sausages, some as big as punchbags at the gym. Mortadella is a cooked sausage of ancient pedigree, a smooth forcemeat of high quality pork studded with fat and spices, so beloved of its creators that it is sometimes simply known as Bologna sausage - which British travellers of earlier centuries called baloney.</p>

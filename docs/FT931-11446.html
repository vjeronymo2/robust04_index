			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mauritanian fishing flounders for lack of investment - The problems holding back a potentially rich source of export earnings MAURITANIA HAS some of the world's richest fishing grounds. A profusion of plankton, where the Canary current from the north meets the Guinea current from the south off the northern city of Nouadhibou supports species ranging from pink spiney lobsters, octopus and squid to sardines, horse mackerel and tuna. But under-investment in vessels and insufficient data about fish stocks remaining threaten to undermine the industry. The novelty of fishing for most Mauritanians could help to explain the lack of investment. Less than 30 years ago, more than 80 per cent of the people, mostly Moors, led a nomadic, or semi-nomadic way of life, based on raising livestock. 'We've traditionally looked more towards the sand than the sea,' says the managing director of one of the country's largest fishing companies. The country did not have its own fishing fleet until the beginning of the 1980s. It started with 150 boats, but only 50 are now operational, and many of those only just. Many vessels lie rusting at anchor in Nouadhibou harbour. The banks, meanwhile, are owed an estimated 13bn ouguiya (Pounds 84m) by the fishing industry, borrowed for the purchase of new boats, an amount which represents 40 per cent of the credit in the Mauritanian economy. The Union Bank for Development, one of the main lenders to the fishing industry, is likely to have its activities radically curtailed under the World Bank and IMF reforms. Mauritanians, it seems, generally prefer to invest hard currency from fish sales in banks and businesses abroad, particularly in the Canary Islands and mainland Spain. Some figures suggest that the Mauritanian fishing industry channels USDollars 100m a year through Las Palmas alone. Most of the large industrial boats are owned jointly by Mauritania and other countries, such as Libya, Romania, Russia or Algeria. 'Those countries don't have the money to invest in boats and neither, it appears, does Mauritania,' comments one foreign diplomat who has taken a close interest in the fisheries sector. The cost of bringing the Mauritanian fleet back up to strength has been estimated at UM75bn (UM is the abbreviation for the ouguiya) - or nearly Pounds 490m. Just as worrying for the future of the industry is the lack of accurate information on fish stocks. According to figures published by the government's Oceanographic and Fisheries Research Institute (CNROP) in Nouadhibou, the level of fish stocks has been static in recent years. Foreign scientists, on the other hand, believe the numbers of some species to be critically low. 'The Mauritanians don't know how many trawlers should be allowed in their waters, whether to permit 500 or 5,000,' says one marine biologist. The Japanese recently reported to the Mauritanian government that the octopus would become threatened if pipes - used mostly by smaller, traditional boats - continued to suck up immature as well as adult fish. The total octopus catch of 21,000 tonnes last year was worth Dollars 75m in export markets, principally Japan, out of total fish exports Dollars 220m. Mauritanian boats are themselves reporting falling catches, 'A vessel of average size used to land over 10,000 boxes of octopus, cuttlefish or squid after two months of fishing,' says Mr Moulaye el Hassen, founder and managing director of Somacopp, a Mauritanian company with three industrial vessels. 'Now, if you're lucky you can expect about 5,000 boxes after 70 days at sea.' Lobsters were once so plentiful that they were fished with nets. The decline in lobster numbers has been so disastrous that Portuguese boats now consider lobster fishing to be virtually uneconomic. Log books listing catches are often not returned to the DCP, the Mauritanian fishery control authority. The main culprits seem to be Spanish and Portuguese captains. The absence of effective surveillance and punishment of vessels infringing quotas and net sizes is another concern. Of penalties totalling UM450m imposed over the last four years UM156m remains unpaid. Foreign governments and multilateral agencies have been insisting on wide-ranging reforms of the Mauritanian fishing industry in exchange for major investment. For example, Mauritania should be eligible for a grant of Ecu9.6m (Pounds 7.85m) from the European Community, as compensation for a fall in 1990 cephalopod exports, under the Stabex provisions of Lome Convention, a trade and aid agreement with former colonies of EC members. This is likely to be used partly to improve management within the CNROP. Foreign exchange will be made available for the purchase of inputs, mostly fishing gear and spare parts, but only to those boat owners who can show they are not indebted to the Mauritanian banks and can deposit the ouguiya equivalent. Germany has invested nearly DM16m (Pounds 6.7m) since 1989 in the purchase and modernisation of the Priscilla, a 54-metre, former Scottish surveillance vessel. Rechristened N'madi, or hunter, it is crewed by Mauritanian sailors and carries German, Danish and British fishery experts. The Germans have also funded an on-board computerised information system for the N'madi. The French government has agreed to provide a second patrol vessel and to finance two marine biologists to work in the CNROP for three years. It is also interested in contributing to the financing a shipyard and an enlargement of port facilities at Nouadhibou. From July last year, at German and French insistence, the DCP assumed responsibility for co-ordinating maritime surveillance, managing navy, air force, customs and fishery patrols. Germany recently agreed to fund a marine biologist as an interface between the DCP and the CNROP, to improve the CNROP's grasp of fish stocks. Meanwhile, the French are requesting that the Mauritanian law requiring a minimum mesh size of 70 mm be more strictly enforced, that all boats display special numbers at least as prominent as their name and that there should be tighter monitoring of infringements and the collection and use of fines. Mauritania still lacks the capacity significantly to add to the value of fish caught. This final piece in the jigsaw - investment in major on-shore processing plant - would become more likely should there be a relaxation of the investment climate climate in Mauritania and, in particular, Central Bank regulations for the release of hard currency. At the end of last year the Brussels-based Centre for Development and Industry held the first of a planned series of seminars to promote industrial partnerships in the fishing sector. Investment of some Dollars 7.5m is needed to improve existing but basic on-shore fish processing plant, to bring it up to standards of hygiene now required by the EC, and to make new products such as fish blocks and fish fillets. Mauritania's fish exports are expected to rise sharply in the coming year with West Africa seen as the most promising market for the pelagic catch. If Mauritanians themselves develop a taste for fingers, fillets and steaks, perhaps then the Moors may turn more of their attention to the sea.</p>

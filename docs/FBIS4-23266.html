			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] One of the catalysts of opposition in Nigeria has  been the election of the consultative constitutional conference,  known locally as the Confab, which is supposed to draw up a new  political dispensation. It seems to have sharpened the resolve  of those who look back at the annulled elections of 12 June last  year and want those results reinstated. Now a new opposition  group is emerging of senators elected last year but who lost  their jobs when the Senate was disbanded along with all other  institutions when General Abacha seized power. A number of  senators say that they are going to reform the Senate, among  them is Segun Bame Gbetan who was elected senator for Oshun  East. On the line Akoi Amusu asked him if it wasn't a bit late  to be reviving the Senate.    [Begin recording] [Gbetan] Well, we have made this move  because since the annulment of the results of 12 June 1993  election, we feel that there is no other way but to try to  resolve both the annulment of the results of that election and  to get the Senate and in fact the National Assembly back to  function. So, that is the general consensus now that the  senators have also come together that we should get the  democratic structures back in place.    [Amusu] But aren't you just causing confusion? I mean, the  Abacha government is now in the process of setting up a  constitutional conference. It has held elections and  everything. So, why are you now suddenly coming out to say that  you want the old Senate to meet?    [Gbetan] Well, it is accepted that there may have been some  confusion about the strategy and the style to adopt but the goal  has always been the same: The goal of the political class is the  same as the military government of General Abacha. Both want to  install lasting democracy and whether it is through Confab or  through general resolution, the goal is the same. So, I think  now if you have a general resolution, the Confab may not be  necessary.    [Amusu] But Gen. Abacha doesn't want you old politicians to  come out of the woodwork. He wants to start afresh with a clean  slate.    [Gbetan] No, there is no intention on the part of Gen.  Abacha  to leave out any particular group. That was why everybody was  allowed to contest and quite a number of senators contested and  won election into the Confab.    [Amusu] So, what you are suggesting is that the Abacha  government should just forget about the constitutional  conference, what you are calling a Confab, and just let you  senators sort it all out.    [Gbetan] Yes, I believe that is a very viable alternative to  the Confab.    [Amusu] But you see, if Gen. Abacha is being asked to accept  your election in those elections of last year as being valid,  then why shouldn't he accept the election of Moshood Abiola  whose election as president has been annulled?    [Gbetan] Yes, Gen. Abacha and his government have distanced  themselves from the illegal annulment of that election and I  believe they are working towards restoring the results of that  election.    [Amusu] But they've showed no signs of that. They have shown  absolutely no signs of their intent to reinstall Chief Abiola as  president of Nigeria. In fact, on the contrary, they seem to be  doing everything to avoid that.    [Gbetan] Well, I believe that what they have not done is to  try to do it by military fiat or by executive fiat and that is  by trying to go through the Confab and particularly General Diya  has said that they will abide by the decision of the Confab and  I think the feeling in the country today is that the Confab  should go there and resolve that issue and get Chief M.K. Abiola  to form his government. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Another border crossing will be added to the two  existing major cargo and passenger crossings at Grodekova and  Poltavka in the Maritime Kray. The crossing, to be opened at  Turiy Rog settlement in Khankayskiy Rayon, will establish the  shortest route to the Chinese city of Mishan for thousands of  tourists and businessmen.    The traffic capacity of the new point will be comparatively  small -- four tourist groups per day. However, according to  Aleksandr Berestavov, chairman of the Kray Committee for  Tourism, the opening of motor vehicle access across the border  will make it easier for many Russians to become acquainted with  China.    In turn, tourists from China, whose numbers have risen  sharply with the introduction of visa-less exchanges of tourists  between the two countries, now have one more window into  Russia's Far East.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Preface written by President Jiang Zemin, "Arm With the </F> Knowledge of Modern Science and Technology," for the book  Basic Modern Scientific and Technological Knowledge,  Selective Readings for Cadres]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- To enrich the scientific  and technological knowledge of cadres at the county level or  higher and to raise their level of leadership over the  modernization construction, I have on several occasions  suggested the compilation and editing of a book that would  systematically impart to them the basic Marxist views that  science and technology are the productive force, an easily  readable book that would explain the scientific and  technological development and trend in simple terms, and a book  that would discuss ways to cope with the development of science  and technology. Thanks to the joint efforts made by the  comrades in the State Science and Technology Commission and  comrades in other units, my wish has been finally realized.    Science and technology are the important impetus for the  development of productive forces as well as the important  indication of social progress. A comprehensive look into the  history of civilization shows that every major breakthrough in  science and technology always brings about profound changes in  productivity and leads to great social progress. Since the  beginning of this century, particularly since the end of World  War II, major breakthroughs and the rapid development of a  number of cutting-edge new and high technologies such as  electronic information, biotechnology, and new materials have  profoundly changed the world outlook and human life. Science  and technology have penetrated all spheres of economic activity  and social life and have become the most important factors  propelling the development of productivity. In the final  analysis, science and technology represent a decisive factor in  the progress of modern society. Competition in the  international arena in modern times is nothing but the  competition of overall national strength. Science and  technology are the keys to winning the international  competition. Comrade Deng Xiaoping had the perspicacity of  discerning this great historical trend and stated in a clear-cut  manner that "science and technology are the primary productive  forces," which is a scientific exposition that has enriched and  developed the Marxist theory on productivity and that has  provided a major guide for building China into a strong and  prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modernized socialist  country.    The remaining decade of this century and the next 50 years  of  the next century are a critical period for the invigoration of  the Chinese nation. The world's progressive tide of peace and  development and the evolving scientific and technological  revolution have provided opportunity for China's reform, opening  up, and economic development. We must seize this  hard-to-come-by historical opportunity, closely track the  development of science and technology in the world, accelerate  the pace of developing new industries, constantly increase the  role of scientific and technological progress in bringing about  economic development, and promote the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the entire national economy. A look at  contemporary world history will tell us that many poor and  backward countries experienced an economic takeoff within a very  short space of time. Although they varied in their respective  conditions and advantageous factors for development, they did  share one thing in common -- that is, they stressed education  and were good at adopting advanced science and technology.  Because we have a superior socialist system and because our  people are known for their hardworking spirit and for their  wisdom, we will surely realize the grand objective of socialist  modernization in 50 to 60 years if we persevere in our tireless  efforts by unwaveringly adhering to the theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic  line, and by resolutely relying on scientific and technological  progress.    To accelerate the pace of scientific and technological  progress in China, it is essential to raise the scientific and  technological level of various levels of leading cadres. Since  adopting the policy of reform and opening up to the outside  world, China has made great strides in training more educated  and professional cadres. At present, most leading cadres at the  county-level or higher are at least college educated, if not  higher educated than that. This, however, does not necessarily  mean that leading cadres, notwithstanding their higher  educational level, are familiar with or have mastered modern  scientific and technological knowledge. Cadres, whether they  majored in social science or in natural science in college,  whether they graduated many years ago or just graduated from  college, need to go through a restudying process. We know that  modern science and technology develop at a dizzying pace, that  new inventions and new theories emerge one after another, and  that old knowledge is being replaced by new knowledge with great  rapidity. Only by carrying out assiduous study, by constantly  acquiring new knowledge, and by arming ourselves with knowledge  can it be possible for use to increase our decision-making power  and to improve the art of leadership. Because there is a vast  amount of scientific and technological knowledge, it is  impossible for our middle-level and high-level cadres to become  experts in certain fields and in certain disciplines. But it is  completely possible for our cadres to broaden and deepen their  range of knowledge or even to become specialized in certain  fields. Failing to accomplish that, they cannot be said to be  qualified leaders.    We now face an important task of stepping up the study and  mastery of modern scientific and technological knowledge. All  levels of cadres must recognize the importance of acquiring more  knowledge and of enhancing awareness of the need to gain more  knowledge out of a sense of making the country strong and  prosperous and of invigorating the Chinese nation. When  acquiring scientific and technological knowledge, we must keep  the followings in mind: We must be undaunted before  difficulties; we must always show a willingness to ask  questions; we must apply knowledge in our daily lives; and we  must have perseverance. Because cadres are entrusted with the  heavy task of providing leadership in socialist modernization  construction, they are indeed very busy. Despite busy work  schedules, they should find time for study. This book may serve  as "a beginner's" reading for understanding modern scientific  and technological knowledge. I suggest that cadres devote a bit  of effort to thoroughly reading this book. To always enrich and  broaden their range of knowledge, cadres may, after finishing  this book, want to read more social science or natural science  works, depending on their job positions and work requirements.  If mid- and high-level cadres know how to arm themselves with  scientific and technological knowledge, to increase their  capability for understanding nature, for utilizing nature, and  for transforming and protecting nature, they will be able to  better lead and mobilize hundreds and millions of people to  advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and to sketch a newer and more beautiful picture  scroll on the vast motherland's land.</p>

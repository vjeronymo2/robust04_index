			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kravchuk feels the two presidents  (Ukrainian and Russian -IF note) with help from their  governments will find a solution for the problem of the Black  Sea Fleet. Talking to a reporter for INTERFAX-Ukraine in Kiev  Saturday, Kravchuk warned against attempts to play up the  Defense Ministers' failure to negotiate a solution, in  Sebastopol [Sevastopol].    According to Kravchuk, Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin agreed in a telephone conversation on Saturday that  negotiating teams must prepare appropriate documentation but a  political decision will rest with the two presidents.    Kravchuk stressed that a decision on the Black Sea Fleet  will  not be detrimental to the Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean  interests and will meet security interests and encourage  cooperation.    Kiev raised no objections to the use of naval facilities in  Sebastopol by the Russian Fleet, and the conclusion of separate  agreements on the use of facilities in Ketch and Donuzlava.    But, said Kravchuk, Russia cannot have as many as five or  six  naval facilities in Crimea. With this proviso, there will be no  solution to the problem.    It had been decided, Kravchuk said, that the Fleet was fifty  percent Ukrainian and the whole world knew that Crimea belonged  to Ukraine.    Kravchuk dismissed as hardly serious Crimean President  Meshkov's demand for the withdrawal of the Ukrainian troops from  Crimea. The whole world recognized Crimea as an integral part  of Ukraine, Kravchuk said. Strangely enough, the Crimean  president failed to remember that.</p>

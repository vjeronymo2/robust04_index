			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK water companies The market was right to be relieved at yesterday's interim pricing agreement between the water companies and their regulator. Lower K-factors - the amount by which the companies can increase prices above inflation - will squeeze profits, but by less than feared. The companies which signed two-year agreements have also gone some way to reducing regulatory uncertainty in the run up to the 1995 periodic review scheduled at the time of privatisation. Thames has taken this argument a stage further by asking for a change in its licence which rules out any further tinkering with the pricing formula between reviews. Thames will have a clearer idea of its likely revenue, but it will also be unable to pass through extra costs to customers by appealing to the regulator for a higher K factor. This leaves the company more exposed to the risk of, say, higher than expected construction prices or new environmental standards. One can only assume that Ofwat will take this into account when setting the company's rate of return on capital as part of the 1995 review. Assuming South West Water can reach agreement today, only North West is left in dispute. The issue may not be resolved until December, which partly explains the poor performance of the shares - although the abrupt departure of the new finance director on Wednesday was hardly reassuring. Still, the favourable outcome of South West's appeal last year on similar grounds suggests North West will at least get a fair hearing.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Pakistan to boost enrichment plant PAKISTAN is planning to expand its controversial uranium enrichment plant at Kahuta near Islamabad in order to provide fuel for a nuclear power reactor being bought from China, according to senior Pakistani officials. An expansion, the costs of which are being assessed by the government, could put an additional strain on Pakistan's relations with the US which cut off Dollars 573m (Pounds 382m) of aid in 1990 because it thought the Kahuta plant had made sufficient highly enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs. If Kahuta were to supply all the fuel needed for the 300MW reactor being built at Chashma on the river Indus, its output would have to expand considerably. Dr Abdul Qader Khan, founder and director of the research laboratories at Kahuta, said in an interview in Rawalpindi: 'We believe that by the time we have the Chinese reactor operational, we will have enough fuel to feed it.' The reactor is expected to be commissioned in 1997. He said the reactor would require low enriched uranium, containing about 5 per cent of the fissile isotope U-235, rather than the 90 per cent plus needed in an atomic bomb. Natural uranium contains only 0.7 per cent of U-235. Dr Khan rejected the suggestion that Kahuta was being used for nuclear weapons but acknowledged it could be. 'A knife can cut vegetables and a knife can kill human beings. So all nuclear plants and all chemical plants all over the world can be used, either for saving the human race or hurting them.' He said Pakistan would open its facilities for inspection if India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974, did the same. Dr Khan did show some conventional weapons that the laboratory makes including a Pakistani version with improved electronics of a Chinese shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile, and an anti-tank missile also of Chinese origin. Pakistani officials said some work on the latter weapon is being done with Chinese assistance at Golra, on the outskirts of Rawalpindi. In 1988, Western officials said American satellite reconnaisance had identified a suspected clandestine enrichment plant at Golra. Dr Khan described this allegation as nonsense. The Golra site is the central mechanical and transport stores of the Pakistan army.</p>

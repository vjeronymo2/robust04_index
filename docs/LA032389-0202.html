Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> QUEEN GIVES OUT 'MAUNDY' PURSES  </P> <P> Queen Elizabeth II distributed purses of specially minted "Maundy" money today  at a cathedral as part of a centuries-old Easter tradition.  </P> <P> In a ceremony dating to the 12th Century, she gave out purses to 63 men and 63  women -- one for each year of her life -- who were chosen as community leaders  in England's second largest city. A crowd of about 5,000 people watched as she  gave out the purses, each containing 63 pence ($1.08), at St. Philip's  Cathedral.  </P> <P> Each year a different cathedral is chosen for the ceremony, which is always  held on Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: US group to raise Dollars 1bn in real estate sale WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate which has been struggling with serious problems in its financial services unit, has agreed to sell most of this division's remaining real estate assets for about Dollars 1bn cash. The assets are being sold to L. W. Real Estate Investments, a newly-formed limited partnership, in which Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment bank, will be the general partner. Westinghouse will invest about Dollars 150m for a 49 per cent limited partnership interest, while Lehman Brothers will contribute a similar amount for its equity share of the partnership. The aim is for the new partnership to offload the properties as quickly as possible through securitisations 'and other accelerated sales and disposition techniques'. The assets are said to have a book value, before reserves, of Dollars 1.7bn, and are being sold for about 52 per cent of their original book value. The partnership will assume some off-balance sheet financing arrangements related to the assets. Westinghouse shares rose Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 on Thursday. Westinghouse said the Dollars 1bn consideration for the assets will exceed the reserved value of the properties. Proceeds from the sale will be used by the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate to pay down debt. Westinghouse noted the latest disposal comes on top of Dollars 1.3bn-worth of asset sales over the past six months - also at values which were in excess of reserved levels.</p>

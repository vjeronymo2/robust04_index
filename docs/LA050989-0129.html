			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS-AND-BLASPHEMY PANEL URGED;  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN, JEWISH, ISLAMIC LEADERS REACT TO RUSHDIE OUTCRY  </P> <P> County academics and visiting members of the National Council of Churches on  Monday agreed that an interfaith conference on how literature can defame any  religion would be of benefit to Muslims, Jews and Christians.  </P> <P> During a lunch meeting at UC Irvine, members of the NCC's Office of  Christian/Muslim Relations and the local Academy for Judaic, Christian and  Islamic Studies learned that they had both been contemplating similar  conferences in reaction to the outcry surrounding Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic  Verses" and Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini's subsequent death threat against the  author.  </P> <P> Since the uproar earlier this year, Christians for the most part have supported  Rushdie's right to freedom of expression, while Muslims have insisted that  their religion is defamed by the book, said Marston Speight, executive director  of Christian-Muslim relations office of the New York-based NCC, a group of 40  million mainline Protestants.  </P> <P> "Our whole life is so secularized, we're unaware," Speight said. "The outrage  of a community not so secularized shows us the degree to which we've lost our  sense of the importance of the holy in our lives."  </P> <P> Such a conference on defamation would seek to define the "holy things" that the  world's three great monotheistic religions hold in high respect, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there would be divergent views among Christians," Speight said.  </P> <P> It should also include an interfaith discussion of "The Last Temptation of  Christ," a movie featuring scenes that some Christians found offensive, as well  as "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a 19th-Century anti-Semitic French  play, said George Grose, president of the Academy, a nonprofit Anaheim Hills  research, educational and dialogue institute that promotes the historic and  theological links among Christianity, Judaism and Islam.  </P> <P> Others at Monday's conference suggested that the limits of diversity in a  pluralistic society should also be explored.  </P> <P> A dozen members of the NCC group had swung through the county as part of their  annual conference held in Los Angeles to meet with Grose and the other members  of his pioneering group in Judaic, Christian and Muslim studies.  </P> <P> Grose has taught a UCI course and tours college campuses with a dialogue  program featuring Rabbi Henri Front of Temple Beth David and Muzamil Siddiqi,  director of the Islamic Center of Orange County.  </P> <P> Siddiqi has invited the Christian group to lunch today at his center's Garden  Grove mosque.  </P> <P> Siddiqi said Monday that Muslims remain concerned about the support Rushdie  received, despite criticism in the Muslim world of his novel.  </P> <P> "It has concerned many of us, the way the Western world responded," Siddiqi  said. "A very large number came out in full support of Salman Rushdie.  </P> <P> "That has created the feeling in the minds of many Muslins that there is now an  open field. You can do whatever you want. . . . Hate campaigns, slander are all  OK under freedom of expression."  </P> <P> The NCC, however, issued a statement in March expressing "deep sympathy" for  Muslims who were insulted and offended by negative descriptions of Mohammed in  Rushdie's novel. "An offense to the religious beliefs and sensitivities to the  followers of Islam or any religion should be viewed as serious as an offense  against the religious beliefs and sensitivities of Christians," the statement  said.  </P></p>

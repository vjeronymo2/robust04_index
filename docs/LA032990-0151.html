			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> HOUSING LOAN FOR CITY CLERK  </P> <P> Pasadena officials have approved a $45,000 housing assistance loan for recently  hired City Clerk Marvell Herren, dropping an earlier plan to buy her a $305,000  home.  </P> <P> The loan was approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> The city will carry a second mortgage on Herren's new home on Cheviotdale  Drive.  </P> <P> Herren, who left her job in Foster City in October to work for Pasadena, asked  for housing assistance as a condition of employment. After she failed to find a  buyer for her house in Foster City, directors decided to buy the Cheviotdale  Drive home and allow her to live there, rent deferred, for up to a year while  she tried to sell her old home. The plan was for Herren to buy the house from  the city.  </P> <P> However, city officials dropped that plan when Herren found a buyer for the  Foster City house and no longer needed the city to buy the Cheviotdale Drive  house outright. But since she still needs $45,000 to complete the purchase of  the house, directors approved the loan.  </P> <P> Herren will pay only interest -- at a rate of 8% -- on $25,000 for five years.  At the end of five years, she must repay the $25,000. However, the city has  agreed to forgive the interest and principal on the remaining $20,000 if she  stays with the city for seven years.  </P></p>

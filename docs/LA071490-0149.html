			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVIDE JOB TO CONQUER BUILDING OF A PARTITION  </P> <P> Although the trend in home design is toward open, undivided spaces, there are  still times when you may actually want to divide big spaces up into smaller  ones. Building a walk-in closet is one reason. So is adding a darkroom or maybe  a soundproof music room.  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, the thing that gets the job done is the partition, a  simple structure that any homeowner with a saw and hammer should be able to  build.  </P> <P> Before you build a partition, draw it out to scale. This will help you  visualize the job and will make it easy to compile a shopping list for lumber.  </P> <P> At the very minimum, you'll need 2-by-4 top and bottom plates, plus 2-by-4  studs spaced every 16 inches on center. If you're framing for a door, you'll  need two or three extra studs for the trimmers, plus a six-foot 2-by-6 and a  scrap of half-inch plywood for the header.  </P> <P> The door itself? A simple prehung flush door is the easiest to install. These  come in a variety of widths from 18 to 36 inches. A 30-incher is a good  all-around size.  </P> <P> You'll also need a few pounds of 16-penny nails and a few pounds of eightpenny  nails to put everything together.  </P> <P> You have a choice of two ways to frame the wall. One is to assemble the whole  thing lying flat, then stand it up and nail it in place. The other is to build  the wall in place. Which is better?  </P> <P> Building flat on the floor is usually easier. Everything is easy to reach, and  you can nail through the plates into the ends of the studs rather than  toenailing. But, if your walls, floor and ceiling are irregular, a preassembled  wall may not fit properly without a lot of shimming and adjusting. Building the  wall in place makes more sense under these conditions.  </P> <P> For a flat assembly, start by marking the location of the proposed wall on the  floor. If possible, locate the partition so you can nail the top plate into the  ceiling joists. If this isn't possible, you'll have to cut 14 1/2-inch lengths  of the same lumber used for the joists (usually 2-by-8 stock) and nail them in  crosswise every 16 to 20 inches between existing joists. This will give you  something to nail your top plate to.  </P> <P> Back down on the floor, cut your top and bottom plates to length and mark off  the positions of your studs, 16 inches on center. Keep this 16-inch interval  constant, even if a door opening interrupts the flow.  </P> <P> Next, measure your floor-to-ceiling height and subtract three inches. This  gives you the length of your studs. Cut them all to this length and secure them  to the top and bottom plates, using a pair of 16-penny nails through the plate  and into each end of the stud.  </P> <P> If you are framing in a door, size the rough opening 2 1/2 inches wider than  your door and one inch higher. This will give you room to shim and adjust the  door frame properly later on. Next, nail together a header from two layers of  2-by-6 with a layer of half-inch plywood sandwiched between. Cut this to length  and nail it in place with 16-penny nails. Then cut your trimmer studs to  length, nail them in place, and finally, add the little cripples above the  header.  </P> <P> Now you can stand the wall up. Make sure the bottom plate is positioned  properly and tack it in place with a couple of nails. If you are working on a  concrete floor, use concrete nails. Carefully plumb the wall, using a  carpenter's level to make sure it is dead vertical in both directions. If the  wall is a bit short in spots, you may have to slip shims between the top plate  and the ceiling. A piece of cedar shingle works well.  </P> <P> When everything is positioned to your satisfaction, nail through the top plate  into the ceiling joist or your previously installed blocking, and nail through  the bottom plate into the floor. But don't nail through the section of bottom  plate running across your door opening. Instead, saw this section out and throw  it away. You can now install your door, and finish off with drywall or  paneling.  </P> <P> For in-place assembly, start by cutting top and bottom plates to length and  marking them off for proper stud placement. Install the top plate first,  nailing through it into the ceiling joists or into blocking. Once the top plate  is in place, install the bottom plate, locating it directly beneath the top  plate by using a plumb bob. Fasten the bottom plate in place by nailing it to  the floor. If you will be framing in a door, do not nail the bottom plate down  in the area of the opening.  </P> <P> Once both plates are in, measure each stud individually to fit its space.  Install the studs by toenailing with your eightpenny nails, driving in a pair  of nails from each side of each stud, both top and bottom.  </P> <P> Frame your door opening as described above. Then cut out the section of bottom  plate spanning the door opening and you are ready to install the door and  finish off the wall.  </P></p>

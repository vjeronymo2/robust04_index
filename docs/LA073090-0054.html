			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARE PROGRAM AIDS CHILD ABUSE FIGHT;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: TEAMS EDUCATE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ABOUT WARNING SIGNALS. BUT ITS  FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN BECAUSE OF STATE BUDGET CRUNCH.  </P> <P> These days, Louise Gagne is sometimes haunted by the face of a little girl who  was in her class at a well-regarded private school a few years ago.  </P> <P> "I realize now she was severely sexually abused, but I just couldn't recognize  it at the time," said Gagne. Now a teacher at Micheltorena Street Elementary  School in Silver Lake, she is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District's  highly praised anti-child-abuse program.  </P> <P> As a participant in CARE (Child Abuse: Recognize and Eliminate), Gagne is part  of a team at the school that has been specially trained to recognize the often  elusive signals of neglect and of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. She and  her peers are well-grounded in when, what and how to report suspected  incidents. The team works with staff members and parents to help head off or  defuse problems at earlier than usual stages. Perhaps most important, they  teach children how to protect themselves, including ways to fight the  life-scarring psychological effects of abuse.  </P> <P> "It's the most comprehensive, thoughtful and efficient school-based program  anywhere," said Dr. Michael Durfee, coordinator of child abuse prevention  programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> Durfee was among those who helped persuade Board of Education members in June  to leave the CARE program untouched when it needed to cut $220 million from the  district's budget.  </P> <P> However, the program faces a much bigger problem. Nearly 75% of its annual  $800,000 funding comes from a $10.1 million state program Gov. George  Deukmejian has said he wants to eliminate to help solve California's own budget  problems.  </P> <P> "It is unconscionable for the governor even to propose such a thing," Board  President Jackie Goldberg said Friday. She said it would be very difficult for  the district, which is likely to face even more cuts as a result of events in  Sacramento, to find the money to save the CARE program.  </P> <P> "We certainly would want to," Goldberg added, "but I don't know how we could."  </P> <P> The funds were intact in the budget approved by legislators on Saturday, but it  was uncertain whether they would survive the governor's expected veto of  specific budget items this week.  </P> <P> Developed by former teacher Shayla Lever, now director of the district's Child  Abuse Prevention Unit, the CARE program began in 1980 and has grown to include  152 of the district's 414 elementary schools.  </P> <P> Lever's office provides intensive training for a small, handpicked team of  staff members at each participating school, along with some basic education in  program principles for other staff members, curriculum materials, student  instruction and parent workshops. The program is designed so each school, once  training is completed, can operate nearly autonomously, freeing the 10-member  office to monitor program effectiveness, provide teaching for new staff members  and other support services, and concentrate on bringing more schools into the  fold.  </P> <P> "We have managed so far to provide the training to every school that has asked  to be included and still maintain a high level of service," said Lever, whose  project has drawn the interest of several other school districts in California.  </P> <P> Noting that victims of child abuse often grow up to be deeply troubled,  sometimes antisocial adults, who in turn abuse their own children, Lever argued  that cutting prevention program funds is a false economy.  </P> <P> One of the more tangible measures of the program lies in the statistics  tabulated annually on reports of suspected child-abuse cases from all of the  district's more than 600 schools. CARE schools, on average, submit about six  times the number of suspected cases as non-CARE schools. About 6% of those  reports are deemed unfounded by the agencies who receive them, while that  proportion ranges anywhere from 40% to 70% for the other schools.  </P> <P> State law requires principals, teachers and others to immediately report  suspected cases to a child protective agency: in Los Angeles, the county  Department of Children's Services or the local police department. Those who do  not risk facing criminal charges.  </P> <P> Child abuse is sometimes so hard to recognize that, despite the district's  widely disseminated instructions, many cases that should be reported are not,  while some incidents are submitted that turn out to be without merit, Lever  said.  </P> <P> The numbers of reports filed -- an average of 14 per school last year --  remains fairly constant for CARE schools. From July, 1989, through June, 1990,  those schools accounted for 2,129 of the 6,168 cases reported districtwide.  </P> <P> "An issue overall is simply one of correct information," said Lt. Steve Day,  former head of the Los Angeles Police Department's child protection section.  "We can generally tell if the reporter is a graduate of the CARE program."  </P> <P> Because of the state reporting law, Day added, "teachers and others tend to err  on the side of reporting. The potential to clog the system (with unwarranted  reports) is there."  </P> <P> He recalled the months after teacher Terry Bartholome's arrest in 1984, and  eventual conviction, for molesting students in his elementary school classes.  "You had institutional paranoia then," Day said.  </P> <P> In the 1985-86 school year, the number of reports from the district zoomed to  7,011. Nearly 5,500 of those came from non-CARE schools and most were  determined to have been without basis.  </P> <P> "The fallout from that was really, really detrimental," said Lever, not only  because innocent people were accused but also because, in the resulting loss of  credibility, "abused children went by the wayside."  </P> <P> Psychiatrist and child-abuse expert Dr. Roland Summit of Harbor-UCLA Medical  Center said the CARE program has many other benefits, including an emphasis on  teaching children that they are not to blame and are not unworthy if they are  unable to fend off the abuse.  </P> <P> Another benefit comes from the heightened awareness and skill of CARE school  staff members, he said.  </P> <P> "It provides more avenues of support, and it gives teachers a way to get more  comfortable (in dealing with child abuse) on an ongoing basis. That's much more  effective than bringing in a consultant for a few hours of training and then  moving on."  </P> <P> In 10 years, only three schools have dropped out of the program. Despite the  track record, the principals at most of the district's elementary schools have  not joined. They include those at the two schools Bartholome taught, and the  one at which another former teacher, Don Ray Moore, has been accused of  sexually abusing fifth-graders.  </P> <P> Lever said the reasons range from an unwillingness to make the required  substantial commitment in time and staff, to a lingering unfamiliarity with the  program, to a reluctance to acknowledge child abuse as a widespread problem.  (Experts estimate that, nationwide, at least one in five youngsters suffers  some form of abuse.)  </P> <P> At Micheltorena, Principal Eugene Sabin is so enthusiastic about the program  that he has included himself in the five-member project team.  </P> <P> "I think we have learned a lot about the needs of our students. I've been  surprised at the extent and depth of some of the problems," said Sabin, who  said his main criteria in assembling the team was to pick dedicated, energetic  teachers who had the respect of their colleagues.  </P> <P> Teacher Stephanie Buehler, a member of the CARE team since the program started  at Micheltorena two years ago, said she believes the whole staff, including  bilingual classroom aides and clerical workers, works in a coordinated way to  help children and their parents.  </P> <P> "We have a strategy, and everyone knows what it is," Buehler said, reciting the  principles the program aims at young abuse victims: Say no; get away if you  can; tell someone; it's not your fault; it will not always be like this; and  there are people who care and can help.  </P> <P> "The child knows there is a whole support network here, and many times we are  able to help parents before a situation reaches the point of abuse," agreed  teacher Donna Kusumoto.  </P> <P> She cited the case of a kindergartner who began crying as the teacher passed  out projects the youngsters had crafted for Mother's Day gifts. After some  gentle questioning, the child said her mother had threatened to throw the  offering in the trash. During a hastily arranged, informal talk, the frazzled  young working mother confided she felt under a lot of pressure and had once  told her daughter, "I wish you'd run away."  </P> <P> Kusumoto said the CARE team lined up some counseling and other help for the  family.  </P> <P> Sometimes, what happens after an incident is reported becomes as crucial as  stopping the abuse in the first place, team members said. They related a recent  case of an 11-year-old girl who said she was being molested by an uncle living  at her home. The report was investigated and the uncle was ordered by  authorities to leave the house.  </P> <P> Then the child suffered the anger of her parents, who had counted on the uncle  to help them pay the rent.  </P> <P> "It's very hard at home. They're blaming me," the girl often tells her  teachers.  </P> <P> "We're working a lot with her, trying to build up her self-esteem, assure her  that she did the right thing," Kusumoto said. "We want her to know that she is  more important than the rent, no matter what she is being told at home."  </P></p>

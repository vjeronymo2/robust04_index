			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Extraordinary items push ITT down 36% in period ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday unveiled a 36.5 per cent drop in third-quarter net income, reflecting a balance sheet cluttered with extraordinary items. The figures included an after-tax gain of Dollars 622m, or Dollars 4.71 a share from the sale of ITT's 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the French telecommunications company. This was largely offset by charges of Dollars 582m, or Dollars 4.41, to cover losses at its Hartford insurance unit. Catastrophe losses from hurricanes Andrew and Iniki reduced earnings by a further Dollars 95m, or 72 cents. Including these items, ITT recorded net income of Dollars 113m, or 60 cents, compared with Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.30, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 5.5bn against Dollars 4.9bn. ITT had warned investors about its extraordinary items in the quarter and had announced its catastrophe losses from the hurricanes. Shares in ITT eased only Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 65 1/4 yesterday in light trading. Operating income improved at five of ITT's nine leading businesses. Earnings from ITT's automotive business rose to Dollars 26m from Dollars 14m. Its forest products services business saw operating income grow to Dollars 35m from Dollars 22m. ITT Sheraton hotels had earnings of Dollars 13m, against Dollars 4m. Earnings from ITT's finance arm grew to Dollars 51m from Dollars 23m while company's communications and information services saw income advance to Dollars 53m from Dollars 43m. ITT said it was adding Dollars 680m in capital to its insurance business to strengthen its surplus position.</p>

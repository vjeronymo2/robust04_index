			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Trawlers leave disputed waters Seven Icelandic trawlers yesterday decided to leave disputed fishing waters after the Norwegian coast guard crippled several nets in a mini 'cod war' between the two countries. A coastguard vessel yesterday cut one of the wires of the Mar trawler near Svalbard, where Norway has sovereignty under a 1920 treaty, forcing it to stop fishing. The Norwegians cut one of the trawl wires of another Icelandic trawler on Saturday and on Tuesday sabotaged the nets of four Icelandic vessels and fired a warning shot at a fifth in the same area. Iceland's government has called the actions illegal, threatening to take Norway to court unless the row is settled by talks.</p>

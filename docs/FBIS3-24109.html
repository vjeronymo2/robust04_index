			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the board of the </F> Coordinating Center of Democratic Forces of Tajikistan in the  CIS, by Marina Pavlova-Silvanskaya; place and date not given:  "The Negotiations Must Not Be Dragged Out"]    [Text] [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] Reports have appeared in the  press concerning contacts between officials from Dushanbe and  representatives of the opposition living in Moscow. What does  this mean--steps toward one another, a feeling out of the ground  for negotiations?    [Latifi] The official authorities of Tajikistan have yet to  declare their readiness for negotiations. Officials are meeting  one on one, but without authority, as private individuals. A  group of high-ranking officials came here recently in the hope  of winning the return of the refugees. This was the second such  attempt, both ended in failure. Given the approach employed by  the emissaries of Dushanbe officialdom, this is not surprising.  For example, K. Kaimdodov, deputy chairman of the Supreme  Council, granted an interview to INTERFAX, in which (oh, simple  soul!) he complained: Field work will soon be starting in the  countryside, there is a shortage of manpower, and the refugees  must for this reason return.    [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What is the opposition's attitude  toward the prospect of negotiations?    [Latifi] We have always advocated negotiations. And the  first  step toward them, in our view, should be a meeting and  agreements with the leadership of Russia, we recognize Russia's  place in "big" geopolitics in the region also. We understand  that it is very difficult to solve any questions within the  former USSR, whatever it is now called, without Russia. But we  see no mediating activity on the part of Russia as yet,  unfortunately. Two institutions have been created in Russia for  a resolution of the Tajik problem. The first is the  interdepartmental commission chaired by A. Adamishin, deputy  minister of foreign affairs. It has been in existence for quite  some time, but has not met since last November.    The second is the Tajik settlement mission, which was  established in November by an edict of B. Yeltsin and is headed  by Ambassador-at-Large A. Oblov. I have met with him three times  and fully share his view of the need for a general--regional,  political, interethnic--settlement in Tajikistan. We agreed for  the time being not to notify the press of the contacts. But the  agreement has to be broken. The Foreign Ministry is patently  dragging out a settlement. We, on the other hand, believe that  the process should be accelerated.    [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What is forcing you to hurry?    [Latifi] With the arrival of spring the development of  events  could assume a catastrophic nature. The passes and roads will be  opened, and everything will be on the move. Colonel General B.  Pyankov, commander of the collective peacekeeping force, who  expressed serious concern at the state of affairs in Tajikistan,  was in Moscow recently. When even the military believes that  without negotiations with the opposition a catastrophe is  inevitable, this speaks volumes. We need to listen to the sober  voice of the army. If an escalation of the conflict begins, the  war could, according to the forecasts of independent experts,  carry over to Uzbekistan in connection with the fact that mass  privatization has now begun there and tension has increased. All  of Central Asia could flare up, and moreover, a Central Asian  arc of war could interface with the Caucasus war. There would  then be a great conflagration, about which we warned in our last  statement.    This is why the opposition is in a hurry to begin  negotiations, to come to an agreement with Russia primarily. A  statement addressed to President B. Yeltsin, Prime Minister V.  Chernomyrdin, and the Federal Assembly has been published. We  appeal to the Russian public also. It should be recognized that  there will be no reforms in Russia and Russia itself even could  explode unless the arc of fire in the south is put out in time.    [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] What, in your view, are the reasons  for  the procrastination over negotiations?    [Latifi] They could be various: a desire to profit from the  arms trade, for example, and also the voluntary or involuntary  playing into the hands of the Tashkent regime. The latter is all  but openly helping General Dostum in Afghanistan, an Uzbek by  nationality. His deputy, General Aizi, declared plainly in an  interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA that his supporters were  seeking to oust President Rabbani inasmuch as he is a Tajik.  Just about half the population of Afghanistan is composed of  Tajiks. The calculation, evidently, is that, after they have  been suppressed in Afghanistan, Tajikistan could be pulled to  pieces also and that it would disappear as an independent state.    [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] So the first step toward a settlement  should be, from your viewpoint, an official meeting of  representatives of the opposition and Ambassador A. Oblov to  discuss the conditions of the achievement of peace in  Tajikistan. And how do you see the further development of events?    [Latifi] The opposition devised its plan of action on 7  December of last year at the meeting in Tehran. It is set forth  in the special document "Proposals for a Peaceful Settlement of  the Military-Political Conflict in the Republic of Tajikistan,"  which was transmitted to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of the President.  Via N. Nazarbayev and S. Niyazov the contents of the document  were conveyed to the heads of state of the CIS. It was also sent  to Butrus-Ghali and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan,  and Afghanistan.    Responding to our proposals, Ambassador Ramiro Paris-Ballon,  the new representative of the UN secretary general, flew to  Moscow. He is now actively trying to get the Tajiks to the  negotiating table and has even traveled to Dushanbe and Gordnyy  Badakhshan for this. We met twice: before and after the trip. It  was proposed that the agenda of the negotiations consist of  three questions:    a political settlement of the situation in Tajikistan (which  would include the creation of a State Council or Council of  National Accord and also a provisional government made up of  competent and neutral persons, an end to all the criminal  proceedings instituted in connection with the political  confrontation and the civil war, and the release of all persons  in detention in this connection);    the disarmament and breakup of the so-called local  self-defense force, armed detachments of the opposition, and  special battalions of the MVD, National Security Committee, and  Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan--formations in which the  regime has as of late been registering on a general basis  combatants from particular areas of the country (Kulyab, for  example), providing them with a "legal roof." It is essential  also to confiscate from the population weapons that are being  held illegally;    refugees, who should be returned to their permanent places  of  residence--with a guarantee of safety and social protection,  return of seized assets, and so forth.    We consider these three questions inseparable from one  another.    Paris-Ballon agreed with the need for their inclusion on the  agenda. He has now gone to New York and reported on the results  of his talks to the UN leadership and several days ago he met in  Tehran with leaders of the Islamic resistance of Tajikistan. He  is to determine the budget of the mission and specify the  location of future negotiations.    [Pavlova-Silvanskaya] You yourself speak about the  possibility of an exacerbation of the situation by spring. It is  obvious, therefore, that a settlement will require the presence  of some peacekeeping contingents....    [Latifi] Even the Russian military openly acknowledges as a  commonly known fact that the regime in Dushanbe is holding on  exclusively thanks to the presence of the Russian Army. Were it  to leave, the authorities would not last a day even: They would  be swept away. These politicians, who came to Dushanbe with the  support of Russian tanks, have in a year conclusively wrecked  the economy, having brought the people to the brink of  starvation.    But we know that we cannot manage either today or tomorrow  or  the day after without Russia, and for this reason the problem of  the presence of Russian military forces in Tajikistan has to be  resolved. They could constitute the nucleus of a peacekeeping  force, but, as A. Kozyrev and British Foreign Secretary D. Hurd  say in a joint statement, Russia should for this obtain a UN  mandate for peacekeeping activity.    UN standards would specify precisely what the "blue helmets"  are entitled to do and what they are not. The arms also would be  under supervision, international observers would inspect them.  Otherwise--there are troops in the region, they will be the  peacekeepers. Today they will support one party to the conflict,  tomorrow, another.    We insist that the Tajik negotiations be conducted under the  aegis of the United Nations. They need a serious guarantor, and  their results need international recognition. Only then will the  parties feel a sense of responsibility.</p>

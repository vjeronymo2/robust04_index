			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: US lawyers victims of their own efforts Sir, There is a wonderful irony in Robert Rice's article ('Tied up in claims for damages', October 19) about the concern of US lawyers at their increasing vulnerability to large damages claims. The US legal profession has encouraged changes in law and procedures over many years which resulted in a litigation system grossly weighted in favour of the plaintiff. The effect of this has been to encourage litigation where it was not merited, and proliferate the imposition of punitive damages far outweighing compensation for loss. Perhaps this new trend giving the legal profession a taste of its own medicine will at last promote changes which will moderate the worst excess, not only for the benefit of the lawyers, but also for other professionals, corporations, and citizens who have suffered under the present system for too long.

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / EU's latest Bosnia plan passes test The leaders of Bosnia's three warring parties yesterday agreed to restart partition talks on the basis of a revamped package put forward by European Union foreign ministers. Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, announced that Moslem, Croat and Serb military leaders had re-affirmed their commitment to free access for relief convoys in Bosnia. But the significance of the new agreement, which followed an accord approved just 11 days ago, was unclear because General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, boycotted yesterday's session, the first face-to-face meeting since the collapse of all-party talks in September. Lord Owen, the EU mediator, said bilateral talks would resume immediately. He appeared to indicate that the 'action plan' stood some chance of success because of the scaled-down aims of the package. The Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, according to Lord Owen, had abandoned his demands for demilitarisation of Bosnia, saying he would insist on the deployment of Nato troops only in his mostly Moslem republic. The US, according to diplomats, has backed off from its previous promise to despatch peacekeepers to Bosnia. The EU initiative also called for the revival as soon as possible of the London Conference of August 1992, which demanded a reversal of 'ethnic cleansing' and the return of territory acquired by military force. However, hopes of territorial concessions by Bosnian Serbs to their Moslem adversaries in exchange for a phase-out of sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia seemed remote yesterday. Mr Izetbegovic said he would reject any 'unjust plan'. He is calling for the return of 'occupied territories' from the Serbs and access to Adriatic ports from the Croats. The Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and his Bosnian Serb proxy, Mr Radovan Karadzic, renewed their demands for the immediate suspension of United Nations sanctions before the Serbs made any territorial concessions. But Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday said: 'The first move has to come from the Serbs' offer of additional withdrawal, once that offer had been implemented, and there was a ceasefire, and the aid was flowing freely, then we, the Europeans, would think that the Security Council should consider suspending sanctions,' he said during the first all-party talks since the collapse of the peace process in September. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, accused all three leaders of reneging on their pledge of 11 days ago to allow the free access of humanitarian aid to some 3m people in Bosnia.</p>

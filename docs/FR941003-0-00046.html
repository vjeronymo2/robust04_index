			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 38. FDA received two comments on proposed &sect;314.53(f) regarding corrections of patent information errors. The proposed provision would require a person disputing the accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted to and published by FDA to first notify the agency in writing stating the grounds for the disagreement. The agency would then ask the NDA holder to confirm whether the patent information was correct, but would not change the patent information listed in the Orange Book unless the NDA holder withdrew or amended that information. If the NDA holder did not change the patent information, a 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant would be required to make a certification for the listed patent despite any disagreement as to its correctness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both comments said that FDA should ensure that patent information submitted to the agency is complete and applies to a particular NDA. One comment would also amend the rule to have FDA confirm, upon request from any person, the accuracy or relevance of the patent information submitted to the agency. One comment said the agency should not provide applicants the grounds for a disagreement on the accuracy or relevance of patent information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated elsewhere in this rule, FDA does not have the resources or the expertise to review patent information for its accuracy and relevance to an NDA. Therefore, the agency declines the comment's requests to ensure that patent information is complete and relevant to an NDA and to confirm, upon request, the validity of patent information submitted to the agency. The agency believes that the declaration requirements under &sect;314.53(c), as well as an applicant's potential liability if it submits an untrue statement of material fact, will help ensure that accurate patent information is submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also declines to amend the rule to prevent the agency from providing applicants the grounds for a disagreement on the accuracy or relevance of patent information. Absent such information, a patent owner will be unable to evaluate the disagreement or to explain whether the patent information is correct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39. One comment noted that proposed &sect;314.53(f) does not require applicants to correct patent listings. The comment would revise the provision to permit applicants to ``make otherwise pertinent certifications while a listing dispute is pending.'' The comment would also require FDA to notify the NDA holder of the disagreement within 15 days of notification and require patent owners or NDA holders to respond to a disagreement on patent information or to withdraw or amend the patent information within 30 days. The comment would then require FDA to immediately send the NDA holder's response to the party that began the disagreement and inform the party whether the patent would remain listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As originally proposed, &sect;314.53(f) expressly required an applicant to make ``an appropriate certification for each listed patent'' notwithstanding any disagreement as to the correctness of the listed patent information. If, as FDA assumes, the proposed reference to ``otherwise pertinent certifications'' means ``appropriate certifications,'' the proposal is unnecessary. If the proposed reference is to negate any responsibility to file an appropriate certification for a patent that is subject to a dispute over listing, FDA rejects the proposal. Until the dispute is resolved, the patent is listed within the meaning of the act. FDA also declines to amend the rule to impose deadlines for resolving patent disagreements. The agency believes that such deadlines would be impractical, considering the agency's lack of expertise in patent matters and the volume of applications FDA receives, and agency resources would be better spent on reviewing applications rather than exchanging disputed patent information among parties as proposed by the comment. The agency also notes that it has not had any significant problems with the informal procedures described in proposed &sect;314.53(f) as most NDA holders have amended or corrected their patent information after FDA has informed them of a dispute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has, however, revised &sect;314.53(f) to provide a new address for the submission of written statements disputing the relevance or accuracy of patent information. Such statements should now be directed to the Drug Information Services Branch in the Division of Drug Information Resources. This change reflects current FDA operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Section 314.54_Procedure for Submission of an Application Requiring Investigations for Approval of a New Indication for, or Other Change From, a Listed Drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;314.54(a)(1)(vii) would require an applicant seeking approval of a drug product that represents a modification of a listed drug, to provide certain information regarding marketing exclusivity if the applicant believed the modification would be entitled to such exclusivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency received no comments on this provision and has finalized it without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

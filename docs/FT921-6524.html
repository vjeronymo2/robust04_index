			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK farmers competing on equal terms, says Gummer UK FARMERS in general are competing on equal terms with other farmers in the European Community, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, told the House of Commons Agriculture Committee yesterday. 'It is very difficult to argue that taken overall the British farmer is at a disadvantage,' Mr Gummer told the committee, which is looking at the UK's Pounds 5.4bn food and drink trade gap. Mr Gummer said he would vigorously prosecute any case where the UK was shown to be unfairly discriminated against and that had any hope of standing up in the European Court. However, the court was a last resort because of the length of time involved; most cases could be resolved speedily through the commission or by bilateral pressure. Asked if he was pressing for increased EC milk quotas for the UK, which is not self-sufficient in dairy products, Mr Gummer said the idea of self-sufficiency had been signed away to the single European market. If the UK were to seek more milk quota, the French would in future be entitled to call for sufficient quota to be self-sufficient in sheepmeat. France is an important market for UK sheepmeat. While the UK was against quotas, once they had been established as they have been for milk it was difficult to remove them, Mr Gummer said. He also pointed out that UK milk was still being sold into intervention. It should be perfectly possible to restructure the industry to manufacture for the top end of the market, he suggested. British food standards were the highest in the world, but the image of British food abroad was not as good as it should be. This could be changed in time, Mr Gummer said pointing to several British success stories - the sliced loaf, used to make 'le British sandwich', beef, lamb, biscuits, and jams.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GAINING MOMENTUM;  </P> <P> SEINFELD ISN'T THE WROLD'S TALLEST MAN, BUT HE IS ON HIS WAY UP  </P> <P> Supporters say he has it all: wit, freshness, unpredictability and timing, an  Everyman comic for everybody. Detractors answer that he's facile but  unprovocative, amusing but hardly influential, just more white bread in the  land of generic comedy.  </P> <P> One thing's for sure: Jerry Seinfeld is on his way up, albeit less rapidly than  some overly enthusiastic college-venue publicists have proclaimed in the past.  </P> <P> The comic, who will take time out from taping 13 new episodes of his critically  acclaimed "Seinfeld" TV series to perform at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center on  Friday, admits to being embarrassed by the bell-clanging hyperbole that  surrounded his last appearance on that campus nearly a year ago. The university  had immodestly billed him then as "America's most imitated comedian" and "the  king of observational comedy."  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from the set of "Seinfeld," the 36-year-old  entertainer laughed when reminded of the incident, saying "it was like a circus  billing, like 'The World's Tallest Man' or something."  </P> <P> This time around, the university's PR people have taken care to avoid  superlatives that leave little room to move. The crowing is limited to calling  him "the hot comic voice of observational humor and star of the NBC sitcom 'The  Seinfeld Chronicles' " (a reference to the sitcom's original title).  </P> <P> Besides putting together the new episodes for "Seinfeld," which may enter NBC's  lineup as early as this month or as late as January, Seinfeld is beating the  media-drum to gain momentum. The 30-minute show has already piqued much  interest -- critics tended to gush about it when four episodes were aired  earlier this year and the ratings were strong.  </P> <P> That success surprised Seinfeld, who wasn't sure how the ongoing story line of  a comic going about day-to-day stuff. "I didn't know it would have such a broad  appeal."  </P> <P> When asked to explain that appeal, Seinfeld hesitated, then thought of Jackie  Gleason. "They asked Gleason about the incredible longevity of 'The  Honeymooners' and he just said it was funny. I guess that's the same thing,  funny transcends everything."  </P></p>

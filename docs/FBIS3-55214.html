			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Loshak report under the "In the Country" rubric: </F> "Without Newspapers?"]    [Text] There has been no conflict more serious between the  press and the authorities in this country than the one that  erupted at the end of last year. Trade union leaders and  editors in chief of central newspapers have advised the prime  minister with coal miners-style bluntness and solidarity of  their plans to cease issuing their publications unless Viktor  Chernomyrdin changes his Decree No. 1233 concerning printers,  paper industry workers, and mailmen. If the professional  rebellion is in any way different from others that have already  swept the country a number of times, it is that the newsmen have  not said a single word about their own well-being. The only  thing they request is: Do not give ill-conceived orders the  most immediate consequences of which will tighten the noose  around the entire press and thus the possibilities of tens and  tens of millions of people to get printed information.    The letter signed by 25 editors in chief is unique also  because newspapers of nearly the entire political spectrum have  seen their interests converge at the point of death. Faced with  the threat of a sixfold or higher rise in tariffs, even the most  well-to-do ones have sensed the chill of nonexistence. As  co-authors of a letter challenging the government, all of them  have displayed a certain courage, but what I see as a desperate  step was taken precisely by those who issue their publications  using that same government's money. While rebuking or ignoring  the rest, the government can simply cut off oxygen from its own  newspapers. The restive ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI may be a case in  point -- according to rumors, the plans are to close the  newspaper and to set up a new, obedient publication in its stead.    Many people suspect that by driving tariffs through the roof  with one hand and handing out subsidies with the other, the  authorities are conducting a selection on the current newspaper  market. All the more so because journalists have already  swallowed without a wince the trial pill of the House of the  Russian Press being taken away from them.    On the whole, nothing extraordinary has been under way: the  redistribution taking place on the markets of authority and  ownership cannot but trigger yet new battles on the information  market. When it has finally dawned that to come to power in  this country one needs simply to stick around in the television  box as long as possible, the main battles broke out behind  television programs' scenes. Given that the biggest bucks in  the information business are made precisely behind those same  scenes, neither strange edicts on the fourth channel, nor  regular reshuffles of television chiefs, nor the fact that upon  hearing cries "Thief!" no one rushed to fire or arrest anyone  come as a surprise.    It is television that has drawn a line without any help from  the press at an entire stage of the mass media's evolution. The  celebration of the new political year was a propaganda fiasco of  such scope that people usually do not get back to their former  jobs in Federal Information Centers, ministries, or press  services. However this matter might be resolved technically,  there is nothing to be done with the public opinion any longer.  I do not rule out a situation, however, where someone in the  president's or the prime minister's entourage would start  whispering: Former ministers are gone, and see what happened --  the press staged a mutiny.    If this is a mutiny, it is a mutiny of despair. It evolves  against the backdrop of determining the results of subscription.  By and large, the readers' audience is beginning to melt, if it  is not already melting. There is only a total of three  newspapers with 1 million or more subscribers, whereas as early  as one year ago there were nearly 10 of them.    In fact, leaving the letter of the editors in chief  unanswered, the authorities are simply drawing practical  conclusions from their assessment of the press' performance on  the eve of the party vote. For those who themselves are to bear  most of the blame, the journalists' fault is both convenient and  evident. A politician reproached MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI for having  failed, along with other newspapers, to warn society about the  threat of Zhirinovskiy. When the critic was shown a November  issue, in which even the cover spoke about the threat, he at  once "turned his coat:" Zhirinovskiy allegedly won because you  advertised him, among other things. Having published their  letter in 25 publications, the leaders of journalists unions and  editors in chief have to a certain extent become hostages to the  government. After all, people subscribed to IZVESTIYA, TRUD,  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and so forth, not to Chernomyrdin. It is  the publications that should be held responsible. But to an  even greater extent we are still hostages to the printers,  mailmen, and paper industry workers. Publishers have already  attributed the current fourfold (!) increase in prices to the  government decree, against which the newsmen's letter is aimed.  In the first half of last year, however, the publishers did not  need any decree at all to effect an almost similar price rise.  What if our letter will serve the interests of yet another  state monopoly? Will the signature by the president of the  publishers' association be a sufficient guarantee?    Indeed, government decree No. 1233 elicits both bewilderment  and protest. But who can guarantee that subsidies instead will  not raise even more questions? Will we be able to find common  ground then? The statement is only a preamble, albeit an  important one, to further solidarity actions.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Germany sunk by four minutes of Bulgarian inspiration - A look at the weekend's action which decided the tournament's semi-finalists This was definitely not supposed to happen. On a clear blue New Jersey day, Bulgaria sandbagged Germany, inflicting a 2-1 defeat on the defending World Cup champions. There was no luck about it. Down one to a Matthaus penalty early in the second half, two moments of unadulterated inspiration in the span of four minutes by Stoichkov and Letchkov, merely the brightest stars in a whole Bulgarian galaxy yesterday, turned the match. In the 75th minute, with Mikhailov's goalpost at the other end still shivering from a mighty strike by Moller, Stoichkov was brought down about 25 yards out by the same player. If he made a meal out of the foul, Stoichkov confected a banquet out of the free kick. It was exquisitely weighted - not too hard, not too soft, nor too high as an earlier effort from the same vicinity had been. It cleared the leaping wall by inches before sailing just inside the angle of the crossbar and Illgner's left-hand post. The German goalkeeper never moved a muscle. But he was flying through the air four minutes later, though to no avail. There did not seen much danger in Iankov's cross from the right, not with Kohler patrolling the middle of the area. But Letchkov somehow leaped above and around Kohler and the ball rocketed off his bald pate into the top right corner. This was fitting justice for Letchkov, who had played so well throughout, almost floating out of German tackles in mid-field and nudging his team-mates on. For it was he who was adjudged to have fouled Klinsmann after 47 minutes. It looked a 50-50 call. Wagner's cross bounced high across the Bulgarian area. Klinsmann touched it on but it still bounced high and he and Letchkov went for it, feet up. But the German striker is the Olivier of the World Cup and as contact was made he crumpled in true style. Mikhailov, who had saved three penalties in the shoot-out against Mexico, went to his right while Matthaus - making a record-equalling 21st appearance in a World Cup finals game, joining his countryman Uwe Seeler, Wladislaw Zmuda of Poland and Argentina's Diego Maradona - chose the other corner, decisively. That might have been it - and surely would have been if Moller's 73rd minute cracker from a pass by Hassler had not hammered against the post. Rudi Voller put in the rebound but was ruled offside. But Bulgaria could point to its own bad luck against the woodwork in the 12th minute from Balakov, working off a lovely laid back pass from Stoichkov. And for each fine Mikhailov save - the 52nd minute one from Hassler was exceptional - Illgner was under comparable pressure The whole match, sharply contested (eight yellow cards), featured parry-and-thrust beyond number. Bulgaria had a wonderful purple patch about one third the way through the first half, while Germany's best was the opening 20 minutes of the second. Letchkov was especially fine, but so, inevitably, was Stoichkov, removed after 83 minutes in a sharp move by Dimitar Penev, the coach, after Stoichkov received one yellow card for protesting too much and threatened to get another. Kostadinov, Sirakov and Balakov all shone and the defence was solid. Ironically, Hamburg mid-fielder Letchkov, who was 27 yesterday, is the only German-based player in the Bulgarian squad. For Germany, Hassler and Moller were indefatigable, but Klinsmann and Voller never clicked as they had against Belgium. Matthaus, again, rarely came forward until it was very late, too late in fact. If the Germans were complacent it was understandable. The only time in 13 matches that a West German side lost to Bulgaria was in 1960 (coincidentally also by 2-1), and though the Bulgarian record against East Germany was even it had never beaten a unified team, either before the last war or since the two Germanies came together. When the tiny knot of Bulgarian supporters in a crowd of 72,000 heard the final whistle they made the sort of noise that compensated for all those lost years.</p>

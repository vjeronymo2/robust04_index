			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Strong yen takes its toll on Inchcape SHARES IN Inchcape fell 5 per cent yesterday after currency movements caused the international services and marketing group to report interim results below market expectations. The UK group's pre-tax profits rose 11.2 per cent to Pounds 130.4m in the six months to June 30, on sales 29 per cent higher at Pounds 3.01bn. However, a currency gain of Pounds 16m, caused by sterling's devaluation, was more than outweighed by the strength of the yen. Inchcape handles substantial export business out of Japan, including distributing Toyota cars, and the appreciation of the Japanese currency reduced profit margins. The motors business was, nevertheless, Inchcape's strongest area, raising operating profits 32 per cent to Pounds 102m. Services, which include insurance, shipping and testing, raised operating profits 22 per cent to Pounds 27.9m, in spite of the tough Japanese market. Profits from marketing fell 19 per cent to Pounds 28.1m. Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, blamed the Japanese recession and restraints on Malaysian consumer spending. Sir David Plastow, chairman, said: 'Although there are signs of recovery in the UK and US, and Asian economies outside Japan remain strong, this has been offset by continuing recession in Japan and the steep downturn in continental Europe.' He added: 'Some of our markets are healthy or on the mend, others have become or continue to be difficult. For the present, we can look forward to continuing to perform well in some areas but shall need to be patient in others.' The motors figures were boosted by a three-month contribution from motor distributor TKM, bought for Pounds 383m in March last year, plus rising production from Toyota GB's new factory in Derbyshire. Toyota's UK sales jumped 43 per cent, giving it more than 3 per cent of the market for the first time. Other UK franchises also performed well, with excellent contributions from its retail dealerships. While the UK had at last recovered, Sir David said all the continental European markets turned decisively downwards. Austerity measures meant car exports to China were unlikely to be as strong in the second half. Sir David said Inchcape was no longer committed to its target of keeping motors, marketing and services in the ratio 50:25:25. He said motors offered a good opportunity at present, which the group was ready to pursue. Gearing fell from 43 to 40 per cent per cent. Interest payments increased from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 15.1m, partly because of investment, and partly because last year's figure was unusually low. Earnings per share rose 8.9 per cent to 15.9p (from 14.6p). The interim dividend rose 7 per cent to 5.8p (from 5.4p). Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- General Michael Rose,  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander for former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Lieutenant General Ratko Mladic,  commander of the army of the Srpska republic, had talks in Pale  this afternoon.    After the meeting General Rose told journalists he was  pleased with the meeting today. "The talks were interesting and  related to an exchange of views on issues of interest to both  sides," he said.    Speaking about the specific content of the talks today,  General Mladic said: "General Rose presented vague claims in  connection with some issues but they were clarified by the Serb  side."    "I explained the same to General Briquemont. The rotation of  UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica falls within the competence of  lower-ranking UNPROFOR commanders and it should not be blown up  out of proportion, because that is precisely what Muslims and  all those who are sponsoring them want in creating a smokescreen  for the world public in order to conceal the Croat-Muslim war,"  Mladic said.    "As regards Tuzla airport, this is a concocted problem  serving the same purpose, but the smokescreen is much thicker  and bigger. There is no reason why we should haggle over this  issue, as all the convoys can enter both Srebrenica and Tuzla as  they please," Mladic said.    "However, Muslims have got bad advisers and think that we  are  naive and will easily swallow their bait. I informed General  Rose about the fact that the Muslims and Croats declared war on  the Serb people. Let them take it back; it will be easy to find  a speedy agreement on everything, including Tuzla. There are  also airports on Serb territory. Serbs cannot even receive  vaccines for babies while the Muslims can even seek to control  all international airports. We will talk about this with the  warring sides," Mladic said.    "We have never had any conflicts with UNPROFOR commanders,  nor with any generals, because it was not the United Nations  that declared war on us, but Tudjman and Izetbegovic," the Serb  commander concluded.</p>

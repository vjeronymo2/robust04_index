			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese shares resume their downtrend THE TWO-DAY recovery in Japanese share prices was wiped out yesterday as arbitrage-related selling, prompted by an overnight fall on Wall Street and the lower yen and bond prices, dominated activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 508.57, or 2.4 per cent lower at 21,072.15, down 1.2 per cent on the week. It opened at the day's high of 21,527.81 but soon turned down, falling to the day's low of 21,008.92 during the morning session. Volume dropped to 180m shares from 250m. Declines outnumbered advances by 805 to 176 with 153 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 25.92 to 1,584.86 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.51 to 1,218.53. Light buying by foreign investors on the main market, and active foreign buying over-the-counter provided a glimmer of light, with the Nikkei OTC index rose by 1 per cent, advancing for the third consecutive day. 'Foreigners, especially European investors, are targeting companies with high growth potential,' said Mr Kotaro Aoki at Ichiyoshi Securities. International blue chips lost ground with Hitachi down Y28 to Y911 and NEC losing Y30 to Y1,160. NTT fell Y5,000 to a new all time low of Y695,000. Large-capital stocks lost ground on institutional selling. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, fell Y1 to Y351 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y9 to Y645. Speculative stocks were among the few winners, Clarion rising Y28 to Y975 and Nippon Carbon by Y70 to Y2,050 on buying by dealers looking for quick profits. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 353.95 to 22,625.39 in volume of 33.4m shares. Trading was dominated by cross trading and window dressing ahead of the March book closing. Nintendo, the game maker, firmed Y100 to Y10,500. The issue initially fell on reports that the company was planning to buy a stake in a US major league baseball team based in Seattle, which some investors feared would spark criticism in the US. However, reports of favourable reaction from local citizens, prompted some buying. Roundup TOKYO'S fall and domestic concerns influenced trading in the Pacific Rim yesterday. HONG KONG dropped in heavy trading as investors dumped the shares they had picked up the previous day on a report that the ousted Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyan had been cleared of charges linked to the June 1989 pro-democracy movement. The story was denied by the Chinese authorities after the close on Thursday. The Hang Seng Index slid 25.76 to 4,600.08, its first decline in a record-breaking advance over the previous nine sessions but up 3.3 per cent on the week. Turnover eased to HKDollars 3.02bn from HKDollars 3.52bn. In a weak banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 25 cents to HKDollars 36.75 while in conglomerates, Jardine Matheson slid 75 cents to HKDollars 43. AUSTRALIA slumped as the local currency and the bond market both plunged, though late action by the Reserve Bank of Australia to offer to buy bonds provided some support. The All Ordinaries index ended down 19.6 at 1,615.8, for a loss of 3.4 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to ADollars 313m from ADollars 259m. Banking shares all dropped. Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 4 cents to ADollars 7.41, Westpac Banking lost 7 cents to ADollars 4.15 and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group fell 12 cents to ADollars 4.37. SEOUL ended lower as investors turned cautious after the rapid rises of the past three days. The composite index fell 9.43 to 658.04, for a 6.7 per cent rise on the week. Turnover remained active at Won541.1bn after Won631.1bn. TAIWAN moved strongly against the trend, the weighted index closing 121.59, or 2.4 per cent higher at 5243.60, up 3.9 per cent on the week. The market was encouraged by the recent trend in Hong Kong but, given yesterday's performance, thought likely to pull back in today's trading. BANGKOK saw turnover rise to a record Bt12.59bn from Bt10.89bn, while the SET index closed a modest 1.37 higher at 781.63, 1.4 per cent up on the week.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / People: Crosby Homes Proof that a good sales technique does work - sometimes. Nick Carter, 32, has just been made managing director of Crosby Homes (North West), part of the Berkeley Group. Not that he has much background in buying land and housebuilding, but his sales technique so impressed Tony Pidgley, chief executive and joint founder of the Berkeley Group that Pidgley offered him a job. Up till then Carter - a graduate of Leeds University with a degree in design and technology - had been selling Porsche cars at a Guildford showroom, a number of them to Pidgley and his family. Carter took a job as a land buyer for Crosby Homes, climbing the rungs until he became the land director for the north west. Carter takes over in the north west from David Jackson, 50, the longest-serving member of the Berkeley Group, who has been appointed managing director of Crosby Homes (Midlands). He in turn takes over from Geoff Hutchinson (above), 35, who becomes managing director of Crosby Homes group, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Berkeley Group.</p>

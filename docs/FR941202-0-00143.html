			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> DOT Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Department clearly and specifically limited the NPRM to consideration of whether blood testing should be used for situations in which breath testing was not readily available for reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests, or in ``shy lung'' situations. For this reason, the issue raised by some commenters of whether employers should have the flexibility or discretion to use blood testing as an alternative to breath testing, even when breath testing is readily available in reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing or even in random or pre-employment testing, is outside the scope of the rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, we remain convinced, for the reasons explained in the preamble to 49 CFR Part 40 published on February 15, 1994, that the Department made a sound decision to designate evidential breath testing as the basic method of alcohol testing to be used in DOT programs. Consequently, the Department will not authorize the use of blood testing as an alternative to breath in the wide range of circumstances recommended by some commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the NPRM proposal itself, the Department is mindful of the concerns expressed by employees and unions about the invasiveness of blood testing. As the Department recognized in the preambles to the NPRM and to the February 15 final rule, blood testing is the most invasive type of testing available, and is likely to create more anxiety among employees than other methods. Blood testing is the only testing method that, if conducted improperly by an ill-trained or inattentive collector, can do serious physical harm to an employee. Moreover, while we recognize a point made by some commenters that employees have accepted blood alcohol testing in some circumstances, we think that the greater invasiveness of this approach would, on the whole, make employee acceptance of the program more, rather than less, difficult to obtain. Employee acceptance is one factor that leads to the success of an alcohol misuse prevention program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another factor we have taken into consideration is the added program complexity that would result from including blood testing in the Department's programs. Laboratories would have to be certified to test the blood samples. As the division among commenters on this point demonstrates, the best solution to this problem is not clear. In our view, DHHS certification would be the highest standard for accuracy and reliability of testing. However, there would be considerable costs to laboratories and the Department, as well as some delays in program implementation, if DHHS had to create a laboratory certification program for blood alcohol testing, as it has for urine drug testing. Assuming that the number of tests involved is small (see discussion below) it might well not be cost effective for laboratories to go through a DHHS certification process. State-certified laboratories appear to vary in reputation for quality as well as in terms of availability; not all states have state or state-certified laboratories that would accept specimens for purposes of DOT-mandated testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned in the preamble of the NPRM, the Department has expressly declined to use laboratories certified by private organizations (such as the CAP) in the drug testing context, and the comments did not provide a persuasive rationale for taking a different course with respect to alcohol testing. Using state or privately certified laboratories as an interim measure until DHHS-certified laboratories are ready could create concern among employees and employers about ensuring the highest level of accuracy in the program. The other procedural issues discussed in the comments_DOT national uniform procedures vs. reliance on differing state procedures, whether there should be a standard DOT blood testing kit and what should be in it, what should constitute a fatal flaw, etc._also suggest that it would be a very complex matter to devise an appropriate set of procedures for blood testing. Other questions arise because of the relationship of non-evidential screening test devices and blood tests. For example, suppose a saliva screening device indicates that an employee tests positive for alcohol. The blood test result will not be available from the laboratory for two or three days. What happens to the employee in the meantime? This is a problem we do not face with evidential breath testing, since a confirmation test result is available immediately, a point which we view as a significant advantage of breath testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the drug testing rules, we explicitly prohibit on-site testing, in part for the reason that we consider it inappropriate for an employer to take any action against an employee, absent a confirmed and verified positive test result. (Concern about the accuracy of devices was also involved in this decision.) A similar situation would occur if an employee had a positive on-site screening test for alcohol and the employer stood him or her down pending receipt of the laboratory confirmation test result. On the other hand, from a safety point of view, there is much to recommend to employers that they stand an employee down after a positive on-site screening test, since no one wants to send (for example) a truck driver back onto the road when we have a test result suggesting that the driver may have alcohol in his or her system. The comments on the subject favored standing employees down in this situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

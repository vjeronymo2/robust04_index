			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Turkey raises interest rates Turkey's central bank yesterday moved to quell recent currency turbulence by raising interest rates to 240 per cent from 70 per cent in the overnight market. Before trading opened yesterday, the lira had lost around 11 per cent against the dollar in two days. The nervousness follows three months when the lira had been steady at around TL31,000 to the dollar, and interest rates had been moving down. The central bank's official opening price yesterday was TL35,291 to the dollar. After the Central Bank move, the rate had steadied to around TL34,000. The uncertainty resulted as traders moved to anticipate a large repayment of government bonds, issued initially at rates as high as 400 per cent as the government sought to finance its budget.</p>

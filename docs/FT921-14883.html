			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Observer: Know-alls Besserwessi, a jolly new compilation with unfortunate connotations, has been elected word of the year for 1991 by the German Language Society in Wiesbaden. A play on the expression for a know-all, it is used to sum up the irritatingly superior demeanour of some westerners coping badly with poorer eastern cousins. Confronted with a list of 10,000 words and expressions purporting to encapsulate life in 1991, a learned jury chose to focus on the etymological consequences of unification. Hence it passed over day-to-day trivia like celebratory Mozart-Kitsch, even if it tarried admiringly over the 'No blood for oil' slogan minted during the Gulf war protests. Other contenders, including expressions such as The Wild East, the Wealth Wall and the newly-coined economic euphemism, Zero Short-time Working, also underscored the lingering contrasts between the two parts of the country. Auslanderhass is another newcomer spotted by the jury. Spawned during this year's outbreak of xenophobic attacks in the streets, the expression, meaning hatred of foreigners, has largely replaced the older and less blunt phrase 'animosity'. This new coinage is expected to show staying power.</p>

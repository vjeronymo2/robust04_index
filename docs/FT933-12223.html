			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Hauliers' strike threat to Italy food SUPPLIES of essential materials including foodstuffs and petrol were threatened yesterday by the onset of a two-week strike of Italy's independent road hauliers. Talks between the government and Unatras, the independent road hauliers' association, are due to continue today to find a compromise, but the two sides remain far apart. The strike threatens devastating disruption at a time of political uncertainty. Road haulage accounts for 62 per cent of all freight in Italy and Unatras members carry roughly two thirds of this. Already yesterday anxious motorists had exhausted supplies of petrol in many of the major cities. This is the Ciampi government's first serious challenge from a trade organisation. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, has adopted a tough stance towards what he regards as excessive demands from Unatras at a moment when unions and management have agreed to keep wage demands below inflation. If necessary, the government says it has prepared emergency measures for essential distribution and could invoke legislation forcing Unatras members back to work. However, matters could be complicated if road hauliers decide to block main roads as some have threatened. The strike has been the result of a dispute over new tariffs and fiscal treatment dating back to last year. The association is demanding a 10 per cent increase in tariffs. The government is offering 2 per cent for 1993 and 3 per cent for 1994.</p>

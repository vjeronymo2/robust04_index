			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Ashdown calls for defeat of BNP The first priority of every democratic political party must be to stamp out the far-right British National Party in Tower Hamlets in May's council elections, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, told his party's London region conference last night. Mr Ashdown said the politics of race must not be allowed to get a grip again in London's East End. Provided that was the first priority of the Liberal Democrat campaign in the Isle of Dogs, where the BNP won a by-election in September, he would campaign there. A Liberal Democrat inquiry found that some of the party's activists in Tower Hamlets had pandered to racist sentiment in leaflets distributed during the by-election. Tower Hamlets party members accepted the findings this month only after being threatened with suspension from the national party.</p>

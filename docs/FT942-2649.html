			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Canadian inflation below zero Inflation in Canada has disappeared, with the year-on-year consumer price index falling in May for the first time since mid-1955. Statistics Canada said yesterday that consumer prices fell by 0.2 per cent last month. The annual inflation rate for the year to May was also minus 0.2 per cent. Inflation has been falling steadily since 1991 when it reached a peak of 5.9 per cent. High interest rates and the 1991-93 recession gave the initial impetus to weakening prices.</p>

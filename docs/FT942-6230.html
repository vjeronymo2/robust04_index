			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Pragmatism and opportunism, but no programme yet: Australian opposition leader Alexander Downer, one week on Only hours after Mr Alexander Downer took over as leader of Australia's opposition Liberal party, a public opinion poll had him nine points ahead of Labor's incumbent, Mr Paul Keating, as the electorate's preferred prime minister. Nearly 60 per cent of voters polled also thought an opposition led by Mr Downer had a better chance of beating Mr Keating's Labor government than one led by Mr John Hewson, Mr Downer's ousted predecessor. 'Not so much a honeymoon - more of a love-in,' remarked one commentator. Sustaining this boost to the opposition's fortunes and capturing it in an appealing manifesto will prove more difficult. For, while media attention has been concentrated on the Liberals' leadership crisis and the recent personality jockeying, the party has faced a policy void ever since it lost the last election, in March 1993. Going into that vote, the opposition's position was clear enough. Mr Hewson, a career economist before his switch into federal politics, had spelt out a free-market economic reform package which was far more extensive than anything Labor proposed. According to a party policy document called Fightback] a Hewson government would have moved swiftly to deregulate Australia's labour markets, largely eradicating compulsory arbitration and occupational awards; switched the taxation emphasis from direct to indirect via the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST); and, in all likelihood, passed control of monetary policy to an independent central bank. But the prescription apparently proved too strong for an Australian electorate, squeezed by recession and fearful of the GST. Largely as a result of this, the opposition lost a supposedly 'unlosable' election. Today, the question is what sort of policies Mr Downer can articulate without running into the more moderately paced reforms pursued by Labor. In his first week, the new opposition leader has given few direct hints  - except to suggest that rigid ideology will be low on the agenda. Immediately after the leadership ballot, he refused to be drawn on specific policy issues, saying only that a 'directional document' would be issued in the next few months. Even that would centre on broad guidelines, rather than detailed strategies. '(This) is not an ideological party, or a frightening party. . . it is a practical, commonsense party and we will address issues in a practical, commonsense way,' he said. Commentators also struggled to read much into the revamped shadow cabinet, announced on Thursday. There was an inevitable preference for either Mr Downer's supporters or those of Mr Peter Costello, who joined Mr Downer on the 'youth ticket' and becomes shadow treasurer. But Mr Hewson stays on, as industry spokesman. Overall, the team is thought to be 'drier' than that of Mr Hewson, but Mr Downer himself has indicated that it was picked primarily with a view to giving Labor a rough political ride, rather than because of its ideological affiliations. Shadow ministers, he said, would have to be 'strong in terms of their attack on the Labor party, in exposing the weaknesses of the Labor government'. As for Mr Downer himself, he comes into the Liberal leadership position with little ideological baggage. His most recent job was shadow treasurer, articulating the opposition's economic policy, and he is widely thought to have handled the task well. But for much of the time, the Downer programme was to acknowledge Australia's increasingly cheerful economic numbers, and then poke holes in Labor's response to them. This approach had the merit of making Mr Downer appear fair-minded, while throwing the spotlight on the weaker points - such as lagging business investment - in the Keating strategy. However, for the most part, it was an effective piecemeal attack, rather than a comprehensive statement of alternative policy. That said, some economic cornerstones were established, and will probably form the basis for policy development in the months ahead. Mr Downer has, for example, consistently suggested that the financial leeway afforded to the government from Australia's faster-than-expected economic recovery should be used to reduce the budget deficit. Failure to do so, he has warned, will intensify the upward pressure on interest rates, and discourage the corporate sector. He has also highlighted Australia's low household saving ratio as a critical area of concern. Lack of domestic savings, he has warned, is likely to exacerbate balance of payments problems, and fuel a 'boom-and-bust' economy. Other key policy elements are likely to include measures to encourage investment by small businesses, and a few of the former Fightback] features  -such as faster micro-economic reform in areas like the labour market, where the government's new industrial relations law is coming under heavy attack from employer groups, and greater independence for the Reserve Bank. But there are also indications that the opposition's future policy emphasis will be wider ranging, putting additional weight on social issues, not just economic ones. On one level, a change of tack is almost certainly wise: the economy has been recovering strongly. But on the broader plane, there are some large lacunae in Liberal party policy. For example, its handling of the high-profile and emotionally charged 'Mabo' issues - the land rights and compensation entitlements of Australia's indigenous peoples - has been disastrous, with the party appearing both callous and inconsistent. The Labor government can also fairly claim to have taken a formidable initiative on Australia's chronic unemployment problem, with a recently announced ADollars 6.5bn (Pounds 3.1bn) jobs programme. Last week, Mr Downer quickly took a tough line on immigration while unemployment remains high. This appears to be of growing concern to voters, although the proposed modest increase in this year's migrant intake will largely be filled by Chinese in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The new opposition leader also trod a shrewd line on the republic debate, suggesting that constitutional change was more likely under a Liberal government, while also saying he felt that such a change was too complex. One week on, then, pragmatism and opportunism seem to be the order of the day for the new opposition leader. But whether they eventually add up to a coherent package which the electorate will buy, remains to be proved.</p>

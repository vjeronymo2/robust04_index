			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> As a high school senior and editor of Santa Barbara High School's newspaper,  the Forge, I was interested to read of the financial demise of numerous Los  Angeles-area high school newspapers. The problems faced by these high school  publications are disturbing and sad.  </P> <P> As school districts across the state face the fact that budgets need to be  reduced, high school papers are an easy target for cuts. Our school district is  no exception, and as a result the Forge's staff and adviser have been forced to  look in new directions for the money we need to print our paper. Thanks to a  combination of hard work by the students and concern on the part of the  school's administration, we are able to publish an eight-page issue every other  week. It isn't easy to acquire the money we need, but involving the entire  staff in fund-raising is an important part of the process. Every student is  required to call potential advertisers and collect the money from these ads.  </P> <P> The dilemma of apathy among the student body is perhaps even more worthy of the  attention of school administrations than budget woes. Journalism is exciting  and educational, and the experience of working as a team to accomplish a common  goal may well be as important as learning how to write a lead or put text in  columns.  </P> <P> ROBIN ADLER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

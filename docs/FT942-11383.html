			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / W German industrial orders on the rise West German industrial orders rose for the third month in a row in March, showing an increase of almost 3 per cent over the previous month, and reinforcing expectations of economic recovery. Export orders rose by 5.8 per cent and domestic industrial orders by 1.2 per cent, but domestic consumer demand continued to flag, with consumer goods orders declining by 3.7 per cent in the same period. The best performing sector was capital goods, with orders up 5 per cent, according to economics ministry figures. Orders for raw materials and intermediate goods were up 3 per cent. Industrial production figures for March are expected to show an increase of between 1.5 and 2 per cent, after a rise of 1.3 per cent in February, the first rises in nearly two years. They suggest that the rise in export orders is already feeding through into production. Some economists suggested yesterday that the strength of the improved figures and indications of growing confidence in the economic outlook might prompt an upward revision of growth forecasts. Most economists expect the west German economy to grow between 0.5 and one per cent this year, while the government forecasts a rise of 1 per cent.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: N America helps BICC to Pounds 63m - Continental Europe cable and UK construction still under pressure BICC, the cables and construction group, lifted first-half pre-tax profits by 26 per cent from a restated Pounds 50m to Pounds 63m. The rise, for the half year to July 2, was in line with City expectations and came in spite of a slight fall in turnover from Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds 1.93bn. Earnings per share rose by 10 per cent, from 8.2p to 9p, but the interim dividend is held at 6p. Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said economic recovery was well-established in North America and was developing satisfactorily in the UK and Australasia. But continental European cable markets remained difficult in the first half and margins in the UK construction sector continued to come under severe pressure, in spite of signs of volume recovery in parts of the market. In construction, Balfour Beatty's heavy civil and power contracting business again performed well and the order book for these and other businesses remained satisfactory. Sales were lower, however, because of the substantial completion of the Channel tunnel project and the company's caution in tendering for highly competitive contracts in the the latter part of 1993. Sir Robin said the issues relating to the tunnel contract had been substantially resolved. The company would give more financial details on the contract 'around the end of the year' when all residual issues should be settled. In cables, the UK communications business improved significantly, as did energy cable exports from the UK, especially high voltage cables to Asia. In continental Europe overall, market conditions stabilised. In North America, the combination of an improving market and rationalisation programmes in the last 12 months had brought a return to profitability. In Australasia, Metal Manufactures performed well. BICC said its cash performance had been sound during the recession, but as it emerged from the downturn 'the inevitable effects of increasing work in progress, together with copper price rises, are becoming evident'. Yet, with acquisition spending well down and increased income from disposals, the net cash outflow at Pounds 94m was reduced by Pounds 24m from the comparable 1993 figure.</p>

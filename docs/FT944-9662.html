			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / SEC to review Nasdaq market The Securities and Exchange Commission said last night it was undertaking a review of the Nasdaq stock market, in the light of allegations that dealers on the market illegally fixed their prices to profit at the expense of investors. The review by the US financial markets watchdog will seek to determine if the dealers broke SEC rules, and comes on the heels of an inquiry launched last month by the US Justice Department into whether dealers violated anti-trust laws by colluding to keep spreads - the difference between the prices at which they buy and sell shares for investors - unnecessarily wide to maximise their profits. Nasdaq is the second largest stock market in the US, after the New York Stock Exchange, listing the shares of such well known companies as Apple Computer and Microsoft. Investors buy and sell stocks at prices quoted to them on computer screens by Nasdaq's 500 or so dealers, who include all of Wall Street's biggest securities firms. The wider the spread, the more money the dealers make on each trade. The Justice Department and SEC investigations follow the publication this year of two academic studies which claimed to have found evidence of such collusion.</p>

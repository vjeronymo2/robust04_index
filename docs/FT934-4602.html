			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Former Italian spy chief held Mr Maurizio Broccoletti, former head of Italy's domestic intelligence services, was arrested yesterday in Monte Carlo on an international warrant for alleged misuse of the organisation's funds, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Proceedings are under way for Mr Broccoletti's extradition. In another development, lawyers acting for Mr Franco Bernabe, head of Eni, the Italian state oil concern, said yesterday they would institute libel proceedings against Mr Alberto Grotti, a former senior executive.

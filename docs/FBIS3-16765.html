This was reported by Yuriy Baturin, an aide to the Russian  president for national security, in an interview to ITAR-TASS.  According to him, the opposition groupings rejecting the  Memorandum proposed by President Boris Yeltsin are preparing to  hold major rallies and demonstrations in Moscow in May. To  prevent a repeat of the events of May 1993, it is envisaged to  use a number of technical contact-free means, including  water-cannons. Yuriy Baturin stressed that in case of public  order violations, legal mechanisms will be put into effect  without delay, especially against those to whom the political  amnesty was extended.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak slips to Dollars 145m on flat sales EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest maker of photographic equipment, reported a 19 per cent decline in first-quarter net earnings on sales that were essentially flat. The company, in the midst of its fifth restructuring since 1983, had warned in March it would have a difficult first quarter and its recovery would be only gradual. Net income was Dollars 145m, or 45 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 4.41bn compared with earnings of Dollars 178m, or 55 cents, on sales of Dollars 4.42bn a year earlier. Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said the results were hardly satisfying. 'Respectable margins in health and chemicals were accompanied by poor rates of return in imaging and information, where problem areas are being vigorously addressed.' He said earnings were hurt by higher costs, unfavourable currency translations, lower selling prices and higher spending on research. He added: 'We look forward to better results with the expectation that sales will continue to recover, particularly in the second half, and that earnings will benefit from actions to restore operating margins to more satisfactory levels.' CHEVRON, leading US energy group, reported a 45 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit to Dollars 304m, writes Alan Friedman. Earnings per share declined to 88 cents from Dollars 1.59 in the first three months of 1992. Total revenues were down by 10.2 per cent to Dollars 9.7bn.</p>

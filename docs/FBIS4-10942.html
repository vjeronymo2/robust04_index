			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero today said he will  further lower import taxes to make internal prices drop. He said  that whomever commits price abuses will have to compete with  cheaper and perhaps better-quality products. Ricupero favors  putting the real into circulation as soon as possible but did  not specify a date. He also supports the conversion of foreign  debt titles to finance education projects. Such a conversion  already is being applied to social and environmental projects.    Minister Ricupero also said that he trusts in the economic  program's success, even though some economic sectors still are  not operating in URV's [Real Value Unit]. This week he will  announce the form of conversion for postal fees.    Minister Ricupero today met Deputy Tarcisio Delgado, leader  of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] in the Chamber  of Deputies, and told him that Congress should establish in the  Constitution only the general principles of the tax and social  security reform. The rules for these reforms, the minister said,  should be defined through complementary laws.</p>

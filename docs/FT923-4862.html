			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Non-aligned talks target Bush policy CUBA yesterday accused the US of forcing it into poverty and hunger, and appealed to the non-aligned movement to support Havana in breaking the US trade embargo. Mr Juan Bosque, Cuba's foreign minister, told the non-aligned summit in Jakarta that President George Bush's policy towards Cuba had become 'more aggressive, more ignominious, more brutal'. The embargo had compounded the crisis caused by the collapse of the eastern bloc which accounted for almost 80 per cent of Cuban trade, he said. Mr Bosque said Cuba had been closed off from any form of credit or development assistance, leaving the economy in a critical situation. He accused Washington of applying 'immense pressure . . . throughout the entire world to prevent our country from obtaining oil'. Describing the embargo as a 'declared economic war', he said 'imperialist aggression will not sway the Cuban people . . . it will not make us renounce our principles and abandon our struggle'. The US was also attacked by Mr Taha Ramadhan, Iraqi vice-president, for its imposition of the 'no-fly zone' in the south of the country. He said it was 'an aggressive decision which violates the sovereignty of Iraq and against which we are mobilising all the peoples of Iraq'. Mr Ramadhan has invited representatives from the non-aligned movement to visit southern Iraq to 'see for themselves how life is actually lived' and to 'expose the falsity of the fabricated allegations floated around by the enemies of Iraq'. The prime ministers of India and Pakistan held bilateral talks in Jakarta yesterday on the disputed region of Kashmir. Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, described the meeting as 'very useful and constructive'. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, said the two countries would maintain a dialogue on the issue but he was not expecting instantaneous success.</p>

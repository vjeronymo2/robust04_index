			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / US stands ground on farm pact: Statement as France renews threats to veto Gatt deal THE US yesterday released its strongest statement so far refusing to renegotiate the US-EC farm trade pact, agreed last November at Blair House in Washington. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said: 'Interpretation or clarification of Blair House cannot be a guise for modifying the terms of the agreement.' The pact had been only 'minimally acceptable to the US and to the EC's other trading partners'; it resulted from 'a difficult compromise which the US accepted in its entirety'. Mr Kantor said his plan to meet Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner and chief trade negotiator, next Monday predated the EC's council meeting. 'Reopening the Blair House agreement will not be on our agenda.' France meanwhile renewed threats to veto a Gatt farm deal unless it obtained fresh concessions, but claimed victory over getting the EC to reopen farm trade talks with the US. Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, expressed satisfaction that the final communique of the Brussels meeting reflected France's 'essential principles'. Those were that any farm accord with the US should not go against, or beyond, the EC's internal reforms, while it should still allow EC farmers preference on their home market and an export role abroad. Mr Balladur cautioned that 'everything is not settled, for all that'. Confirming his role as France's 'hard man' on the Gatt farm issue, Mr Alain Juppe, who is secretary-general of the RPR Gaullist party as well as foreign minister, brandished the veto threat again. There was mixed reaction from France's 1m farmers. Leaders of the mainstream FNSEA and CNJA unions welcomed the Brussels outcome as a modest first step, but said they still did not trust Sir Leon to put their demands to the Americans and would prefer France to talk directly to the US. Coordination Rurale called for 'vigilance' among its members, who tried to blockade Paris last week, while two leftwing farm groups - Confederation Paysanne and Modef - denounced the conservative Balladur government for its 'capitulation' in Brussels. Praising the co-operation Germany had given him on the farm issue, Mr Balladur went on to criticise 'certain European partners' for claiming that 'France was putting the community in danger'. That appeared to refer to British warnings to France not to precipitate an EC crisis over Gatt. Sir Leon brushed aside the French threats. He said the internal EC compromise over Blair House - agreed about 3am yesterday - had 'cleared the air', leaving no excuse for other leading trading partners to delay new Gatt offers and push the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion. Sir Leon also emphasised the unanimous agreement of all 35 EC foreign, farm and trade ministers in the final communique that December 15 was a serious deadline, countering recent French suggestions that the date had been imposed by the US. Under the compromise, Sir Leon's brief is to explore whether the US is willing to show new flexibility in 'interpreting, amplifying or clarifying' parts of Blair House, without, however, requesting a formal renegotiation of the EC-US agreement.

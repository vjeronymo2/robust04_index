			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / US to go ahead with Somalia pull-out: American troops come under fire as 100 die in fighting between rival clans THE US military said yesterday it was going ahead with plans eventually to withdraw 3,000 troops from Somalia despite riots and gun battles that rocked Mogadishu in the past four days, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. But about 1,000 of those troops, now deployed in the southern city of Kismayu where rival militia fought on Monday, would remain for some time, army captain Ed Loomis said. About 100 people have died in Kismayu this week, according to the French medical aid agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres. Earlier yesterday US military spokesman Colonel Fred Peck said the planned troop pull-out was on schedule 'despite events in the past 72 hours'. He was referring to violent protests in Mogadishu by supporters of warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, who accused the American-led forces of backing his rival, Mohamed Said Hersi, known as Morgan. The US military denies the charge. The protests were followed by gun battles on Thursday between the multinational forces and bandits in Mogadishu. There was a similar but brief clash yesterday. The violence, the worst since the task force started arriving in December to stop bandits looting food aid, had forced Washington to delay the withdrawal from Monday of the 3,000. The US has about 18,000 troops in Somalia. The rest of the Americans should be home by April, when the United Nations is expected to have taken over command of the task force of troops from 23 nations.</p>

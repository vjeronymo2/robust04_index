			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> BUILDING SAFETY SURVEY OKD  </P> <P> The City Council voted to spend $80,000 to $100,000 on a survey to identify  buildings that might collapse or be seriously damaged in a moderate or strong  earthquake.  </P> <P> The survey, which is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 1, will include all  buildings constructed before 1934 that have more than 100 occupants, and all  buildings completed before 1976 with more than 300 occupants. The city first  adopted seismic building standards after the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, and  it approved tougher standards in 1976 after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake.  </P> <P> The survey will pave the way for a law to upgrade hazardous buildings in the  city. That law will target unreinforced masonry buildings, which are the most  likely to collapse during a strong earthquake.  </P></p>

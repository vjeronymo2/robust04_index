			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STILTS TO GIVE BARD'S THEATER CHANCE 'TO BE OR NOT TO BE'  </P> <P> Developers today announced they would build an office building on stilts to  preserve the remains of the 16th-Century Rose Theater, where William  Shakespeare is believed to have debuted as an actor.  </P> <P> But protesters who have waged a campaign to save the partly excavated theater  condemned the plan as "worse than expected."  </P> <P> The 10-story office building would stand 22 feet above the Elizabethan  theater's remains and be supported by steel girders, the developers said. The  theater's remains would be on view from entrances on three sides of the office  building, they said.  </P> <P> The government-approved plan for the site south of the Thames River would cost  $15.8 million more than the initial plan and would reduce some office and  parking space, the developers said.  </P></p>

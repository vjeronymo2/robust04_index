			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD BRIEFS: CDC ISSUES TOXIN ALERT ON TROPICAL SEAFOOD SPECIES  </P> <P> Thorough heating is inadequate protection against toxins that may be present in  certain tropical seafood species, according to a study by the Centers for  Disease Control in Atlanta.  </P> <P> An article in the agency's Morbidity &amp; Mortality Weekly Report found that  cooking did not destroy elevated levels of scombroid toxin -- a naturally  occurring contaminant -- in fish identified as the source of two outbreaks last  year.  </P> <P> In each of the incidents, which occurred in Chicago and Charleston, S.C.,  victims were diagnosed as suffering from scombroid poisoning.  </P> <P> This particular toxin is fast-acting and is capable of producing symptoms in  otherwise healthy adults in as little as five minutes after a meal.  </P> <P> The attack, which can last up to 10 hours and may require emergency medical  care, includes nausea, dizziness, facial swelling, diarrhea and fever.  </P> <P> There have been 192 scombroid fish poisoning outbreaks in this country between  1973 and 1987 resulting in more than 1,000 illnesses, according to the CDC.  Hawaii, with 51, and California, with 29, topped all other states in the number  of such incidents. None of the cases involved fatalities.  </P> <P> Those species most often implicated in these poisonings are mahi-mahi, tuna and  bluefish.  </P> <P> The scombroid toxin is produced in dark-fleshed fresh fish with high levels of  the compound histidine, an amino acid. Under poor storage conditions -- whether  on fishing boats, docks or in warehouses -- the histidine can be converted into  histimine by surface bacteria on the fish.  </P> <P> "This is a situation where the bacteria that are normally present on the fish  break down the other normal surface materials to form abnormally high levels of  toxic products," said Stephen Ostroff M.D., CDC medical epidemiologist familiar  with the report.  </P> <P> As little as 20 milligrams of histimine per 100 grams of fresh fish can cause  symptoms, according to the CDC. Hazardous levels of the compound in tuna are  considered to be 50 milligrams of histimine per 100 grams.  </P> <P> In the Chicago outbreak, which produced eight illnesses, mahi-mahi was  implicated as the source of the contamination. Investigators found that the  fish showed signs of freezer burn or had been thawed and improperly refrozen.  Laboratory tests found levels of histimine in the remaining fish to be three  times that considered hazardous by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> As for the Charleston case, contaminated yellow-fin tuna was identified as the  cause of nine illnesses. However, local health officials who reviewed the  incident found that the suspect fish was kept thoroughly iced throughout  storage and handling.  </P> <P> Even so, investigators found that histimine present in uneaten tuna was 10 to  15 times above the level considered hazardous.  </P> <P> "As these outbreaks demonstrate, cooking toxic fish is not protective," the  article stated.  </P> <P> The authors recommend continuous icing or refrigeration for all potentially  scombroid-toxic fish from the point at which the catch leaves the water until  cooking. This recommendation, however, is standard advice for all fish species  -- not just the dark-flesh varieties.  </P> <P> "There is nothing else the consumer can do if they get a bad piece of fish. You  can't smell the toxin, feel it or see it," said Ostroff. "But people have to  realize that, while this is a problem, it is not a frequent occurrence."  </P> <P> Tropical Toxins -- Often mentioned in tandem with scombroid poisoning is  ciguatera, another toxin found in tropical reef fish. The number of poisoning  incidents involving ciguatera are estimated to be 25% higher than that from  scombroid, Ostroff said.  </P> <P> From 1973 to 1987 there were a total of 233 ciguatera outbreaks with a total of  1,045 illnesses and three fatalities. Most of these incidents, or 167, occurred  in Hawaii. Another 35 were in Florida and only three in California.  </P> <P> Species linked to ciguatera, which is formed when fish eat a certain poisonous  reef algae, include mahi-mahi, barracuda, amber jack and some red snapper  varieties.  </P> <P> The CDC's statistics for seafood-related poisonings, including bacteria such as  Vibrio cholera and Vibrio vulnificus, are considered fairly well documented  because the contaminations are so distinctive.  </P> <P> "Seafood-related illnesses tend to be more severe (than those caused by other  foods)," said Ostroff. "Cholera, ciguatoxin, scombroid are often easily  recognizable entities. Another one is paralytic shellfish poisoning. They  usually involve a small number of people when noticed (by health officials).  Cholera cases sometimes only involve one person."  </P> <P> In terms of outbreaks, it appears that there are more poisonings and illnesses  related to seafood than any other individual protein source. That's because  illnesses caused by meats, such as salmonellosis and camplylobacteriosis, are  harder to detect and are often not as identifiable. Symptoms in these cases can  also be more variable.  </P> <P> "A substantial portion of the outbreaks (documented by CDC) where there's a  known contaminant and a specific food are seafood related," said Ostroff.  </P> <P> There were 7,431 food-related outbreaks between 1973 and 1987. Seafood  accounted for 11.1% of these, or 827 outbreaks and 12,766 illnesses, according  to the CDC.  </P> <P> Half of all the episodes, however, have undetermined causes. As a result, the  figure for seafood contaminations, as well as for those cases linked to any  other individual food, can be doubled as a way of accounting for the percentage  of unknown causes, Ostroff said.  </P> <P> "The proportion of seafood-related illnesses are higher than any particular  meat product," he said.  </P> <P> However, Ostroff disagreed with some consumer groups who have claimed that the  contamination threat from seafood -- in general -- is a greater health risk to  consumers than is meat or poultry.  </P> <P> Botulism Threat -- Improper storage conditions also played an important role in  another food poisoning recently reported by the FDA.  </P> <P> The agency linked three botulism cases in the New York City area with  consumption of a commercial garlic-and-oil mix that was kept at room  temperature despite a label stating "Keep Refrigerated."  </P> <P> A preliminary investigation by health officials implicated a product no longer  manufactured: Chopped Garlic in Extra Virgin Olive Oil made by Colavita Pasta  &amp; Oil Co. The Newark, N.J.,-based firm discontinued the item a year ago but  announced a recall of the product nevertheless.  </P> <P> The victims, each of whom required hospitalization, apparently used the oil to  prepare garlic bread.  </P> <P> As a result of this and other recent cases, the FDA has alerted commercial  producers of similar products to ensure that labels and bulk packaging  materials prominently state, "Requires Refrigeration for Safety" or  "Refrigerate Both Before and After Opening."  </P> <P> FDA researchers have found that oils present an ideal environment for the  growth of botulinum spores.  </P> <P> "Clostridium botulinum bacteria are widespread . . . and may be found on  various produce, including garlic, but their spores are harmless when there is  oxygen in the environment," according to the FDA's account of the episode.  "However, the spores can produce a deadly toxin when in an oxygen-free,  low-acid environment."  </P> <P> A similar contamination incident occurred in 1985, the FDA reported, when 37  people suffered from botulism after eating a dish that included a commercial  chopped garlic in soybean oil in a Vancouver, British Columbia, restaurant.  </P> <P> As a result of the recent problems with garlic in oil, the agency is warning  that any such commercial or homemade mixes can pose serious health risks if  left at room temperature.  </P></p>

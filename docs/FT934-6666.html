			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Day-release courses in decline The provision of day-release courses for employees of local companies used to be an important activity for Selby College, one of the colleges that top the government's tables for the successful provision of vocational training. In line with a long-term trend, however, the significance of day release to the North Yorkshire college has fallen - a 20 per cent fall in volume last year alone. The slack at Selby has been taken up by an expansion in the provision of A-levels and full-time vocational study for qualifications. The vocational study comes under scrutiny in the government's league tables as the BTec National Diploma (equivalent to two or more A-levels) and the City and Guilds Certificate, which is a similar qualification. Vocational studies make up more than 50 per cent of the college's activities. According to the government's tables colleges are marginally less well able than schools to provide the vocational education that is being assessed. The latest figures show colleges enjoying a 82.12 per cent success rate compared with state school's 85.84 per cent success rate. The trend towards full-time provision has been fuelled by two main influences. First, the funding regime has encouraged the provision of full-time courses by colleges and discouraged them from bidding for part-time contracts such as Youth Training, the work-related training scheme for 16 to 19-year-olds. Participants on such work-related training would typically gain the occupationally specific National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), the attainment of which is not included in this year's college league tables. Funding has aroused considerable anger when the government says it wants to encourage work-related training. A new funding regime for colleges is intended to address this problem. Second, an increasing number of 16-year-olds are choosing to stay in full-time education, rather than seek a job or enroll on YT. It is a challenge to persuade them that vocational qualifications are equal in esteem to academic ones. Just less than half of the 2m students in further education are studying for vocational qualifications. Employers, according to both colleges and the awarding bodies, have a regard for the qualifications in the league tables. BTec, one of the main awarding bodies, said this year that only 5.7 per cent of the students gaining its national diploma were unemployed six months later. Nearly 28 per cent went on to further study while nearly 30 per cent went directly into employment. Just how welcoming employers will be to the General National Vocational Qualification, which will replace the existing qualifications, remains to be seen. The tables also show that, as in schools, students taking vocational qualifications obtain superior results to those taking academic qualifications. The government and college principals say this is not because vocational qualifications are easier but because they are different.</p>

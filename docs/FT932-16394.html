			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Observer: Versus If cows had three horns, Sarosh Zaiwalla would be sitting on them. Every way he turns there is the Indian government. Zaiwalla, the Chancery Lane-based doyen of Indian solicitors in the UK, is simultaneously suing the Indian government for unpaid fees of some Pounds 180,000, judgment on which is expected in the London high court this week; he is representing it in an action against aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas; and he is sitting on an international arbitration panel considering a Pounds 17m claim against, yes, the Indian government. Zaiwalla is promising himself a holiday to escape this legal minefield. He won't be off to New Delhi, one assumes.</p>

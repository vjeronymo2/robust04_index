Georgian troops opened artillery fire on positions of  the Abkhazian armed forces. This was reported by the press  service of the plenipotentiary of the Republic of Abkhazia in  the Russian Federation.    At the same time bands from Georgian formations stepped up  their activities in Galskiy Rayon.    In the meantime the press center of the Republic of  Georgia's  Ministry of Defense has issued its own assessment of the events.  According to the Georgian side, under the pretext of combatting  bands from the formations, Abkhazian formations numbering up to  2,500 men are engaged in actions against the civilian population  in the region, continuing their ethnic cleansing in the  territory under their control. According to the same source,  Georgia's government troops have not yet taken action in  response.    The latest exacerbation of the situation has demonstrated  once again that the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict cannot be  resolved without a political settlement. Nor can one fail to  consider the possibility that the events of 6 February could  have been undertaken by forces on both sides of the Inguri which  do not like the idea of establishing normal bilateral relations  between Georgia and Russia.</p>

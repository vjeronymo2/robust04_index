			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: London Stock Exchange delays launch of system THE London Stock Exchange has postponed the launch of its London Market Datafeed (LMD) service, a live price and data feed designed to replace its Computer Readable Services (CRS). After tests, both in-house and among market practitioners, the Stock Exchange decided to review the design and development of LMD. The system, expected to be launched this summer, will not now be available 'for some considerable time,' according to the exchange. The exchange has become increasingly sensitive to potential systems failures since a software problem shut down its Topic news and information service for almost a whole trading session in June. Many institutional investors ceased to deal because of the absence of reliable share price information. One of the marketmakers involved in testing the LMD system said his firm will be able to manage with the existing CRS feed, until the new system is launched. 'We can slot in the new feed easily, when it is available,' he said.</p>

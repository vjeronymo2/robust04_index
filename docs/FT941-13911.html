			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion: A good meal, a bottle of wine and 25 per cent off - Nicholas Lander updates the FT/Transmedia invitation to 1,000 free meals The Financial Times restaurant offer starts on Monday. It is still not too late to take part if you would like:  - A 25 per cent discount on all food and wine consumed in one of the restaurants on our list.  - The chance to win a free meal for two. 1,000 free meals for two are on offer to those taking part in the scheme during the three weeks starting on Monday. Some of our readers are likely to win more than one free meal. For every time you eat at one of the restaurants in our scheme, you get 25 per cent off the cost of that meal, plus an extra chance of winning a free meal for two. And there is no limit on the number of free meals that you may win. The key to this offer is a plastic card, the FT/Transmedia Restaurant card, offered free for six months. How it works and how to get it are explained in more detail below. Since we announced the scheme at the beginning of the year, the number of UK restaurants in the scheme has doubled to 210. The list on this page gives an idea of the range; but the number is growing daily as Transmedia signs up more participants. In addition, there are 2,400 restaurants in the US which will accept the card. If you use it in the US you will get the 25 per cent discount, but will not be eligible for the promotional free lunch draw. You will get a directory, regularly updated, of the restaurants in the scheme. As the numbers grow, this will offer a wide choice of eating places throughout the UK and in the main centres in the US. The spread is already pretty good. The main point of this scheme is that it does not just come to an end after the promotional period. For the first three weeks you get the chance of winning one of the 1,000 free meals, plus the 25 per cent discount. For six months you get a 25 per cent discount without any cost. After that, you can still use the card, but an annual charge will be made. The mid 1990s is no time for another 'fine dining club', nor do FT readers need reminding of where they can go for the best and, inevitably perhaps, the most expensive cooking. Your FT/Transmedia directory of British and American restaurants can provide a much broader and, I hope, more useful service. There are restaurants in which the chef/proprietor is the obvious attraction: David Adlard in Norwich, Chris Oakes in Stroud, Richard Smith in Moulsford, Stephen Bull in London and John Dicken at Dickens, Wethersfield, Essex. Restaurants around the City: Alba, Ashtons, Beauchamps, Mr Garraways and La Paquarette. Good neighbourhood restaurants which you can now enjoy more frequently: Glaisters, SW10, Newtons, SW4, L'Artiste Assoiffe, W11, Waltons SW3, Willoughby's N1, Crowthers, SW14 and the two branches of Hunter's in Winchester and New Alresford, Hampshire. Even restaurants in top London hotels - the Grosvenor House, the Mayfair and several other Inter-Continental hotels - which will reduce the cost of your overall stay in the West End. There are also restaurants which can easily be appended to a more cerebral experience - the Archduke just by the South Bank Centre, the Wigmore Restaurant by the Wigmore Hall and Les Partisans in the centre of Edin-burgh. A collection of good wine bars and pubs with restaurants - Le Metro, SW3, Fino's, W1, the Fox and Anchor, EC1, and the Ebury Street Wine Bar, SW1 - and Japanese (Ajimura, W1), Chinese (Red, SW3; Yien, N10), Greek (Daphne, N1), Indian (The Red Fort, W1 and Addab, W8), Thai (Bahn Thai, W1) restaurants too.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading indicators index stalls after rise in March The US official index of leading indicators was flat in April, after a strong 0.7 per cent gain in March, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Separate figures showed new orders for manufactured goods fell 0.1 per cent between March and April. On an annual comparison, however, orders were up a robust 9.1 per cent. The figures followed reports earlier this week of a modest decline in consumer spending and home sales between March and April and a drop in the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence last month. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to conditions in manufacturing industry - was flat in May. Some analysts see the weaker tone of recent data as evidence that higher short- and long-term interest rates are beginning to exert a downward pull on growth. The majority view, however, is that recent data reflect the natural volatility of economic statistics rather than a weakening of economic fundamentals. Economic series do not rise continuously even in strong expansions. Most forecasters believe the economy is still growing faster than the 2.5-3 per cent annual rate regarded as sustainable in the long term. Gross domestic product is expected to grow faster this quarter than the 3 per cent annual rate registered in the first three months. Falling share prices and an increase in weekly claims for unemployment insurance made the largest negative contributions to the leading index in April.</p>

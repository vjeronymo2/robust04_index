			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / People: Taylor Woodrow recast Taylor Woodrow appears to have completed its senior management reshuffle with the promotion of 46-year-old Brian Abrahams, currently responsible for group trading activities and managing director of Greenham Trading, onto the board. In turn, George Borwell, 66, chairman of Greenham Trading, will retire from the board at the May agm. When Colin Parsons took over as chairman of the big UK construction company a year ago, he admitted that even he, as an operating director, sometimes had difficulty in understanding the structure of the board, which at the time was top-heavy and generally opaque. Since then, six directors have left, and four new ones, including Abrahams, have been appointed. A Taylor Woodrow man from the age of 16, when he joined as a junior in the buying office, Abrahams has concentrated on the sales and marketing side. As Borwell's protege, he pushed forward with the expansion of Greenham Trading, which has a product range from contractors' tools to leisurewear and which is one of the few businesses within the group that has continued to improve its performance through the recession. Borwell, one of the doyens of Greenham Trading, may be asked by the subsidiary board to become its non-executive chairman. Taylor Woodrow reports its full year results on March 30.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Summary of a speech by Senior Lieutenant General Tran Van </F> Quang, chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Veterans  Association, given at the Third Plenum of the Central Committee  of the Vietnam Veterans Association]    [Text] It's the nature of imperialism to interfere in the  internal affairs of other countries in order to topple and  enslave them.    The party has educated the Vietnamese people, particularly  veterans, about that, and actual life has proven this during the  revolutionary struggle. Even though they have suffered defeats  in armed aggression, the imperialists have not changed their  nature or plots. Now, along with making preparations to carry on  armed aggression, their main method of aggression today is to  cause turmoil and disorder and carry on "peaceful evolution"  activities in an attempt to turn Vietnam into a dependent  country within their orbit. Since the collapse of the Soviet  Union and the socialist countries in Eastern Europe, they have  promoted this strategy, which they refer to as a strategy for  expanding victory. This is a very insidious strategy that is  being carried on in two ways: They are stirring up turmoil and  fostering local conflicts and carrying on "peaceful evolution"  activities within each country in order to cause crises,  poverty, and conflicts so that they can easily gain control. The  situation in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, African  countries, and a number of countries on other continents have  proven this point today, there are 32 hot spots affecting 36  countries.    In order to carry out this worldwide counterrevolutionary  strategy, the imperialists have put forth four main policies:    a. Both compete and cooperate with the major capitalist  countries -- Western Europe and Japan -- in order to share the  responsibilities, which actually means working together to  eliminate the regimes of the independent countries and divide  world rule.    b. Continue to promote "democratization" in the SNG  countries  and Eastern Europe, which actually means to continue eliminating  the achievements of socialism at the root and quickly promote  the "capitalization" of those countries.    c. Continue to transform the remaining socialist countries,  the most important of which are China and Vietnam, and use  Vietnam as the spearhead in the attack, because China is a large  country that would take much more time; once Vietnam has been  transformed, this evolutionary process will be promoted in China.    d. Solidify and strengthen the political and military  position of the United States in important zones, and gradually  shift the center of immediate foreign affairs activities to Asia.    Naturally, this is a subjective plot of theirs. Today, with  the negative lessons from the former Soviet Union, Eastern  Europe, and other countries such as African countries that are  suffering because of imperialist plots, the people of the world  are on guard. The common trend today is toward national  independence and peace. Internally, the American imperialists  are facing many difficulties. They can't do everything they  want. However, the decisive thing is that countries and peoples  must be aware of their insidious plot and integrated offensive  strategy--which includes political, ideological, organizational,  economic, cultural, and social strategies, weapons, and both  foreign and domestic forces--in order to constantly be on guard  and actively defeat each of their stratagems and destructive  plots.    Vietnam is one of the key points where the enemy is carrying  on "peaceful evolution" and trying to cause disorder. After many  years, their plans to infiltrate armed exiles into Vietnam in  order to establish "war zones" and disrupt things have been  defeated. Thus, they have decided that the main method used to  attack Vietnam will be "peaceful evolution" in conjunction with  zonal violence. And they are coordinating outside forces with  domestic forces. In each specific area, they rely on the  hard-core forces and use specific forms of activities legal,  quasi-legal, illegal, political, ideological, economic,  cultural, and so on in order to build up their forces and  political strength and create the proper conditions for  "peaceful evolution" and disorder.    As for strategic methods, they are using Cambodia and other  conditions to penetrate Vietnam. They are blocking and  destroying Vietnamese-Chinese relations. They are trying to  prevent Vietnam from becoming strong economically, they continue  to isolate us politically, and they are promoting ideological  and moral decay. They are trying to penetrate state  organizations, political and social organizations, and degraded  and degenerate cadres, make use of the conflicts among the  people and the mistakes of the cadres, and gradually invalidate  the leadership of the party. Combining those two formulas  disorder and loss of political stability and "peaceful  evolution" will transform the system into a non-democratic,  non-socialist system.    In reality, they have carried on many activities to stir up  trouble and create political instability, causing certain  difficulties for us. Not including 1992 and prior years, in 1993  alone they carried out a number of activities. A typical example  was what happened on 7 March in Ho Chi Minh City and nearby  areas. They set off explosions, set fires, and planned to take  over the city's radio and television stations and present  themselves as a "government appealing for international help."  With the spirit of vigilance of the people and people's security  forces, we immediately crushed them.    Thanks to the vigilance of the people and the correct and  timely manner in which things have been handled by the  administrative organizations, their plots and stratagems have  all failed.    Based on their activities, we can make generalizations about  a number of their principal stratagems:    They have used the mistakes made by a number of localities  in  implementing the policies and the gullibility and superstitious  nature of a number of people to stir up trouble.    They have set off simple and varied explosive devices and  coordinated forces on the spot with forces from other localities.    They have united reactionary elements posing as religious  people and reactionary elements among the ethnic minorities, a  number of puppet troops, and puppets of the old regime who  refuse to reform themselves.    They are in contact with people abroad and receive commands  from abroad.    Following their defeats in 1993 and in prior years, they  realized that the situation was not yet ripe. In their view, for  the situation to be ripe, there must be four conditions:    1. Steps must be taken to ensure that the people,  particularly elements of the upper class and those engaged in  social activities, are vague about political concepts, lose  their socialist orientation, and accept the doctrine of  pluralism and multiple parties. The party's leadership and the  administration's control must gradually be invalidated. They say  that there is a "germ" of this today, but this has not yet  become a tide, and they are not yet strong enough.    2. There must be activist forces within using many forms of  organization, including social democracy and radical democracy.  This exists today but is not yet strong enough.    3. The reactionary and backward forces and rabble-rousers  must be united under a unified command. They say that this is in  the process of being formed.)    4. Active support must be provided from abroad.    In order to bring about these conditions, they say that the  resistance factions must be united and that well-known people  must serve as the "banners" in propagating ideas and theories  and carrying on legal and quasi-legal activities. Efforts must  be concentrated on attacking a number of our positions and  policies and specific mistakes made by us and on criticizing a  number of leaders.    They say that Vietnam has a tradition of patriotism and  national pride and that the CPV has seized the nationalist  banner. Because of this, slogans such as "eliminate socialism,  eliminate the communist party" cannot be used. Instead, the  mistakes and difficulties of the party and administration must  be used to gradually erode and invalidate the leadership of the  party. Only then will it be possible to create the conditions  for toppling the system.    Although the destructive activities mentioned above are  important, they represent just the tip. Much more dangerous are  their offensive activities on the ideological, political,  economic, cultural, organizational, and espionage fronts. That  is the core of their "peaceful evolution" offensive.    1. On ideological viewpoints, they have put forth the  following requirements and contents:    They say that in the stage when the situation is not yet  ripe, requiring the people to directly oppose socialism and the  communist party is excessive. Thus, socialism should not be  criticized in its entirety. Instead, attacks should concentrate  on the basic points of socialism such as the dictatorship of the  proletariat, a single leading party, human rights, freedom, and  so on. In order to do this, they have proposed a "third path,"  which they say does not follow capitalism or socialism or any  other doctrine except freedom and prosperity. This is really  aimed at abandoning the socialist path to follow the capitalist  path. They reject the leadership of the communist party and the  dictatorship of the proletariat, saying that the dictatorship of  the proletariat is undemocratic and that the leading party has  replaced god in ruling the people. They argue that President  Ho's choice has not been fulfilled. While independence has been  won, there is no freedom or happiness. And because  Marxism-Leninism has made mistakes, the party has had to  renovate itself. But the party has gone only half-way in  renovating itself and so people must demand that it renovate  itself more. The basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi  Minh thought must be abandoned and so on and so on.    2. They have put forth an action program -- which they call  a  scenario -- on Vietnam's transitional path. The contents are:    At the start, there is no need to eliminate the communist  party, but the party must renovate itself further. The party can  then transform itself into a non-Marxist party and implement a  system of political pluralism.    The entire economy must be de-nationalized, the  "independence" of the mass organizations must be assured and  progressive and moderate political organizations must gradually  come into being, with the tendency being toward political  pluralism. Freedom must be expanded, opposition must be  accepted, and so on.    If the above "scenario" is implemented, the communist party  and Vietnam's social system will be transformed into the system  that they want, and that will be a "victory without war."    They are disseminating the above arguments quite broadly  using many means each week there are more than 100 documents,  and in October 1993 alone there were 650 documents. They are  also using meetings to propagandize the above theory and  spreading rumors and sowing doubts. Recently, at a debate on  Vietnam held by a number of Japanese businessmen, they mentioned  having the CPV transform itself into a national party and having  the Vietnamese system transform itself into a capitalist system.    3. On organization:    They are not only propagating an anti-socialist viewpoint  but  also following the organizational path. Besides gathering people  to openly voice opposition, they are trying to penetrate us  using a variety of methods such as holding scientific debates,  having groups come and go, and reviewing cooperative plans on  the economic, cultural, and social fronts. We do not oppose the  debates on economic and cultural exchanges. We have studied and  accepted the scientific achievements of man and the economic and  social management experiences of other countries. But we must  wage a resolute struggle against the viewpoints of the enemy,  who are using every form and means possible to destroy our  system.    4. The economy:    This is another very important struggle front against  "peaceful evolution." Besides the economic embargo imposed by  the American imperialists, the large capitalist countries have  both fought for Vietnamese markets in order to reap large  profits and also used the economic path in the hope of leading  us into their trap. The following are a few examples:    They have promised to invest a lot, but in reality, they  have  invested very little.    They have invested mainly in private enterprises.    They have emphasized investing in the travel, services, and  processing sectors.    Through economic activities, they have propagated depraved  views and a corrupt culture, and they have bribed and corrupted  cadres.    5. Culture, morality, and espionage:    These, too, are fronts on which they are attacking us.  Depraved cultural products that stimulate violence and  debauchery, propagate a pragmatic way of life, and destroy good  morals and good customs are corrupting some of our youths and  children. Espionage and the theft of national secrets and  activities aimed at causing splits among the people pose an  immediate and long-term danger to defending and building the  country.    The "peaceful evolution" activities and other disruptive  activities of the enemy forces pose a danger to the independence  and path of development of our country.    Opposing and defeating those activities is a strategic task  of the entire party, all the people, and the entire political  system of the state. This is a struggle front to defend the  system and protect the fruits of the revolution and our nation's  path forward. As revolutionary leaders have said, this struggle  is a struggle on the political, ideological, economic, cultural,  security, national defense, and social fronts. It must be waged  using both education, discipline, and the laws; it must be both  peaceful and violent; production must be stepped up; attention  must be given to the people's standard of living; and the enemy  must be isolated and exposed in order to defeat them.    The immediate thing is to concentrate on the following:    We must adhere firmly to a revolutionary socialist  viewpoint,  thoroughly understand the renovation lines and targets of the  party with a scientific basis, and implement [the lines] more  and more effectively. While making an effort to contribute to  the struggle to have a prosperous people, strong country, fair  society, and civilized country with a socialist orientation, we  must never forget that the expansion of production with many  economic elements must have a socialist orientation. We must  open the door and study the scientific and technical  achievements of other countries, but we must not forget to  adhere to the concept of independence, sovereignty, and  self-reliance. We must expand investment cooperation in order to  attract capital and raw materials and gain experience, but we  must not forget the struggle to eliminate the opportunistic and  destructive factors. We must be vigilant and actively criticize  the erroneous arguments and the distortions of Marxism-Leninism  and Ho Chi Minh thought, socialism, and the leadership of the  party.    Democracy must be elevated along with maintaining discipline  and the laws. Those two aspects are inseparable in building  strength. Democracy starts from the interests of the people, by  the people, and for the people. Discipline is necessary to  defend democracy.    There must be active participation in mobilizing the masses,  implementing the policy of great national solidarity, handling  the "burning issues" and conflicts among the people,  implementing the economic-cultural-social development programs  and security and national defense programs in the localities to  bring practical benefits to the people, and opposing corruption,  smuggling, and other social evils.</p>

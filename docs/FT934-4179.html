			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A mighty malt - The virtues of the Balvenie With the profusion of single malts on the market, it is easy to forget that whisky companies still think their business is, first and foremost, about blending. The Johnnie Walkers of this world are now up to 150 years old and still going strong. It will take a while before big companies realise the market is getting bored by blends and wants more malt. The need to provide for blends has meant that some of the very best malts have been restricted to a tiny circle of blenders and specialised journalists. The only way for a connoisseur to get hold of them was from an independent bottler, such as Gordon &amp; MacPhail or Cadenhead. The Balvenie is interesting in this regard. William Grant was the first to market malt properly around the world when, early in the 1960s, it re-packaged Glenfiddich. This was such a success that it obscured the fact that Grant had other distilleries - one of which, the Balvenie, was considered at least as good as Glenfiddich, if not considerably better. With Glenfiddich increasingly in demand as a single malt, however, neighbouring Balvenie had to tout for business in 'fillings': that is, to market itself as an important component part in the blends of Grant and other companies. Thus, getting a bottle used to be a labour of love. In the past few months, though, there has been rather more of it about. The reason is that Balvenie celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, and Grant has marked the occasion by issuing a third version to complement the two which were available, although in small quantities. It also has re-packaged the lot in smart new bottles. Glenfiddich produced its first 'white' whisky on Christmas day 1887, so the Balvenie is Glenfiddich's junior by just six years. Scottish thrift governed both operations. Where Glenfiddich's stills were bought second-hand from Cardhu, those at Balvenie came second-hand from Lagavulin, on Islay. Even thriftier, and considerably more barbarous, was the decision to use Balvenie House as the core of the new complex: it was, by all accounts, a rather grand 18th century mansion. Balvenie retains a good many features from the original conception. Less than 10 per cent of single malt distilleries still kiln a percentage of their malt; Balvenie is one of them. Some of the barley even comes from the Grant farm, which surrounds the distillery complex. The malt is peated very lightly, in the Speyside style. Indeed, the peating has been reduced in recent years, so there could be a touch more on older bottlings than there is now. At Glenfiddich, they set great store by having retained the original coal-fired stills. A direct flame under the still will require use of a 'rummager' to prevent the yeasty solids from catching and burning and, in some distilleries, the rummager is considered a quality factor as it is said to 'toast' the yeast. But because of the Balvenie's lesser vocation as a source for blending, the rummagers were removed, along with the coal fires. This might well have affected the complexity of the malt. Balvenie's stills are much taller than those at Glenfiddich, with noticable 'boilpots' - a swelling in the neck of the still which makes the copper look like some sort of long-necked bird which has swallowed an exercise ball. Their purpose is to create a reflex action which adds to the structure of the spirit. The Balvenie is a rich, relatively heavy whisky - far more so than its stablemate. It also sees the inside of more old sherry casks than Glenfiddich, and about a quarter of the 10-year-old malt - the Founder's Reserve - has passed through these. Being a sweetish whisky, it marries particularly well with the traces of sweet wine in the sherry butt. In the old days there was also a Balvenie Classic, but this has been replaced by Double Wood - a 12-year-old malt which has been aged in old bourbon whisky barrels for 11 years and then run off into sherry butts for six months. Its final six months before bottling are spent in bourbon oak and the result is a happy fusion. The sweet, fruity element is there along with the slightly buttery character imparted by the bourbon wood. Finally, Grant has brought out a 15-year-old, single-barrel, cask-strength malt. This is bottled cask by cask at 50.4 per cent. Only bourbon barrels are used to make it an uncompromising version of the 'bourbon' style of malt whisky: intensely buttery and with an attractive smokiness - but with all that Balvenie sweetness on the palate.</p>

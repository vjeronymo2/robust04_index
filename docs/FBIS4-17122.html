			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Russia has once again  called on the warring sides in Rwanda to immediately stop their  fratricide, put an end to senseless violence and return to the  practical implementation of the Arusha accord with the  participation of all political forces, deputy head of the  Russian Foreign Ministry department of press and information  Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today.    Any positive motion aimed at an inter-Rwandan settlement  will  be met by Russian support and understanding, Demurin noted. "We  welcome Organization of African Unity (OAU) actions aimed at  stopping the bloodshed, and hope that joint efforts made by the  U.N. and the OAU will lead to a turning-point in the present  dramatic situation in Rwanda. In this connection Moscow  supports the initiative proposed by the Tanzanian president to  hold a peace conference on Rwanda in Arusha on April 23," the  Russian Foreign Ministry official emphasised.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry is waiting for facts from the  Cambodian prime ministers concerning the accusation by the  Cambodian foreign minister about Thailand supporting the Khmer  Rouge [KR] .    Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri was asked  by  news reporters about Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom  Sirivut's charge, which he made when he was in Malaysia that  Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge and that there are pictures  substantiating the charge. Prasong told reporters that he had  instructed the Thai ambassador in Phnom Penh to seek a meeting  with the Cambodian prime ministers in order to get facts from  them so the Thai Government could take a proper course of  action. Prasong said he did not understand why Prince Norodom  Sirivut did not tell Thailand directly when he visited Thailand  last time.    [Begin recording] [Prasong, in progress] ... this is not  good for our relations -- existing and future relations. I will  wait for information from the ambassador.    [Unidentified reporter] Prince Sirivut said he brought up  this matter when he was in Malaysia. He said he wanted Malaysia  to convey his concern to Thailand as Malaysia is an ASEAN friend  of Thailand.    [Prasong] Why didn't he discuss it with us when he was in  Thailand? We would like to ask him this question? [end  recording]</p>

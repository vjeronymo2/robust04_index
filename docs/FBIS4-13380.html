			<p>BFN     [Text] Kandy, April 16, IRNA -- Visiting Iranian Majles  Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri said here Saturday that U.S.  presence in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean was disturbing  regional peoples.    "We feel ourselves duty-bound not to let the U.S. endanger  the security of the region through its provocative presence,"  Nateq-Nuri told Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Abdulqader Shahul  Hameed.    Nateq-Nuri said that this required more coordination among  regional countries, a goal which he said, the Islamic Repulic of  Iran was trying to achieve.    The Iranian parliamentarian also voiced Iran's readiness to  help Sri Lanka overcome its internal problems.    Shahul Hameed said that Iran enjoyed special status in the  international community and that his country praised Tehran's  international "constructive" role.    Referring to the closure of Israeli Embassy in Colombo,  Shahul Hameed said that Sri Lanka insisted that all occupied  lands should be returned to their owners and the Palestinian  people should be given their denied rights.    He reiterated that Colombo's stance on Israel depended on  the  vindication of the Palestinain people's rights.    Iran and Sri Lanka along with other countries in the region  should expand cooperation in an effort to prevent domination of  a country by another.</p>

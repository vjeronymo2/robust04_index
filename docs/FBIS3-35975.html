"Russia stands against the escalation of the conflict and  against air strikes" on positions of conflicting sides, he told  a press conference.    However, the priemier also opposed the statements of Russian  nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirnovskiy who said in Bosnia that  U.S.-proposed air strikes on serbs would be viewed as an attack  on Russia.    "This is an exaggeration", Chernomyrdin commented.    "The settlement of the Bosnian conflict is not an easy  problem and it cannot be solved overnight", Chernomyrdin said.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HIKE BASE PAY TO $4.25 IN BILL DEFYING VETO THREAT  </P> <P> Defying threats of a second presidential veto, the Democratic-controlled House  Education and Labor Committee Tuesday agreed to raise the federal minimum wage  to $4.25 an hour on Jan. 1, 1991.  </P> <P> The committee voted also to allow employers to pay a lower starting wage of  $3.61 an hour for 60 days to newly hired employees with no previous experience  in the labor force.  </P> <P> In contrast, a plan by President Bush would not raise the current minimum wage  of $3.35 an hour until 1992, although he also would raise it to $4.25.  Additionally, his plan would allow employers in 1992 to pay newly hired workers  $3.40 a hour for six months, whether or not they had previous job experience.  </P> <P> The Democratic-dominated House is expected to pass the bill next month, and a  similar measure has been prepared for Senate approval before the start of the  new fiscal year on Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Bush previously delivered an ultimatum to Congress, vowing to veto any minimum  wage bill if the top rate exceeded $4.25 an hour and did not include his  conditions for a starting wage.  </P> <P> The President made good on his promise on June 13, rejecting a bill that raised  the floor to $4.55 an hour and contained the 60-day starting wage provision.  </P> <P> Because the average hourly pay for private non-farm workers was $9.70 an hour  last July, the fight over the minimum wage may involve greater political  symbolism than economic impact. California, for example, already has a $4.25  minimum pay rate, and about a dozen other states have wage floors higher than  the federal level.  </P> <P> But partisan lines were clearly drawn on the issue, with intensive lobbying for  the increase by organized labor and heavy opposition from the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and other business groups.  </P> <P> Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the committee, noted that  the Bush Administration has agreed to negotiate with Congress on clean air  standards, drug policy and the federal budget, but not on an increase in the  minimum wage.  </P> <P> White House officials have said that Bush's veto of a minimum wage of $4.55  apparently inflicted little political damage. Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), a  leading advocate of a minimum wage increase, said that he was informed Tuesday  by Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole: "The President has no  concessions."  </P></p>

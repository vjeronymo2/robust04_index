			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: Not clear how UK's borrowings explain large trade deficit Sir, Mr Walter Eltis (Personal View, 'From debt to deficit', July 29) shows convincingly how the deficit in Britain's balance of payments reflects the country's excessive borrowing. In terms of flows of funds, indeed, it is something of a tautology that when the private and public sectors in the UK, taken together, are in deficit, it follows that the outside world - as the only other player in the game - must be in surplus. If the country lives beyond its means, it must either draw on its assets or increase its debts. It is not so clear, however, that if we are competitive, as Mr Eltis believes, our borrowing explains the current large deficit in our balance of trade. Why should the increasing borrowing requirement of the government in any way prevent the competitive supplier of widgets from gaining a larger share of markets abroad and/or displacing imports in the home market? Some of us can remember a time when improving the trade balance was seen as a useful step towards the country paying its way and reducing its debts. It is discouraging that, these days, economic advisers teach that reducing the debts is itself a precondition for taking practical measures in the real economy to bring the reduction of debt about.

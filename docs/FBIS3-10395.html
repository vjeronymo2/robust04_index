			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] Dr. Francisco Acosta Coloma, energy and mines  minister, says it necessary to develop productive activities in  all facets of the electricity sector within a free market  system. Francisco Acosta says this new trend will allow the  modernization of the electricity sector because it is not fair  for the state to reserve for itself the tasks of regulation,  normalization, and control when it performs none of these  functions under optimum conditions because it does not have  adequate resources to update its obsolete equipment.    The energy and mines minister also said that oil production  will increase to 400,00 barrels per day this year. This  increase in production comes from the (Boyi-Capiron), Tivacuno,  (Amo), (Daimi), (Ginta), and (Ori) oil fields operated by the  Matsu company, which will produce an additional 16,500 barrels  of oil.</p>

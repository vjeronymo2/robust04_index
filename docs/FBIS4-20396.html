The Impact of the Return to GATT on  Enterprises of Our Country and Measures To Deal With It    A. Challenges Enterprises of Our Country Will Face    1. Under the principles of the elimination of quantitative  restrictions and of trade liberalization, it will be necessary  to limit the use of, or eliminate such things as quotas and  import and export licenses; as a result our country's import  system will undergo significant changes. Our country has  committed herself to reduce the use of import licenses by  two-thirds and to terminate the import regulation tax within the  next three years; eliminating and reducing nontariff barriers  are certain to weaken our country's trade protection measures.  (Footnote 1: The Legal Rule Formulation Office of the Legal  System Bureau of the State Council, "The Great Significance of  the Return to the GATT to Our Country's Economic Life," JIAGE  LILUN YU SHIJIAN Apr 93) All this will result in our country's  enterprises facing a harsher external environment for business  operations.    2. "The resumption of GATT membership" may make consumption  structure mature too soon, a development which may hamper the  upgrading of China's industrial structure. In the 1980s, the  strong disruptive effects and demonstration effects produced by  imported durable consumer goods constituted the factor which  induced industrial structure to become more based on light  industry. To improve the overall quality of the economy and  increase overall national capabilities so as to create a solid  foundation for achieving the strategic objectives for the middle  part of the next century, China must immediately start efforts  to upgrade her industrial structure, and must change her  industrial structure from centering on heavy industry into  centering on light industry. With regard to this issue, China is  faced with the likely negative effects produced by "the  resumption of GATT membership." "The resumption of GATT  membership" will inevitably result in substantial increases in  imports. After "the resumption of GATT membership," with the  weakening of trade protection, China's consumer goods market,  especially the market for large, durable consumer goods, will  become a place of competition among the signatories. According  to forecasts, once foreign durable consumer goods are imported  in large quantities, urban consumption first of all will be  stimulated. A contradiction will therefore emerge: On the one  hand, the upgrading of industrial structure requires that mainly  the capital- and technology-intensive industries, chiefly heavy  and chemical industries, be developed, and those industries need  a great deal of capital input; on the other hand, the main  sources of capital formation in China now are residents' savings  and fund raising of various forms, but the upgrading of  consumption will siphon off a substantial part of residents'  savings. Thus the upgrading of industrial structure can be  hampered by inadequate capital formation. (Footnote 2: Zhao  Lingyun, "Four Major Challenges Posed by the Return to the GATT  on the Chinese Economy," GUOJI JINGMAO TANSUO Jan 93)    3. The exporting of competitive products is very likely to  cause antidumping problems. Under the GATT's general principles,  the signatories may adopt tariff protection policies against  imports. After "the resumption of GATT membership," our country  can use this method to protect domestic infant industries;  Western developed countries can also use this method to restrict  exports from our country. This will be a major problem our  country will face in regard to exports after "the resumption of  GATT membership." It will be difficult to set appropriate prices  for some of our country's products which sell well on the  international market; as a result such products are prone to be  subjected to antidumping tariffs imposed by developed countries  in order to restrict imports from China. Such a development can  adversely affect competitive exports from our country. (Footnote  3: An Furen, "The Impact of Joining the GATT on Our Country's  Economy and the Challenges Our Country's Economy Will Face As a  Result," CAIJING WENTI YANJIU (Dalian) Jan 93)    4. The expanding of the scope of protection of intellectual  property rights will result in some domestic enterprises paying  high licensing fees. As some developed countries are  significantly superior in the areas of science and technology,  techniques, name-brand trademarks, artistic and literary works,  computer software, etc, expanding the scope of protection of  intellectual property rights is doubtless in accord with the  wishes of those countries. As enterprises of our country will  have to incur a great deal of expenditures on many patent  licenses and purchase patents from Western developed countries  legally, there will be increases in their production costs and a  decline in the competitiveness of their products on the  international market. (Footnote 4: Yang Pengcheng, "The Impact  of the Return to the GATT on the Business World of Our Country,"  QIYEJIA TIANDI Jan 93)    5. Under the condition of the granting of market access, the  technology-intensive, capital-intensive, and knowledge-intensive  products of our country will face the challenge posed by the  fierce competition from manufactures imported from foreign  countries. For a long time, under the protection of high import  tariffs, our country has followed the import substitution  strategy with regard to technology-intensive, capital-intensive,  and knowledge-intensive products, neglecting the introduction of  foreign things and giving excessive emphasis to having things  produced domestically. Consequently, some technology-intensive,  capital-intensive, and knowledge-intensive products and  industries of our country, such as passenger cars, electronic  products, chemical products, and high-grade textiles and the  industries producing those products, are not competitive on the  international market. After "the resumption of GATT membership,"  disruptive impacts of imports on the domestic market will be  unavoidable because of the reduction in administrative  intervention and the opening of the domestic market. According  to estimates, after "the resumption of GATT membership," there  will be direct disruptive effects on industries whose output  value accounts for approximately one-third of the total value of  industrial output. If the degree of connectedness between  industries is also taken into consideration, the prospective  impact should be considered to be very extensive. (Footnote 5:  Chen Jiaqin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership'  on Our Import and Export Trade and Measures To Deal With It,"  GUOJI MAOYI Sep 93)    B. Measures Our Country's Enterprises Should Adopt To  Deal With the Impact    1. Several measures to improve the quality of our country's  products so as to make them more competitive. a) Do a good job  of selecting pillar industries and leading products, bringing  about the progress and improvement of all industrial products.  In view of realities in the world and in our country, it is  proper to consider making the microelectronic and information  industries the pillar industries of our country, making  energetic efforts to support them and develop them on a priority  basis, linking them up with the information system, automation  system, and machinery industry system, and making applications  in the hundreds of thousands of enterprises of our country. Such  developments will be certain to speed up the technological  progress of our country's enterprises and improve enterprises'  management standards, thereby fundamentally resolving the  widespread problems of poor product quality, small product  variety, high costs, and low output in enterprises. b)  Accelerate enterprise reform, completing the thorough  transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms as soon as  possible. The basic condition for making enterprises transform  their operating mechanisms is the transformation of enterprises  into actors engaged in market competition. First, separate  government from enterprises and have enterprises truly acquire  the statuses as commodity producers and business operators and  as market actors. Second, it is necessary to build and perfect  the domestic market as soon as possible, making the domestic  market a unified, open, and comprehensive market based on fair  competition. Finally, make enterprises enter the market,  thoroughly transforming their operating mechanisms. All this  demands that accelerated supporting reforms of the systems  regulating foreign trade, finance, materials, investment,  prices, technological renovation, foreign exchange, etc., be  carried out, so that after the transformation enterprises' new  operating mechanisms can be used in practice and play their  role. c) Accelerate the development of new products, using  high-quality new products in efforts to occupy and expand  market. First, it is necessary to form "scientific  research-development-production complexes" in backbone  enterprises or enterprise groups, directly turning achievements  of scientific and technological research and applied  technologies into new physical products, and carrying out mass  production of those products. Second, with regard to the  approach to new product development, it is necessary to mainly  depend on one's own research, and to use technology introduction  and technological cooperation as supplementary means, combining  the two approaches. Lastly, carry out the technological  transformation of enterprises on the basis of revolving around  the development of new products and variety development. d) Make  active efforts to adopt international standards so as to  increase the international competitiveness of our country's  products. The standards of products reflect the technological  standards, labor quality, and management standards involved.  Moving our national standards toward international standards as  fast as possible and making enterprises directly adopt  international standards have also become urgent tasks. e) Reform  enterprises' wage system, making employees more inclined to care  about product quality. On the one hand, educate employees on  quality in a more vigorous manner, and raise employees' quality  awareness; on the other hand, have wages linked to product  quality. (Footnote 6: Liu Mingshun, "Several Measures to Improve  the Quality and Competitiveness of Our Country's Products After  Our Country's Resumption of Her Status As a GATT Signatory  Member," BEIJING SHANG XUEYUAN XUEBAO Mar 93)    2. Change enterprises' organizational form, so as to make  them capable of competing with foreign enterprises. a) Organize  enterprise groups, so as to make it easier to give play to  overall strengths, to create returns to scale, and to stimulate  fund accumulation and vertical and horizontal financing; in  addition, group economic activities are equipped with huge  fund-gathering capability and multiple fund-gathering channels,  a fact which is conducive to the concentration of production and  funds. Enterprise groups are capable of organizing and  conducting researches regarding the development of new products,  and are therefore able to proceed with technological renovation  and transformation. Enterprise groups are capable of taking  risks and competing with foreign companies, and are therefore  both more capable of attracting foreign capital and capable of  developing abroad. Currently, our country's enterprise groups  are small in scale. Local governments should emancipate their  minds, and break down vertical and horizontal barriers; they  should adopt policies tilted in favor of enterprises with  potentials and good prospects and invigorate those enterprises  on a priority basis, and should merge small and medium-sized  enterprises with low efficiency and concentrate funds on using  technology to tap their latent capability. b) Adopt the joint  stock system. The joint stock system is tied to socialized large  production. The joint stock system clarifies ownership rights  over assets, so that enterprise employees' status as masters  will become explicit and concrete. For now, correctly leading  residents to move toward stock and bond trading so as to turn  consumption funds into production funds also constitutes an  effective way to increase funds. (Footnote 7: Wang Chuanrong and  Li Huimin, "A Preliminary Discussion of How Some Enterprises of  Our Country Should Meet the Challenge Posed by Joining the  GATT,'" SHANDONG CAIZHENG XUEYUAN XUEBAO Feb 93)    3. Effectively use a flexible tariff system or differential  tariffs to protect national industry. At present, for developed  countries, tariffs no longer constitute a powerful means of  trade protection, but developing countries can still protect  their domestic industry very effectively by using the flexible  tariff system approved by the GATT. While lowering the overall  tariff level, it is necessary to adopt flexible differential  tariffs in view of the differences in the level of technological  development of different industries and the differences in the  competitiveness of different products of a given industry. It is  necessary to carry out little or no reduction in tariffs applied  to industries and products which are being developed  domestically, such as products of the electronic, chemical, and  medical supply industries. It is proper to substantially reduce  the tariffs applied to industries and products with regard to  which our country enjoys rather high technological standards and  is very competitive, such as textiles, clothing, light industry  products, and toys. (Footnote 8: She Jianzhi, "The Advantages  and Disadvantages of Our Country's Return to the GATT and  Measures to Deal With the Issue," JINGJI WENTI Feb 93)    4. Conscientiously study and consult various countries'  successful experience regarding nontariff trade-protection  measures, in an effort to develop our national industry. a)  Government's necessary intervention in international economics  and trade is indispensable; b) endeavoring to maintain a low  restriction on market shares of imports; c) in order to prevent  being controlled by foreign enterprises, some countries prohibit  foreign enterprises from carrying out any direct investment in  some sectors; d) enforcing strict technological standards and  safety and health laws and regulations; e) support provided by  the fiscal and financial policies of the government; f) the  policy of having things produced domestically; and g) organizing  customs unions and free trade areas, thereby exercising trade  protection based on having blocs of states serving as the actors.    5. Seek better conditions for entering the international  market and for acquiring advanced technologies by making use of  the GATT. At the present moment, to different extent all the  major developed industrial countries are imposing conditions or  restrictions on giving our country the most-favored-nation  treatment, imposing discriminatory quantitative restrictions on  our country, applying unjustifiable antidumping measures against  our country in an inappropriate manner, and controlling  technological exports to our country. After "the resumption of  GATT membership," our country can try to gradually eliminate  those discriminatory trade conducts and barriers under the  relevant provisions of the GATT. (Footnote 9: Yang Taishan, "The  Impact of the Return to the GATT on Our Country's Enterprises,"  QIYEJIA (Wuhan) No 23, 92)    6. Organize production and marketing in accordance with  international rules and practices. In the process of taking part  in the international division of labor in a comprehensive  manner, our country's enterprises should observe international  practices. For example, they should pay attention to compensated  use, special-purpose use, and regional and scope restrictions in  regard to the introducing, utilizing, and purchasing of patents,  trademarks, copyrights, etc. Enterprises should clear up matters  of intellectual property rights involving foreign works,  technologies, trademarks, and patents which they are now  copying, reproducing, or use without compensation. As another  example, those enterprises which have long been competing on the  basis of low prices should analyze their products' share of a  given market and their price ratios to comparable foreign  products; if the share is too large, it would be necessary to  try to reduce the concentration, for otherwise such a situation  can cause damage law suits and antidumping investigations.  (Footnote 10: Zhou Saiqin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT  Membership on Our Country's Industry," JINGJI WENTI TANSUO Mar  93)  <H5>  II. The Impact of the Return to the GATT on Domestic Prices </H5> in Our Country and Measures to Deal With It    A. Impact on Domestic Prices in Our Country    Some comrades believe that "the resumption of GATT  membership" will have a large impact on the general price level  on the domestic market. From a short-term perspective, prices  will decline on the domestic market. With the accelerated reform  of our country's foreign trade system, tariffs are gradually  becoming the main means of regulating imports and exports. With  the further opening of the domestic market, high-quality,  low-price products from the international market are more likely  to enter the market of our country, thereby bringing about  decreases in prices of comparable domestically produced  products. On the other hand, as required by the GATT, our  country's tariff level had to be appropriately lowered, and as a  result selling prices for some imports on the domestic market  will decline. All this will help alleviate supply and demand  contradictions, and will thus suppress inflation, thereby  contributing to effectively maintaining relative stability of  the general price level on the market. From a long-term  perspective, it will be more difficult to maintain the basic  stability of the general price level on the market. a) Under the  traditional system, our country has been a low-price country.  After the resumption of GATT membership, the domestic price  level will move toward the price level on the international  market, leading to price increases. b) With the economy becoming  more externally oriented, the supply and demand relationships on  the international market and the resultant price fluctuations  will both directly affect the supply and demand balance and  prices for materials in our country. c) With the reform of the  foreign exchange system, downward exchange-rate adjustments'  role of encouraging exports and inhibiting imports will be  strengthened; increases in purchasing prices for goods for  export will bring about some increases in prices for comparable  goods sold domestically. Therefore it is necessary to establish  a new set of effective mechanisms for suppressing inflation.  (Footnote 11: Sun Quan and Zhang Xianbin, "The Impact of the  Resumption of GATT Membership' on Domestic Prices and Measures  to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN Apr 93)    Some other comrades believe that after "the resumption of  GATT membership" the domestic general price level's basic  tendency to increase amid general stability will be determined  by the following several situations. a) Price increases caused  by the expansion of the scope of market regulation of prices  will be hampered by such factors as the opening of the domestic  market and the intensification of market competition. According  to estimates, after the scope of market regulation of prices is  expanded, prices for energy and raw materials will rise to some  extent, and prices for factors of production will also rise, but  because of competition the manufacturing sector will be forced  to absorb such price increases; thus prices for manufactures and  consumer goods can remain basically stable, and the domestic  general price level will not be markedly affected by the two  factors. b) Import tariff concessions and the downward  adjustments of renminbi [RMB] exchange rates are also two  mutually constraining factors. c) The price-raising effects of  protection of intellectual property rights will also be  cancelled out by the acceleration of technological progress.  Consequently, after "the resumption of GATT membership," the  domestic general price level will neither fall substantially nor  rise substantially. It will show a tendency to rise amid general  stability. (Footnote 12: Zhang Qian, "A Preliminary Analysis of  the Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on the Domestic  General Price Level," GUOJI MAOYI WENTI Jun 93)    According to another view, in the process of development as  well as reform and opening up, an economically backward country  will see large increases in its price level, or even  hyperinflation. As far as international factors are concerned,  the spread of international inflation into a country represents  a necessary law. It can spread through many means such as  foreign trade, foreign capital, foreign debts, and exchange rate  devaluation; it can also spread from the coastal regions to the  hinterland. As yuan may not be taken abroad, international  inflation can spread to the country, but domestic inflation  cannot spread abroad. All this shows that in the process of  opening up, our country's price level will inevitably rise until  it is the same as the price level on the international market.  By increasing the openness of our country, "the resumption of  GATT membership" is certain to accelerate the rising of domestic  prices. (Footnote 13: Yang Fan, "The Impact of the Return to the  GATT on Prices in Our Country," GUOJI MAOYI WENTI Feb 93)    Some comrades have also analyzed the defects of the  traditional price system. As they have pointed out, except for a  few commodities, the international and domestic price systems  have been basically disconnected for a long time; "the  resumption of GATT membership" will surely have disruptive  effects on the domestic price system. First, in terms of the  price level, the lowering of tariffs and the reform of the  domestic tax and fee system will result in the price level  falling somewhat; but reforms regarding the dual-track yuan  exchange rate system and the foreign-exchange distribution  system will lead to increases in the domestic price level, and  especially the further downward adjustment of yuan exchange  rates will result in increases in prices for goods for export;  enterprises will spend more on debt serving, resulting in  increases in costs, and the purchasing prices for goods for  export will also rise accordingly; increases in fees for  foreigner-related services will also bring about increases in  some related fees. Second, there will be further adjustments of  price structure. Prices for some goods which are too high or too  low domestically will gradually move toward prices on the  international market. With the development of international  service trade and because of the demand of the development of  tertiary industry in our country, service fees will be  substantially increased. (Footnote 14: Ma Song, "The Impact of  the Resumption of GATT Membership on Prices in China and  Thoughts on Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN  Jun 93)    B. Price Reform Measures Which Should Be Adopted To  Deal With the Impact    1. In accordance with the demands of the socialist market  economy, accelerate the transformation of the price-forming  mechanism and establish a pricing mechanism based mainly on  market regulation of prices. In the future, on the one hand, it  is necessary to supplement and perfect the pricing measures  regarding the production materials, light industry products, and  agricultural products for which prices have been decontrolled,  truly giving enterprises the right to set prices; on the other  hand, gradually decontrol, in batches and by stages, prices of  products which are suitable for being decontrolled and of which  conditions for decontrolling are basically ready, such as prices  for grain and some production materials as well as fees for some  social and business services. (Footnote 15: Gao Tiesheng and  Zhang Xuehong, "The GATT and Price Reform in Our Country,"  JINGJI LILUN YU JINGJI GUANLI May 93)    2. Accelerate and deepen price reform. a) Accelerate the  price reform related to prices for imports and exports. b)  Accelerate the price reform related to factors of production, so  as to stimulate the flow and factors of production and the  growth of the factor market. Especially, it is necessary to  accelerate the reform of prices for input of factors of  production relating to imports and exports. c) Accelerate the  reform of tertiary industry prices. d) Introduce market-economy  countries' effective pricing methods and principles which are  conducive to market competition, and reform the pricing methods  and principles which do not meet the demands of international  competition and a market economy. e) On the basis of referring  to practices in market-economy countries, establish and perfect  our country's socialist-market-economy system of the state's  macro-level price administration, regulation, and control. f.  Enhance the investigating and research involved in the price  decisions made by enterprises, especially large- and  medium-sized enterprises, strengthen enterprises' internal price  management, give emphasis to the gathering of price information,  train price workers, etc. (Footnote 16: Ma Song, "The Impact of  the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Prices in China and  Thoughts on Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU SHIJIAN  Jun 93)    3. Transform the function of price work, and improve price  management, so as to meet new demands. a) Broaden the horizon,  and emancipate the mind; establish the concept of large market  and the concept of the international market; and enhance the  analysis of dynamics of the international market, and study the  links between the domestic and international markets and the  impacts of the domestic and international markets on each other,  making such analysis and study one of the preconditions for  handling price work. b) Perfect price laws, regulations, and  methods, reduce direct administrative intervention, and use laws  and policies to regulate enterprises' pricing behavior and to  guide the functioning of the market, so as to make sure that the  situation is in accord with internationally followed principles.  c) Guide efforts to establish industrywide price consultation  organizations, which will coordinate the respective industries'  prices for imports and exports. (Footnote 17: Sun Quan and Zhang  Xianbin, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on  Domestic Prices and Measures to Deal With It," JIAGE LILUN YU  SHIJIAN Apr 93)    4. Complete the price reform mainly consisting of price  deregulation as soon as possible. As a comparison of the price  structure of our country's products with that of the  international market would show, prices for industrial products  and capital-intensive products of our country are too high,  whereas prices for primary products and labor-intensive products  of our country are obviously too low. In terms of our country's  tariff structure, our country's nominal tariff rates for  industrial products and capital-intensive products are high,  whereas our country's nominal tariff rates for primary products  and labor-intensive products are low. After the return to the  GATT, it will mainly be tariffs on industrial products in the  high tariff category and with values higher than on the  international market that will be reduced; on the markets for  such important industrial products as automobiles, machinery,  and electric appliances, domestically produced products will be  easily replaced by foreign goods. However, prices for primary  products such as crude oil and coal are lower than international  prices; thus, after "the resumption of GATT membership," those  products will flow to the international market in large  quantities, thereby aggravating the situation of short supply on  the domestic resource market. Therefore, to take the initiative  in meeting the challenge posed by "the resumption of GATT  membership" to domestic industries, it is necessary to carry out  the price reform mainly consisting of price deregulation, so as  to increase as much as possible the time difference between the  decontrolling of prices and the lowering of tariffs. In this way  it will be possible both to give full play to prices' role in  allocating resources and guiding production and consumption, and  to mitigate the disruptive effects produced by the substantial  weakening, caused by the reduction in nominal tariffs, of the  protective effects of actual tariffs on industrial products. At  the same time, alleviate the pressures created by tariff  concessions on our country's industry by appropriately lowering  RMB exchange rates some time later. (Footnote 18: Cai Sifu, "The  Challenge Posed by Tariff Reductions to Our Country's  Industries," ZHONGNAN CAIJING DAXUE XUEBAO Feb 93)  <H5>  III. Challenges Posed by the Return to the GATT to Our </H5> Country's Foreign Trade System and Measures To Deal With Them    A. Challenges Posed by the Return to the GATT to Our  Country's Foreign Trade System    1. Increases in imports will result in enterprises facing a  more complicated external environment. After "the resumption of  GATT membership," with the granting of large tariff concessions  and the weakening of nontariff barriers, the degree of openness  of the domestic market will suddenly increase; this will  inevitably result in increases in imports, thereby producing  huge disruptive effects on the external business environment for  various domestic enterprises, especially state-owned  enterprises. Such changes in environment will center on three  issues: a) because of imbalances between imports and exports  caused by increases in imports, maintaining a  balance-of-international-payments equilibrium will become a very  prominent issue; b) changes in conditions for importing goods  and in the composition of imports will further prompt and  stimulate the adjustment of consumption structure, thereby  affecting the structure of the economy as a whole and the  equilibrium of aggregate demand and supply, and thus adopting  effective measures to prevent a new round of inflation of  consumption demand will also become a practical issue; and c)  under the condition in which market access is granted, foreign  goods will squeeze into and occupy markets in our country,  thereby posing severe challenges to the development of domestic  industries, especially the machinery and electric product  industries. All this will undoubtedly create new destabilizing  factors in the macroeconomic environment. (Footnote 19: Wang  Shiyuan, "The Return to the GATT and the Reform of the Economic  System of Our Country," JINGJIXUE DONGTAI, Mar 93)    2. The return to the GATT will produce disruptive effects on  our country's foreign-trade management system. After "the  resumption of GATT membership," the import management system  will certainly be greatly simplified, and tariffs and nontariff  barriers will certainly be reduced. The foreign-trade management  system based on state commands and highly monopolized state  control will be transformed into a foreign-trade management  system based on enterprises' decentralized, independent import  and export operations. The decentralization of foreign trade  operations may result in efforts to export domestically produced  products by competing in lowering their prices, a behavior  detrimental to the trade interests of the nation. (Footnote 20:  Li Changcai, "Opportunities and Challenges Presented by the  Return to the GATT," JINGJI DONGTAI Feb 93)    3. The impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on the  import and export system. Currently signatories to the GATT  believe that our country's trade barriers are excessive, a  situation far from meeting GATT requirements. Therefore, it is  necessary to further relax foreign exchange control, lower  tariffs, reduce the scope of the use of import licenses, improve  import administration and policy transparency, reduce the scope  of plan-based management of foreign trade, grant greater  autonomy on foreign trade operations to foreigner-involved  enterprises, and reduce or eliminate means of subsidy such as  export-related tax refunds. Foreign trade enterprises will also  encounter competition from exporting enterprises at home. Thus,  the existing foreign trade system has to be reformed accordingly.    4. The impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on  foreign trade revenues and expenditures and on the value of the  currency. As some goods from our country are not competitive  internationally, they cannot be exported in large quantities to  earn foreign exchange, whereas foreign goods will pour into the  market of our country unimpeded; as a result there will occur  balance-of-payments deficits, forcing our country's yuan to  devalue and yuan exchange rates to decline. Such a development  will also produce a situation unfavorable to securing foreign  loans, resulting in increases in borrowing costs. (Footnote 21:  Yang Wenyan, "The Impact of the Resumption of GATT Membership on  Our Country's Economy and Measures to Deal With It," JINGJI  WENTI May 93)    5. It will be difficult to complete the fundamental reform  of  the foreign trade system within a short period of time. From a  long-term perspective, the benefits "the resumption of GATT  membership" will give our country will be fundamental in nature.  In the near term, there will be a time lag in many areas of work  in our country. The sudden transition from the old to the new  system will cause some confusion in economic life, and the  impact of the reform of the foreign trade system on other parts  of the economic system can be described as a situation in which  a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole;  it is absolutely impossible to complete the reform in a short  time. (Footnote 22: Li Shousheng, "A Preliminary Analysis of the  Resumption of GATT Membership' and the Issue of Access to the  Chinese and U.S. Markets," GUOJI MAOYI WENTI Sep 93)    B. Measures on Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Our  Country Should Adopt To Deal With the Challenges    1. Further reform and perfect our country's existing foreign  trade system. a. With regard to the export system: First, it is  necessary to reduce plan-controlled goods as much as possible;  with regard to large-volume investment goods with impacts on  state plans and people's lives as well as goods with bearings on  the national strategic interests, it is necessary to determine  the specific facts and conduct measurement on specific things in  an effort to achieve rationalization. Second, there should be  transparency with respect to the procedures, modes, and methods  governing the application for export licenses; give every  enterprise qualified for application the right to be informed of  all the aspects of the system and the procedures involved;  simplify the elaborate procedures, reduce costs, endeavour to  make things scientific and standardized, and reduce management  loopholes as much as possible. At the same time, carry out  competitive auctions, so as to increase returns on exports,  thereby safeguarding the overall returns for the country. Third,  further perfect foreign-trade enterprises' mechanism of  shouldering independent responsibilities for profits and losses.  Fourth, actively form all kinds of partnerships and joint  ventures across the sectors and carry out all kinds of  shareholding, mergers, and buy-out across the sectors, grant  more production enterprises or enterprise groups the right to  engage in import and export foreign-trade operations, and  further diversify and decentralize foreign trade actors, so as  to make it possible to take part in international competition in  an effective way. b. With regard to the import system, the  reform principles should be: establish a functioning mechanism  which is mainly based on tariff regulation and based on having  nontariff regulation serving as a supplement, which is  characterized by a rational tariff level and an appropriate  tariff structure, which contains the competition element to an  appropriate extent, and which protects infant industries; on the  basis of referring to the experience of some developing  countries (areas) on structural reform and in view of the  demands of the development of our national economy and the  adjustment of our country's industrial structure, formulate  annual mandatory and guidance plans on the entire country's  imports, with the main objective being to facilitate the  optimization of industrial structure; and, while protecting  national industry, it is necessary to select newly emerging  industries which are playing an important role in the  development of the national economy and enjoy advantages in  terms of development. (Footnote 23: Nie Wenlong, "Statements  Made Before Our Country's Return to the GATT," DANGDAI CAIJING  Jun 93)    2. Transform the function of government, further enhance the  transparency of our country's foreign trade policy, and regulate  foreign trade in accordance with the law. Under the condition of  a socialist market economy, enterprises are legal entities  carrying out business operations; government's function is  mainly to carry out planning, coordination, supervision, and  services, so as to create a good external environment for equal  competition among enterprises, but government should not  interfere in enterprises' business activities. At the same time,  it is also necessary to emphasize that giving play to the  market's role as the basic mechanism of allocating resources is  not tantamount to relinquishing the state's macroeconomic  regulation and control. (Footnote 24: Chen Jiaqin, "The Impact  of the Resumption of GATT Membership' on Our Import and Export  Trade and Measures to Deal With It," GUOJI MAOYI Sep 93)    3. Establish and perfect enterprises' mechanism of operating  in accordance with international practices. First, deepen  enterprise reform and transform enterprises' operating  mechanisms. In considering issues, it is necessary to link up  the functioning of the domestic economy with international  economic circulations and to link up the domestic market with  the international market; and it is necessary to focus on  resolving the issue of carrying out business operations in  accordance with the laws of movement of the international market  and international practices. Proceeding from realities,  establish joint-stock economic conglomerates in which foreign  trade enterprises will serve as leaders and which are based on  trade-industry, trade-agriculture, and trade-technology  integration, or joint-stock economic conglomerates in which  large backbone production enterprises will serve as leaders and  which will be based on industry-trade, industry-agriculture, and  industry-technology integration; take the initiative in actively  participating in marketing activities on the international  market; make enterprises turn into carrying out production and  business operations in accordance with the standard system,  market demand, price levels, marketing practices in the area of  international trade; include such internationalized-operation  targets as those on the amount of foreign exchange produced by  exports, costs for earning foreign exchange, the rate of foreign  exchange retrieval, and the amount of foreign exchange remitted  in the system of targets used in enterprise accounting, so as to  ensure the sustained, steady, and high-efficiency development of  foreign trade. Second, actively develop market internationally,  and promote the diversification of foreign trade. The main  problem in our country's foreign trade is that the relevant  market abroad is small, with around 90 percent of the exports  being confined to such regions as North America, Hong Kong,  Macao, and Europe. Such a situation is very far from meeting the  demands of the development of the situation at home and abroad.  In accordance with the principles of combining economic  relations with trade, of unified planning, of exploiting  strengths, and of rational distribution, closely combine export  trade with such activities as the utilization of foreign  capital, labor service cooperation, building projects on the  basis of contracts, and overseas investment; create new  breakthroughs in regard to purchasing and marketing channels,  fund raising, market development, and approaches to business  operations; gradually form a functioning mechanism of economic  and trade activities which is based on a situation in which the  economy stimulates trade, in which trade brings along the  economy, and in which domestic and international elements are  joined, forming a combined a force; enhance the performance of  many functions such as sales promotion, fund raising,  introduction of foreign things, exploratory efforts,  coordination, service, and information; and promote the  diversification of foreign trade. (Footnote 25: Lu Xinde, "A  Brief Discussion of the Linking Up of Our Country's Domestic  Market With the International Market," SHANDONG CAIZHENG XUEYUAN  XUEBAO Feb 93)    4. Establish and perfect laws and regulations on imports,  and  replace the existing administrative regulations of various kinds  with laws, so as to enhance the transparency of our country's  foreign trade policy. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate  and enact our country's Foreign Trade Law, Antidumping Law, and  Antisubsidy Law as well as market protection measures as soon as  possible. As the day of our country's final resumption of her  GATT signatory status is drawing near, our country is faced with  the prospect of foreign products pouring into the domestic  market. As soon as preexisting administrative measures are  terminated, they must be replaced with relevant laws to provide  protection so as to help customs offices protect national  industry; otherwise there will be inestimable harms to the  implementation of the state's industrial policy and the  development of the national economy.

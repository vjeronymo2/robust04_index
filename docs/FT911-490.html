			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Travel: The happy isles - Snapshot THE Isles of Scilly are a group of 100 tiny islands clustered in a deep blue sea with white sand on their long curving beaches, palm trees in cottage gardens, fields of daffodils in November, wild orchids in the hedgerows in summer. Huge rocks hewn into primeval shapes jut from the sea where seals and dolphins swim and the grass on the coastal paths is springy underfoot. Winters are mild, summers generally sunny and visitors return year after year not just for walking, boating, fishing and bird-watching but for the peace and friendliness they find. The islands lie 28 miles south-west of Land's End, the most southerly point of the British mainland. Only five are inhabited (pop: 2,000) and there is accommodation on all five. St Mary's, three miles by two, is the largest and the only place where private cars are allowed . With its shops, restaurants, pubs, cafes, hotels and guest houses, it has a bustle that is noticeably absent from the other islands. Tresco has sub-tropical gardens. St Martin's, with a population of 84, has recently acquired a 24-bedroomed luxury hotel. On St Agnes you can hunt for beads buried in the sand from a 17th century wreck and have delicious pasties at The Turks Head. On Bryher, waves crash spectacularly on to the gigantic rocks of Hell Bay. The great pleasures of the Scillies include inter-island boat trips, with St Mary's boatmen visiting hotels and guest houses at breakfast to announce their programmes for the day. Other islands have their own boats and, weather permitting, visit most places most days. An old poem still seems to sum up the Scillies: 'Rocks and sand and barren land, a church without a steeple. Houses made of ship-wrecked wood, full of happy people.' Tourist Information Centre, St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, tel: 0720-22536.</p>

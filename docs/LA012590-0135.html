			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS FAULT MCMARTIN CHILD INTERVIEW METHODS  </P> <P> There are many things to be learned from the McMartin Pre-School molestation  case, but perhaps the most important lesson of all is how not to talk to  children, according to top child-development experts.  </P> <P> Experts across the country say the interview techniques intended to extract the  truth from youngsters who attended the Manhattan Beach nursery school were so  misguided as to make the children seem coerced, rehearsed and ultimately  unbelievable to the jury. And last Thursday, the jury acquitted Ray Buckey and  his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 counts of child molestation.  </P> <P> According to both child development and criminal defense experts who have  closely monitored the case for the last six years, some of the adults -- the  parents, the prosecutors, the therapists -- who tried hardest to find out what  happened in the first place may have done the most to confuse the case in the  end. While the prosecution's approach will surely be subjected to ongoing  attacks of second-guessing and Monday morning quarterbacking, in the long run  it will be the conversations with the children that were the most confusing,  the most damaging.  </P> <P> "If I had to do it over again, I would do some things differently," Kee  McFarlane, the social worker at the Children's Institute International who  interviewed many of the children, told The Times on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The problem, according to the experts, was that most of the children were never  given the chance to simply tell what, if anything, happened to them.  </P> <P> "They were never given the opportunity to tell their stories as they knew them,  in their own words, until long after their minds had been contaminated with the  thoughts and fears of the adults around them," said David Raskin, a  psychologist at the University of Utah who has been studying child abuse cases  for the last 15 years. By then, he said, it was too late.  </P> <P> Although the questioning process worked differently for each of the 360  children who eventually claimed to have been sexually molested, in many  instances it was the parents who first talked to their own children, followed  by the police. Eventually most of the children were referred to the Children's  Institute International, an established child-abuse treatment center in Los  Angeles that had much experience with abused children but little or no  knowledge of the judicial system.  </P> <P>  McFarlane summed up the institute's approach this way: Because of their fears  about what their parents would think and what the police would do, because of  their terror about what their perpetrators had supposedly done already, the  children had to be helped, they had to be taken by the hand and persuaded that  it was "all right to tell their yucky secrets."  </P> <P> If she were doing it again, McFarlane said, she would move more slowly, giving  the chlidren time to say whatever it is they wanted to say in their own words.  The problem, she said, was that there were so many cases. (The institute  interviewed 400 children.) And there was much pressure to get through with it,  to get on with it.  </P> <P> Given the choice, she said, she might not do it at all -- at least she would  not put herself in the position of being both therapist and investigator.  </P> <P> "You can't do both, not at the same time," McFarlane said in a telephone  interview from San Francisco, where she said she has gone to rest and reflect  on what went wrong with the case from the prosecution's -- and the children's  -- point of view.  </P> <P> "The unfortunate thing about what happened in the McMartin case is that we were  forced to do both," McFarlane said. "We were gathering information for lawyers  while at the same time we were just trying to get these children through their  fears."  </P> <P> A therapist's or social worker's goal is to understand "the subjective reality"  of the patient, to understand his fears and fantasies, Raskin said.  </P> <P> An investigator's job is to deal only with reality, "the truth as it actually  happened," not as it was feared or imagined, Raskin said. These two goals are  completely in conflict, he said.  </P> <P> Just because the interviews were conducted as they were does not mean that the  crimes did not occur, said Faye Girsh, a San Diego therapist. It simply means  that "it will be impossible for anyone ever to know for certain exactly what  did -- and what did not -- happen" at the McMartin school, said Girsh, who has  worked on numerous child-abuse cases that have been successfully prosecuted,  including a recent one involving 26 children in a Montessori day school  baby-sitting service in Reno, Nev.  </P> <P> By comparing cases that have been successfully prosecuted with those that have  not, social scientists have tried to glean information about how children talk,  how they think -- and what will hold up in court.  </P> <P> "The only thing we agree on across the board is that the way it was done in the  McMartin case is not the way it should be done. Beyond that, there isn't a lot  of agreement among experts about what is right and what isn't," said one  child-abuse specialist, who, like most of the nationally known figures in the  field, was drawn into the case as a consultant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Questions Remain  </P> <P> Since the McMartin case began, dozens of books have been written and hundreds  of workshops and seminars have been conducted across the country to try to  teach mental-health specialists something about how the judicial system  operates and to teach lawyers and police officers something of how the mind of  a child works. But many questions remain on both sides.  </P> <P> Although some experts continue to believe that child molestation is  under-reported, some law-enforcement officers and a growing number of  child-abuse experts believe that the United States may be suffering from mass  hysteria about child abuse -- a hysteria that is now infecting the minds of the  children who are not developmentally equipped to distinguish between truth and  lie, fact and fantasy.  </P> <P> The other side of the problem is that actual child molesters are extremely hard  to identify.  </P> <P> In the behavioral sciences unit at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., profiles  of child molesters have been developed. Unlike drug traffickers or other  high-profile criminals, child molesters are often model citizens, hard-working,  successful professionals, usually men, who are unusually kind to children and  have no apparent sign of mental illness, other than their abnormal sexual  attraction to children.  </P> <P> "That's why they are so scary," said Girsh, who in her practice has treated  many perpetrators of incest and pedophiles, the medical term for child  molesters.  </P> <P> But researchers have also been observing parents as well as perpetrators. And  what they are seeing is nearly as chilling.  </P> <P> Even when parents simply suspect that their child has been abused, they behave  in ways that can also harm the children. Sometimes parents react with such  horror and disbelief that they do not give the children any support and they do  not even allow them the opportunity to say whether anything really happened.  </P> <P> In other cases, parents become so obsessed with their own worries that they  badger their children to the point they begin to think something untoward or  awful has happened, even when it really has not.  </P> <P> There are researchers who believe that children, because of their vulnerability  and their dependency on adults, can in effect be brainwashed by an unending  barrage of questions, allegations and innuendoes.  </P> <P> But there are other experts who believe that this line of reasoning is  preposterous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Equipped to Lie  </P> <P> Children, these researchers insist, cannot tell a lie, at least not about  something as painful and unfamiliar as sexual abuse. They have neither the  experience, the incentive nor the language to do so.  </P> <P> Many of these arguments are based on years of study by prominent researchers in  the field, most notably Gail Goodman, a development psychologist at the State  University of New York at Buffalo, and Karen Saywitz, director of children's  psychological outpatient services at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> Working under grants from the U.S. Justice Department, the National Center on  Child Abuse and Neglect and other organizations, these researchers have found  that while children, especially children the age of those who attended the  McMartin Pre-School, can and will fabricate a wrong answer to a question, they  are not able to fabricate details.  </P> <P> One of the unfortunate by-products of the nation's war on child abuse, however,  is that children at younger and younger ages are learning more and more about  child abuse.  </P> <P> Girsh tells the story of a case in San Diego involving a recently divorced  couple whose 6-year-old daughter accused the father, a prominent and respected  lawyer, of sexual abuse. The child insisted that she knew the difference  between truth and lie, between fact and fantasy. True, she knew the words. But  she also insisted in court that she had seen the tooth fairy.  </P> <P> In the end, the judge and jury learned that her mother had recently read her a  book on child molestation, which the child, for whatever reasons, had committed  to memory. What she had told her mother and the prosecutors was not what she  had actually experienced in real life but what she learned from a book.  </P> <P> If an interview is conducted properly -- meaning that children are given the  time and the encouragement to talk, but are not told what to say or what others  have said before them -- they will eventually tell the truth, many researchers  believe.  </P> <P> The question is how to get it.  </P> <P> Some studies have shown that the more serious the interviewer is, the more  likely the child will be to tell the truth. But other studies have suggested  that the colder and more emotionally remote the interviewer, the more likely  the child will be to say what he or she believes the interviewer wants to hear.  </P> <P> One of the controversial techniques, one used in the McMartin case, involves  playing on the floor with the children and using dolls and puppets. Critics say  such practices demean children, compromise the seriousness of the task and lead  to more fantasy playing than fact telling. Others say it is necessary to put  the children at ease, although even proponents acknowledge that too much should  not be read into what children do with dolls.  </P> <P> As one child-abuse expert put it, "The dolls are not lie detectors; they are  communication tools."  </P> <P> What is most important, according to many experts, is understanding the  language children speak.  </P> <P> "If you start using works like, 'under' or 'against' or 'on top of' or  'inside,' you'd better know ahead of time that children actually know what  those prepositions mean," said Laurie Braga, a psychologist at the University  of Miami Medical School, who, along with her husband, Joseph, helped  prosecutors by interviewing dozens of sexually abused children in a day-care  center in Miami in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> That case -- which was the subject of a book, "Unspeakable Acts" by Jan  Hollingsworth, and a television docudrama -- resulted in what is said to be the  first successful prosecution in the nation of a day-care center operator on  multiple abuse charges.  </P> <P> It is also critical, Laurie Braga said, to understand something about child  development. What do children know? What can they remember?  </P> <P> You cannot, for example, ask a 3-year-old whether something happened within the  last 30 days or even within the last 30 minutes. They don't even know how to  tell time.  </P> <P> A common theme voiced by many child-abuse experts is just how poorly equipped  the American courtroom is to deal with accusations from children.  </P> <P> "In our judicial system, we are not allowed to ask 'leading' questions," said  Ann Uherek, a psychologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, who has provided  therapy for 12 McMartin students and 38 other children enrolled in five nearby  schools who had also claimed to be abused.  </P> <P> Uherek said the typical question in an American court of law is worded this  way: "Tell us what happened on the morning of April 19, 1989." That is not a  question a 3-year-old or a 4-year-old or even a 9-year-old can answer, she  added.  </P> <P> Although California and other states have exceptions in their codes of evidence  that make some allowances for children, many experts believe that the courts  have not gone far enough in accommodating children. There have been some  efforts to reform the system, including an experiment in Denver where judges  bring children into their private chambers, sit them on their knees and listen  to what they have to say.  </P> <P> Some states, California included, have also passed laws allowing testimony to  be taken in private, on closed circuit television, so small children are spared  the trauma of appearing before their alleged abusers.  </P> <P> The American judicial system insists that the accused be allowed to face his  accuser. But when dealing with children, Uherek said, that system simply does  not work. "It may be fine for adults," she said, "but not for children, who are  susceptible to magical thinking . . . who believe that simply by having to face  their perpetrator, they will be harmed or even killed."  </P> <P> "In one sense," Joseph Braga said, "there may be a great deal of historical  significance in these child-abuse cases because we are beginning to define what  are the needs, what are the capabilities of young children."  </P> <P> The unfortunate thing, according to many experts, is that many people are  inexperienced in this new field and are operating by the seat of their pants.  </P> <P> As far as many child-abuse experts are concerned, however, there is a bitter  irony in all the criticism that has been lodged against McFarlane and others  like her who have tried to help children tell painful stories about what adults  have done to them.  </P> <P> Unlike rape cases, in which the victim is often blamed for what may or may not  have happened, it is the therapist in child-abuse cases who gets the brunt of  the criticism.  </P> <P> We cannot bring ourselves to blame innocent children, the experts say, but we  certainly can and do blame the adults who helped the children to tell their  stories. It is, Joseph Braga said, a new form of an ancient practice: Killing  the messenger because you don't like the message.  </P></p>

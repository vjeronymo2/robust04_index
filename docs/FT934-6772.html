			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: BASF likely to cut dividend again BASF, the German chemicals group, is likely to cut its dividend again this year and expects business to remain weak before turning up in 1995, according to Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman. Pre-tax earnings for the first nine months of 1993 were down 44 per cent at DM607m (Dollars 354m), mainly because of a 10 per cent sales decline in Europe, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of the total, he said. German operations were showing operating losses, and would be liable for a considerably lower tax bill. The group cut its dividend by DM2 to DM10 last year after pre-tax profits fell 41 per cent to DM1.24bn. Profits had also been hit by heavy start-up and development work on the group's gas business and plants at Schwarzheide in eastern Germany, Antwerp and Mexico. Group sales, down 5 per cent overall at DM30.7bn in the nine months, were helped by a 7 per cent rise in north America which stemmed partly from the acquisition of Mobil's polystyrene business. While Mr Strube gave no clear forecasts for the full year, or the dividend, he said sales in August and September were around 5 per cent higher than in the same two months of 1992, marking the first improvement this year so far. 'Volumes and earnings are beginning to stabilise at a low level,' he said. 'We have probably reached the bottom of the slope, but it is too soon to conclude that we have started up the other side.' Earnings power was still being dampened by slack demand and low prices resulting from over-capacity and increasing imports from low-cost countries. Sales of plastics and fibres, BASF's biggest business sector, fell 9 per cent to DM7.3bn because of a 19 per cent drop in Europe, including a 23 per cent slump in the domestic market. Chemicals, accounting for 13 per cent of total sales, remained one of the group's biggest earners, Mr Strube said. A 9 per cent decline in Europe was partly offset by a 15 per cent revival in north America. Confirming further labour cuts and closures in Germany - continuing a programme which had helped reduce fixed costs by DM600m so far this year - he signalled greater concentration in future on developing the chemicals business abroad. While some 45 per cent of spending in this sector, excluding oil and gas, had been focused in Germany in recent years, the proportion would be cut to 35 per cent in a new medium-term plan. China was playing a particularly significant role in the company's internationalisation, he noted.</p>

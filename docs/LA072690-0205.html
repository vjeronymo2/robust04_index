			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEBEER GAINING IN BATTLE WITH INS;  </P> <P> DEPORTATION FIGHT: THE YOUNG DUTCH NATIVE WHO KILLED HIS GUARDIAN IN DANA POINT  AFTER BEING MOLESTED IS FREED OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGE OF COMMITTING A CRIME  OF MORAL TURPITUDE.  </P> <P> A federal immigration judge in San Francisco Wednesday bolstered Dutch native  Joeri DeBeer's hopes of avoiding deportation by dismissing the government's  charge that DeBeer committed a crime of moral turpitude when he killed his  abusive guardian as a teen-ager, according to DeBeer's attorney.  </P> <P> The judge threw out the charge because DeBeer's conviction was expunged in  March by a Superior Court judge in Contra Costa County.  </P> <P> But the Immigration and Naturalization Service will press on in its effort to  deport DeBeer under a second charge, stemming from the expiration of his  student visa in 1986.  </P> <P> An attorney for the INS said the agency would not grant him permission to leave  the country by "voluntary departure." That alternative, which is often afforded  illegal immigrants whom the Justice Department deems to be "of good moral  character" for the previous five years, would ease DeBeer's efforts to re-enter  and settle in the United States in the future, which he says he would want to  do if forced to leave.  </P> <P> DeBeer killed his guardian more than five years ago, and his attorney, John  Alcorn, says he has shown good moral character since then. But INS San  Francisco District Director David N. Ilchert vehemently opposes DeBeer's being  given anything but a deportation order. "The kid's not Jack Armstrong," Ilchert  said. "If he butchers and barbecues and buries another human being, is he of  good moral character?"  </P> <P> Immigration Judge Brian Simpson set DeBeer's new deportation hearing for Jan.  18. He was originally ordered deported in 1986, but a federal immigration  appeals board recently reopened the case.  </P> <P> "This changes the whole picture," said Alcorn, a Laguna Hills immigration  attorney. "The one and only issue will be to determine if Joeri's of good moral  character. I don't know what on earth the government will come up with."  </P> <P> DeBeer was convicted in 1986 of voluntary manslaughter for the killing of  Phillip Allen Parsons, a child molester who had brought DeBeer to the United  States at the age of 13 with the permission of DeBeer's mother.  </P> <P> At his trial, DeBeer testified that Parsons had molested him repeatedly, until  finally, on April 9, 1985, the 17-year-old youth shot Parsons with a borrowed  gun, took the body to Riverside County and set it afire with gasoline. Then he  returned to their Dana Point apartment and set it on fire.  </P> <P> A sympathetic jury recommended leniency for DeBeer, and he was sentenced to  three years' probation and 14 months in Juvenile Hall, which he had already  served awaiting trial.  </P></p>

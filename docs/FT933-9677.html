			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Hosokawa cabinet balances rivalries JAPAN'S newly installed prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, early today named a key coalition ally, Mr Tsutomu Hata, as foreign minister and deputy premier. In announcing his cabinet line-up, Mr Hosokawa completed a delicate balancing act. He has put together a cabinet new enough to keep his just-elected seven-party coalition happy, but experienced enough to ensure continuity in government. The core posts went to defectors from the Liberal Democratic party, now in opposition after nearly 40 years in office. But Mr Hosokawa still found room in the cabinet for a record three women and for two non-politicians. Mr Hata's party, the Japan Renewal party, also picked up the posts of agriculture minister, minister of international trade and industry, and finance, which went to a former bureaucrat, Mr Hirohisa Fujii. After his appointment was announced, Mr Hata said that a priority for him would be to apologise clearly for wartime brutality in the hope of securing a full reconciliation with other Asian countries. 'We have to find the right words,' he said. Other leaders of coalition parties were also rewarded with posts, including Mr Sadao Yamahana, the Social Democratic party leader, who is the minister responsible for political reform, which is the the policy priority of the Hosokawa government. Mr Hata was one of the key defectors who brought down the former Liberal Democratic party government over its failure to enact political reforms. The cabinet list came two days after Mr Hosokawa was elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote that put the seal on the LDP's setback in the general election on July 18. There were intense negotiations to balance the interests of the seven parties involved. Mr Hosokawa appointed a woman, Ms Manae Kubota, to the post of Economic Planning Agency director. The 68-year-old Ms Kubota belongs to the Social Democratic party and has served in the Upper House of parliament. The labour minister is Chikara Sakaguchi, a member of the Buddhist-backed Komeito Party. While Mr Hosokawa has been working out his cabinet, Japan's bureaucrats have continued to do things their way. Without consulting the new administration, finance ministry officials have been telling other ministries that spending in next year's budget will increase by only 3 per cent. The ministries are supposed to present their spending plans to the finance ministry by the end of this month, and appear to be ready to continue the plans made under LDP rule.

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Vosper to boost acquisition level VOSPER Thornycroft Holdings, the shipbuilding and engineering group, intends to increase the size and frequency of acquisitions, with a view to lessening its dependency on warship orders. The Southampton-based company reported a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.08m in the six months to October 3. Sales rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 114.6m, of which 84 per cent is for export. Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said the group had so far been justifiably cautious on making acquisitions, having purchased businesses for about Pounds 1m each. However, he was now prepared to buy one or more businesses at about the Pounds 20m level, if and when suitable candidates were identified. Mr Martin Jay, managing director, said about 15 per cent of sales were already not connected to warship orders, which could be erratically phased, although some of this work was still defence related. The group had cash balances of Pounds 137m at the half-year, although the total was inflated by the receipt of a large stage payment for work in hand. The underlying cash position is about Pounds 60m. The order book of work yet to be performed is worth more than Pounds 600m, with over 95 per cent for export. Mr Usher said he looked forward to tendering for the next batch of Royal Navy minehunters. 'Despite uncertainties over the level of UK defence expenditure, we are encouraged that the minister for defence procurement stated last month that the Royal Navy needs more single role minehunters.' The group has completed an Pounds 8m investment programme in shipbuilding facilities. In preparation for the Common New Frigate which is foreseen for the Royal and European navies, the company has also become partners in a bidding team for the project with GEC and British Aerospace. Earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 19.6p (17.8p), while the interim dividend is lifted by 13 per cent to 5.3p (4.7p).</p>

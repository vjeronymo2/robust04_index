			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BECHER'S BROOK FENCE TO BE ALTERED  </P> <P> Becher's Brook, the feared Grand National fence where eight horses have been  killed in the last 21 years, will be modified before next year's running of the  famous steeplechase.  </P> <P> Prompted by a public outcry over the deaths of two horses at Becher's in this  year's race, officials of Britain's Jockey Club said the changes will make the  fence safer for riders and horses without loss of its intrinsic difficulty.  </P> <P> Under the project, the landing side of the fence will be altered to level off  the acute backward slope that pulls horses into a ditch if they land short. The  depth of the water-filled ditch will be reduced by 30 inches, and new running  rails will be installed on the landing side so that horses can jump straight  ahead and not be forced to veer across their rivals.  </P></p>

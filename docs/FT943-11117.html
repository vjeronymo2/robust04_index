			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Economic data in the coming days is likely to set the tone for the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee on August 16. Recent data has provided mixed evidence about the pace of US expansion - not least last Friday's second-quarter gross domestic product figures. The 3.7 per cent growth rate is faster than the long-term sustainable rate: but the figure was below market expectations and consumer spending growth remained weak, helping the bond market to its best gain in weeks. The long bond advanced nearly two points on Friday, to put the yield at under 7.4 per cent. Friday's employment numbers will determine whether the market can hold on to these gains. After 379,000 new jobs in June most economists expect the July figures to show slower job growth. Expectations range from 150,000 to 375,000. A weak employment report would further reduce fears of Fed tightening at its August meeting. Other data filling out the economic picture this week will be June personal income growth (expected at about 0.3 per cent); the June National Association of Purchasing Managers Index (expected to slip to about 57, from 57.5 in May, due to the build-up in inventory) and new home sales (expected to slow to 700,000 from 738,000 in May).</p>

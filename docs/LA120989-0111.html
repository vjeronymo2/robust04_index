			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> BISHOP CALLED OUT OF LINE IN KILLEA PRO-CHOICE CASE  </P> <P> Californians of every religion, including people who oppose abortion, believe  that a Catholic bishop was out of line when he barred a San Diego assemblywoman  from receiving Communion because of her pro-choice stand, The Times Poll has  found.  </P> <P> The fact that the assemblywoman, Democrat Lucy Killea, went on to score an  upset victory in a state Senate race tends to substantiate another point  illustrated by the poll: It helps when running for elective office in  California to be pro-choice on abortion.  </P> <P> Most Californians generally favor abortion personally, the survey showed. This  places them in disagreement with Americans as a whole, who basically oppose  abortion, according to a nationwide survey conducted by The Times last March.  </P> <P> The latest state poll involved telephone interviews with 2,046 adults -- 1,594  of them registered voters -- over a five-day period ending Wednesday night. The  margin of error is three percentage points in either direction.  </P> <P> "Although religion has always played an important part in American politics,  this survey reaffirms that a majority of voters are likely to resent attempts  by the church to influence the outcome of political contests," Times Poll  Director I. A. Lewis said.  </P> <P> On other issues, the survey found that:  </P> <P> * The ballot measure pushed by Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature to  raise gasoline taxes in order to finance highway construction and improvements  still is in trouble with the voters, although support has increased since two  October surveys by The Times Poll. In this latest survey, 36% favored the  proposal and 42% opposed it, with 22% expressing no opinion. In early October,  only 29% favored the measure and 53% were opposed.  </P> <P> * State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is running 10 points ahead of former San  Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein in early jockeying for the 1990 Democratic  gubernatorial nomination, 35% to 25% with 40% undecided. This is virtually the  same standing as The Times Poll found in an October survey, when Van de Kamp  held a 12-point lead.  </P> <P> * A hypothetical November runoff between Van de Kamp and Sen. Pete Wilson, the  expected Republican gubernatorial nominee, now is dead even among registered  voters, with each getting 33%. This marks no change from the October poll, when  each had 34%. In a Wilson-Feinstein match-up, the GOP senator holds a 20-point  lead, 45% to 25%. That is a widening of the gap since October when the  candidates were 14 points apart.  </P> <P> Democratic Assemblywoman Killea's stunning triumph in a Republican-dominated  Senate district last Tuesday was viewed in both political and religious circles  as a backlash against Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher's widely publicized,  harshly worded sanction against Killea. Although personally opposed to  abortion, Killea advocates the pro-choice position of allowing each woman to  decide for herself whether to have an abortion.  </P> <P> "If the bishop had stayed out of it, I would have won," complained Killea's  bitter opponent, GOP Assemblywoman Carol Bentley. The Times Poll had no way of  proving her contention, since this was a statewide survey. But it did show that  Californians as a whole consider the bishop's dramatic step in denying  Communion to the candidate to be an unwarranted intrusion into politics.  </P> <P> Asked whether they regarded the bishop's action as "appropriate or not," 71% of  the voters branded it inappropriate, including 70% of the Protestants and 71%  of the Catholics. Only 21% felt it was appropriate.  </P> <P> Even a majority of voters who generally oppose abortion believed that the  bishop was out of line, by 52% to 34%.  </P> <P> The survey reaffirmed that Californians are much more tolerant about abortion  than are Americans generally. The Californians were asked whether they find  themselves "more in favor of abortion or more opposed," and the response was  54% in favor, 36% opposed and 10% not sure. By contrast, a national poll by The  Times last March found Americans as a whole to be opposed to abortion, 40% to  34%.  </P> <P> Among California Catholics, there is a significant difference between voters  and non-voters in their attitudes toward abortion. Catholics who are registered  to vote favor abortion by a 5-4 ratio, but those who are not registered oppose  it by 7 to 5.  </P> <P> Latinos overwhelmingly oppose abortion, by a ratio of 9 to 5. But their impact  in the voting booth is disproportionately low because less than half -- only  44%, according to this survey -- are registered to vote. By contrast, 76% of  all other racial and ethnic groups are registered. And these groups favor  abortion by 7 to 4.  </P> <P> Basically, the higher people stand on the socioeconomic ladder the more they  support abortion.  </P> <P> All these factors contribute to a political climate that tends to reward  candidates who are pro-choice.  </P> <P> To illustrate the point, The Times Poll asked voters to choose between two  mythical candidates for governor, a "Mr. A" and a "Mr. B." The survey sample  was divided, with the candidates' abortion positions -- whether pro-choice or  anti-abortion -- reversed for two voter groups. The result was that whichever  candidate was described as pro-choice emerged as a lopsided winner.  </P> <P> Voters also were asked whether the abortion issue alone would cause them to  abandon a candidate whom they normally would support except for the candidate's  position on abortion. The responses showed that anti-abortion voters tend to be  slightly more committed to their cause than are pro-choice voters.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion voters, the survey showed, are somewhat more apt to desert a  pro-choice candidate than pro-choice voters are to abandon an anti-abortion  contender. But because there are significantly more voters who favor the right  to abortion than oppose it, a candidate who takes a pro-choice position can  count on gaining more votes than he loses, roughly two points worth.  </P> <P> Finally, voters were asked about their attitudes toward some candidate who  might take a position "very different" from their own "on a sensitive issue,"  but promised to "uphold the present law" rather than "impose his views on  others." Would the voter hesitate to support such a candidate or would the  promise to uphold the law be sufficient?  </P> <P> This is more than just a hypothetical question in the 1990 gubernatorial race,  because Van de Kamp personally opposes capital punishment but says he would  carry out the law and allow murderers to be executed. As a Catholic, he also  personally opposes abortion, but is pro-choice.  </P> <P> Voters were closely divided on the question in this survey, with 46% saying  they would hesitate to vote for the candidate, 41% saying the "uphold the law"  vow would be sufficient and 13% not sure what they would do.  </P> <P> The poll also showed that relatively few voters are paying any attention to the  budding races for lesser state offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney  general and treasurer.  </P> <P> In the contest for the Democratic attorney general nomination, the poll showed,  Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner holds a 10-point lead over San Francisco  Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, but 66% had no opinion.  </P> <P> State Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and John Seymour (R-Anaheim) are  running virtually even for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, with a  whopping 87% holding no view on the contest. Abortion could become an issue in  that race since Seymour's surprise announcement in September that he had  reversed his position and is now pro-choice.  </P> <P> Similarly, State Treasurer Thomas Hayes and former U.S. Treasurer Angela (Bay)  Buchanan of Irvine are running even in their bids for the GOP treasurer  nomination, but 68% have no opinion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOTING PREFERENCES  </P> <P>  If the November general election for governor were between John K.

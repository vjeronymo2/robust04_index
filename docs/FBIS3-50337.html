The delegations were led by Mate Granic, deputy prime  minister and foreign minister of the Republic of Croatia, and  FRY Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic. The meeting was held on  the basis of the recently signed declaration between the two  countries. After the talks, which were of a consultative  character, both sides said that they reached an agreement on  several matters. This is assessed as a step forward in the  implementation of the joint declaration.    Both sides have taken all necessary steps to ensure that the  two governments' offices open in Zagreb and Belgrade by the 15  February deadline and that all related technicalities are agreed  upon.    They also agreed to set up a joint commission of the two  governments to deal with displaced persons, refugees, and other  humanitarian issues. The two governments are to appoint  high-ranking and responsible members of the commission as soon  as possible and invite ICRC [International Committee of the Red  Cross] and UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]  representatives to take part in the commission's work. The  commission will be open for contacts with the families of  missing people and their associations.    Both sides took on the responsibility to unconditionally  exchange information on the missing persons and make extra  efforts to find them. At the same time the commission will be  allowed access to all locations presumed to house either  imprisoned or missing persons.    The two sides also examined all other issues of importance  for the normalization of relations between the two countries and  for Croatian-Serbian relations as a whole. They agreed to  examine these issues at regular meetings at high political  level, in principle once a month, in the capitals Zagreb and  Belgrade on an alternating basis.    To this aim Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, invited Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic to  visit Zagreb. The invitation was accepted with pleasure and the  date was fixed for 12 February. On this occasion there will  also be held the first meeting of the joint commission for  missing persons and humanitarian issues.</p>

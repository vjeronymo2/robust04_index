			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] After submitting to the Congress the 1995 budget  bill, Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said that the new  parity of the bolivar to the dollar could be adopted during  Wednesday's Council of Ministers. He warned that the official  exchange rate will enter into force on 6 July but added that  there will be controlled foreign exchange and secondary  [marginal] exchange fed by nontraditional exports. Sosa  Rodriguez added that the Central Bank may at some time supply  that secondary dollar market with some foreign currency.    According to Development Minister Alberto Poletto, the  regulated prices of staple products will be announced after the  exchange rate is announced. In the minister's opinion, the price  control measure is necessary to halt the increase in the prices  of staple products, because hoarding has been on the rise in  recent weeks. He believes that profound changes will take place  when adjustments to the economy are made, mainly in terms of the  financial crisis involving government intervention in eight  banks and one financial corporation. That is why the measure is  temporary and depends on the balance of the market.    [Begin Poletto recording] These prices should be adjusted.  There will not be a frozen price rate. The prices will be  adjusted inasmuch as some indicators may vary, mainly the  monetary indicator, meaning the exchange rate of the bolivar to  the dollar. We are trying to cover a whole range of products,  which as we understand -- that is, what came out in the decree  you are familiar with -- represent 80 percent of the usual and  normal consumption of the Venezuelan people. [end recording]    Commenting on the services mentioned in the decree, Poletto  indicated that regulations are in the hands of the respective  ministries. Some services are even being controlled by contracts.</p>

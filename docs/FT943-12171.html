			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Privatisation in 1996 for Pechiney Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, who is due to take over as chairman of Pechiney later this week, believes that the French state-owned aluminium and packaging company will probably be privatised in 1996. He also believes that the priority for the company was to return to profit. In 1993, Pechiney suffered a net loss of FFr980m (Dollars 180m). Mr Rodier said that, although 1996 might seem distant, it does not leave much time for the company to prepare itself for sale. In addition to reversing its losses, the company is also at the centre of a proposed, but complex, alliance with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the hydro-electricity producer.</p>

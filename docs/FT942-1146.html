			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Statoil refinery scheme hit by delay The construction of a condensate facility to expand the Kalundborg refinery in Denmark is expected to exceed budget by at least DKr1bn (Dollars 156m) and be delayed by at least one year, Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company and owner of the refinery, said yesterday. The facility is intended to expand annual production capacity by 1.5m tonnes to 4.8m tonnes and allow output of light oil products to meet stricter environmental standards. It is expected to come on stream in the fourth quarter of 1995. The budget for the project was DKr2.2bn but this was adjusted to DKr2.6bn last January. 'The increases reflect delays and deficiencies in the engineering work that have had a knock-on effect in the construction phase and have created substantial extra work,' Statoil said. The disclosure comes six years after a NKr6.4bn (Dollars 905m) cost over-run on Statoil's Mongstad refinery expansion project in Norway. This exceeded Statoil's equity capital at the time by 27 per cent. That budget overshoot forced the resignation of Mr Arve Johnsen, president and chief executive - replaced by Mr Harald Norvik, Statoil's current president - and a far-reaching reorganisation of the company. The group had to seek a capital injection. The main contractor is US-based Ralph M. Parsons, while Exxon is the technical adviser to the project. 'These cost overruns undermine the profitability of the project compared with original plans. However, the project has come so far that there is no question of halting it. To ensure an acceptable completion of the project, we have made substantial organisation changes,' said Mr Norvik. Statoil estimates the net rate of return on the project at 6 per cent, or 10 per cent before tax. In September, the board is to be presented with findings of an internal audit of the project which is under way. A government inquiry into the affair may be called for.</p>

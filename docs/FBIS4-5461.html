			<p>BFN     [Text]Sa Kaeo -- Governor Kasem Chaisit yesterday suspected  arson as the cause of the inferno which devastated a border  market in Aranyaprathet district Friday night.    About 330 stalls and some 60 million baht worth of  merchandise were destroyed in the two-hour fire. Fire trucks  were unable to get into the market because of the narrow access  to the site and some of them had to draw water from toilets to  extinguish the blaze.    The governor said the arsonists might be Thais or Cambodians  who were enraged by the recent action taken by Thai authorities,  upon the request of Cambodian officials in Banteay Meanchey  Province, to repatriate all Cambodian traders who crossed the  border to do business at Talat Rong Khrua.    He said he was awaiting the report of police investigation.    Emerging from an emergency meeting held yesterday with  police  and military officers, Governor Kasem said the border point at  Khlong Luk-Poipet would be temporarily closed effective as of  yesterday. Only authorized officials and aid workers of the  United Nations agencies will be allowed to pass through the  border.    The governor said the closure of the border was necessary  for  security reasons because of the escalation in fighting between  Cambodian factions across the border.    He anticipated a rise in cross border smuggling by the  so-called "ant army" as a result of the border closure which is  expected to cost Thai traders 10 million baht a day in lost  business.    Several angry Thai traders who lost their property in the  fire complained that they did not understand why the military  prevented them from going into the market to retrieve their  goods as the fire had not yet reached their stalls.    Governor Kasem later asked for sympathy from the traders,  saying that it was necessary for the troops to ban people from  getting into the market in order to prevent "third hand"  elements from causing trouble. He also said the scene of the  fire was only 200 meters from the border line.    Shortly before the fire, three artillery shells, fired from  inside Cambodia, exploded behind a Thai military outpost killing  two Cambodians and injuring three -- two of them seriously. The  injured were rushed to Aranyaprathet district hospital.</p>

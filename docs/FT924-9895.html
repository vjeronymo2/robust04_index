			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: American boost for Glaxo SHARES IN Glaxo rebounded following buying in the US, prompted by a recommendation from one highly influential US securities house. Dr Jonathan Gelles, the top-rated pharmaceuticals analyst at Wertheim Schroder, sent out a note reminding clients why Glaxo is on Wertheim's 'most favoured' list. He argues that the dividend is set to increase by 22 per cent per annum in the short term and sees the stock hitting Pounds 13 a share within 18 months. He says that, while the Standard &amp; Poor's industry average is expected to fall, Glaxo's earnings per share growth will rise to 20 per cent over the next few years. And he added that the house had been buying the stock very heavily on behalf of US institutions. The shares were firm all day and closed 21 better at 820p. Media activity Selected media stocks were boosted by a re-evaluation of the prospects for satellite group BSkyB. Big shareholders Pearson, News International and Granada were all strong performers yesterday. Agency broker James Capel, Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley have all significantly increased valuations. The figures range widely depending on whether debt is included and what discount rate is used. Hoare Govett estimates Pounds 3bn, up from Pounds 2.2bn at the end of last year, using a discount rate of 13 per cent and inflation of 3.5 per cent. The house bases its optimism on an increased take-up of more expensive subscriptions, the Premier league deal and renegotiated film contracts. Granada, which Hoare believes to be the 'principal buy' among the shareholders, climbed 17 to 298p. News International which owns 50 per cent of BSkyB and is always a tightly traded stock, gained 17 to 298p, and Pearson, which has 16 per cent, moved ahead 15 to 363p. Reed International, which has around a 3.7 per cent stake, also firmed but was probably more influenced by switching from its new partner, the Dutch publisher Elsevier. It closed 7 higher at 589p. Waters in demand Water issues were easily the best performers in a generally strong utilities area of the market as the institutions focused on the prospects of well-above market average dividend increases from the sector. The water sector's interim dividend season kicks off this morning with results from Thames Water, the biggest of the 10 privatised water companies as measured by market capitalisation, and continues until December 17 when Wessex Water reveals its figures. The general consensus around the market was that dividend increases across the sector will average around 9 per cent. Kleinwort Benson's utilities team expects the sector as a whole to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 846.5m, 7.4 per cent up on a year ago and dividends up an overall 8.7 per cent, ranging from 8 per cent at South West Water to 9.4 per cent at Severn Trent. Kleinwort maintains its recommendation that funds overweight in the sector should use any strength to lighten their holdings. Mr Steve Doe at Hoare Govett, on the other hand, maintained the sector 'is still attractive relative to the market and the electricity sector'. Anglian was the best performer among the sector's Footsie constituents, adding 15 at 468p, followed by Severn Trent, 13 higher at 450p. British Gas was given a strong push by market heavyweights such as Hoare Govett and Kleinwort Benson and settled 3 1/2 ahead at 273p. Shell rose 5 to 538p, largely at the expense of BP, which could manage only a minor improvement at 234 1/2 p, after one of the leading UK integrated broking houses recommended a switch. Lasmo dipped 1 1/2 to 174 1/2 p ahead of tomorrow's seminar on its Indonesian gas interests. Sentiment continued to strengthen ahead of J. Sainsbury's interim results tomorrow, with market talk suggesting that sales had edged forward around 5 per cent on the same period last year. Trading was also said to have benefited from the group's recent promotion with British Airways. The shares rose 8 1/2 to 510p. Some of Sainsbury's gain was at the expense of rival Tesco, off a penny at 232p. A downgrade held Booker back, the shares retreating 6 to 359p. BZW trimmed Pounds 3m from its current year forecast to Pounds 99m, blaming difficult trading conditions in the food distribution business. Slightly better than expected figures from Associated British Foods added a halfpenny to the shares at 443p, although did nothing to improve the market outlook for milling and baking. Dealers linked this with the fall in bid target RHM, the shares ending down 12 at 263p ex-dividend, a penny short of Tomkins' alternative cash offer. Barclays shares dipped early in the session after recent profits and dividend downgrades and the possibility of more to come were highlighted in the Sunday press. They later rallied to close 4 higher at 350p, having touched 338p at the outset. There was slight disappointment in the market with Prudential's stated 1991 figures, reworked under the accruals method, and the shares settled 2 1/2 easier at 276p. Invesco MIM,the UK fund management group, shot up 9 more to 84p after a number of big blocks of stock, totalling 22m shares, were crossed in the market at 77p a share. Late in the session it was announced that Daido Mutual Life Insurance had sold a 4.99 per cent stake in Invesco. Last week Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong investment house backed by Mr Li Ka-Shing, increased its stake in Invesco to 14.9 per cent. Turnover in British Steel rose to 15m as the shares closed unchanged at 47p, after Smith New Court cut its forecast and labelled the stock a sell down to 20p. The broker expects current year losses to reach Pounds 165m, against its previous estimate of a Pounds 50m loss. Lucas Industries moved 9 ahead to 115p after BZW was reported to have had a buyer of 1m shares. Simon Engineering bounced following last week's profits downgrading from Smith New Court and jumped 10 to 89p. Nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's interim figures left William Cook 6 lighter at 89p. Bargain hunters helped Tomkins recover some lost ground and the shares closed 10 up at 222p as developments on the RHM bid were awaited. Stag Furniture rose 21 to 95p as the market caught wind of an approach from a rival. The Midlands company confirmed the rumours but withheld the name of the bidder. There was speculation that bathroom maker Spring Ram (up a penny at 151p) was poised to launch an offer worth 105p a share. Blue Circle Industries remained one of the market's takeover favourites, the shares jumping a further 8 to 175p. Weakness in Allied Lyons last week was corrected, helped by analysts returning from a visit to the company's Spanish operations. The shares rose 7 to 633p. The recent strength in Queens Moat Houses continued as talk surrounding the hotel group's rumoured strategic discussions with Bass persisted. The latter also benefited from a reiterated buy stance from BZW and the shares put on 7 to 556p. Queens Moat gained a penny to 44p. Turnover in Tiphook, boosted by a block of 2.3m shares dealt at 231p a share, reached 4m. The stock closed unchanged at 239p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (146).

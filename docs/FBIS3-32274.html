			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections,  scheduled for 8 May.    Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party presidential hopeful,  has  responded to former President Alfonso Lopez, who said the  presidential hopefuls had not expressed their position on the  exchange rate. De la Calle reminded Lopez that when he spoke  before the National Federation of Businessmen, he said that "the  next administration must balance its public finances, because it  is the only way we can avoid continuous currency reevaluations  and maintain low interest rates."

Samper seeks to "promote products abroad and reactivate the  agrarian fund, the national rehabilitation plan, and the IDEMA  [Agricultural-Livestock Marketing Institute], which are pillars  of the country's agricultural sector." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL  TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Jan 94 p 7A)    Carlos Lemos, former Colombian foreign minister and Liberal  Party presidential hopeful, said on 25 January that if Colombia  and Venezuela really want to resolve their border differences,  they must "accept arbitration by a third party." A high-level  bilateral commission appointed by the presidents has submitted a  report to the two governments with its recommendations.

(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision  Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 31 Jan 94)    Carlos Lemos, Liberal Party presidential hopeful, has stated  that liberalism is being handled foolishly. In a statement made  only two months before the elections, Lemos said the party must  state its position regarding the concentration of wealth in  Colombia. For his part, Ernesto Samper agrees that the party  must be reformed but says "liberalism has shown its willingness  to reform and modernize itself," unlike other parties.

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: American symphonists - Andrew Porter reviews much noisy, angry, well meaning music and has to cover his ears According to a recent survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League, covering five years of programmes by the leading orchestras, John Adams (the composer of the operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer) is the living American composer most often played. Kurt Masur began his directorship of the New York Philharmonic with Adams's Short Ride in a Fast Machine and Tromba Lontana, two short works, one loud and one soft. El Dorado, Adams's latest orchestra piece, was given its premiere recently by the San Francisco Symphony, which commissioned it. It's about 'the greed of the eighties', we are told, with a first movement, angry and violent, that is 'my own response to the Gulf War'. I've not heard El Dorado, but last month in New York there were two symphonies containing much angry, noisy music. John Corigliano's First Symphony was inspired by the sight of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, those thousands of commemorative panels for those who have died. Each movement recalls a lost musician friend. The first, 'Of Rage and Remembrance', begins 'ferociously' and includes pages on end of slashing chords marked 'tutti as loud as possible', but in a quiet episode a distant piano is heard playing the Albeniz Tango, a favourite piece of the pianist friend remembered. The central movement, a Tarantella, recalls a friend in the music business, famed for his wit, who became mad; a trivial tarantella tune is put through increasingly horrible distortions. Corigliano found the motto theme of the finale, 'Giulio's Song', while listening to 30-year-old tapes of himself and a cellist friend improvising. Played by a solo cello, it begins with the whole-tone ascent that in Berg's Violin Concerto spells 'Es ist genug'. Other themes join it; in the score they are named, and the names are those of musician friends who have died. The music mounts to a battering funeral march, with the clash and clamour of bells; in a quiet coda earlier themes are recalled. The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony, which gave the first performance, under Barenboim. It was recorded (Erato); the disc has stayed for months in Billboard's Classical Top Ten; Corigliano won the Grawemeyer Award, music's 'Nobel Prize'. (Birtwistle, for The Mask of Orpheus; Ligeti, for the piano Preludes; and Chinary Ung, for Spiral, were earlier winners.) At the New York premiere, which was given by the Philharmonic under Leonard Slatkin, panels of the Quilt hung in the lobby of Fisher Hall, and the audience was invited to inscribe the names of dead loved ones on a new panel. The emotional charge was high. The critic must steel his heart to say that, for all the pain and grief and love that it expresses, the musical means of expression are undistinguished, conventional, obvious. The New York Times went so far as to call the result 'vulgar'. Aaron Jay Kernis's Second Symphony, which was given its first performance by the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, addresses even more 'the endless violence of the Gulf War, the subtle and unsubtle encroachment upon women's and minority rights, the hovering threat of censorship of artists along with the economic, social, and medical disasters that plague us daily'. Adams is 45, Corigliano is 54; Kernis is a younger composer, born in 1960, who has become very prominent. He wrote some good, exuberantly inventive works in his youth: Dream of the Morning Sky (1983), for soprano and orchestra; Love Scenes (1987), for soprano (Dawn Upshaw) and cello. But now, as work after work after work pours out, he seems content to press the conventional response triggers. His first symphony, Symphony in Waves, had its premiere earlier this season from the New York Chamber Symphony, and has been recorded. It included Adams-like passages of minimalism. The movements of the Second Symphony are entitled 'Alarm' 'Air/Ground', and 'Barricade'. The first, marked 'aggressively', contains wave upon wave of noisy climax underpinned by ostinato. In the second, simple melodies wander over 'grounded' harmonies. While writing the third, Kernis says, 'a recurring image was the building full of innocent Iraqi civilians under siege which was mistakenly bombed and obliterated nearly a year ago'; it ends with the loudest noise I have ever heard in a concert hall - four tam-tams whacked 'at maximum volume' for five long seconds. Audience and orchestra players covered their ears. Crash-bang - alternating (but not always) with episodes soft, sentimental, and soupy - has become the mode of the successful American orchestra works taken up in city after city. Del Tredici's Alice screams at the top of her voice; he himself describes his Steps, composed for the Philharmonic, as 'violent and raucous . . . clattering . . . Godzilla battling Megalon'. This is music for people already half-deafened, responsive only to high-decibel assault. And he is not the only composer who writes it. Poster-art is in vogue. American orchestras (and their conductors) - shunning Carter, Sessions, Wuorinen - embrace it. When not strident, it's 'nostalgic'. In the programme that brought the Kernis, there was a 'new' Flute Concerto, by Joseph Turrin, in sub-Prokofiev vein. In the Philharmonic programme after the one that brought the Corigliano, Slatkin championed Claude Baker's Shadows, a 'Japanese' piece such as many composers have written: a flower arrangement of exquisite sounds - scratch, patter, tinkle and ting - based on four haiku but also (with full acknowledgement and near-quotation) on movements by Mahler, Britten, and Stravinsky. Dainty working, no harm it in at all - and no sustenance. We might as well have been listening to Takemitsu.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 29 (XINHUA) -- The China Council  for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), which serves  domestic and overseas businessmen, will this year initiate a new  way for China's non-governmental foreign trade to expand, by  organizing more business people to accompany Chinese leaders'  visits abroad.    Zheng Hongye, chairman of CCPIT, made the statement when  interviewed by XINHUA recently.    He said that in 1993, CCPIT's experimental work in this  regard witnessed fruitful results, and it will try to  standardize the practice.    During the past year, CCPIT received over 180 overseas  business delegations to China, up by 50 percent over the  previous year, 12 of which came with their government leaders.    Meanwhile, CCPIT provided various services for business  people worldwide concerning exhibitions abroad, reception of  overseas exhibitions to China, trade marks, patents and law, as  well as promoting economic and trade ties between the two sides  of the Taiwan straits and dealing with the Sino-U.S.  most-favored-nations [MFN] issue.    Zheng stated that CCPIT aims to promote Sino-foreign trade,  introduce overseas investment and advanced technology and  conduct activities of various forms in Sino-foreign economic and  technological spheres, so as to enhance China's business ties  with other countries and regions.    So far, CCPIT has relations with over 360 business bodies in  more than 160 countries and regions covering trade, commerce,  finance, enterprises, industrial property rights, exhibitions,  law and consultations.    It also enjoys cooperative relations with relevant  organizations in over 50 countries and has set up bilateral  cooperative councils with some countries.    CCPIT now has nearly 300 domestic branches and more than  20,000 enterprises as domestic members.    With its network worldwide, the chairman noted, it will  function better as a go-between for China's economic and trade  relations with other countries and regions.    As China's economy develops, China's non-governmental  businesses will be more active and play a more important role in  China's foreign trade.    On Sino-U.S. trade relations, he said that although there  are  some frictions, the two economies are strongly complementary,  adding that business people in the two countries are  enthusiastic about Sino-U.S. business activities and hope the  MFN status granted to China by the U.S. can be unconditionally  extended.    He continued that CCPIT is to push forward the development  of  Sino-U.S. business ties through non-governmental channels.    On business exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan  Straits, Zheng said that Taiwan's investment in China's mainland  has risen during the past few years due to the economies on the  two sides of the straits being complementary, though two-way  business exchanges have not yet been realized.    He hoped that the Taiwan authorities can help realize the  two-way exchanges as soon as possible so as to enable business  people from the Chinese mainland to visit Taiwan at an early  date.    If business disputes across the Straits can be solved  through  arbitration bodies, it will be conducive to the development of  such exchanges, the chairman noted.    He said that CCPIT is also facing challenges such as the  role  of CCPIT in building a socialist market economy, calling it "a  new task". On this point, he said that CCPIT is to strengthen  its coordination and service through self-reform to meet the  demands of a new situation.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Spot the difference Sharks generally get a pretty poor press, but it seems they do have some rather surprising uses. An international dermatologists' conference in Perth, Australia was told last week that shark bile, secreted by the liver to aid the digestion of fats, cuts down grease production and reduces acne significantly. David Fenton of St Thomas's Hospital, London, told the conference that in a study of 15 patients who applied shark bile extract spray on their faces twice a day, 14 had significantly improved or altogether cleared their acne problems within two months. Two months after treatment stopped, the spots returned. Known as isolutrol and marketed as Ketsugo, the solution has been patented by McFarlane Laboratories, a family-owned Melbourne drug company.
